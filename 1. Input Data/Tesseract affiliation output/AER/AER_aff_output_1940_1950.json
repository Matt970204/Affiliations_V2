This type of economic organization has been called forth\nby the doctrine of total war. Besides the traditional use of the military proper, total war\nembraces two new weapons: psychological and economic warfare. In the economics of the\nmilitary state there is no distinct line of demarcation which separates war from peace.\nWar is no longer regarded as a passing stage of abnormality to be replaced in short by\nnormal conditions of peace; and war economics is no longer a special branch of public\nfinance but penetrates the whole of economic science.\n\nIn the economics of the military state, there is no unused capacity, industrial or other-\nwise, since all resources are placed in the service of war preparation and war. The profit\nmotive is retained, but is subject to important modifications. Private initiative, inasmuch\nas it is recognized and allowed to emerge, is vested with the function of serving the\neconomics of the military state. Depletion of the stock of accumulated wealth, as a source\nof current consumption, is co\u00f3rdinated with current production, the other source. The\ntraditional concept of normalcy with its excess of national income produced over national\nincome consumed is abandoned.\n\nEvolution of War Economics in Recent German Literature\n\nThe intensive occupation with the economic aspects of war preparation\nand warfare which started in Germany with the advent of the Hitler\nregime has resulted in a stupendous volume of literary output in the course\nof the years. Research institutes and university chairs for the investigation\nand propagation of war economics were established by the authorities, who\nalso assumed financial responsibility for the printing and publishing of\nnumerous treatises and monographs on war economics. All this is re-\nmarkably different from the situation in 1914 when Werner Sombart spoke\nof the economists as follows: \"W'e had nothing to give that could have\nbeen of direct service to the great cause. Nothing has become more clear\nin our minds than this: our co\u00f3peration was not needed in any respect.\"\nCorrespondingly it is said now that \"economic science cannot be acquitted\nof the grave guilt of insufficient preparation for the [first] World War.\"?\n\n\"Though attempts have been made to appraise nazi economic policies\nas the result and outcome of German economic development within the\nimmediate and more remote past, it does not seem possible to regard\n\n!NV.

                    "THE TWO FEDERAL REVENUE ACTS OF 1940!\n\nTwo revenue acts have been passed by Congress this year. The first, approved June 25,\nwas a series of amendments hastily thrown together in what was then thought to be the\nclosing days of the congressional session. This Act (1) reduced the amounts of personal\nexemptions, (2) increased by about 10 per cent individual and corporation income taxes,\n(3) increased surtax rates in the middle brackets and (4) increased most excises.\n\nThe Second Revenue act of 1940, applicable to corporations only, has three important\nfeatures: (1) it levies a special tax on the excess profits of corporations; (2) it suspends\nduring the life of the excess profits tax the Vinson-Trammell act designed to limit profits\nfrom naval, airplane and other defense contracts; and (3) it permits accelerated (five-year)\namortization of the cost of certain facilities necessary for national defense. The Act also\nprovides for those in military and naval services a new system of life insurance and credit\non annuities under the Railroad Retirement acts. An amendment is made to the Social\nSecurity act for employers who had not received credit for contributions to state funds\nbecause they were late.\n\n\"The first Act is expected to augment revenues by $729,000,000 for the fiscal year 1941,\nand by about $1,000,000,000 in a full year of operation. The second is expected to increase\nrevenues still further by about $500,000,000 in the calendar year 1941, and by $900,000,000\nto $1,000,000,000 when the defense program becomes fully operative.\n\nThe Fiscal Situation\n\nNo year since the World War has seen such changes in the federal fiscal\npicture as 1940. In January the President estimated that the deficit for the\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1941, would be $2,876,000,000. His estimate\nfor national defense expenditure for 1941 was about $1,940,000,000. This\nsum was only a fraction of the amount soon deemed necessary as he saw\nthe German army overrun country after country in Western Europe. A\nrevised estimate in June was for $3,250,000,000 defense expenditures; in\nAugust for $5,000,000,000. Total expenditures for 1941 were estimated in\nAugust at $12,000,000,000 in contrast to $8,000,000,000 in January. These\namounts do not tell the full story. Congress was asked to appropriate in-\ncreasingly huge sums for defense, not all of which could be expended in\nthe current fiscal year. Exclusive of the cost of enforcing the acts for com-\npulsory military training and putting the National Guard into active mili-\ntary service, Congress had appropriated over $14,000,000,000 for defense\npurposes by August 5, 1940.\n\nEven in May before the situation in Europe became so bad, and while\ndefense appropriations were comparatively small, Secretary Morgenthau\nbecame concerned over the $45 billion debt limit. At that time the work-\ning balance was $1,3500,000,000, a sum the Secretary thought unwise to re-\nduce. Although the President had suggested additional tax revenues ot\n$460,000,000 in his January message, Congress ignored the request, and\n\n'Preceding federal revenue acts passed since the adoption of the Sixteenth (Income\nTax) amendment to the Constitution have been discussed in earlier volumes of the\nAmerican. Economic Review. Volume and page references are given in the Review of\nSeptember, 1938 (vol. 28, p. 447). For the 1939 Act see the Review of December, 1939\n(vol. 29, p. 695). Further analyses may be found in the authors' Federal Income Tax\n(1940).\n",

This situation arises where excess capacity coincides with inability of\nproducers to control production and prices. The experience of the cotton textile industry\nsupports the view that cutthroat competition tends in time to correct itself. (The excess ca-\npacity which developed in this industry around 1923 was substantially eliminated by 1937.\nUnder certain conditions, however, it is quite possible for cutthroat competition to continue\nindefinitely.

                    "I\n\nEconomists have long maintained that free competition tends to promote\neconomic efficiency. Business-men, however, have remained singularly un-\nconvinced. In trade journals and at manufacturers conventions competition\nis termed \"ruinous,\" \"unethical,\" \"cutthroat,\" \"destructive.\" The control\nof competition through patents, tariffs, mergers, trade associations and in-\nformal agreements has been a major objective of business policy.\n\nThe competitive practices condemned by business-men are of two quite\nseparate types, which should be clearly distinguished. Cutthroat competition\nsometimes refers to false advertising, adulteration of goods, commercial\nbribery, defamation of competitors, and similar fraudulent practices. It\nwould be generally agreed that such practices are undesirable, and they\ntherefore raise no major question of public policy.\n\nSecond, and perhaps more commonly, cutthroat competition refers to\nacts which tend directly or indirectly to lower the existing price structure.\nIt can scarcely be argued, however, that price reductions are always un-\njustified. A price cut which reflects a reduction in raw material costs or an\nimprovement in manufacturing technique is clearly reasonable. Under what\nconditions, then, does price cutting become cutthroat?\n\nMost of those who denounce price cutting are rather vague on this point.\nEmphasis on the zofivation of producers is reflected in such terms as\n\"chiseler,\" \"unfair,\" \"unethical.\" In other cases certain /ecbziques of price\nreduction, such as secret rebates or fictitious advertising allowances, are\ncondemned. Neither of these criteria, however, provides a satisfactory\nbasis for distinguishing cutthroat competition from competition in general.\nIt does not matter very much what a price concession is called\u2014 \"rebate,\"\n\"allowance,\" \"discount,\" or plain \"cut.\" The important thing is that prices\nhave been reduced. And they are probably reduced in most cases because\nsome producers hope thereby to increase their short-run profits or bolster\n\n\u00bb\u00bb ot\n\n! For a. more complete list of such practices, see Leverett S. Lyon and others, TAe Na-\ntional Recovery Administration, Brookings Institution, Washington, 1935, especially chap-\nters 22, 26, and 27.\n\n? Most goods are sold at a wide variety of prices, which are not necessarily changed\nsimultaneously or proportionately. It is therefore more correct to speak of the price struc-\nture being undermined than of the price being cut. The conventional term \"price cutting\"\nis used below, however, for reasons of convenience.\n",

                    "SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF SAVINGS DEPOSITS\n\nIn this paper various characteristics of savings deposits are studied in order to clarify\nthe functions of these deposits. (1) In the late 1920's many deposits were withdrawn for\nthe purchase of stocks and other investments. During the 1930's, as a rule, deposits were\nnot used for current spending on consumption to the extent commonly supposed. In one\ndepressed area, however, spending and unemployment were the main reasons for with-\ndrawal. (2) The activity of savings deposits is marked by sharp seasonal fluctuations, but\nthe annual rate of turnover is more stable than that for demand deposits. Medium-sized\nbalances ($400-800) are the most active. (3) The data indicate that over 40 per cent of\naccounts are closed before becoming a year old. Older and larger accounts, however, make\nup a large part of total deposits. (4) These data emphasize the need for a time period in the\ndefinition of savings, since many deposits are used for non-current spending. The use of\nsavings deposits as investments, however, seems to be increasing.\n\nIn this paper certain characteristics of the deposits in the mutual savings\nbanks of New York State are considered. The purpose of the investigation\nis to acquire a clearer notion of the nature of savings deposits. The prin-\ncipal characteristics considered are the uses of saved funds, and the activity\nand age of accounts. For the most part, data concerning these questions\nare not obtainable for all banks, but it happens that internal studies made\nby a few of the banks in the state are pertinent to this inquiry, and are be-\nlieved to be representative of other banks. These studies have been supple-\nmented by statistics published in the 4zzal Reports of the Superintendent\nof Banks and by discussions with savings-bank officers.\n",

                    "A. Uses of Savings Deposits\n\nIt is virtually impossible to determine accurately the reasons for savings-\nbank withdrawals. This is so because deposits usually are withdrawn in\ncash, which cannot be traced. Sometimes, however, withdrawals take the\nform of checks drawn by the savings banks on depository commercial banks,\nespecially when the amounts are large, and the endorsements on these\nchecks provide clues to the uses of the money. Several individual banks\nmade studies of these endorsements covering short periods of the late\n1920's in order to discover to what extent deposits were being used for\nstock purchases. These studies showed quite conclusively that savings de-\nposits were attracted in large amounts to the stock market or to invest-\nment in mortgage certificates and other securities.\n\nOne bank, for example, discovered that in January, 1929, 24 per cent of\nthe withdrawals by check were used to purchase stocks and bonds, while\n40 per cent went into real estate or mortgages. In March, 40 per cent went\nfor stocks and bonds and 37 per cent for real estate or mortgages.* When\ncompared to stock-market movements, the rise and fall of withdrawals\n\n! These data were collected by the Savings Banks Association of the State of New York.\nAlthough these figures come from only one (large) bank, several others found similar\nresults and savings-bank officials believe them to be typical in the metropolitan area.\n",

                    "A RE\u00c9XAMINATION OF THE CLASSICAL THEORY\nOF INFLATION\n\nAn adequate analysis of the classical theory of inflation cannot afford to neglect the\nfollowing points: (a) The structure of economic society, more particularly of industrial\nproduction, was not fully integrated by the turn of the eighteenth century. (b) The general\neconomic theory formulated at that time concentrated on the problem of production in ac-\ncordance with the concrete major problem of its time. (c) The \"received doctrine\" con-\ncerning money had been formulated under mercantile conditions based on a manufactural\nand not an industrial mode of production. (d) The general circumstances occasioned by\nthe jerkingly proceeding industrial expansion, enhanced by the specific conditions of the\nAnglo-French wars, resulted in an apparently general rise of prices.\n\nAs to the functional value of a theory developed on this basis and proposed to be ap-\nplied to the solution of modern monetary problems, we have to recognize that: (a) The\nanalysis of this rise of prices was carried on with the help of a scientific method which did\nnot and could not include a concept of qualitative change. Quite the contrary, \"received\ndoctrine\" as well as the outward appearance of the economic process seemed to suggest a\nmerely quantitative expansion without any fundamental qualitative change in the structure\nof production. (b) The result of such an attitude toward the phenomenon of rising prices\nwas to conceive of them as deviations from an otherwise static condition. (c) Such theoretical\nposition did not prove fatal for 1bat time for the reason that the actual though temporary\neconomic conditions tended to obscure the imminent structural change indicated in the rise of\nprices.\n\n\"The classical theory of inflation expressed thus the phenomenal coincidence of a specific\nhistorical period. It has to be understood as a \"special case\" in doctrine formation created\nby and applicable to a special historical situation only.\n\nBy the end of the eighteenth century the industrial type of producing\ncommodities had become prevalent, bringing in its wake a development of\nregular interrelationships between the various producers and consumers.\nAdam Smith, in his discussion of the division of labor, has given an\nadequate picture of that society.\n\n\"There is little doubt that the theory of money would have retained its\nposition of secondary importance in the general economic theory of that\nperiod if it had not been for the occurrence of particularly striking events\nwhich forced the political and economic strategists to concern themselves\nparticularly with disentangling the apparently highly important flux of\nmoney. One extraordinary event was the French Revolution, which to the\nEnglish merchants produced an economic-political threat of first im-\nportance. There was a definite connection between the Revolution in France\nand the conditions in England. In the treatises on money, concerned with\nthe doctrines elaborated in this period, it has always been emphasized that\nthe military expenditures during this time were of an ex/raordinary nature.\nThere is a curious neglect of the difficulties which arose out of the structural\ntransformation which took place in England quite irrespective of the foreign\nwars. It is of course perfectly true that one cannot distinguish clearly\nand in absolute terms between \"indigenous\" development and \"influences\nfrom the outside.\" It amounts to a tautology, today, to say that the causes\n\nof the French Revolution and the reasons for its being disliked by the\n",

                    "COMMERCIAL POLICY AS REFLECTED IN TREATIES\nFROM 1931 TO 1939\n\nGreat changes have largely transformed world trade during the years from the onslaught\nof the world depression to the outbreak of the present war in Europe. Nowhere are these\nchanges so clearly reflected as in the treaties of commerce which have been negotiated\nduring the past eight years. Since these treaties are the legal embodiment of one aspect of\neconomic foreign policy, they represent a complex structure of contractual obligations\nwherein various national interests in the sphere of economic life find expression. For an\naccurate analysis of recent commercial policy, an examination of the tendencies, established\npractices, and methods exhibited in the binding agreements entered into by nations is\nessential. Here the use of the most-favored-nation clause, quotas, exchange controls, barter\nagreements, tariffs, bilateralism, and other devices of trade policy, the frequency of their\nappearance, and their content and scope, can be studied with a view to determining more\nprecisely the nature of the above-mentioned changes.\n\nI\n\nThe subsequent data are based upon a study of over 510 bilateral con-\nventions, treaties, and exchanges of notes between states for the period\n1931-1939. This group is broken down by means of the accompanying\ntable into various cross-classifications, by topics and kinds of provisions,\nand certain conclusions will be drawn from the number of treaties in each\ncategory. Provisions which are characteristic of the new trend in commercial\npolicy will be examined in detail, and further general conclusions as to\nthe effect of the new regime upon international trade relations will be indi-\ncated.\n\nEven though this group is not exhaustive, it represents approximately\ntwice as many negotiations of a similar nature as are recorded for the\nwhole era from 1919 to 1930. One effect of the unsettled economic rela-\ntions of the last decade has been to necessitate many and frequent agree-\nments on trade and commerce. Of the 510 agreements, 137 were modifica-\ntions of existing treaties. These modifications were not only changes within\nthe broad pattern of agreements already in force; they also entailed altera-\ntions of a more fundamental nature.\n\nAs can be seen from Table I, when the total is broken down into com-\nponent figures representing the several types of provisions found in this\ngroup of treaties, as well as the geographic distribution of agreements con-\ntaining these provisions, some noteworthy facts emerge. But a caveat should\nbe entered at once against interpreting the table too literally. Aside from\nthe qualifications set forth in the explanation which accompanies the table,\nand which must be considered in any interpretations drawn therefrom, the\ndata summarized should be interpreted as providing evidence on the char-\nacter and content of recent commercial-treaty policies. To be most useful,\nthe calculations presented here should be set over against treaty practice\n\n\"This figure constitutes probably one-half of all such negotiations during these years\n\n(until Sept., 1939). The particular accords cited are the most important and hence they\nare believed to be satisfactorily representative.\n",

                    "The test for the effectiveness of the National Labor Relations act is to be sought\nin the degree to which it achieves its specific purpose of helping to abolish disputes over\nlabor's right to organize and bargain collectively, a question coinciding only partially\nwith that regarding industrial peace at large.\n\nTo gauge this development numerically the following methods are used: The degree\nto which labor in its struggle against \"unfair labor practices\" is resorting to the NLRB\nrather than to strikes is measured through the ratio of \"pure\" complaint cases (that is\nthose in which strikes were not also resorted to) and \"organization strikes in disputes\nunder the Board's jurisdiction,\" while the degree to which labor uses the Board merely in\naddition to strikes rather than in the place of strikes is measured through the ratio of\n\"strike-complaint cases\" to pure complaint cases. The trend of the employers compliance\nwith the Act is inferred from the yearly total number of disputes over \"unfair labor prac-\ntices.\" The number of organization strikes in disputes under the Board's jurisdiction in\ncomparison to those not under the Board's jurisdiction is used as additional indicator\nof the effectiveness of the Act.\n\nThese several indices are calculated as nearly as the published records allow, and\ngraphically represented.\n\nThe picture of the development so obtained is regarded as promising. Labor is coming\nto settle disputes over \"unfair labor practices\" increasingly through the NLRB rather\nthan through strikes; the ratio of strike-complaint to pure complaint cases is beginning to\ndiminish, and organization strikes in disputes under the Board's jurisdiction are diminish-\ning faster than those not under the Board's jurisdiction. Most of all, the total number\nof disputes over the outlawed unfair labor practices has noticeably declined since the last\nyear, following a strong increase during the first three years of the operation of the\nNational Labor Relations act.\n\nPurpose of tbe Labor Relations act.\u2014In view of the flood of criticism\nof the National Labor Relations act and its administration by the NLRB, it\nis of great importance to possess reliable indices for gauging the effective-\nness of the Act in achieving the purpose for which it was designed. This\npurpose was to enforce labor's right to organize and bargain collectively,\na purpose apparently conceived in the idea that independent organizations\nof workers and employers bargaining with each other on equal terms con-\nstitute the industrial set-up best suited to a democracy with an, as yet, com-\nparatively liberalistic economic system.\"\n\nOf course, it was hoped that such \"functioning trade unionism\" will\neventually also mean more peaceful industrial relations, with strikes and\nlockouts largely replaced by organized negotiations aided by mediation and\narbitration. Indeed, the Labor Relations act expresses the conviction that\nsuch will be the results of established collective bargaining:\n\nExperience has proved that protection by law of the right to organize and to\nbargain collectively safeguards commerce from injury, impairment or interrup-\ntion, and promotes the flow of commerce by removing certain recognized sources\n\n' Totalitarian states, on the other hand, have found governmentally controlled common\norganizations of workers and employers better suited to their political and economic sys-\ntems. The fact that trade unionism in the United States has come to be made govern-\nmentally enforceable might perhaps raise the question in one's mind as to the continued\n\"liberalistic\" character of this institution.\n",

Data obtained indicate\ndistribution of individual property holdings, not wealth distribution. Since (1) nominal\nestates are not probated, (2) some more than nominal estates wholly or partly escape\nprobate, and (3) not all probated estates are inventoried, data presented actually con-\nstitute a sample of the distribution of probated estates derived from those inventoried.\nProperty distribution among all adults dying is not shown, since the exact number and the\naverage value of nominal estates cannot be ascertained. The pattern of distribution is\nsimilar to that found in other studies. San Francisco shows a higher concentration of\nproperty than Alameda County. The two counties, separately and combined, display a\nhigher concentration of property in 1935 than in 1907.\n\nThis study of property distribution, based on probate data, is con-\nfined to the wholly urban county of San Francisco and the essentially\nurban county of Alameda in California. The bulk of the population of the\ntwo counties is concentrated in a metropolitan area consisting of the city\nof San Francisco, and a number of lesser cities across San Francisco Bay,\nincuding Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda, Piedmont, and Emeryville. Total\npopulation of the two counties was approximately 600,000 in 1907 and\n1,300,000 in 1935. These were the earliest and latest years in which rea-\nsonably adequate probate data could be obtained.'\n\nIn the tables below, estates of males and females were not separated as\nwas done in King's early study,? since such a separation seemed of doubtful\nvalue. To an increasing extent women as well as men have estates, and it\nseemed likely that this would be especially true of urban communities. The\nages 21 and over were selected instead of 25 and over as in King's study\ncited above, because of the greater inclusiveness.?\n\nA probate study of this kind shows distribution of individual rather than\nfamily estates. Only that part of the total family estate which is legally the\nproperty of the deceased is subject to probate. Moreover, even this individual\ndistribution is shown only incompletely, since estates of nominal size are\nnot probated, and since all or part of the individual estate of the deceased\nmay not be subject to probate, because of the manner in which it is held.*\nFinally, even the statistics of estates actually probated are incomplete, be-\ncause some estates probated are not inventoried. Thus the data obtained\nfor purposes of finding the property distribution represent fundamentally\nmerely a large sample of those estates of persons dying which were actually\nprobated.\n\n?

                    "Offset Checks: Further Reply\n\nIn his first discussion! of our article \"A Neglected Component of the Money\nSupply\" published in the Review in September, 1939, Mr. Villard contended\nthat we were defining deposit balances in an unusual manner. In his second dis-\ncussion appearing on another page of this issue he attempts to make the point\nthat we are using the concept \"velocity\" in an unusual manner. The authors feel\nthat a brief restatement of their analysis of the intra-account clearing process\nmay serve as the best answer to Mr. Villard.\n\nAnyone familiar with the activity that occurs in the bank account of a going\nbusiness concern is aware of the fact that a sizeable portion of the daily debits\ncharged to the account is matched at the time of bank posting by simultaneous\ncredit entries. In a recent investigation the authors sampled the accounts of\nbusiness firms in one of the leading banks in Ohio.? The daily debit and credit\ndata over a 27-month period in 15 commercial firms' accounts showed that 55\nper cent of the checks drawn during the period were offset at the times of bank\npostings by simultaneous credit entries. The percentage was 65 in a sample of\n14 industrial firms' accounts over the same period. The question then arose, \"Can\nthese offset checks be fairly regarded as representing transfers of deposit bal-\nances ?\"\n\nIf a deposit balance is defined as the net credit balance existing at any time\nin the account of a bank customer, it follows that credit entries to a bank account\nwhich are simultaneously matched by debit entries at the time of bank posting\nnever have the chance to appear as net credit balances and, therefore, cannot\nbe regarded as deposit balances. The fact remains, however, that the holder of\nthe account has drawn checks in payment of his obligations. Against what have\nthe checks been. drawn? Not against deposit balazces as defined above, but\n\nlarger \"offset checks\" will be relative to Dice and Schaffner velocity, other things equal.\nFor the economy as a whole \"offset checks\" equal all debits (or credits) and velocity is\nzero. See note 4 above.\n\n*If it were found that checks were completely \"offset\" in a given account, it could\nbe argued that this fact had demonstrated that the balance in question was not being held\nfor transaction purposes (although even this conclusion would not follow if banks were\nrequiring minimum balances). But complete \"offsetting\" of checks means simply that\nthe balance involved does not vary from posting to posting, and the mere existence of a\nbalance which does not fluctuate raises the question of why such a balance is being held,\nquite apart from elaborate computations regarding \"offset checks.\"\n\n* H.

Villard, \"A Note on Offset Checks as a Component of the Money Supply,\" this\nReview, Dec., 1939, pp. 798-799.\n\n* The authors are indebted to the Bureau of Business Research of Ohio State University\nfor aid in this investigation.\n",

S.\n388 (1938). The interpretation is found in an article in the December, 1939,\nissue of the Review.\n\nProfessor Mayer's comment indicates on its face misunderstanding of the\ninterpretation he challenges. After quoting from the article to the effect\nthat \"if the reasoning in this case (Pacific Gas and Electric) is consistently fol-\nlowed, there will be few, if any, occasions on which a rate order based upon\nhistorical cost will be distributed by the Supreme Court,\" Mr. Mayer proceeds to\nstate that \"if, in the future, complaining public utilities plead the confiscation\nissue directly, the cozrts will find nothing in the Pacific Gas and Electric decision\nto preclude their accepting and weighing reproduction cost evidence although\nthat evidence may have been rejected by the Commission. Consequently, it is\nentirely possible that many rate orders based on historical cost may be disturbed\nby the cozrts without doing violence to this decision.\"\n\nIt is quite apparent that the sentences quoted from our article deal exclusively\nwith the attitude of the Supreme Court toward historical cost. There is no sug-\ngestion in this quotation or in the whole article that the decision of the Supreme\nCourt precludes trial courts from \"accepting and weighing reproduction cost,\"\nwhen confiscation is the issue.\n\nIf the decision precluded the consideration of reproduction cost by trial courts\nthe statement that \"there will be few, if any, occasions on which a rate order\nbased upon historical cost will be disturbed by the Supreme Court\" would be\nmeaningless. If such courts were compelled by the Supreme Court to follow\nhistorical cost alone, then the Supreme Court would never disturb a rate order\nbecause it was based on such cost.\n\nThe interpretation suggested in our article can perhaps be best illustrated by\nsupposing that a trial court in a case where confiscation is the issue sustains a\nCommission order made on the basis of historical cost such as the order involved\nin the Pacific Gas and Electric case, and further that the court refuses to give\n",

                    "The Possibility of a Positively Sloped Demand Curve\nfor Labor\n\nIn a recent article! Mr. Sidney C. Sufrin examines the possibility of an increase\nin output and employment for a monopolistic firm resulting from a rise in wage\nrates, assuming no change in the demand curve for the product. Mr. Sufrin's\nconclusions are based upon the examination of a hypothetical case but it is neces-\nsary to determine the exact conditions under which the above situation is possible\nbefore valid conclusions of sufficient generality can be drawn. The possibility of\na positively sloped short-run demand curve for labor in periods of deep depression\nhas also been suggested by Mr. R. F. Harrod.? But as will be shown, the case\nof a positively sloped demand curve for labor need not be limited to those situa-\ntions where plants are operating in a stage of decreasing cost.\n\nAssuming the demand curve for labor to a firm selling in an imperfect market\nto be given by the product of marginal physical productivity and marginal\nrevenue, corresponding to each number of laborers employed, there are three\nconceivable situations for which this curve may be positively sloped. The most\nobvious case would be one in which both the marginal physica productivity\ncurve and the marginal revenue curve were positively sloped. Such a situation is\nprobably not likely, however. A second possibility would be one in which the mar-\nginal physical productivity curve is positively sloped and the marginal curve is\nnegatively sloped, provided of course that the demand for the product is not inelas-\ntic. This case will hold true within certain limits defined below. A rising marginal\nphysical productivity curve might occur when a plant is operating far below\noptimum capacity so that each additional worker employed together with the\nappropriate amounts of raw materials would yield increasingly larger increments\nto the total product. An example of this situation might be a case where the\nemployment of additional laborers would permit the use of machines which had\npreviously stood idle in the plant, and make possible economies of greater division\nof labor and technical efficiency to the extent that larger increments would be\nadded to the total product with each additional man employed. Production in a\nregion of increasing marginal physical productivity could occur only when firms\nare selling in imperfect markets, however. But in periods of low demand,\n\n* \"Monopolies and Labor Regulation,\" 744m. Ecoz. Rev., XXIX, Sept., 1939, pp. 551-552.\n\n*R. F. Harrod, \"Pigou's Theory of Unemployment,\" Ecoz. Jour., March, 1934, p. 27.\n\n*Increasing marginal physical returns would in general be accompanied by falling\nmarginal costs. If firms selling in a purely competitive market were operating in a stage\nof decreasing marginal costs, any firm could profitably expand its output at the prevailing\nprice since the demand for the product is perfectly elastic to the individual firm. Equilibrium\nfor the short-run will only be reached when the firms are all producing at a stage of rising\nmarginal cost and when marginal cost is equated to price for each firm. Hence a rising\nmarginal physical productivity curve for a firm selling in a purely competitive market is\nimpossible.\n",

                    "FUNDAMENTAL DEFICIENCIES OF THE AMERICAN\nPATENT LAW\n\nThe patent law is basic to the patent system. By analyzing the former we may explain the\nweaknesses of the latter.\n\nThe law makes certain rather obvious \"economic\" assumptions which are inapplicable to\nthe modern economy. But the most important\u2014and most fallacious\u2014assumption is its in-\ndividualistic conception of the process of invention. In fact, invention is a group process, the\nindividual contributions being relatively minor. In modern industrial research this is par-\nticularly so.\n\nA grant of separate proprietary rights over each inventive contribution thus imposes bar-\nriers to further innovation and reduction to practice of the whole. The economic system has\nhad to remove these barriers. But this has involved the creation of large patent pools, with\nconsequent dangers of injustice, and monopoly.\n\nIn addition, the confusion entailed by the application of the single patent to modern tech-\nnology has offered to the powerful legal methods of unfair competition. The result is often\ninjustice, perpetual legal monopoly over whole industries, and the danger, at least, of tech-\nnological retardation.\n\nThe patent law is not the same thing as the patent system. Our legal\nmethod of fostering technological advance is an ancient structure, almost\nthe same, basically and in detail, as it was three hundred years ago. But\nthe economic institutions which have grown up around this venerable\nlegal framework have so radically changed that it is difficult to believe\nthat the same law could possibly apply in the manner originally intended to\nthe new situation. In fact it does not. Economic change, motivated by the\ndynamic quest for profit, can use law, modify it, or ignore it. The resultant\nsystem may be more or less socially beneficent, more or less effective in ac-\ncomplishing its original purpose; in any event it will be different from that\noriginally contemplated by the unchanged legal prescriptions.\n\nThis paper does not attempt thoroughly to describe or evaluate the op-\neration of the patent 5j5/em. Its major interest is rather in the theory of the\npatent /aw. Law is society's means of conscious control. Because it is basic\nin the sense that economic institutions must develop within or about it, we\nmust understand the law before we can understand and evaluate the eco-\nnomic adaptations and the resultant synthesis. Insight into the problems\nof our present patent system may therefore be gained through analysis and\nevaluation of the preconceptions and rationale of the patent law, particu-\nlarly in the light of the major economic changes which have occurred since\nits conception.\n",

                    "PRODUCTIVITY, WAGE RATES, AND EMPLOYMENT\n\nOur economic system has demonstrated greater ability to produce goods than to\ndistribute the buying power to consume them. Spurgeon Bell's recent book attributes this\nshortcoming to the way productivity gains are distributed, with the implication that too\nmuch have been diverted to higher wage rates, and too little to lower prices. Re\u00e9xamination\nof his data reveals that the evidence is conflicting. Events, industry by industry, show that\nwage costs per unit shift closely with productivity, but that capital charges do not. While\nunit charges to consumers vary somewhat with productivity, and while output at times\nvaries with prices, the connection between productivity and prices is very dim. Productivity\ngains went largely to profits in the 1920's, and to consumers and wage rates in the 1930's.\nThese facts neither support nor contradict Bell's conclusions. They do suggest the need\nfor deeper theoretical investigation of the problem of the proper dynamic balance between\nproductivity, prices, profits, and wages, in the light of their repercussions on the distri-\nbution of income and on expenditure, savings, and investment, if full employment is to\nbe maintained,\n\nOne of the outstanding characteristics of our present economic system\nis that sharp increases in industrial production do not carry with them a\nvolume of expenditure sufficient to provide markets for the increased pro-\nduction. Four times in the past twelve years, in 1928-29, 1935, 1936-57,\nand late 1939, industrial production has spurted sharply upward, only to\nfall back as sales failed to keep pace with production. Whether this phe-\nnomenon be explained in terms of the failure of the propensity to invest\nto keep pace with the propensity to save, or whether it be explained in\nterms of the disappearance of the automatic readjustments of competitive\nmarkets as a result of monopolistic competition, the result is the same: our\neconomic system cannot find ways to move into consumption the goods\nwhich our technical productive apparatus stands ready to turn out in such\nabundance. While Russia suffers because her socialist economy cannot pro-\nduce the goods her population clamors to buy, we suffer because our cap-\nitalist institutions fail to generate the buying power to move into consump-\ntion the goods we can so readily produce. \u00c1s a consequence, millions of\nmen are unemployed.\n\nFacing this situation, any study which attempts to clarify the facts con-\ncerning the key elements in the problem must be given careful attention.\nThe latest Brookings publication, Productivity, Wages, and National In-\ncome, is such an attempt.' In the words of its jacket, \"it indicates how the\ngains from increasing productivity are distributed among the groups par-\nticipating in production and the consuming public; and the effects of the\nexisting distribution upon employment and national income.\"\n\nThis article does not attempt to review the book, in the sense of presenting\na careful appraisal of its workmanship with respect to statistical technique,\nobjectivity of presentation, conclusions reached, and their value to students\nand the profession. Questions which might be raised with respect to the\nsignificance of the index numbers used, or of their reliability when changing\n\n! By Spurgeon Bell, Brookings Institution, 1940.\n",

It might, however, affect some\ninstitutions adversely. Such a reduction was impossible so long as banks acted competitively.\nNow, however, that they can act in concert, it would be profitable to reduce the rate.\n\nShould the banks in any state reduce the rate to zero before similar action is taken by\nothers, there would be a net gain in income to the community taking action first. Under\nmonopolistic conditions the term interest applied to the deposit rate is really a misnomer.\nThe function of this payment is to place a restraint upon competition for investment.\nThough the banks pay the entire cost of this restraint, all other investors receive the\nbenefit in higher yields. In continuing to pay interest on deposits, the banks are, therefore,\nnot acting to maximize profits. The deposit rate could also be used as an instrument of\nmonetary policy to affect interest rates, investment, prices and output.\n\nWhy do banks pay interest on deposits?* What determines the rate; and\nwhat would happen if interest payments were reduced to zero? These three\nquestions have both practical and theoretical significance. During the last\nfew years the deposit rate has been continually revised downward, and it\nis now suggested that it can be reduced to zero. Administrative facilities\nnow make possible such a reduction by concerted action on a national scale,\nor by state and county banking associations in different geographical areas.?\nWhat would happen to bank earnings and assets if a zero rate were put\ninto effect? This is a problem in interest theory which, aside from a few\nremarks by Knut Wicksell, Ludwig Von Mises, and J. M. Keynes, has\nhardly been explored at all.\n\nThe following propositions will be advanced below:\n\nI. The conventional competitive theory of the deposit rate is inadequate and\ninconclusive.\n\nII. In a competitive banking system, interest must be paid by individual banks\nto attract reserves. The rate is a function of the loss-ratio and the loan\nrate of interest. The height of the deposit rate varies with the profitability\nof bank operations and an equilibrium rate of zero is theoretically possible.\n\nIII. In an oligopolistic situation such as the Big Five of England, the deposit\nrate would have a tendency in the short period to rise above the competitive\n\n' Since the payment of interest on interbank deposits has been prohibited, this discussion\nis concerned solely with customers' deposits.\n\n* Concerted and uniform action on the deposit rate was made possible in the United\nStates by Sec. 11 (b) of the Banking act of 1933 amending Sec, 19 of the Federal Reserve\nact; Sec. 324 of the Banking act of 1935, and Sec. 101 amending Sec. 12B of the F.R. act.\nThese confer powers upon the Federal Reserve and the F.D.LC. to fix the deposit rate.\nPrior to 1933 this rate was determined primarily by competition and clearing house regula-\ntions. For these and a history of the deposit rate see Part II of Commercial Banking Reform\nin tbe United States by Leonard L. Watkins, University of Michigan, 1938. On recent\nlegislation, see Watkins, chapter 6. State action is dependent upon statute. In Wisconsin,\nSection 220.04(6) of the statutes empowers the Banking Commission to issue orders with\nrespect to the deposit rate. No law, however, is necessary to permit county associations to\nmake voluntary agreements. These agreements have in fact been made in several counties\nfixing a deposit rate less than the maximum prescribed by either the state or federal au-\nthorities, and so far their legality has not been questioned, These agreements may not be\nenforceable at law as between the banks but such enforceability does not appear to be\nnecessary.\n"

                    "REINVESTMENT AND THE RATE OF INTEREST\n\nThe classical theory of investment, as exemplified in the work of Keynes, considers\nthat, ceteris paribus, a fall in the rate of interest brings about an increase in total invest-\nment. This may be true for net investment but it is not obvious for reinvestment. Unless\nit is true for both net investment and reinvestment, there does not exist an unequivocal\nguide for policy. \u00c0 change in the rate of interest operates on reinvestment by bringing\nnearer or postponing the abandonment and premature abandonment of existing capital.\nAn increase in the interest rate tends to increase in general the abandonment of existing\ncapital and also the premature abandonment of those capital goods which are to be re-\nplaced by goods of intermediate durability. But though the decision to abandon is hastened\nby the increase in the interest rate, this does not automatically swell the flow of reinvest-\nment. It may or may not. This, however, introduces a range of indeterminacy in the effect\nof a change in the interest rate on the flow of total investment which calls for further\nstudy.\n\n1l. It is the purpose of this paper to examine briefly the problem of the\nrelationship between the flow of reinvestment and the rate of interest.\nApparently it is tacitly assumed that reinvestment responds to a change in\nthe rate of interest in the same way as net investment, or at least does not\nbehave in such a way as to offset the effect of such a change on net invest-\nment.! Now, the classical position on the relationship between the rate of\ninvestment and the rate of interest may be expressed in the words\nof Keynes: \". . . if there is an increased investment in any given type of\ncapital during any period of time, the marginal efficiency of that type of capi-\ntal will diminish as the investment in it is increased . . . the rate of invest-\nment will be pushed to the point on the investment demand-schedule\nwhere the marginal efficiency of capital in general is equal to the market\nrate of interest.\"? This implies that a rise (or fall) in the rate of interest,\ncel. par., will decrease (or increase) the rate of investment; and in an\neconomy which is consuming its capital, this change in the interest rate will\nincrease (or decrease) the rate of capital consumption. But the rate of\ninvestment may be taken either gros; or nel, 7.e., with or without the rate\nof reinvestment.? The rate of reinvestment can be further subdivided into\ntwo rates, viz., the rate of reinvestment which arises from replacing exist-\ning machines with new ones of the same kind, and that which arises from\ntransferring over to new machines of a different kind. The former kind of\n",

In fact, he has a tendency to make the volume\nof net investment depend upon the volume of reinvestment, e.g., pp. 100-104.\n\n? [bid., pp. 136-137.\n\n? To distinguish between the two, it is necessary to define what is meant by \"maintain-\ning capital intact.\" This is very difficult to do in real terms, while in monetary terms, net\ninvestment may be defined unambiguously on an ex-post basis, following Keynes, as the\ndifference between Income and Consumption, op. cit., p. 62, or, following Ohlin, as the\ndifference between gross investment and disinvested capital, Pemmimgpoliti\u00a3, offentliga\narbeten, etc., Stockholm, 1934, pp. 8-9.\n",

Mexico's share in our imports, since\nthe expropriations of March, 1938, has fallen drastically as a result of the boycott of\nMexican oil by American companies. The selection in this manner of a base period during\nwhich special conditions were unfavorable to imports from Mexico is contrary to the\nprinciple insisted upon by the United States in the negotiation of trade agreements with\nforeign countries. This action weakens the bargaining position of the United States and\njeopardizes the principle of equal treatment embodied in the trade agreements program.\n\nBilateralism in international trade has put a severe strain on the \"most-\nfavored-nation\" policy, once accepted in principle by all great trading na-\ntions. Today the United States is almost alone in its practice of a commercial\npolicy aimed at extending the application of the principle to all phases of\ntrade regulation. Other countries hold that the most-favored-nation prin-\nciple is limited to tariff treatment, and does not apply to the newer direct\ncontrols. But we insist that equality of treatment must be extended to quotas\nand exchange controls also, otherwise the new devices will nullify equal\ntreatment in tariff rates. Consequently we have insisted that our exporters\nreceive a share in all foreign import quotas proportional to tbeir sbare in\ntbe imports for a previous \"representative period.\" 'This formula as incor-\nporated in the Hull trade agreements refers to customs quotas, which limit\nimports at special tariff rates, as well as to quotas which establish an abso-\nlute limit to imports.\n\nUsually it is the United States which insists upon the principle in order\nto get a \"fair\" share in someone else's quota, but there are several instances\nin which we ourselves have established customs quotas in connection with\ntariff reductions niade in trade agreements. The most recent case is the\ncustoms quota on fuel oil and crude petroleum established in the Vene-\nzuelan agreement. The import tax on these products has been halved for\nan amount not exceeding 5 per cent of the total crude petroleum processed\nin United States refineries during the previous year.\n\nImports in excess of this customs quota will have to pay the original tax.\nA subsequent proclamation by the President has assigned shares in the\nquota to our principal suppliers. Mexico, up to the time of the oil expro-\npriations the source of from 10 to 15 per cent of our oi] imports, has\nreceived a very small share, and the question arises, have we allocated the\noil quotas according to the formula we have demanded of others, or are\nwe scrapping our principle in order to discipline Mexico? The answer is\nimportant for the future of a commercial policy based on the most-favored-\nnation clause.\n\nSpecifically, have we discriminated against Mexico by the choice of a\nbase period which can in no way be said to be normal or representative?\nOn the basis of imports for the first ten months of 1939, Venezuela was\n",

                    "The analysis of Mr. Mikesell appears formally correct in its setting but ir-\nrelevant to my argument, since he has chosen to investigate a situation so com-\npletely different from mine. The more fundamental differences are obvious:\nwhereas my model: was an economy with imperfect factor and commodity\nmarkets and operating at less than full employment, he treats of perfect compe-\ntition, full employment, and homogeneous production functions. He also assumes\nthe precise and continuous operation of marginal productivity remuneration in its\nstrictest physical version, a condition patently at variance with the hypothesis\nof my paper. But the extent of other differences I am unable to determine from\nhis exposition. My attention was directed toward the results of minimum wage\nlegislation on the entire system, but Mr. Mikesell deals with product price, the\nproduction function, and other aspects of firm equilibrium. The best interpreta-\ntion which can be given is that\u2014if his argument 7; intended to explain general\neffects\u2014he refers to some symbolic or summary firm, a sort of weighted average\nfirm. Yet if this firm is to represent the whole economy, surely its appropriateness\nis vitiated by the other conditions he has posited. The first of these is that\nall prime costs are labor costs. This is a difficult premise for a macro-economic\nanalysis; it ignores, for example, user costs in the short period. But he further\nassumes, apparently, that there is but one wage-rate: that all units of the factor\nlabor get the same remuneration. Here lies an inexorable dilemma. If he does\n10t make this assumption, then an increase in the low wage-rate will not bring\nabout an equi-proportionate rise in prime costs (even if all prime costs are \"labor\"\nCosts) , and his argument collapses. If he Zoes make this assumption, however, he\nis not discussing a minimum wage situation at all but a generalized wage advance!\n\nIt is difficult to leave this note without the opinion that here stands an example\nof that \"reasoning based upon inapplicable premises\" which Mr. Hagen, my\nsecond commentator, deplores. I concur that the premises are inappropriate; but\nwhether they are inapplicable or not, they were not the premises of the article\nmy critic seeks to attack.\n\nWith the comments of Mr. Hagen, on the other hand, I am in general agree-\nment.

                    "TOWARD A CONCEPT OF WORKABLE COMPETITION\n\nThe paper of which this is an enlarged and revised version was read at a joint Round\nTable of the American Economic Association and the Econometric Society, during the\nmeetings at Philadelphia, December, 1939.\n\nWhere one of the conditions of perfect competition is absent, the presence of others\nmay lead to greater rather than less imperfection. Long-run curves of individual demand\nand cost are flatter than commonly represented, and the imperfections of competition corre-\nspondingly less. Industry subject to fluctuating demand requires prices in excess of short-\nrun marginal cost. Favorable conditions appear to include a sloping individual demand\ncurve, and some uncertainty whether a reduction of price will be promptly met.\n\nWith standardized products, a chaotic market tends toward ruinous competition. Pure\noligopoly is seldom found; the important case being that of openly-quoted prices with\nvarying amounts of deviations on actual sales. Standard products with sloping individual\ndemand curves are also possible.\n\nWhile extreme quality differentials approach monopoly, more moderate ones may be\nworkably competitive, especially with further growth of closer substitutes and better\nknowledge of qualities on the part of buyers.\n\nIL. Introduction\n\nTheories of imperfect and \"monopolistic\" competition have for some\ntime been current, in an unformulated state, in the field of economic policy;\nand important beginnings have been made at formulation by economic theo-\nrists. \u00c1s a necessary step in this last development, the conception of \"perfect\ncompetition\" has itself for the first time received really specific definition\nand elaboration. With this has come the realization that \"perfect competi-\ntion\" does not and cannot exist and has presumably never existed, for\nreasons quite apart from any inescapable tendency toward collusion, such\nas Adam Smith noted in his familiar remark on the gettings-together of\nmembers of a trade. What we have left is an unreal or ideal standard\nwhich may serve as a starting point of analysis and a norm with which to\ncompare actual competitive conditions. It has also served as a standard\nby which to judge them.\n\nI am not quarreling with proper use of this standard as an ideal. How-\never, it has seemed at times to lead to undesirable results, in that it does not\nafford reliable guidance to the factors which are favorable to the closest\navailable working approximation to that ideal, under actual conditions.\nWith this problem the present paper is concerned.\n\nThe theory of the subject has defined for us the results of various forms\nof imperfect competition\u2014some of the results being still debatable.

The introductory chapter discusses busi-\nness situations as they are apprehended by the business-man; distinguishes\ngroups of external factors that affect economic change; lists the statistical\nseries that may be used advantageously in continuous observation of the busi-\nness conjuncture; and ends with the expected conclusion that empirical link-\ning of factors and symptoms, as reflected in time series and other data, is\ninsufficient for the understanding of economic change, since observation of\nactual economic processes cannot distinguish between interwoven causes and\neffects. To make causal analyses a theoretical apparatus is indispensable.\n\n'This theoretical apparatus is presented in chapters 2 through 4. Chap-\nter 2 deals with equilibrium and the theoretical norm, 7.e., with the sta-\ntionary economy. Chapter 3 presents the entrepreneur, the innovation, and\nthe banking system\u2014the triple alliance that contributes a strategic impetus\nto economic evolution. Chapter 4 comprises the crux of Professor Schumpe-\nter's theory of business cycles, indicating how the behavior of entrepreneurs\nprovides the primary model for use in the study of business cycles; how this\nprimary model is complicated by consideration of secondary factors (errors,\npropagation through the credit system, etc.), and of the various types of\ncycles to which the primary and secondary factors give rise. These three\nchapters are to a large extent a summary of Professor Schumpeter's earlier\nwritings on the nature of a stationary economy and the theory of economic\nchange. But in chapter 2 comments on imperfect competition take account\nof recent developments in the field; and in chapter 4 business-cycle theory\nis expanded and extended materially beyond the somewhat bare statement\nof it in Professor Schumpeter's earlier writings.\n\nChapter 5 in Volume I discusses the bearing of the theoretical model\nupon the measurement of cycles in time series. Chapters 8 through 13 in\nVolume II deal with the behavior of various economic quantities in Great\nBritain, the United States, and Germany, for the pre-war period as repre-\nsented by annual data. The successive chapters discuss the general price\nlevel, physical quantities (total) and employment, prices and quantities\nof individual commodities, expenditures and wages, the rate of interest,\nthe central credit market and the stock exchange. These chapters may be\ntermed statistical, although this does not mean that they present a de-\ntailed statistical analysis of cycles in the various aspects of the economic\nsystem.

                    "INTEREST RATES FOR HOME FINANCING\n\nPrior to the present decade, the deficiencies of the financial system gave rise to un-\neconomical lending terms and to excessive rates of interest on home loans. The pronounced\nand continued upward sweep of the secular trend during the twenties deferred the inevitable\nconsequences, but the ensuing crisis brought the shortcomings into sharp focus. The\nrepercussions were national in scope and set into action various measures of reform to\ngive relief to home owners. This paper presents a summary of the activities of the Federal\nHome Loan Bank System, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, the Federal Savings and\nLoan System, and the Federal Housing Administration. The influence of these agencies on\ninterest rates is discussed, followed by an analysis of the justification of the existing rate\nlevel. It is shown that present rates are no longer the result of free market activity but\nare governed primarily by the rate established on FHA insured loans. There is now some\nquestion of the adequacy of rates to cover the attending costs of home-financing institutions.\n",

                    "One of the most striking phenomena of the trade depression of the past\ndecade is the trend of interest rates. It is difficult for many to accept the\nrealities of the existing level, and hence it is often characterized as \"arti-\nficial,\" \"temporary,\" \"unsound,\" etc. For the most part, this attitude is the\nresult of an emphasis upon historical perspective rather than concentration\nupon the unusual conditions which have prevailed in recent years. It is\ncommonly assumed that, with the correction of the existing abnormalities,\ninterest rates will inevitably be adjusted. However, the uncertainties of the\nassumption cast doubt upon any early realization of the deduction made.\nNot only is this true because of the unknown duration of these so-called\nabnormalities, but, in addition, various controls which have been developed\nwill likely continue to function over a much longer period.\n\nThe prevailing level of interest rates may also be questioned when related\nto the underlying forces of the demand for, and the supply of, capital. Many\ninfluences affecting these primary determinants of the cost of money en-\ncourage the conclusion that the present low level of interest rates is not\njustified in the light of economic conditions. Risks which are so comprehen-\nsive as to cause concern for the safety of the entire economy would seem\nto point in the direction of a rate sufficiently high to afford compensating\nprotection for those who supply the capital. In the face of these abnormal\nrisks, the rates of interest seem to be entirely inadequate.\n\nAs to the demand for capital, it is much more difficult to evaluate\nits vitality and persistency. There is much evidence of its potentiality where\nthere is reasonable availability of funds at what is considered to be an\nattractive rate, accompanied by favorable terms of loan repayment. Evi-\ndence of possible demand is found in the development of various govern-\nmental lending agencies such as the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, the\nReconstruction Finance Corporation, various agricultural lending groups,\nnot to mention the indirect facilities provided by the Federal Housing\nAdministration. Private lending institutions fail to display any great en-\nthusiasm for accommodation of the borrowers financed through these\n",

(See Supplement, March, 1940, p. 219.)\n\nThe theory of comparative cost has lately been replaced by more modern theories of\ninternational trade. This paper considers the relations between these different theories.\nHaberlers opportunity cost analysis emphasizes continuity with and similarity to the\nolder doctrine by taking as data the scales of relative prices established by the pricing\nprocess. Ohlin's general equilibrium theory is simply a more general and explicit formula-\ntion of the opportunity-cost doctrine. Though Ohlin, like Haberler, demonstrates that\nmutually beneficial trade is possible only where relative price scales differ, he is less\nconcerned with this result than with its underlying basis: the relative supplies of the\nproductive agents. Elaboration of this ultimate scarcity aspect of international trade is\nwhat distinguishes this theory and gives it superior explanatory value. For dealing with\nwelfare problems, the abbreviated opportunity-cost version is handier. Both modern\nformulations differ from the classical in that they assume a multiple, the latter a single-\nfactor world.\n",

                    "One of the leading objections to the classical theory of comparative cost\nhas been that it takes as its point of departure the long discarded labor-\ncost theory of value. Adoption of this theoretical base put modern sponsors\nof the doctrine of comparative cost in the anomalous position of accepting,\nfor those parts of their analysis concerned with a closed economy, the\nthoroughly modern theory of general equilibrium, while atavistically re-\nverting, for any discussion of international relations, to the rejected\nRicardian value principles. Recent years, however, have witnessed a thor-\noughgoing reformulation of the theory of international trade which unites\nit in a consistent fashion with the main corpus of equilibrium theory.\n\n\"The modern restatement of the principles of international trade has been\nchiefly associated with the names of Professors Ohlin and Haberler. These\nwtiters have provided us with two alternative approaches to an analysis of\ninternational trade, that of the former being explicitly formulated as an\nextension of the general theory of equilibrium,! that of the latter being\nexpressed in terms of opportunity cost? In a recent paper,? Professor\nHaberler indicated, rather briefly, some of the main relationships between\nhis approach and that of Professor Ohlin, as well as the line of connection\nwhich links his own theory with that of Ricardo. Except for these remarks,\nand occasional references in recent literature, I know of no discussion of\nthese matters. For this reason, and because the relationship of the oppor-\ntunity cost version of international trade theory to the general equilibrium\ntheory, on the one hand, and to the doctrine of comparative cost, on the\nother hand, is perhaps less apparent than it should be, it may not be amiss\nto devote a few pages to the task of clarifying these interconnections.\n\n' Bertil Ohlin, Igterregional and.

                    "UNION WAGE AND HOUR POLICIES AND EMPLOYMENT\n\nPaper presented at a Round Table Conference of the American Economic Association,\nDecember 28, 1939. (See Supplement, March, 1940, p. 227.)\n\nIn manufacturing industries and in bituminous coal mining, wage rates since 1933\nhave been greatly increased and hours of work have been substantially reduced. Proponents\nof these changes have insisted that such wage and hour policies would increase total pur-\nchasing power and increase employment. The evidence presented below does not sub-\nstantiate these claims. In fact, employment in bituminous coal mining was lower in 1937\nthan in 1929 when production was not so great, and employment in 87 manufacturing\nindustries was slightly lower in 1939 than in 1929 when production was about the same.\nIn bituminous coal mining and in manufacturing industries money payrolls were about\n10 per cent below those of 1929, although, owing to a decline in the cost of living, real\npayrolls were higher than in 1929.\n\nA more detailed study of bituminous coal mining shows the changes in per capita in-\ncome, employee productivity, mechanization, costs, and sales income that were associated\nwith increases in wage rates and decreases in hours that were introduced beginning in 1934.\n\nThere is no one wage and hour policy to which all unions subscribe.\nGenerally speaking, unions like most employers sell their product at the\nbest price and under the best conditions that they can obtain. What price\nthey can command depends on many factors. In the short run if the in-\ndustry is a profitable one, as for example petroleum refining and automobile\nmanufacturing, and if the union has substantial bargaining power and its\nleadership is able and aggressive, relatively high wages and short hours\nof work may be attained. On the other hand, if the industry is faced with\nruinous competition and overdevelopment, as for example in cotton and\ncertain other textile industries, particularly if the scope of union organization\nis not industry-wide, the workers will have to content themselves with\nrelatively ow annual earnings and with relatively long hours.\n\nOther factors which affect wage and hour levels are (1) the character\nof the demand for the product, that is, whether the demand is elastic or\ninelastic, (2) the proportion that labor costs constitute of the total cost\nof production, (3) the economic organization and financial structure of\nthe industry, (4) competition from substitute products, (5) general busi-\nness conditions, and (6) the relation of capacity to demand. Because of the\noperation of these factors, wage and hour levels and policies vary by regions,\nmarkets, industries, and often establishments.\n\nIn a number of industries, unions, like employers in numerous instances,\nhave successfully maintained the price of their product during periods of\ndrastic deflation. In the anthracite industry, for example, the union has not\ntaken a single wage reduction since the Award of the Anthracite Strike\nCommission of 1903 and in the building and construction industry it is not\nuncommon for organized crafts to retain their nominal wage rates during\nperiods of depression. In other industries, unions, like employers on numer-\n",

                    "OBJECTIONS TO THE 100 PER CENT RESERVE PLAN\n\nCertain objections to 100 per cent reserves are commonly overlooked. In case of bank\ncredit, the real lenders are the depositors including, notably, the recipients of checks.\nIt is these whose convenience waiting is combined and co\u00f3rdinated by the banks and made\navailable to borrowers who pay for free banking service to depositors. The 100 per cent\nreserve scheme would make this free service impossible unless subsidized and might con-\nceivably bring disappearance of deposit banking. Subsidization objected to; perpetual\ngovernment debt as means to idea of 100 per cent objected to. Why precisely 100 per cent?\nA sacred number? Possible resulting growth of new type of financial institution through\nwhich we could still get deflation. Why henceforth deprive depositors of possibility of\nfree banking service?\n\nA number of economists who favor a managed currency, with the idea of\npromoting stabilization of the general level of prices, have accepted\u2014a little\ntoo uncritically, I think\u2014the idea of 100 per cent reserves. Objections\nwhich I cannot but believe have some importance, seem to have been gen-\nerally overlooked.\n\nOne of the principal features of commercial banking, as we know it\ntoday, is free service to depositors, whereby business can be carried on by\ncheck and the clerical work of transferring credits from the makers of\nchecks to the depositors of checks is done without fee\u2014though the depres-\nsion has brought in, to some extent, the service charge. It is because the\nbanks have been able to \"lend more than they have,\" because, in short,\nthey have not been compelled to maintain a 100 per cent reserve, that they\nhave been able to render this service to depositors without charge.\n\nOf course the banks do not really lend more than they have, except as\nintermediaries or agents for the real lenders. What the banks do is to\nbring borrowers and lenders together. And the lenders are the bank de-\npositors. Let us suppose the banks to lend, in the aggregate, several times\nas much money as they have on hand. The borrowing accomplishes nothing\nfor those who receive the deposits until they use their newly acquired credit\nfor the purchase of goods, by writing checks on this credit. When they\nhave done this, they no longer have claims on the lending banks. But the\nrecipients of their checks have these claims. Clearly, the banks could not\nthus lend more than they have on hand and have the lending mean any-\nthing, if the recipients of the checks drawn on this credit were, every one\nof them, to insist at once upon taking the money out of the banks. I/ ir\nIhe recipients of tbe checks, therefore, wbo are really the lenders. They\nhave given up tangible goods or services and are waiting for payment. For\nthe checks they have received are but claims on the banks. And the recipients\nof these checks are still but claimants on the banks after the checks have\nbeen turned in, until they have actually drawn out the money owed to them\nor until they have, in their turn, made purchases and passed to others\nthe claims they hold on the banks. These others then become the claimants\non the banks. If all the borrowers of all the banks failed to repay, is it not\n",

                    "RAILROAD COSTS IN RELATION TO THE VOLUME OF TRAFFIC\n\n\"The fact that for the railroads, as for any enterprise, the cost of production is affected\nby the volume of product merits some further consideration. This is true particularly with\nrespect to the relative variability of the several items of cost. When the four main divisions\nof expense for the Class I railroads are compared with the variations in traffic volume\nover the period from 1922 to 1938, it is found that the items which vary most closely\nwith traffic are actually those which have commonly been presented as comprising the\nlargest \"constant\" components (and conversely).\n\nThis failure of the facts to support the common pronouncements results from the im-\nplicit assumption of standards which are essentially rigid. This assumption, and the pro-\nnouncements based upon it, do not hold for periods longer than approximately a month.\nWhen considered over a longer period the variable element in all operating costs stands\nout as the dominant characteristic. This has some significance in connection with the\ndoctrine of increasing returns; for the extent to which costs are variable directly affects\nthe increase in returns, as the volume of traffic increases.\n\nThe point has been made frequently that fixed or constant costs absorb\nan abnormally large portion of the income of a railroad. The term \"con-\nstant costs,\" as used here, refers to those elements in the expenses of a\nrailroad which are essentially independent of, or not functionally related\nto, the volume of business handled. This constant characteristic has been\npointed out particularly with respect to maintenance expenditures, and\ngeneral expenses. Ripley has said \". . . only about two-thirds of the total\nexpenditures of a railroad are applied to operation, the remaining third\nbeing devoted to capital account. Moreover, of these two-thirds of the\ntotal applied to operating outlay, only about one-half responds to azy\nchange in the tonnage, the other half being constant up to a certain\npoint.\"* What this point is Ripley does not say. He admits that the state-\nment implies a given standard of service, and maintenance, as well as a\ngiven stage of technological development, but apparently does not consider\nit necessary to develop the point. That the \"constant costs\" grow with\nthe growth of traffic over a period of years, however, is implicit in his con-\ntention that they remain about two-thirds of the total.\n\nThe use of the term \"constant\" in referring to any costs is dangerous\nbecause it suggests an invariability which does not exist, even for relatively\nshort periods. Moreover, no costs are altogether independent of the volume\nof business. Given a certain volume of business, on the average, for a\nperiod of time, then certain expenditures will be made whether that volume\nof business is moving at the moment or not. But in any business the cost\nof production is affected by variations in the volume of product; and this\nis true for a// costs when the variations are large, or extended over a con-\nsiderable period of time. Railroads are not essentially different from other\nenterprises in this respect.\n\nThe difference in variability among the several elements of cost is\nessentially relative. The relation of costs to the volume of traffic may be\neither direct or indirect. This more accurately states the difference between\n\n!W. Z. Ripley, Railroads, Rates and.

Such\ncourses have lost contact with their major objective\u2014the application of economic theory\u2014\nand have become adjuncts of the school of commerce rather than the social science of eco-\nnomics. Public Finance and Labor Problems are unfortunate cases in point. Courses and\ntextbooks in specialized fields must go beyond mere descriptive, technical material and\nbuild upon the foundation of economic principles used as a kit of tools designed for the\nstudy of the operation of the economy as a whole. The lack of unity charge should be\naddressed to the specialist in applied fields rather than to economic theory. Any study\nof a phase of the operation of an economy as a whole can be illuminated by the use of\neconomic principles, but systematic theory can never unify technical, structural, adminis-\ntrative studies of business\u2014a r\u00f3le for which it was never intended.\n\nHas Economic Theory Lost Its R\u00f3le of a Unifying Agent?\nIn 1919, Professor Walton H. Hamilton wrote:\n\nThe task of a general body of theory in any subject is to give unity to its\ninvestigation. At present economics is badly in need of such a unifying agent.\nIts sprawling frontiers reach from value theory across money, taxation, and\ntransportation to salesmanship, insurance and advertising. Each of these subjects\nhas its own personnel. Those who seek truth in these remote fields of inquiry\nknow little and care less for value theory. . .. As a result economics today tends\nto break up into a large number of overlapping but unrelated inquiries and to\nlose the unity which in times past has been its source of strength.!\n\nProfessor Wesley C. Mitchell voiced the same lament in 1925 asserting\nas an example that economic theory \"plays a small r\u00f3le in our work as\nspecialists in public finance. . . .\"? Professor Willard E. Atkins continued\nthe lament in 1935 stating:\n\nPart of the unrest has been indicated by the drift of teachers into business fields\nand into schools of commerce. From outside positions they have thrown back\nat the traditional economists the charge that their teachings are unreal?\n\nI quite agree with these writers that economic theory should be a\nunifying agent which specialists in the fields located on the periphery of\neconomics could ignore only at the risk of placing in peril their reputa-\ntion as specialists.

                    "TREATMENT OF CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS IN THE\nTEACHING OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\nPaper presented at a Round Table Conference of the American Economic Association,\nDecember 27, 1939.\n\nThe teacher of political economy cannot be \"neutral\" in controversial questions, \"giving\nall sides\" and letting it go at that. Such questions are not isolated, but fit into a pattern\nof development which will be different for different teachers. The teacher is not so much\nan advocate of views as he is a reporter on observations. The honest teacher makes himself\nthe ally of history as he understands it; believing that after all economics is an art rather\nthan a science, he necessarily makes room for deliberate social purpose. The usefulness of\nquantitative methods should not blind us to the essentially qualitative character of the\nsubject. Every great teacher of political economy had a thesis. Those who refused to take\na position added little to thought or action, and are forgotten, \"Indoctrination\" does not\nimply neglect to explore and to refute. It means simply scrupulous inspection plus earnest\nrecommendation.\n\nIn political economy, over a period, principle derives from practice, and\nnot the other way round. Sanction follows social convenience. Evolution in\ndoing compels evolution in doctrine. This does not mean that local and\ntemporary and partisan interest can immediately alter received rules. And\nwhere there is a wider and more permanent change of advantage, there is\nstill the celebrated lag which makes for gradual warping rather than sudden\nabandonment of old theorems. It is commonplace that a minority equipped\nwith control of the social means of production may for long keep law and\nmorals on its side. But in the economist's beloved \"long run\" we learn by\nliving, and do not live by learning.\n\nThis is lesson number 1 in the teaching of political economy. Unless one\nrecognizes that in economic life there is no absolute, and that trends in\nthought follow trends in performance, he is not attempting to study social\nbehavior but is trying to define a theology. Writings reduced to something\nlike system the elaborate opportunism which went by the name of mercantil-\nism. After these coercive public policies had been eaten into by private\ninitiative, the Jaissez faire philosophy was seized upon eagerly because it\njustifed what was already familiar conduct. And now that individualist\nenterprise has grown out of all anticipated proportions, and thus taken on,\ninevitably, the collectivist character, the propriety of public control is again\nurged. This is historical development, with the unexpected becoming, after\na time, orthodox.\n\nThere have been variants, of course, within the larger cycle. Consider the\ndissent from classical doctrine inspired by American geographical and eco-\nnomic conditions at the beginning of the last century. Here was a country\nnot of decreasing but of increasing returns, in which accessions to popula-\ntion meant not resort to poorer natural resources but to richer, with the con-\nsequence of a larger product for each worker. Instead of growing economic\nstringency, as in old countries, there was progressive liberation. In place of\nattention to the division of labor, association of labor was the need. The\n",

Socialist economists take\nthe opposite view that society best serves its own interests by regulating the\neconomic activities of individuals.

He, however, confines this qualification to\ncases of non-perfect (as he calls it) competition, of the non-tangency sort. On\npage 476, he says:\n\n\"In the analysis of perfect competition, the maximization of profits by entre-\npreneurs is a situation that must exist ex defimitione. First, we are accustomed\nto defining normal profit as the transfer cost' of entrepreneurship; i.e. the\namount which is necessary to keep the firm in operation. Second, we exclude\nsuper-normal profits from the case of perfect competition. Therefore, entre-\npreneurs under perfect competition 7245/? maximize profits or disappear alto-\ngether. The same analysis applies to the \"tangency case\" of monopolistic com-\npetition.\"\n\nNot at all. It is normal profit that must exist ex defimitione in a perfectly\ncompetitive situation\u2014and normal profit is a purely subjective matter. It is that\nprofit which just induces the entrepreneur to stay in the business. In monetary\nterms, it could be zero or even negative, though either of these is unlikely as a\ncontinuing phenomenon. It might very well be positive but less than what the\nentrepreneur might earn in some other line of activity, or even in the same line\nof activity, if he so wished. And the same reasons might deter an entrepreneur\nfrom maximizing his money profits under perfect, as under non-perfect, competi-\ntion. That is, he might produce beyond the point at which his money profits are\na maximum, counting the \"prestige\" attaching to the management of a large\nbusiness, for example, as sufficient or more than sufficient to compensate him\nfor the profits that he gives up. Or, he might sell at a lower price\u2014although\nfeeling that he might sell all he wished at a higher price\u2014for philanthropic\nreasons, for example. Or he might pay wages higher than the market, for ethical\nreasons or for \"the feeling of righteous self-satisfaction that goes with it.\"\n\n\"That profits are a maximum in perfectly competitive markets is true in current\nliterature, only by assumption. We do exclude supernormal profits from the case\nof perfect competition, but only because we assume that normal pros are maxi-\nmum profits. Incidentally, of course, the types of monopoly equilibrium, described\nby Mrs. Robinson, for example, are true only by assumption. We conclude that\nthe individual entrepreneur will produce that output at which marginal revenue\nequals marginal cost, only because we assume that he will attempt to maximize his\nnet money profit. Actually, to assume that an individual's net money profit will be\na maximum is to assume that he will equate marginal revenue and marginal\ncost. Any other assumption concerning the objective of business-men will lead to\na different equilibrium position. In the absence of knowledge concerning the ob-\njectives of business-men, it is impossible to determine that equilibrium position.\nWe must say, as the older economists used to say, that the individual entrepreneur\nwill attempt to maximize his net advantage (whatever that may be).

                    "Reply by Mr. Higgins\nI realize from Professor Lynch's note that I used the term \"profits\" somewhat\nambiguously. In the passage that he quotes, the \"profits\" that must be maximized\n\n?Jtalics his.\n",
                    "he points out that the assumption that individual producers will attempt to\nmaximize their profits is only one of many assumptions that might be made in\nthe analysis of any particular case. He, however, confines this qualification to\ncases of non-perfect (as he calls it) competition, of the non-tangency sort. On\npage 476, he says:\n\n\"In the analysis of perfect competition, the maximization of profits by entre-\npreneurs is a situation that must exist ex defimitione. First, we are accustomed\nto defining normal profit as the transfer cost' of entrepreneurship; i.e. the\namount which is necessary to keep the firm in operation. Second, we exclude\nsuper-normal profits from the case of perfect competition. Therefore, entre-\npreneurs under perfect competition 7245/? maximize profits or disappear alto-\ngether. The same analysis applies to the \"tangency case\" of monopolistic com-\npetition.\"\n\nNot at all. It is normal profit that must exist ex defimitione in a perfectly\ncompetitive situation\u2014and normal profit is a purely subjective matter. It is that\nprofit which just induces the entrepreneur to stay in the business. In monetary\nterms, it could be zero or even negative, though either of these is unlikely as a\ncontinuing phenomenon. It might very well be positive but less than what the\nentrepreneur might earn in some other line of activity, or even in the same line\nof activity, if he so wished. And the same reasons might deter an entrepreneur\nfrom maximizing his money profits under perfect, as under non-perfect, competi-\ntion. That is, he might produce beyond the point at which his money profits are\na maximum, counting the \"prestige\" attaching to the management of a large\nbusiness, for example, as sufficient or more than sufficient to compensate him\nfor the profits that he gives up. Or, he might sell at a lower price\u2014although\nfeeling that he might sell all he wished at a higher price\u2014for philanthropic\nreasons, for example. Or he might pay wages higher than the market, for ethical\nreasons or for \"the feeling of righteous self-satisfaction that goes with it.\"\n\n\"That profits are a maximum in perfectly competitive markets is true in current\nliterature, only by assumption. We do exclude supernormal profits from the case\nof perfect competition, but only because we assume that normal pros are maxi-\nmum profits. Incidentally, of course, the types of monopoly equilibrium, described\nby Mrs. Robinson, for example, are true only by assumption. We conclude that\nthe individual entrepreneur will produce that output at which marginal revenue\nequals marginal cost, only because we assume that he will attempt to maximize his\nnet money profit. Actually, to assume that an individual's net money profit will be\na maximum is to assume that he will equate marginal revenue and marginal\ncost. Any other assumption concerning the objective of business-men will lead to\na different equilibrium position. In the absence of knowledge concerning the ob-\njectives of business-men, it is impossible to determine that equilibrium position.\nWe must say, as the older economists used to say, that the individual entrepreneur\nwill attempt to maximize his net advantage (whatever that may be). Truly,\nempirical research is needed, as Mr. Higgins suggests.\n\nEDWARD S. LYNCH\n\nIowa State College\n"

The issue of confisca-\ntion was not involved.? If, in the future, complaining public utilities plead the\n",
                    "procedural point of view, evidence of cost of reproduction may be considered\nas having received adequate weight if it is carefully examined, even though\nthe evidence is found to be without force. But it does not follow that evidence\nof cost of reproduction would be given sufficient weight in a confiscation case if\nit were merely carefully examined. Here the courts look to the actual results in\ndollars and cents, and it might very well be that a commission's refusal to give\nactual weight to cost of reproduction would result in rates unfairly low in the\neyes of the court. The force of the O'Fallon decision, in fact, is that the cost\nof reproduction must receive weight in the final result, provided, of course, that\nthe evidence is substantial.*\n\nHad the issue in the Pacific Gas and Electric case been one of adequacy of\nrates, the decision of the Court might have been different. So much seems to\nbe implied by the following words: \"Respondent was entitled to contest the\nvalue thus placed upon its properties, or any part of them, to insist that the\nvalue taken as the rate base was too low, and that in consequence the prescribed\nrates were confiscatory. That was the issue upon which the court below should\nhave passed.\"\n\nWhile it may be true that a majority of the Supreme Court does favor historical\ncost, it can hardly be said that the Pacific Gas and Electric case establishes this\nfact. There is yet no reason to conclude that the Court has necessarily departed\nfrom its position in the Los Angeles Gas case, where it said: \"And mindful of\nits distinctive function in the enforcement of constitutional rights, the Court\nhas refused to be bound by any artificial rule or formula which changed condi-\ntions might upset.\"5 It appears that \"fair value\" is still a matter of judgment\nsubject to judicial review.\n\n\"P .

                    "Comment on the Pacific Gas and Electric Case'\n\nIn the December, 1939, issue of the Review there appeared an article which\nconsidered, along with other matters, the significance of the recent decision of the\nSupreme Court of the United States in the Pacific Gas and Electric case? The\nauthors summarize their conclusion in the following words: \"It may be inferred\nthat a majority of the Supreme Court now looks with favor upon the use of\nhistorical cost as the rate-base. No other conclusion is possible in view of the\nfact that the California Commission in this latest case expressly declared its\nadherence to historical cost and that it flatly refused to give any consideration to\nreproduction cost. . . . It seems rather clear that if the reasoning in this case is\nconsistently followed, there will be few, if any, occasions on which a rate order\nbased upon historical cost will be disturbed by the Supreme Court.\"? Since this\ncondusion might be taken to mean that the Supreme Court is at last ready to\nplace its stamp of approval upon the use of historical or original cost in confisca-\ntion cases, the discussion of this important decision should be carried a step\nfurther.\n\nThe question before the Court was not one of confiscation, but of procedure.\n\"As the District Court did not deal with the issue of confiscation and the\nevidence is not before us, we are concerned only with the question of procedural\ndue process, that is, whether the Commission in its procedure, as distinguished\nfrom the effect of its order upon respondent's property rights, failed to satisfy the\nrequirements of the Federal Constitution.\" And the particular procedural point\nin dispute related to the method by which the California Commission arrived at\nits result. The Commission had considered evidence as to cost of reproduction,\nbut in fixing the rate base it had given weight and effect solely to historical cost.\nThe precise issue was whether the refusal of the Commission to give weight to the\ncost of reproduction constituted a denial of procedural due process of law.\n\nThe Court held that the procedure of the Commission did not deny the com-\npany due process. It found that the Commission had duly weighed the evidence\nas to reproduction cost, and had cast it aside as unsatisfactory; but that it had\nnevertheless based its valuation upon ample evidence. \"The Commission was\nentitled to weigh the evidence introduced, whether relating to reproduction cost\nor to other matters. The Commission was entitled to determine the probative\nforce of respondent's estimate. That the Commission did so is apparent from\nboth its statement to that effect and the reasons it gives for considering these\nestimates to be without positive value. . . . Nor did the ruling with respect to the\nweight of evidence as to reproduction cost leave the Commission without\nevidence of the value of respondent's property. We have frequently held that\nhistorical cost is admissible evidence of value. . . . In the instant case we cannot\nsay that the Commission in taking historical cost as the rate base was making a\nfinding without evidence and therefore arbitrary.\"\n\nIn other words, this decision only reiterates a well established principle of pro-\ncedure\u2014namely, that it is essential to examine and give appropriate weight to all\npertinent evidence of value, so that a decision will not be arbitrary.

                    "THE SHORT VIEW AND THE LONG IN ECONOMIC POLICY\n\nPresidential Address Delivered at the Fifty-second Annual Meeting of the American\nEconomic Association, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, December 27, 1939\n\nOnce upon a time an academic economic theorist, by some freak of fate\nnot likely to be often repeated, got himself slightly entangled in the machin-\nety of formulation of government economic policy. What I plan to tell you\ntonight reflects largely, though not I hope too explicitly, what the process\nof policy-formulation did to his academic theorizing, and what his theoriz-\ning failed to do to the process of policy-formulation.\n\nAs an active participant in the policy-making process, the academic\ntheorist suffers from a number of handicaps more or less peculiar to him-\nself. For purposes of teaching, or of acceptable writing for his restricted\naudience of fellow-theorists, his conclusions are of little importance; and\nwhat matters above all is the rigor and elegance of his manner of reaching\nthem. For policy, on the other hand, conclusions are vital, and often are\nall that is vital. For the purposes of academic theorizing, the premises\nthe theorist starts from may without serious penalty be arbitrarily selected,\nnarrowly restricted in range, and purely hypothetical in nature. But the\nselection of premises controls the conclusions reached, and for policy-\ndetermination it is therefore vital that all the important variables be\ncovered by the analysis, and that the conclusions be not affected by the use\nof premises which are irrevelant for their purposes or less realistic than\nit is possible with the aid of available information to make them. To vio-\nlate these rules in policy-making is to be guilty of the grossest irresponsi-\nbility. If he is not to be wholly in the way of the policy-maker, therefore,\nthe theorist must emerge from his ivory tower, \u2014which is almost as hard\nas to return to it.\n\nThe theorist's habitual methods of analysis are such as to lead to \"right\"\nor \"wrong\" answers to manufactured problems, the premises and the\ncriteria of rightness being so chosen as to make this not only possible but\nnecessary. For the policy-maker, however, the problems are for the most\npart not of his own devising, but are presented to him by outside forces,\nin vague and ill-defined fashion, and what he asks of his advisers con-\n\nsists as much of help in determining what the problems are as of help\nin finding solutions for them. The theorist here is likely to find himself\nuninformed and unskilled.\n",

                    "ACHILLES' HEELS IN MONETARY STANDARDS\n\nThe international gold standard fell in an epidemic of Midas' disease but it was at-\ntacked through its own Achilles heel. The attempt to maintain a fixed price for any com-\nmodity which may rise, but not fall, in money value, is, in the long run, all but hopeless.\nImportant paper currencies were stronger than the gold currencies so long as they were\nkept flexible in gold value but they became at least as vulnerable as any gold currency\nwhen a relative fixity of exchange rates was sought and, still more, when a rise in their\ngold value was precluded and a fall regarded with equanimity or deliberately designed. A\nflexible exchange value of a currency, within a not very narrow zone around the \"point of\nequilibrium,\" is essential to forestal] the success of bear speculators and defeat of the\nexchange policy. The vulnerability of a currency to speculative attacks is coeval with other\nweaknesses in any currencies yet adopted. A money with a goods, rather than a gold, reserve\noffers the greatest promise not only of invulnerability but also benefaction.\n\nThe international gold standard has now, for some years, been moribund,\nif not dead. It is true that the United States, in somewhat unconvincing\nfashion, still proclaims its adhesion and allegiance to the royal metal. So\nfar, however, as money is concerned, it is in no better state than China used\nto be when it had a metallic monetary standard (silver), of equal virtue\nwith gold, maintained in isolation from the rest of the world.\n\nFor many decades the allegedly outstanding advantage of the gold stand-\nard was its international character. One or the other (or both) of the great\ninternational currencies, the pound sterling and the dollar, was always\nsynonymous with gold, and adherence to gold therefore meant stable ex-\nchange rates against at least one of these important currencies. With the\ngeneral abandonment of gold standards, the advantage of automatically\nstable exchange rates is now lost except, possibly, for the dollar as against\nthe Belgian franc.' In purchasing power, gold has not, over a lengthy pe-\nriod, been more stable than silver, and it has not been as stable as a well-\nmanaged paper currency. The maintenance of a gold standard which is no\nlonger used in the bulk of international transactions therefore involves\ngold-standard countries, in equa] degree with silver or paper-using nations,\nin the uncertainties of exchange, and, in possibly greater degree, in the un-\ncertainties of price levels. No authentic gold currency, nor any potential\nbloc of such currencies, is likely to take the former or present place of\neither the pound or the dollar in international transactions, so that, while\npresent conditions continue, the dollar or any similar near-gold currency is\nsubject to all the exchange vicissitudes which affect its neighbors. Gold has,\nmoreover, rather less potential stability in real value than of yore. There\nnow seems little reason, therefore, for giving gold a place, of rig^t, in our\nmonetary system.\n\nThe international gold standard fell in an epidemic of Midas' disease\n\n! Exchange rates are, of course, a two-sided matter and no stability of any one cur-\nrency, in gold value or anything similar, will now, of itself, provide stability in the rate\nof exchange against other currencies. The Belgian currency, however, is, rather uncertainly,\ntied to gold; and the dollar-belga rate is substantially stable.\n",

                    "MONOPOLY ELEMENTS IN RENT\n\nThe concept of land ownership as a monopoly is old, but it reappears in new and\naltered form in Professor Edward Chamberlin's theory that urban rent is a purely\nmonopoly income, while agricultural rent is purely competitive. This theory, based on a\nconfusion of the markets for re/a/] goods and agricultural products, on the one hand,\nand the markets for retail sites and farm lands, on the other, seems definitely invalid.\nThe markets for both retail sites and farm lands are imperfectly competitive; and the\nrent, in both cases, is an imperfectly competitive return.\n\nLand ownership has often been referred to as a monopoly. Adam Smith's\nwell known dictum that \"the rent of land . . . is naturally a monopoly\nprice\" was followed, in some cases with modifications, by Malthus, Senior,\nJ. S. Mill, Henry George, and by a few recent economists. This doctrine\nhas not hitherto met general acceptance, but Professor Chamberlin has\nrecently given it new prestige in his TPeory of Monopolistic Competition\nin which he has formulated the novel theory, that while agricultural rent\nis a purely competitive return, urban rent is a \"pure monopoly return.\"\n\nProfessor Chamberlin finds many differences between agricultural land\nand urban land, and between agricultural rent and urban rent. He contends\nthat a business site confers no advantages analogous to superior fertility in\nagricultural rent; that one site \"is capable of Producing as large a quantity\nof retailing services as another\u2014there are no differences in fertility and no\nscarcity whatever of the best land in this respect\"; that marginal and sub-\nmarginal land anywhere\u2014 practically free land\u2014is as \"fertile for selling\nputposes\" as the best shopping site in New York City. Urban rent, which\nis entirely location rent, is quite different even from location rent of farm\nland; for the location rent of farm land is due to differences in the cost of\ntransportation to the market, but the urban land \"carries its market with it.\"\nThe market for agricultural products is purely competitive, allowance being\nmade for differences in transportation costs; there are many buyers and\nsellers, as required for pure competition, and any seller can dispose of an\nindefinitely large amount of product at the prevailing price. \"The retail\nmarket, on the other hand, contains monopoly elements, for the factor of\nconvenience differentiates the product spatially.\" Since buyers do not move\nabout with entire freedom, the owner of any particularly convenient site,\naccording to Professor Chamberlin, has a monopoly of the use of the site,\nand receives a monopoly rent. His site affords a market which is, to a degree,\ndistinct from the whole; and the amount of product he can dispose of at\nthe prevailing price is not indefinitely large\u2014as in pure competition.\n\nIt is not difficult to agree with much of Professor Chamberlin's argument.\nIt is quite true that the advantages afforded by good business sites are dif-\nferent in some respects from those afforded by good land; that low-rent sites\n\n\"Third ed., pp. 112, 113, and Appendix D. Professor Chamberlin considers only the\nrent of agricultural land and of urban land devoted to retailing.\n",

The Report of the Committee on National Debt and\nTaxation (1927), the Economics of Taxation. (1924) by Harry Gunnison Brown, and\nFirst Principles of Public Finance (1936) translation, by de Viti de Marco, are among the\nnoteworthy exceptions. \u00c0merican writers in public finance generally have emphasized the\ndescriptive aspects of particular death duties.\n\nNo less than four different conclusions of death duty incidence may be distinguished.\nThese vary from the view that death duties are without burden, provided that substantially\nthe whole of the estate is taken by such taxation, to conclusions that the incidence of death\ntaxes is on the predecessor, the successor, or jointly, and in indeterminate proportions upon\nboth the predecessor and the successor.\n\nThe view of incidence which it is believed may be most strongly supported is that the\nburden of death duties, including taxes directed to the estate as a whole as well as the\ndistributive shares, is upon the predecessors. Incidence from this point of view is inter-\npreted with reference to the immediate burden of such taxation, and is distinguished from\nthe subsequent economic and other effects which result therefrom.\n\nAlthough of ancient origin! and of major fiscal importance in the\nmodern economy, there has been rather limited consideration, on the\nwhole, of the problems of death-duty incidence and economic effects.?\nAn important exception is found, however, in the investigation of the\nCommittee on National Debt and Taxation, which directed no small part\nof its attention toward these aspects of the British estate, legacy, and suc-\ncession taxes. Customary discussions, particularly in American fiscal lit-\nerature, have established emphasis on the descriptive features of operative\nestate and inheritance taxes. While the usefulness of this approach is not\nto be minimized, it is contended that the importance of death duty inci-\ndence, with its economic repercussions, justifies more than the casual treat-\nment, apparently, so far accorded.\n\nIn the discussion of the incidence of death duties it will be assumed\nthat taxes imposed on or measured by the value of an estate subsequent\n\n!See Max West, The Inheritance Tax (New York, Columbia Univ.

                    "DIVISION OF THE TAX BURDEN AMONG INCOME GROUPS\nIN THE UNITED STATES IN 1936\n\nRecent statistical studies of the tax payments of members of different income groups\n(Twentieth Century Fund) and of the numbers of persons in those groups (National Re-\nsources Committee) now make possible calculations of the actual distribution of the tax\nburden in the United States with a fair degree of accuracy. Allowance must be made for\nvarious possibilities in the shifting of indirect taxes and for differences in the tax systems of\ndifferent states. That fortunate few (1.4 per cent) whose incomes exceeded $7,500 paid\none-third of the nation's taxes. An analysis by taxing divisions shows the median income for\ndividing the tax burden equally above and below was $2,600 for the nation as a whole,\n$2,000 for state and local taxes (Illinois), and $15,000 for federal taxes. The lower income\ngroups paid a higher percentage of the tax burden than the percentage of the national\nincome which they received,\n\nThe questions of who pays our taxes and who should pay them are peren-\nnial. Economists have long discussed the question of tax shifting to explain\nwhy certain taxes are or are not a burden upon the immediate payers thereof.\nThe reasoning has been largely a priori and only in the past few years have\nstatistical investigations been made. To correlate one of those studies with\nrecent findings on income distribution and draw further conclusions is the\npurpose of this paper.\n\nIn Facing tbe Tax Problem and Studies in Current Tax Problems the\nTwentieth Century Fund (hereafter: TCF) has published the results of an\nextensive investigation into the tax burden of ten \"typical\" representative\nfamilies of different income classes.* Separate calculations were made under\nfive different shifting hypotheses. Federal, state, and local taxes as of 1936\nwere analyzed to determine their probable incidence on the families selected.\nAs a result of extensive computations, Professor Newcomer and her asso-\nciates under the Fund derived conclusions regarding the total tax burden\nper family. The findings were expressed both in terms of dollars and as\npercentages of total incomes that would have been received had no taxes\nbeen shifted.\n\nValuable as this study is, it does not afford an answer to the question,\n\"What percentage of the total tax burden of the country is borne by the\npeople of different income classes considered as groups?\" Wealthy people\noften allege that they are paying most of the cost of government. Occasion-\nally they change their tune and try to arouse popular disapproval of gov-\nernment spending by claiming that all taxes are shifted to ultimate con-\nsumers and that therefore the poor, being the most numerous, shoulder\nthe tax burden of the country.\n\nLegislators are also interested in this question. It is not enough for them\nto know the TCF estimate that the man with a $1,000 income pays ap-\nproximately 10 per cent of his income in direct and hidden taxes and that\nthe $5,000 man pays 20 per cent. They should also know how much of the\n\n! New York, 1937.\n",

                    "CONCENTRATION OF JOINT-STOCK ENTERPRISE\nIN ITALY\n\nIn terms of absolute and relative proprietorship, joint-stock company enterprise appears\nto have become increasingly important in the Italian economy since 1914. More significant\nis a marked concentration of corporate wealth. In 1922 the 100 largest non-financial\ncorporations owned less than a third of all non-financial corporate assets; by 1936 the\n100 largest firms owned almost half of such assets. The trend toward concentration has\nbeen even more pronounced in the field of banking. It is to be noted, however, that\npolitica] centralization of economic controls in recent years has come to overshadow the\nsignificance of authority resting on formal ownership.\n\nIn one of his leading speeches on the Fascist Corporate State, Premier\nBenito Mussolini undertook to give his listeners \"a broad outline of the\nhistory of capitalism during the past century.\"* This required a definition:\nCapitalism . .. is a specific mode of production, a system of industrial produc-\ntion. Capitalism in its most highly developed form is a mode of mass\n\nproduction for mass consumption, financed in mass through the national and\ninternational issue of joint-stock capital.\n\n\"The touchstone of \"advanced capitalism,\" then, is large-scale industrial\nand financial joint-stock enterprise. In the course of his address, the Duce\nasked: \"Is Italy a capitalistic country?\" and replied:\n\nIf by capitalism is meant that complex of usages, customs, technical progress\nnow common to all countries, we can say that Italy too is a capitalistic country.\nBut if we go more deeply into the matter and examine the situation from a\nstatistical standpoint . . . we then secure data that enable us to say that Italy is\nnot a capitalistic nation in the current sense of the word.\n\nHe cited statistics on the economic structure of the Italian population, in-\ndicating a zmerical predominance of agricultural and small industrial\nenterprises. \"You see at once from this survey how varied and complex is\nthe Italian economy, and why it cannot be identified with any one type;\nespecially so as the 523,000 manufacturers are almost all at the head of\nsmall or medium-sized concerns.\" That is, in Mussolini's opinion Italy is\nnot \"capitalistic\" because small-scale (and presumably non-corporate)\nenterprise is numerically outstanding in its business-industrial system.\n\nUnfortunately, the paucity of data on national wealth and income\u2014\nand, furthermore, on the employment and production of corporate and\nnon-corporate enterprises\u2014makes it difficult to throw a direct and com-\npletely revealing light on the significance of joint-stock companies in the\nItalian economy.? The available information, however, indicates that large-\nscale corporate enterprise is by no means unimportant. Certainly, in\n\n!Speech to the National Council of Corporations, November 14, 1933. See Benito\nMussolini, Tbe Corporate State, Florence, 1936, pp. 11, 18-19.\n\n\"The terms \"corporate\" and \"corporation\" are herein used as equivalent to \"joint-\n\nstock\" and \"joint-stock company,\" not in their current Italian usage with reference to\ncertain fascist institutions.\n",

                    "THE RELATION OF AMERICAN FOREIGN-TRADE POLICY\nTO NEW DEAL DOMESTIC POLICY\n\nPaper presented at a Round Table Conference of the American Economic Association,\nDecember 27, 1939.\n\nThe comparison of American foreign-trade policy and New Deal domestic policy is\nonly superficially a question of economic policy in the narrow sense. Economists tend to\napproach these problems as if they were questions of trade barriers in the international\nfield and of price rigidity and monopolistic tendencies in the domestic field. Essentially\nautarchic tendencies in foreign trade and monopolistic tendencies in domestic markets are\npolitical responses to a shift in the social framework of the market. Traditional economics\ntends to assume the constancy of this social framework, and then proceeds to a refinement\nof its analysis within the postulated constancy. Present problems arise because the frame-\nwork of custom, values and law is shifting. Economics has become increasingly exact in its\nformulations, and at the same time increasingly irrelevant to the social process it claims to\nstudy. The essential problems today are: Is the social framework still a constant? and if\nnot, what difference does it make in the discussion of relevant policy? Until these questions\nare explicitly faced, divergent policies in international] and domestic markets will be argued\nwith heat but without light, because the traditional postulate of the economist\u2014the con-\nstancy of the social framework\u2014eliminates the area in which the real problems arise.\n\nA discussion of the relation of. American foreign-trade policy to New\nDeal domestic policy must be based upon a clear understanding of the\nnature of the two policies which are in comparison.\n\nThere is little difficulty in a statement of our present foreign-trade\npolicy.' Essentially it is designed to broaden trade by a process of negotia-\ntion of trade agreements with other countries to reduce trade barriers. The\nobjectives are both economic and political. No discussion of the economic\nobjectives is required before an audience of professional economists\u2014there\nis no proposal in the field of economic policy for which so nearly unani-\nmous support can be found in the profession. The political objective\u2014\nthe development of an atmosphere in international relations in which\npeaceful intercourse between nations becomes somewhat more probable\nor possible\u2014is open to more serious doubt. Few will question the objective\nitself; but qualified students of international relations might well wonder\nwhether an expansion of international economic intercourse which was not\naccompanied by a strengthening of the international political and juridical\nframework in which the trade relations will develop, might not rather\neasily promote a variety of international contact that might lead to inter-\nnational conflict, if no provisions were made at the same time for mech-\nanisms and institutions of adjustment which would render such conflict\nharmless from the standpoint of the preservation of peace. Mr. Raymond\nMoley defined \"the twin objectives of the New Deal\" as \"the application\nof intelligence and goodwill to the solution of our domestic problems, and\nthe avoidance of foreign entanglements.\"?

            "found": "'This paper is concerned with the economic effects, upon the economy as a whole, of\nestablishing a uniform minimum wage. The system under consideration is a closed economy\noperating at less than full employment and with imperfections both in the factor markets\nand in the commodity markets. Under these conditions, a minimum wage is likely to in-\ncrease the economy's propensity to consume. Whether the total volume of employment will,\non balance, be maintained, diminished, or increased depends upon whether the increase in\neffective demand flowing from the heightened propensity to consume equals the decrease in\neffective demand caused by factors whose influence is adverse. It seems probable that the\nestablishment of a moderate minimum wage would create more consequences favorable to\nthe maintenance of the level of employment than unfavorable. Though price advances may\nresult, the real income of the persons covered by the legislation will be raised. Whether\nthe real incomes of other members of society will be altered is difficult to foretell, the result\ndepending upon the extent of the price changes and upon whether or not the level of\nemployment is maintained.\n\nMost books and articles dealing with the subject of minimum wages are\ndescriptive or argumentative works concerned chiefly with some specific\nlegislative act. In addition to works of these types there are several in\nwhich some attempt is made to give a theoretical explanation, of more or\nless general applicability, of the economic effects of minimum wages.\n\"There is neither space nor necessity for detailed criticism of this literature,\nand it will suffice to indicate the reasons for believing that further study\nof the subject is necessary:\n\n(1) Until very recent years, almost all theoretical discussions of wages\nand employment have been founded, consciously or otherwise, upon as-\nsumed conditions of perfect competition and full employment. The use of\nthis hypothesis is entirely valid, provided its implications are thoroughly\nunderstood and the limitations they impose squarely faced. But failure to\ndistinguish clearly between this analytical model and the real world has\ntoo often led writers to content themselves with making casual statements\nabout the effect of minimum wages upon \"cost\" and equally uncompre-\nhensive declarations about the consequences of changes in cost.?

                    "Aside from discussions over technical aspects of theory, economists as social scientists\nhave always been concerned with public questions of their day. Although the wages fund\nis mainly of historical interest in economic theory, it has generally been supposed that it\nrepresented a subject on which professional economists made a contribution to public\nopinion of mid-nineteenth century England. Study of the views of a great variety of\nindividuals as presented in reports of a British Royal Commission in 1867-68 indicates\nthat the discouraging conclusions of economists on the success or justice of trade-union\naction to raise wages were not widely known. Individuals and groups to whose interest\nsuch professional opinion would have been favorable were not familiar with it. John\nStuart Mill, a prominent public figure at the time and a wages-fund theorist, has been\nthought to have relaxed the severity of his conclusions in later years, but examination\nshows that he did not give up the basic concept of the theory.\n\nIt is tradition that during the middle years of the nineteenth century the\ntheoretical views of economists were popularly applied by the British\npublic to the efforts of trade unions to raise wages. The generally ac-\ncepted wage theory at the time was that known today as the \"wages fund.\"\nWages were supposed to have been paid from a fund of capital in the\nhands of the capitalist-employer. For a given period of time, a year for\nexample, the size of this fund was fixed. It was a corollary of this proposi-\ntion which was applied to oppose trade-union action dealing with wages.\nIf one group of workers increased its share by pressure of a strike, some\nother group of workers somewhere would have to take less; only a certain\ntotal amount was available for wage-carners. In the history of the de-\nvelopment of economic theory it has been represented that this theoretical\nargument of the ranking economists was used by the general public or\n\"informed middle-class opinion\"! to demonstrate the futility or inequity of\nstrike action over wages. The theoretical views of economists were sup-\nposed to have given this lead to popular thought. Examination of evidence\navailable shows that these theoretical arguments of economists were not\nwidely known to the general public, and were practically unknown to\ngroups with an immediate interest in a wages economy.\n\nRicardian economics is the basis for the wages-fund theory, but John\nStuart Mill is considered to have given it the most concise and generally\naccepted expression in his Principles of Political Economy, first published\nin 1848. His much-heralded \"recantation\" of the theory in 1869 is con-\nsidered to mark its d\u00e9nouement. Cairnes's reassertion of the doctrine and\nits implications for trade-union activities in 1874 is looked upon as a dying\ngasp. It was during the middle years of the century, corresponding to the\nperiod of Mill's pre\u00e9minence as an economist, that the general public is\nsupposed to have been most interested in the economists' theoretical views\non wages. By a study of the writings of economic theorists of the period\n\n! Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Industrial Democracy, London, 1897, pp. 615 ff.\n",

Checks deposited for credit to an account ordinarily require\nfrom one to several days before the amounts involved become collected balances.\nThis is well understood by all business-men with whom I am familiar, and the\nbanks in this part of the country at least seem to make frequent analyses of ac-\ncounts in order to assure themselves that checks are not being drawn against\nuncollected balances.\n\nIt occurs to me that the authors of the article in question would have avoided\nwhat appears to be a serious error in their deductions if they had known more\nabout the credits to the business firm's bank account which is shown in connection\nwith their article. I suggest that those credits, especially some of those involving\neven amounts and fairly substantial sums, may represent deposits of the proceeds\nof borrowed funds or cash obtained from some other source. In any event, I am\nquite sure that few banks today will permit substantial drafts against uncollected\nbalances.\n\nIf my knowledge of the existing situation is correct, the so-called \"neglected\ncomponent\" must be quite negligible in total amount, and therefore it should\nperhaps remain a \"neglected component\" in so far as students of monetary\ntheory are concerned.\n\nE.

                    "Mill on Machinery\n\nIt is commonly thought that John Stuart Mill had serious doubts about the\nsocial benefits of machinery because of the oft-quoted passage in his Principles\nof Political Economy: \"Hitherto (1848) it is questionable if all the mechanical\ninventions yet made have lightened the day's toil of any human being.'\"*\n\nCiting and apparently commending this statement, Karl Marx goes on to say\nthat the capitalistic application of machinery is not for the benefit of the laborer,\nbut merely to lengthen the portion of his time which he gives without an equiva-\nlent, to the capitalist and, therefore, it is but \"a means for producing surplus\nvalue.\"? Many other illustrations could be given of similar misunderstanding of\n\n* Book IV, ch. vi, sec. 2.\n* Capital, vol. i, part i, ch. xv, sec. 1.\n",

It is a task which I do not approach with the calm cheerfulness\ndisplayed by little Johnny who was busy with pencil and paper when his\nmother asked, \"What are you drawing, son?\" \"I am drawing a picture of\nGod, mother.\" \"But,\" objected mother, \"no one knows what God looks\nlike.\" To this came the reply, \"Well, they will when I get through.\"\n\nI doubt whether any one knows what the government's defense fiscal\npolicy is; nor is any one wise enough to know for sure what it should be.\nWhat is said, therefore, in this article must be regarded as a tentative\nattempt at explanation and evaluation. That such attempts should be made\nin a democracy is of first importance, provided that they are made in the\nproper spirit, even though the outsider does not have the data for discussing\nthese subjects that the people actually in Washington have. It is possible,\nhowever, that the outsider has one small advantage. Most of the Wash-\nington experts are engrossed in jobs which, though important, are never-\ntheless only cogs in a very large machine. There seem to be few persons, if\nany, in Washington charged with the duty of taking an over-all view of the\neconomics of the defense program and planning and integrating wise\npolicies. The outsider, as the phrase goes, is less likely to be unable to see\nthe forest because of preoccupation with some of the trees.\n\nA few things need to be said by way of preamble. First, discussion and\nappraisal of fiscal policy are considerably complicated by the peculiar status\nin which the United States is and has been for several months. The con-\ndition has not been one of legal war but it has certainly not been one\nconsistent with what is commonly described as peace. In the past, fiscal\nactivity has been judged on the basis of peacetime Treasury operations\non the one hand and wartime Treasury operations on the other. For\nsome months past, the United States has been in the position of be-\ning economically at war and legally at peace. This condition has made\nboth the administration and the interpretation of fiscal policies rather\ndifficult.\n\nSecond, there is a dictum that has been ascribed to various military lead-\ners which is, \"Three things are necessary to the conduct of a war. They are\nmoney, money, and more money.\" As every economist knows, this state-\nment is true only in a very special sense. An army does not throw dollars\nat an enemy. I venture the suggestion that there are seven m's that are\n",

Even more significantly, they\nwere able to discriminate between various possible sources of supply, re-\nducing their imports from certain countries and expanding them from other\ncountries.

                    "HOUSING POLICY AND THE DEFENSE PROGRAM\n\nThe increasing expansion of the armament program has been accom-\npanied by a considerable upswing of residential construction in almost all\npatts of the country and it is easy to understand that all those sectors of the\nbusiness world whose interests are favored by brisk building activity are\nenjoying the prospect of a forthcoming building boom. This is true of\natchitects and contractors of all types, of the producers and sellers of build-\ning material, and of real estate agents and credit institutions engaged on\nfinancing residential construction and real estate transactions. Also the\nfederal agencies which can claim the merit of having substantially contrib-\nuted toward improving our mortgage system\u2014the Federal Housing Ad-\nministration and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board with its affiliated\ninstitutions\u2014appear to be favorably impressed by the present state of\nbuilding activity, and so far no sufficient consideration appears to have\nbeen given to the question whether this attitude is fully justified. The fact\nis, however, that serious arguments can be advanced in favor of a govern-\nmental policy designed to prevent a building boom from developing.\n\nA somewhat closer examination of the present conditions of the housing\nmarket shows that the initial period of rapidly increasing production for\narmament purposes was preceded by a substantial recovery of residential\nconstruction. After the last building boom had spent itself in 1930, building\nactivity remained stagnant for several years and was very slow in expand-\ning. Between 1925 and 1930 a considerable oversupply of dwelling units\nin relation to effective demand for housing had been accumulated; and no\nbrisk building activity could be expected to take place until this over-\nsupply had been absorbed, and this process lasted until 1938. Even sub-\nsequently, when shortages of dwelling units were slowly developing in\ncertain areas, expansion of building activity was still checked by a con-\nsiderable overhang of real estate repossessed by lending institutions as a\nresult of the large volume of foreclosures which had been the heritage\nof the collapse of the mortgage market in 1931 and 1932.\n\nWhereas an annual supply of approximately 450,000 dwelling units\ncan be assumed to correspond to the effective demand which results from\nnormal replacements and increases in the number of families, the number\nof dwelling units started in 1938 was still considerably below this figure; it\namounted to 347,000 in all non-farm areas of the United States. Residential\nconstruction assumed a more \"normal\" development in 1939 when 465,000\ndwelling units were added to the existing stock. In 1940 also private con-\nstruction was just sufficient to cover the normal increase in demand. It\n",

The importance of this formal solution to a program of recon-\nstruction depends upon the degree of approximation of the underlying assump-\ntions to the realities of economic life. The mathematical or logical analysis of\neconomic relations is essentially a static approach. It achieves its solution by\nmaking extremely simple assumptions the logical implications of which are then\nworked out as a theoretical exposition of the possible and \"ideal\" results of the\nassumptions. Perfect competition is the ideal for the maximization of income. A\nplanning board could achieve this result by utilizing the parametric function\nof prices if the assumptions underlying the theory of perfect competition actually\nexisted. But why would a planning board be necessary under such circumstances ?\n\nWhen conditions of imperfect and monopolistic competition, with all the\ncomplexities they present in real life, are encountered, the possibility of using\nthe parametric function breaks down. Prices can no longer be treated \"as if^\nbecause prices are no longer data to which adjustment can be made. The prices\nare part of the adjustment process. The guides of competitive price theory lose\ntheir force because the conditions have been removed, by technical as well as\ninstitutional factors. As competitive forces recede, it becomes increasingly difficult\nto maximize income, and it is impossible to do so under total monoply. Central-\nized planning, by controlling production completely, is faced with the necessity\nof solving a monopoly and not a competitive problem; yet the technique to be\nemployed is based upon competitive theory. The theoretical solution is too simple\nfor a working model of a world that insists upon becoming more complex all the\ntime. Professor Lange wisely removed Professor Chamberlin and Mrs. Robinson\nfrom positions under socialism; they present too many disconcerting obstacles.\n\nProfessor Landauer disagrees with my contention that a universal theory is\nimpossible. This difference seems to turn on our concepts of theory and science.\nIf theory is merely formal logic, then the validity of the results depends upon\nthe validity of the assumptions made. The solution is for mathematicians and\nlogicians, not economists. The use of economic terminology in the assumptions\ndoes not give us any more information about the nature of phenomena we are\ntrying to deal with than is contained in the assumptions themselves. Of course\nmathematica] technique may be an invaluable aid at times, but there are many\nother factors not amenable to it which must be included. Unfortunately, pure\ntheory and empiricism cannot be categorically separated if we are to solve\nproblems of the world in which we live. It may be desirable to avoid confusion\nof methods, but at least we are in sad need of fuor.\n\nPure theory is based upon a strictly mechanistic concept of science. Even within\nthis framework little progress has been made toward the development of\ndynamic theory. But economics is a socia] science and its concept of dynamics\ncannot be confined to the mechanistic. Social processes are evolutionary and\neconomic activity is part of them.

                    "Economic Rent: In What Sense a Surplus?\n\nStudents of economics have long been handicapped by the fact that many of its\nterms are used, by various economists, in widely different senses. Even when a\nterm seems to have acquired a clear and definite and generally accepted meaning\nin the craft of the economists, there is no guarantee that innovators will not\nadopt a new meaning for it and be extensively imitated.\n\nIt has been so with the word \"rent\" which, to the classical economists, meant\nrent of land but which, about the turn of the century, began to be applied to the\nyield of produced capital. As the then \"modern\" and \"up-to-date\" economists of\nabout the year 1900 began to blur the distinction between land and produced\ncapital and between the income from the one and from the other, and to follow\nthe man in the street in using the term \"rent\" for both, it was still possible for\nthose of us of a different point of view to make ourselves clear by referring to\n\"economic rent.\" By using the modifying word \"economic,\" we could still make\nclear that we were referring to the yield of land as such, Z.e., of land in the\nstrict economic sense, exclusive of improvements made by an owner or tenant iz\nit as well as o7 it.\n\nBut now it begins to look as if even this privilege is to be denied us and as if\nonce more the very terms by which we have tried to emphasize a distinction we\nhave considered important are to be appropriated and turned to other purposes\nby economists who have no sympathy with us. Indicative of this apparent trend is\nthe recent book by Professor Kenneth E. Boulding of Colgate University, entitled\nEconomic Analysis 'To Professor Boulding, economic rent is not just the yield\nof land ownership\u2014indeed, he seems to feel that much of this yield is not even\nto be included in it\u2014but rather is \"any payment to a unit of a factor of production\nin an industry in equilibrium, which is in excess of the minimum amount necessary\nto keep that factor 7z its presen occtipation.\"?\n\nProfessor Boulding makes it very clear that he regards wages as, in part, eco-\nnomic rent. Many workers would stay in the particular line of work they are in,\neven at appreciably lower wages than they now receive, and the excess over the\namount necessary to keep them in that particular line is economic rent. Boulding\nillustrates by reference to the occupation of weaving, in which, at $20 a week,\nhe supposes 1,000 willing to work, each extra dollar per week increasing by 100\nthe number of men \"willing to work at weaving.\"? \u00c1nd, according to Professor\nBoulding: \"The higher the wage, the greater will be the economic rent received\nby all those workers who would be willing to work at a lower wage, and the\ngreater will be the economic rent received by all workers.\"4\n\n!

                    "Professor Whittaker on Indifference Curves: A Rejoinder\n\nIn the September, 1941, number of this Review (pp. 569-70), Mr. Arthur\nKemp drew attention to the treatment given to indifference curves in my book, A4\nHistory of Economic ldeas, raising the possibility that readers may conclude\nthat the early curves of Alfred Marshall, in his work, entitled Te Pure Theory\nof Foreign Trade and Tbe Pure Theory of Domestic Values, are identical with\nthose constructed more recently by members of the Paretian school, such as Hicks.\nOf course this would be incorrect and I am grateful to Mr. Kemp for men-\ntioning the matter. The Pareto-Hicks indifference curve goes back to Edge-\nworth's Mathematical Psycbics (1881), though Irving Fisher, in his Ma/Pe-\nmatical Investigations in tbe Tbeory of Value and Prices (1892), claimed inde-\npendent discovery and took a position more nearly that of the Paretians than did\nEdgeworth. What I had ia mind in arranging this section of my book was the\nelaboration of the Paretian indifference curve concept, applied in Marshall's\nproblems of international trade, in Edgeworth's article on \"The Pure Theory of\nInternational Values\" (Econ. Jour., 1894), and that by W. E. Johnson on \"The\nPure Theory of Utility Curves\" (Econ. Jour., 1913) ; but probably it would have\nbeen better to confine the name \"indifference curve\" to the Paretian line of\nequal utility and employ some other designation for Marshall's curve. However,\nthere appear to be certain confusions in Mr. Kemp's statement which it may be\nwell to clear up.\n\nIf the Marshallian graph reproduced in my book be compared with, let us say,\nFigure 1 of Hicks's Value and Capital it is evident that, superficially at all\nevents, different topics are dealt with. Marshall was examining the market be-\ntween two trading groups, Hicks the choice of an individual between two com-\nmodities. But, as each of Marshall's groups was supposed to enter the market\npossessing the entire supply of a single commodity and to endeavor to bargain\n\n! Value and. Capital, p. 15.\n",

That point is that, under\ncertain conditions, a monopolist faced with increasing labor costs might find it\nmore profitable to increase rather than decrease employment.\n\nThe conditions under which this is likely to obtain are (1) that the demand\nschedule for the monopolist's product is more elastic in the lower-price ranges\nthan in the higher-price ranges, and (2) that before wages are raised the\nmonopolist is operating at less than full plant capacity, so that multiple shift\noperations may be introduced. In such a situation, cutting the work week while\nhourly rates were raised would force the monopolist to re-determine his output.\nGiven a demand of sufficient elasticity along its lower reach, the monopolist\nmight find it to his advantage to operate two (or more) rather than a single\nshift. Thus, employment and output would be increased and unit prices would\nfall.\n\nMr. Mosak argues that my view is in error because, if an increase in produc-\ntion would result in larger profits zfter wages are increased, a similar increase\nwould surely have resulted in even greater profits before wages were raised.\nTherefore, if his goal was the maximization of profits, the monopolist should\nhave increased both production and employment without any regard to wage\nchanges. In Mr. Mosak's words, \"if a bigger output is more profitable after the\nincrease, it must have been all the more so before the wage increase.\" This criti-\ncism is not 2 propos. My argument is that, after wages were raised, a bigger out-\nput might yield a greater profit than a smaller output\u2014or vice versa; but under\neither circumstance, after wages were raised, profits would be smaller tban before\ntbe wages were raised. This position, I believe, does not involve the error Mr.\n\nMosak accuses me of having committed.\nQmN IE V (^ QrTEDINI\n",

                    "Labor Productivity in Tire Manufacturing:\nA Reply to L. G. Reynolds\n\nIn his review of The Productivity of Labor in tbe Rubber Tire Manufacturing\nIndustry in this Review (June, 1941, p. 415), Mr. Reynolds made several state-\nments which require a reply.\n\nHe said, \"The conclusion that \"unstable conditions in labor relations have been\nin large measure responsible for the reduced rate of productivity increase since\n1933' (p. 181) is not supported by adequate evidence.\" The paragraph from\nwhich this statement, torn from its context, was quoted appears on pages 180\nand 181 in the chapter entitled \"Summary and Conclusions.\" The evidence in\nsupport of the statement quoted by Mr. Reynolds is to be found principally on\npages 106-21 and 172-75. It includes an account of the effects upon the industry\nof section 7A of the N.R.A.; of the A.F. of L. and the C.I.O. organization drives;\nand of the spectacular increase in the number and severity of labor disputes. The\ndiscussions relating to such matters as the controversies over \"majority rule,\" the\n\"union shop,\" the \"speed-up,\" and the movement toward decentralization afford\nadditional evidence. Numerous references have been cited to industrial, union\nand governmental sources of information concerning these topics.\n\nMr. Reynolds said, \"The discussion of the distribution of the gains from in-\ncreased productivity . . . exhibits theoretical confusion at several points. The\nstatement that money wages in a particular industry \"normally reflect changes\nin productivity,' and that 'the marked upward trend of wages in the tire industry\nis largely explainable in terms of increasing labor productivity (p. 144) applies\nto a particular industry propositions which are true only of the economy as a\nwhole, and moreover confuses marginal with average productivity.\"\n\nI see no reason why the fact that the above statements are true for the economy\nas a whole should preclude their application to a particular industry. The evidence\nwhich I have been able to assemble suggests that both generalizations are true\nof the tire industry. Although the data are much too lengthy to present here\nthey may be summarized as follows:\n\n1. The trends in the average productivity series and in the wages series are\nsimilar.\n\n2. The plants with the highest productivity tend also to pay the highest wages.?\n\n3. \"The various incentive wage systems in use in the industry establish definite\nrelationships between individual earnings and individual output.?\n\nIt has not been contended that these conditions exist without exception. Several\nother factors such as the extent and character of union organization, cyclical\n\ninfluences, and institutional changes have been discussed in relation to their\neffects upon wages. But it is my belief that the evidence substantiates the state-\nments quoted by Mr. Reynolds.\n\nMr. Reynolds' charge that my work confuses marginal with average productivity\nseems to me to be particularly unfounded. In the section of chapter I on MetPods\nand Procedures (pp. 21-24), special pains were taken to prevent any reader\nfrom falling into this error. Moreover, the paragraph immediately following\nthe statements citicized by Mr. Reynolds for confusing marginal with average\nproductivity re\u00e9mphasizes the distinction as follows: \"It should be noted again\nthat the productivity measures used in this study represent changes in physical\n\n*!

We refer to his Deutscher Sozialismus,\npublished about a year and a half after Hitler's advent to power and made\navailable to the English-reading public several years later under the innocent\ntitle, 4 New Social Philosophy? 'There is some danger that in the heat of\nour conflict with German fascism, a conflict which will endure for some\ntime, whatever precise form it may take, Sombart's notable contributions\nwill be obscured and repudiated. Particularly will this be so if we assume\nthat in a spirit of moral abnegation he surrendered to the newly risen\npower in his country.\n\nIt is not the primary purpose of this paper to investigate the subjective\npremises behind his apparent surrender to fascism. It is necessary, never-\ntheless, to examine briefly the hypothesis that Sombart \"sold out,\" partly\nthat no unjust stigma may be attached to an important figure, but more\nparticularly in order to justify our examination of his work as a social\nscientist. With respect to the latter, it is clear that the work of a man lack-\ning in courage and integrity contains no significant continuity, except the\ncontinuity of opportunism; and that is hardly the premise for interesting\nimplications, unless it be the repudiation of opportunism.\n\nIt is my belief that Sombart did not so much surrender to National\nSocialism as espouse it. This judgment is premised upon the following\nconsiderations: (1) the courage and independence manifested by Sombart\nthrough a large part of his career; (2) his allegiance to certain vital aspects\nof his plan of a National Socialist constitution of society for a number of\nyears prior to Hitler's advent to power; (3) certain fundamental social out-\nlooks and qualities of temperament which characterized the man through-\nout his life.\n\nFor a period of at least two decades Sombart avowed himself a Marxian,\nin the face of obviously great hindrance to his academic advancement. De-\nspite spectacular success as a lecturer and notable scholarly achievements,\nSombart was confined for fifteen years to the lowest professorial rank at the\nprovincial university of Breslau. In 1905, several years after the appear-\nance of the first edition of Der Moderne Kapitalismus, he was called to a\nprofessorship in Berlin, not to the University of Berlin, but to the College\nof Commerce (Handelshochschule).

This would be a powerful factor in\nlimiting, and offsetting, depressions, not only because it would prevent any\nfall in the price level in the raw material sector but because it would\nsustain production in that sector and put new money into circulation, in\nacquisition of goods for the reserve, which could only be brought to bear\non the purchase of other goods. If, on the other hand, a purely inflationary\nboom were imminent, the resulting redemption of currency, in commodity\nunits at the established price, would operate, both by increasing the im-\nmediate supply of goods and by reducing the supply of money, to stifle\nthe menace.

                    "ECONOMIC RESEARCH IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\nI\n\nIn view of the great number and wide variety of contributions of gov-\nernment to economic research and the consequent breadth of my subject,\nit might be appropriate to begin with a careful delimitation of it. Unfor-\ntunately, economic research is a peculiarly difficult thing to define. More-\nover, the difficulties are far greater in the case of government, and I believe\nin that of business, than they are for a research institution or even a uni-\nversity.\n\nIt has been frequently suggested that a running inventory should be\nmaintained of research projects under way in government. If well done,\nsuch an inventory might be a very useful \"clearing house.\" But to be useful\nit would have to be done with discrimination. Otherwise, it would be\nbogged down with a host of undertakings of little consequence and little\nrelevance. Such undertakings are vastly more numerous than research proj-\nects which promise to be of material value.\n\nLet me illustrate some of the problems of defining economic rescarch\nin government which such a running inventory would meet. A cabinet\nofficer or other high executive desires information on the best way to\nfinance new industrial facilities to support the defense program. He asks\nfor a confidential memorandum. Or perhaps this government executive\nplans to make a speech on the subject of industrial facility financing and\nasks to have a draft prepared for him. Or again one of his correspondents\nhas inquired about this subject, and he requests a draft reply. In each case\nthe government employee of whom the executive makes his request is\nseeking to give the best answer he can to a question which most of us\ntoday would regard as definitely in the realm of economics.

The total cost of light-draft waterway transportation to shippers,\nplus the costs imputable to the federal government, are less than the rates\ncharged shippers for equivalent service by railroad. This involves considera-\ntion of inland and coastal navigation as a system, and does not imply that\nall or even most separate waterway projects are economically sound except\nas parts of a system, since a few extremely low-cost channels can offset\nmany smaller high-cost channels.\n\n2. Waterway competition is not a significant factor in the present dif-\nficulties of the railroads.\n\n3. The plight of rail carriers would not be alleviated if federal aid to\nlight-draft waterways were entirely abandoned.\n\nIt is not proposed to offer an elaborate rebuttal to the arguments that\nhave been advanced by many writers against river and canal navigation.'\nTo avoid misunderstanding, however, it may be well to note certain dif-\nferences between this survey and some of the analyses presented by water-\nway opponents.\n\nExcept for port rivers, which are classified with their harbors in the\ntraffic reports of the army engineers, this study embraces every improved\nwaterway in the United States on which the net registered tonnage by barge\nor light-draft motorboat in 19538 exceeded the net registered tonnage of\nocean or lake vessels? All studies adverse to waterways have relied on a\nsampling method.\n\nThis investigation considers the influence of length of haul as a factor\nin railroad rates.

But now the animal has come forward to speak\nfor himself, and all economists will welcome Professor Pigou's new and\nstimulating book.\n\nJust as Marshall? in his review of Jevons' Theory of Politica! Economy\ndid Jevons, and himself, less than justice, so Pigou? reacted to Keynes in a\nremarkably parallel fashion. Apart from Marshall's vexation at prior pub-\nlication in less perfect form of doctrines which he was himself developing,\nand only here does the parallel begin, his annoyance was generated by\nJevons' treatment of earlier writers. \"[Jevons] seemed perversely to twist\nhis own doctrines so as to make them appear more inconsistent with Mill's\nand Ricardo's than they really were . . . [Marshall's] youthful [!] loyalty\nto [Ricardo] boiled over.\"'*\n\n\"That Pigou was justified in his reaction to Keynes's treatment of the\n\"classical\" economists, particularly of their beloved mutual master, there can\nbe no doubt. Whether Keynes was deliberately Machiavellian in this, only\nhe can tell, and whether or not such tactics helped the spread of his doc-\ntrines, only his biographer will be able to tell us.\n\nIn any case, it is clear that the time has come for the calm reconsideration\nwhich the present work attempts. In his preface, Professor Pigou makes\ngenerous acknowledgment to the stimulus of Keynes's thought, and this is\nborne out by a comparison of this book with his own previous review and\nwith the TAeory of Unemployment. Employment and Equilibrium is for\nthe most part not such difficult reading as the former book, and in my\nopinion more important.\n\nWith respect to methodology, it is almost ideal. Following introductory\ndiscussions of definitions, Part II treats the conditions of equilibrium de-\ntermining employment, income, savings-investment, interest, etc. This sec-\ntion will probably be of major interest to most readers. It is less technical\nin character than Part III, which is concerned, along rigid lines of compara-\ntive statics, with the effect after equilibrium is re-attained of changes in\nvatious parameters such as banking policy, productivity, thriftiness, etc. The\n\n!

In country X\nthe price is set at the point where 4 units are taken at a price of $2.50 each.\nAs buyers in M are eager for more of the commodity if they can get it at the low\nprice prevailing in X, they enter the markets of X and compete for the com-\nmodity, provided they are free to do so.\n\nIf there are no trade restrictions of any sort and if we assume that (1) there\nare no costs of transport, (2) the demand and supply schedules in each country\nwill remain unchanged in the period under consideration (which perhaps implies\nthat there are no changes in incomes caused by international money flows), and\n(3) the foreign exchange rate remains unchanged, we may connect these two\ngraphs in the diagram by a horizontal line.

                    "On the Significance of Another Production Function\nA Comment\n\nThe latest presentation of a Douglas production function! contains some\nerroneous reasoning.\n\nMiss Gunn and Professor Douglas established a multiple correlation between\nthe logarithms of capital (X,), labor (X,), and production (X,) over 556\nmanufacturing industries in 1919. In doing so they found themselves faced by\nthe same troublesome circumstance that appeared in the earlier studies of this\nkind: the three variables, pairwise, are very highly correlated. As a consequence\nof this multicollinearity the scatter points in the three-dimensional space tend\nto arrange themselves along a line instead of a plane.\n\n1. Even in the absence of a three-dimensional scatter diagram one can tell\nfrom the bunch maps shown in the article that there is multicollinearity ; but the\nauthors refuse to recognize it and resort to a faulty demonstration of its absence.\nAfter having cut up the total scatter into partial scatters of observations of X,\nand X, for several, relatively narrow ranges of X,, they argue (p. 75) that\nunder conditions of high-degree multicollinearity the partial X,X, scatters\nwould each tend to cluster about a point.\n\nThe fact that instead of clustering about points these scatters seem to spread\nalong lines (Chart III) does not disprove in the least the presence of high-degree\nmulticollinearity. The linear spread could be reduced at will by reducing the\nwidth of the \"capital groups.\"\n\nOther features of Chart III, however, prove the presence of such multicol-\nlinearity. These features are: (a) the closeness of the group regression lines to\neach other and (b) their increasing order number with increasing size of X, or\nX,. Feature (a) points to the fact that by projecting the three-dimensional\nscatter into the X,X, co\u00fcrdinate plane along the X,-axis, we obtain a long drawn-\nout linear arrangement of points instead of a broad scatter that could be reduced\nby the action of X,. Feature (b) indicates that low (high) values of X, can\nonly be observed where X, and X, are small (large).\n\n2. The authors believe that in a situation of this sort the selection of one\nminimization direction (X,) and the neglect of the two possible alternatives\npresent a way out. This reminds one of a man who stuffed his ears with wax\n1n order not to be disturbed by the rattling of his alarm clock. The alternative\nminimization procedures are designed to demonstrate the instability of 2j plane\nfitted to the present observations of the three variables. They give a warning to\nthe research worker that the choice of a direction in which to minimize deviations\nis exerting an excessive influence on the result, possibly a greater influence than\ncan be ascribed to the data. The alternatives elucidate the dubious usefulness of\n4nj of the three possible regression equations for the purpose of describing\nthe structural relationship between the variables, or of estimating the value of\n\n!

Even less\ndoes it take notice of the important stimulating effect exercised by gold imports\n(on income account at least!) . ..\" (p. 12, 1. 3).\n\n2. \"None of the speakers pointed out that in this respect our silver purchases\nwere, dollar for dollar, more potent and beneficial to domestic employment than\nwere our gold purchases. . . .\" I mention silver purchases besides gold purchases\nas a source of demand for commodities (p. 10, 1l. 37). However, it was not the\npresent writer's task to discuss the relative advantages of different monetary poli-\ncies (public works, financed by the creation of purchasing power, are clearly\nsuperior to either gold or silver purchases), but, in a paper of ten thousand\nwords, to render account of the influence of gold on the price level (this is the\ntitle of my paper!). Moreover, even if silver purchases were superior, \"'Zollar for\ndollar,\" they were less significant 2 1010, because the value of the domestic gold\noutput is much larger than the value of the domestic silver output.\n\n3. \"Is it costless if we exchange productive capital goods for non-productive\ngold... ?\" Throughout my whole paper, I take the view that the private demand\nfor credit has undergone structural changes which would not have permitted,\nduring the thirties, a full utilization of American capital goods industries, unless\nthe demand for goods was supplemented and stimulated by gold and silver pur-\nchases and public spending of other kind. Cutting out the gold purchases would,\ntherefore, have implied, other things being equal, larger unemployment and not\na larger production of capital goods for American use.

                    "A Rejoinder\n\nMy criticism of the new production function presented by Miss Gunn and\nProfessor Douglas dealt with certain methodological mistakes. The first point\nconcerning the interpretation of Chart III in their article seems to have been\naccepted by the authors; but they object against the second point concerning\nthe evaluation of the marginal productivity coefficients.\n\nIn defending their position, the authors use a weapon which shares with\noutworn artillery the property of being more dangerous to the marksman\nthan to the target. I am referring to the argument that \"the problem might\nbe approached from the point of view of elementary regressions.\" True, cor-\nrelation between determining variables is not harmful in fitting equations that\nare designed to furnish best estimates (safest forecasts) of some dependent\nvariable. In ordinary regression analysis, where such estimates are sought, we\ncan neglect multicollinearity if we are ready to assume that the true degree\nof intercorrelation between the pairs of variables is the same in (a) the set of\nobservations from which the estimating equation has been calculated and (b) the\nobservations that are used in making the estimate (forecast). This has been\nmentioned in my former criticism.\n\nAs far as I am aware, these production functions have not been computed\nfor the purpose of estimating the value of production on the basis of known\ncapital and labor inputs. They are established for quite a different purpose,\nnamely, the estimation of the structural relationship among the three variables.\nThe new as well as the older functions are used in order to estimate marginal\nproductivities of labor and capital and to compare these estimates with in-\ndependently derived shares of labor and capital in the product of industry.\nElasticities of demand for labor and other structural characteristics are derived\nfrom the functions. The authors fail to realize that this purpose does not\njustify the ordinary approach of regression analysis. What is correct proce-\ndure in setting up an es//matimg equation for X, is not necessarily correct\nin evaluating the s/ruetural relationship between X,, X,, and X.. The two pur-\nposes can be served by one and the same method only if all \"disturbances\" are\nconcentrated in X,, while X, and X, enter into the computations with their\n\"true\" values! Otherwise the computation of structural coefficients requires\nsome different approach. Multicollinearity becomes troublesome as soon as\n\n* Dr. Max Brown made a study covering manufacturing in New Zealand from 1915-1916\nto 1934-1935. He found the value of k to be .517 and j .483, and the share received by\nlabor, the ratio of wages and salaries to product, to be exactly equal to the exponent of\nlabor, namely, .517. (These results are from an unpublished thesis at Cambridge Uni-\nversity.)\n\n\"True\" values are generally defined as the strictly related parts of the observed\nvariables, \"disturbances\" as the remainder.\n",

The two curves\ndiffer both in mechanics and in underlying assumptions.

That criticism is simply\nthat the r\u00f3le played by restrictive government policies in preventing general\nrecovery after 1933 can be appraised only in the light of a discussion of the\nvarious factors responsible for the failure of such recovery and a determination\nof their relative importance.

Asked to speak to the Association on\nMarshall as part of the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the publica-\ntion of his Principles, I find myself very much in the position Malthus\nthought Senior was in.\n\nMy own plight I attribute mainly to four factors: First, so much of what\nknowledge I may have about Marshall has been gained through the years\nfrom the late Dr. Taussig's writings, teaching, and conversation that I can\nno longer separate what I have learned for myself from what I have derived\nfrom him. Secondly, the fifty years and more of published commentary\non Marshall's Principles have made it difficult to find fresh cause for praise\nor complaint. Third, the admirable Merorials of Alfred Marsball, 1925,\nedited by Pigou, and containing penetrating and enlightening contributions\nby Keynes, Edgeworth, and Pigou on the relation of Marshall's personality\nand social philosophy to his economics, has so thoroughly exploited the\nbiographical data available even to insiders that not much scope is left to\nthose who had never seen nor heard Marshall in the flesh nor had an\nopportunity to draw on the rich fund of oral Cambridge tradition. What\nwould be ordinarily a substitute, published letters, are also unavailable\nexcept for the few published in the Mezzorials. Finally, Mr. Schumpeter\nhas kindly made available to me in advance a generous-sized abstract of\nhis paper on the pure theory aspects of Marshall's Principles, with the\nconsequence that I cannot easily, without resort to plagiarism, fill out what\nI can find to say within my own assignment by encroachment on his.\n\n1f, then, what I say should sound unduly familiar and commonplace,\nsolace must be sought in the also familiar and commonplace reflection that\n",

                    "ALFRED MARSHALL'S PRINCIPLES: A SEMI-CENTENNIAL\nAPPRAISAL:\n\nI\n\nFifteen years or so ago I gave a series of lectures at the London School\nof Economics in which I incidentally paid my respects to the great shade\nof Marshall. Somebody in the audience thereupon wrote me a letter ex-\npressing a feeling, couched in the form of a question, to the effect that\nMarshall's message would pass away much as Mill's message had, or for\nthat matter that of Adam Smith. I will put what I have to say in the form\nof an answer to that question.\n\nIn one sense Marshallian economics has passed away already. His vision\nof the economic process, his methods, his results, are no longer ours. We\nmay love and admire that mighty structure which, battered by the impact\nof criticisms and of new ideas, still spreads its majestic lines in the back-\nground of our own work. We may love and admire it as we love and admire\na madonna by the Perugino, recognizing that she embodies to perfection\nthe thought and feeling of her time, yet recognizing also how far we have\ntraveled from her.\n\n\"This, of course, is no more than the inevitable result of the work done\nduring these fifty years which would have had to be entirely barren if\nMarshall's Principles could be to us anything else than what is conveyed\nby that equivocal term, \"a classic.\" It is the common fate of all classics in\nall fields. 5 Jicet parva componere magnis, there is a significant analogy\nbetween the relation of modern economic theory to the theory of the Przz-\ncibles and the relation of modern physics to the physics of the '90's. It\nwas in 1894, if my memory serves me, that H. A. Lorentz said he felt\nthat theoretical physics had attained perfection and therefore had ceased to\nbe very interesting. Now that feeling of certainty is gone. Gone are the\nbeautifully simple and clear-cut contour lines. Instead, we see the disorder\nof a battlefield \u2014unco\u00f3rdinated masses of fact and pieces of technique, no\nprospect at all of fitting this heap ever again into an architectural struc-\nture. Something very similar has happened to economics. I do not now\nmean to refer to the vicissitudes of the capitalist system and to the change\nin moral and political attitude that has occurred with respect to it. It is not\nMarshall's views on practical problems, social questions, and the like that\n\n! This article is a reconstruction, from notes, of a \"paper\" read to the American Economic\nAssociation, at the New Orleans meeting, on December 29, 1940. Here and there, some\ncomments have been added from an earlier and unpublished essay of mine which in turn\nhad been revised in the light of the information contained in Mr. Keynes's \"Memoir of\nMarshall,\" first published in the Ecoz. Jowr., and reprinted in Memorials of Alfred Marsball\n(ed. A. C. Pigou, 1925) and in J. M. Keynes, Essays in Biography, 1933. I hereby acknowl-\n\nedge my debt to that \"Memoir,\" which I regard as one of the outstanding masterpieces of\nbiographical literature. References are to the 1933 volume.\n",

            "found": "A MULTIPLIER ANALYSIS OF ARMAMENT EXPENDITURE\n\nUnder present programs of increasing armament expenditure, it becomes necessary\nto adapt financial policy to progressive stages of employment in order to permit the\nmaximum increase of national income. Traditional monetary tools apply only to general\nunemployment and full employment, and not to the intermediate stages. Since to reach\nfull employment the economy must pass through successive stages of decreasing total\nunemployment, with full employment appearing much earlier in some sectors than in\nothers, a policy relevant to this development at any intermediate stage is necessary. The\nrecent experience of Great Britain, Canada, and Germany, in passing through this period\nof segmentary full employment, indicates a need for new controls over the distribution\nand amount of savings. In order to channelize the flow of funds into non-saturated felds,\nthe federal government in this country might well consider: (1) licensing of new\nsecurity issues; (2) differential reserve requirements for commercial banks; (3) increased\ncontrol over the disposable funds of other financial institutions; (4) revival of the un-\ndivided profits tax; and (5) Treasury absorption of private savings. Still other measures\nmight be used when it becomes necessary to enlarge the total supply of savings, such as:\ndirect propaganda, curtailment of certain types of consumption, increased social security\npayroll taxes, and \"deferred savings certificates\" to government bondholders. A numerical\nestimate of maximum diversion can be made on the basis of these proposals.\n\nGovernment expenditure, expanded by war needs, now absorbs more\nthan one-half the national income of most of the belligerent nations. In\nEngland, almost 60 per cent of the enlarging national income must be\ntransferred to the government for use in supporting the war effort. Esti-\nmates of the German government's share in the national income of the\nReich run as high as 72 per cent.? Japan and Italy use at least 50 per cent,\nalthough no complete data are available? and Canada is apparently divert-\ning about 30 per cent.* The United States, with the addition of the lease-\nlend program, will probably reach 20 per cent of an 80 to 85 billion dollar\nnational income during 1941.5\n\n' This percentage, as well as the others, is a very rough approximation, useful only to\nshow order of magnitude. It is derived from the Ecomomist's estimate for January, 1941:\nnational income at a yearly rate of 8.12 billion pounds, and government spending at a\nrate of 4.63 billion per year. The Economist, February 1, 1941, p. 138.\n\n* New York Times, March 9, 1941, p. 16, citing a report on wartime spending prepared\nfor the Department of Commerce by H. Arnold Quirin.\n\n?* Japan: The Statist, August 31, 1940, p. 189, citing the Toy\u00a3o Gazette, shows that the\nnational income to be expected for the year 1941 is about 30 billion yen, of which 12\nbillion will be taken by various savings devices. New Yor\u00a3 Times, January 24, 1941, p. 5,\nindicates that government plans call for 4.5 billion yen of taxes in addition to all borrow-\ning. This means a transfer of 55 per cent of the national income to government.\n\nItaly: Tbe Economist, April 6, 1940, pp. 616-617, presents the only budget data for\nfiscal 1941 from which an estimate can be made.\n\n* From data in the Baz\u00a3 Letters of the Bank of Nova Scotia and the Bank of Montreal,\nI have estimated the current rate of national income at 5.5 billion dollars. From this,\nnormal expenditures of .39 billion (Bank of Canada, S/atistical Summary, August-Septem-\nber, 1940) and 1.46 billion of war costs (New Yor& Times, March 9, 1941, p. 18), must\nbe diverted to government. This is almost 34 per cent.\n\n* Federal spending is expected to be at the rate of at least 17.5 billion dollars per year,\nand if national income falls within the estimates which range from 80 to 85 billion, the\npercentage of it diverted to the national government will be between 20 per cent and 22\nper cent.\n"

Introduction\n\nThe recent loan to China by the United States for the purpose of stabiliz-\ning the Chinese currency? was immediately beset with difficulties which\ndiminish the value of the loan. The nature of the difficulties can be briefly\nstated.\n\nHaving abandoned the silver standard in the year 1935, China adopted\nthe foreign exchange policy of pegging the value of the national currency\nto pound sterling and the United States dollar through the process of un-\nlimited selling and buying at the official rates by the Chinese governmental\nbanks. Eight months after the so-called \"China Incident\" which started on\nJuly 7, 1937, the Chinese national government had to suspend this policy\nand to institute other measures of exchange control. Since March, 1938,\nforeign exchange has been obtainable from the governmental banks at the\nofficial rates only on application. As many applications were denied, the\nunofficial (or \"black\" market) of foreign exchange emerged, the bulk of\nthe transactions being carried out in Shanghai where the national govern-\nment has no effective control.\n\nThe unofficial rates have been progressively lower than the official rates.\nThis decine in the unofficial market is the result of a combination of\nfactors.

Recurring\ndeficits in federal finance are a constant and growing cause of widespread\nuneasiness. It is no longer possible to be ignorant of the unprecedented\nsize of the national debt or to brush it aside as a matter of trifling im-\nportance. We have recently been treated to a battle of words over the\nComptroller General and his functions and responsibilities. There are\nthose who believe that the existing distribution of financial authority and\nresponsibility has failed to remain in harmony with the principles of demo-\ncratic government as set forth in the federal Constitution. To many intel-\nligent observers it appears that national finances are running wild, with\ndisaster awaiting somewhere ahead. These matters\u2014never to be lightly\nregarded\u2014take on especial importance as the nation faces a crisis which\nmay end in war, and which in any event calls for extraordinary efforts in\nbehalf of preparedness for defense. At such a time a nation's financial\norganization and financial policy are not the least of the factors which may\ncontribute to success or defeat.\n\nUnder these circumstances the appearance of an authoritative book deal-\ning in a comprehensive way with the whole financial system of the United\nStates federal government is timely. Dr. Selko is himself an authority on\nthese matters, and he has had the invaluable aid that derives from his con-\n\n\"This article is suggested by, and is in large part based upon, Te l'ederal Financial\n\nSystem by Daniel T.

                    "PROFIT MAXIMIZATION UNDER MONOPOLISTIC\nCOMPETITION\n\nCurrent theory nominally recognizes that the individual firm maximizes profits, not\nthrough output adjustments alone, but also by determining price, the attributes of the\nproduct and selling effort. In this article the r\u00f3le of product variation and the interrelations\nof these three variables are emphasized. Diagrammatics analogous to those customarily\nused in price-output problems are developed and these are later employed to demonstrate\nthat the incidence of relevant technological innovations upon the quality of the product\nof the firm are independent of abnormal profits or of monopolistic advantage. Finally, the\njoint determination of output, product and promotion is considered. Normally, the ex-\nploitation of every profit possibility until marginal costs and receipts were equated would\nbe expected. Available funds may, however, be limited and certain policies may earn\nlosses unless more intensively pursued. In this case certain profit possibilities must\nbe passed over in favor of others, the marginal net return on working capital will vary\nwith different employments, and as the amount of such funds available changes the manner\nof their expenditure may differ markedly.\n\nEntrepreneurs must determine, nter alia, the price and output of their\nproduct, its specifications, and the amount and type of selling effort.! The\nlogic and illustrative diagrammatics of the entrepreneurial determination\nof output and price are familiar. Similar methods, developed below, are\napplicable to the problems of determining the optimum degree of dura-\nbility and of other product attributes. The procedure used is shown to be\nrelevant to a consideration of the incidence of improved technology on\nprices and quality. Finally, the joint determination of price, product,? and\npromotion? is attempted. In the following discussion it is assumed that the\nproducts of immediate rivals are heterogeneous and are considered by\nconsumers to be close but not exact substitutes: they are \"differentiated\" one\nfrom another either because the product (or service) is tangibly different,\nor because it has been made to seem so, or because of location. The time\nperiod relevant to the considerations of this paper is not the long run, but\na short period in which there is, however, sufficient time for some rather\nfundamental adjustments by entrepreneurs: the product of each firm is held\ncapable of considerable modification, but the possibility of changing over\nto a radically different type of product with altogether dissimilar uses and\nattributes is excluded. The location of the enterprise is considered given,\nbut distribution facilities or delivery services may be modified. The reason-\ning throughout assumes that entrepreneurs desire profits, have perfect\nknowledge, and act rationally.\n\n1]f the firm has a less than infinitely elastic demand schedule, and one assumes that\noutput and sales will be equated, then a price decision simultaneously determines output\n(or vice versa) and this theoretically comprises but one decision.\n\n? \"Product\" throughout includes the material good plus all associated intangibles excep?\nthose resulting from promotion and the peculiar site of the place of sale. Thus \"differentia-\ntion\" due to location or advertising is excluded: all other types are included.\n\n5\"Promotion\" throughout includes all selling effort, whether advertising or personal\nsalesmanship. Although advertising is only a particular form of promotion it will be used\nsynonymously.\n",

This note was written before the appearance of Mr. Higgins! comments. The\neditors of the Review suggested to me that I might like to modify my remarks in the\nlight of what Mr. Higgins had said. It seems best, however, to let them stand as written.\nWhile the bias, if any, of the two notes is different, there is practical agreement between\nMr. Higgins and myself in those parts of our remarks which touch on common topics.\nThis agreement, independently attained, must carry more conviction than if it had arisen\nout of Mr. Higgins' persuasiveness.\n\nI would merely add that under some versions, at least, of the 100 per cent reserve\nplan, new issues of purchasing power are not, as Mr. Higgins seems to suppose, pre-\ncluded. They would, however, be made only by the central monetary authority and never\nby member banks. Contractions would be accomplished under the same authority. The notion\nis that aberrations in the more or less uncontrollable velocity of money would be coz-\npensated by appropriate and adequate changes in its volume. This would perhaps not work\nsmoothly but it would work. Mr. Higgins is right, however, in suggesting that, with money\nof the traditional type, we must choose between an unstable automaticity and a measure\nof potential stability under fallible administrative discretion.

Thomas on the proposal for 100 per cent cash\nreserves against the demand deposits of banks. Professor Brown's article seems to\nme to be sheer casuistry. The contentions of Professor Thomas are weightier but\nthey apply only against those advocates of 100 per cent reserves whose en-\nthusiasm has outrun their discretion. Professor Thomas' own enthusiasm in\naspersing the proposal has led him into some counter-extravagances of statement.\nI write this note, therefore, in the hope of defining the issue more clearly, both\nby refuting what Professor Brown asserts and by showing the bearing of the\nvalid part of Professor Thomas' criticism.!\n\nProfessor Brown is concerned to exonerate the banks from the charge of lend-\ning what they do not have. Banks, he says, do not lend except as intermediaries\nor agents for the depositors. The latter are the real lenders. 'To make his point,\nhowever, he assumes that banks start by lending, in the aggregate, several times\nas much money as they have on hand. (He does not say how this can be done\nwithout an ad oc creation of money.) He then goes on to show that, thereafter,\nthe banks may act only as intermediaries. But, in the inception of the process,\nthe banks are clearly acting as principals, and the process is frequently repeated\nab ovo though not on the scale that Professor Brown assumes for its beginning.\n\nAn ordinary loan is an exchange of a present asset for a promise.

                    "Gold Imports: Cost and Benefits\n\nIn the discussion of \"Gold and the Monetary System\" at the December meet-\nings,' all four speakers seem to have agreed that our huge gold imports, amount-\ning to about $16,000,000,000 from January, 1934, through 1940, were practically\ncostless to the American public and had beneficial effects upon employment here\nin so far as they resulted in additional exports from this country. These gold im-\nports, which amounted to as much as total relief expenditures, or to four-fifths of\nthe deficits of the federal government during those years, have been paid for by\nthe Treasury simply by issuing an equivalent amount of non-circulating paper\nmoney to the Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nIn his paper Dr. Hardy stated that the gold purchases will continue to be cost-\nless to the American public, except consumers of gold, until we approach \"nor-\nmally full employment\" when the large gold output [in this country?] \"will\nnecessitate a correspondingly curtailed output of useful goods\" [in this country ?].\nProfessor Neisser seemed to conclude that, with idle productive resources, the\nonly possible cost of gold purchases consists of the irreplaceable natural resources\nembodied in the additional exports resulting from gold imports, and spoke of the\nmultiplier effect of the additional exports, whereby \"gold imports increase the\nnational income by more than their value\" !\n\nQualifications to their conclusions on the costless character of the purchase of\n$16,000,000,000 of gold from abroad may be indicated by such questions as the\nfollowing: If the U.S. Treasury had continued the 1936-38 gold sterilization pro-\ngram, would the gold purchases have been costless to the American public? Have\nthe higher required and excess reserves, as the result of gold imports, not cost the\nbanks or bank customers something? Would the gold already imported cost us\nmore if we experience a marked price inflation, permitted and encouraged by the\nincreased reserves that have arisen from huge gold imports? Is it costless to this\ncountry if we exchange interest-bearing securities or profitable investments for\nbarren and \"rather useless\" gold imports? Is it costless 1f we exchange productive\ncapital goods for non-productive gold which we could not use to buy the same\namount of goods from foreign countries?\n\nThe speakers failed to indicate clearly that most of the proceeds foreigners\nobtained for imported gold during the period from 19534 through 1940 were\nused to acquire capital items (securities, property, bank deposits, etc.) rather\nthan to purchase American goods, so that the stimulating secondary effects on\nAmerican employment through exports, which were mentioned by Professors\nMachlup and Brown and stressed by Professor Neisser, were distinctly limited\nto a fraction of the $16,000,000,000 paid for gold imports. None of the speak-\ners pointed out that in this respect our silver purchases were, dollar for dollar,\nmore potent and beneficial to domestic employment than were our gold pur-\nchases, for less than one-seventeenth of the gold purchased during those years\nwas currently produced in the United States, whereas about one-fourth of the\n\n!

                    "ECONOMICS IN A TIME OF CHANGE\n\nPresidential Address, Fifty-third Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association,\nNew Otrleans, Louisiana, December 27, 1940\n\nIn periods of war and revolution scholarship is not immune to the forces\nthat affect human events. There is a tradition\u2014-an honorable tradition \u2014of\nscientific aloofness, of exclusive concern with the affairs of the mind and\nthe spirit at such times, but it is a tradition difficult to keep alive in an era\nof total war. As individual human beings, of course, scholars feel the\nweight of conflict. Many are affected as disciples of arts that have important\nuses in the prosecution of war. Most immediate is the impact of revolu-\ntionary war on social scientists, for the very subject matter of their disci-\nplines may be altered under the stress of profound civil disturbance. Not\nleast is economics involved in such changes. The full violence of the present\ndisorders has perhaps not yet been experienced by our science, but it needs\nno prophet to suggest that the effects will be far-reaching and enduring.\n\nSome of these effects we have already felt. Abroad, in regions where\nfreedom of economic thought has long prevailed, we have seen economics\nreduced to a subservient art. Our colleagues have been silenced. The great\neconomic journals of continental Europe are dead. Throughout the world\nopportunity for objective study has been seriously impaired, at a time when\nit is sorely needed. But these are not the only reasons for disquiet. If we\nface the realities of economic life, and set against these realities our theories,\nour analytical tools, our ability to devise and direct instruments of control,\nwe must confess to inadequacy. Our needs outrun our means of under-\nstanding. In his presidential address five years ago Maurice Clark said that\nthe mood of our generation of economists is one of doubtful potency in\nthe face of a great crisis. That mood has not been relieved, certainly, by\nany lessening of the crisis since he spoke.\n\nThis feeling stands in sharp contrast to that of our nineteenth-century\npredecessors. Except for a few troubled spirits, these economists felt at\nhome in a mastered world. The institutional framework had been set. The\nessential nature of economic processes, tending eternally toward equilibrium\nin this enduring framework, had been established. The form and central\nsubstance of organized economic knowledge seemed to have been defined.\n\nI do not imply that complacency dominated the thinking of these men.\n",

                    "THE TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 1940\n\nWith the passage of the Transportation act of 1940 Congress has added water carriers\nto the growing list of major domestic commercial transportation agencies subject to regu-\nlation by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Only air lines now remain under separate\nauthority. The regulation of railroads, pipe lines, motor carriers, and water lines is also\nunified and centralized on a pattern largely derived from the earlier rail statutes. In par-\nticular, maximum, minimum, and exact rates and charges of each of these agencies are\nsubject to Commission control. Entry into service is also rigidly subject to regulation by\nmeans of permits and certificates of public convenience and necessity. For the first time a\nnational transportation policy governing all agencies subject to the Interstate Commerce\nact has been enacted. Another major feature of the Act is provision for the creation of a\ntemporary Board of Investigation and Research to study the relative economy and fitness\nof each mode of transportation, the extent government has subsidized or otherwise aided\ntransportation, the amount of taxes levied upon transportation by all governmental units,\nand any other matter likely to lead to improvement of transportation conditions. The Act\nalso makes numerous changes in the Interstate Commerce act, many of technical interest\nonly, and modifies legislation governing land-grant rate reductions and loans by the\nReconstruction Finance Corporation to railroads.\n\nUpon its passage last September, the Transportation act of 1940! be-\ncame the latest in a long series of important federal statutes dealing with\ntransportation problems. The Act is divided into three main divisions, each\nwith a separate title. Title I deals with amendments to the existing law\nand promulgates a new declaration of national transportation policy; Title\nII is devoted to the regulation of water carriers in interstate and foreign\ncommerce; and Title III includes a miscellaneous group consisting of Part\n1 on investigation of the various modes of transportation, Part 2 on rates\non government traffic and Part 3 on amendments to the Reconstruction\nFinance Corporation act.\n\nRegulation of W'ater Carriers\n\nThe section which adds domestic common and contract water carriers\nto the already impressive list of agencies subject to regulation by the\nInterstate Commerce Commission as Part III of the Interstate Commerce\nact, is perhaps of greatest public interest. Only air carriers among the five\ntypes of transportation of national concern now remain under other con-\ntrol, the railways having been brought under the Commission in 1887,\nthe oil pipe lines in 1906, and the motor carriers in 1935.?\n\n! Public no. 785, 76th Cong., 3d sess., approved September 18, 1940. This was known\nas the Wheeler-Lea bill, S. 2009. The legislative history of S. 2009 was as follows: Intro-\nduced in Senate by Senators Wheeler and Truman, March 30, 1939; hearings held by\nSenate Committee on Interstate Commerce, April 3-14, 1939; reported by Senator Wheeler\nwith amendments, May 16, 1939 (Sen. Rep. no. 433); passed Senate, May 25, 1939;\nreferred to House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, which reported bill to\nHouse with amendments, July 14, 1939; passed House with further amendments, July 26,\n1939; bills sent to Conference Committee, which filed report on. April 26, 1940 (House\nDoc. no. 2016); recommitted to.Conference Committee by House, May 9, 1940; Con-\nference Committee filed second report on August 7, 1940 (House Doc. no. 2832) ; House\nagreed to conference report on August 12, 1940, and Senate on September 9, 1940; ap-\nproved by President, September 18, 1940.\n\n? Several proposals have been made to shift the air carriers to Commission supervision,\n",

                    "REARMAMENT, RECOVERY AND MONETARY POLICY:\n\nWe are at present faced with the triple problem of rearmament, recovery, and avoidance\nof price inflation. An acceptable monetary policy needs to be calculated to achieve all three\nobjectives, plus the maintenance of full employment once obtained. With the present rapid\nsurge toward full employment and the special pressures for arms production, conflicts of\ninterest appear likely, especially over wage increases. Adoption of a stable policy \"rule\"\n(such as price stabilization) as the basis for monetary and fiscal policy might provide the\nbasis for a workable \"truce\" between labor, monetary authorities, and those in charge of\nrearmament.\n\nOther primary advantages of monetary stabilization around a stated \"rule\" are (1)\nthe basis it provides for \"equity,\" (2) its stabilizing effect on business conditions, and (3)\nits elimination of the necessity for further centralization of power in the hands of dis-\ncretionary monetary \"authorities,\" The arguments that adoption of such a stable policy\nwould involve loss of desirable flexibility have been much overstated.\n\nThe choice between alternative \"stable money\" policies is largely a matter of expe-\ndiency. Present institutional conditions, especially in regard to labor, point toward price\nstabilization as the most expedient choice.\n\nOur country is at present faced with three major \"economic\" problems\n\u2014rearmament, restoration of a higher level of employment and income,\nand avoidance of unwanted price inflation. Apparently the second is now\nwell on the road to solution, temporarily at least, but the other two are\nstill very much in the \"unsolved\" stage. W'e need, then, to make every\neffort to assure (1) that the upward surge in employment and income is\nnot cut short, (2) that the \"recovery\" surge is prevented from leading\nto the excesses of price inflation, (3) that the rearmament program is ex-\npedited, and (4) that the \"prosperity\" now being attained is made a\n\"permanent\" one, if at all possible. It is the purpose of this note to consider\nbriefly the part monetary policy can play in obtaining this four-fold ob-\njective.\n\nT\n",

                    "THE ARMAMENTS PROGRAM AND NATIONAL INCOME\n\nThe armaments program will probably lead to a smaller increase in the national\nincome than would a work-relief program involving the same amount of net government\nspending. This is due to higher leakages in the first-round turnover of armament expendi-\ntures and to the rapid amortization of privately financed capital equipment in the arma-\nments field. If the period considered is long enough for complete amortization to take place,\nthe expansionary effect of induced investment will be neutralized by depreciation charges.\nThe argument may be generalized for use in the evaluation of the income-increasing\npotential of any spending program.\n\nThe purpose of this note is to point out that the dollar-for-dollar value\nof an armaments program in increasing the national income may well be\nless than that of a work-relief program.\n\nIn appraising the income-increasing value of any expenditure we have\nto consider not only the ze/ addition to the income stream which that\nexpenditure represents, but also the direction of the expenditure. It is the\nsecond of these considerations which is being dealt with in this note. As far\nas government programs are concerned the first point has been pretty well\ncovered in recent discussions of tax policy, and I have nothing to add here.\nWhat is being compared is the dollar-for-dollar value of two types of\nprograms\u2014armaments and work relief\u2014with the comparison put on a\nnet basis. Any difference due to choice of fiscal methods is ignored.\n\nThe effect of a spending program on total income is governed by\n(1) the spending reactions of recipients at all stages, or \"rounds of\nincome,\" and (2) the amount of induced investment, also at all stages.\nIn order to compare two programs, however, it is necessary to follow the\nspending only through the hands of one set of ultimate consumers, on\nthe assumption that, for all practical purposes, spending reactions and\ninduced investment after the initial expenditure has completed an \"income\nround\" will be the same regardless of the purpose or source of the original\nexpenditure.!\n\nIt is fairly certain that a work-relief program has a greater potential\nas an income-increasing force if investment induced by the primary expendi-\nture is not considered, attention being focussed on first-round spending\nreactions alone. The direction of work-relief spending is such that leakages\nare at a minimum. There is, of course, the familiar proposition that workers\nin the industries supplying goods for rearmament enjoy a higher income\nthan relief workers and hence are likely as a group to have a lower marginal\n\n\"This assumption is, of course, contrary to fact. Ultimate recipients of the primary\narmaments expenditures are a quite different group than WPA workers; the re\u00e9xpenditures\nmade by the two groups may differ somewhat in direction as well as in volume. If the\ndifference is significant there might be an advantage, one way or the other, in investment\ninduced by secomd-round (and subsequent) spending. Also, no account is taken of the\nimpact of different programs on \"confidence.\" In my judgment, these factors, while im-\nportant in some respects, are of insignificant magnitude in the special case being con-\n\nsidered, and their inclusion in the analysis here would make it unnecessarily cumbersome\nwithout altering the substance of the conclusions.\n",

Real and\nfancied strike evils have led to many \"solutions.\" These solutions generally fail to distinguish\nbetween strikes over rights and strikes over interests. The former may be adjudicated, the\nlatter may not. The ordinary strike to increase wages, shorten hours or improve working\nconditions is a democratic alternative to authoritarian determinations. Some limitations on\nstrikes now exist, and others could be introduced without violating the principles of\ndemocracy. It would be reasonable to compel adjudication of disputes involving rights, to\nprohibit altogether strikes in public utilities, to compel settlement in any strike when the\npublic is suffering seriously, and to require limited production of certain commodities\nand services during some strikes. These restrictions would raise the struggle for status\nto a higher level and would protect the public interest.\n\nThe common belief that unreasonably great losses of time and money\nresult from industrial disputes is not well founded. Most of the production\nlost during a strike is usually made up either before or after the strike, by\nthe persons directly involved or by others. Indeed, it is not possible to\nestimate accurately the simplest and most objective elements of strike costs\n\u2014namely, the man-days or wages lost; \"and any figure on the total cost of\nstrikes would be even more fictitious.\" Nor can the direct and indirect\ngains to be used as offsets be measured, such as reductions in waste and\ninefficiency and increased use of machinery, where these occur.\n\nEven if exaggerated estimates of strike losses should be accepted as\nreasonably accurate, it would still be true that those losses are relatively\nsmall. The annual cost of industrial accidents in the United States has\nbeen estimated at between three and five billion dollars, and the cost of\nSickness at from eight to ten billion dollars. The cost of unemployment not\nthe result of strikes, accidents and sickness is tremendous, especially that\nof recent years, and more especially if the unemployment of land, capital\nand management is included, as it should be. These estimates, it should\nbe noted, are also commonly exaggerated, but when all allowances are\nduly made, the losses are still appreciably greater than those occasioned by\nindustrial disputes.\n\nThe real and fancied evils resulting from strikes have led to many pto-\nposed \"solutions.\" One extreme proposal, rarely advanced openly, is that\nthey should be completely outlawed and that the free play of competitive\nforces should be depended upon to establish desirable conditions of em-\nployment. As a \"solution\" of the problems involved, this proposal has no\nmerit whatsoever. For prohibiting the strike would not establish sufficient\nfreedom of competition to bring about desirable conditions, and such an\nabsolute prohibition could not possibly be enforced in a democracy. An-\nother extreme proposal is that strikes should be permitted without restric-\ntions or regulations of any kind.

                    "RECENT CHANGES IN WORK-RELIEF WAGE POLICY\n\nRecent changes in WPA wage policy have been substantial. The relief act of 193\nrequired that regional differences in monthly earnings should be based on differences i\ncost of living. \"Cost of living\" may refer to the income needed to maintain (1) a uniforn\nlevel of living, or (2) the actual levels of living that prevail in different regions. The nex\nWPA. wage schedule, revised in accordance with a qualified cost-of-living concept, raised th\nnational average approximately $2.50 a month. Substantial increases were made in unskille\nearnings in the South with only small changes elsewhere. The 1939 act also established a uni\nform work month of 130 hours, thus abandoning the prevailing-hourly-wage policy. Thi\nprovision has increased efficiency in various respects. Changes in work-relief wage polic\nhave been associated with shifts in the distribution of emphasis between the work an\nrelief aspects of such programs. In recent years, a growth in legislative determination o\nwage and hour policy has accompanied increasing emphasis upon the efficient accomplish\nment of useful work.\n\nAn analysis of work-relief wage policy covering the period 1930-37 wa:\npublished by the present authors in a previous issue of the Review. Since\n1937 the wage policy of the Work Projects Administration has been\nchanged materially, particularly by the Emergency Relief act of 1939.\n\nIn general, work-relief wage policy has reflected the peculiar position\nand the innumerable difficulties of a work-relief program. Work relief is\n\u00e0 hybrid, combining many of the aspects of normal employment with those\nof relief. Because it is a compromise between work and relief, a number\nof special features are found in a work-relief program: (1) need is the\nprimary basis for employment while occupational fitness is secondary; (2)\nprovision of employment is the chief objective and the completed work\nis subordinate so that the major canon of efficiency is maximum direct\nemployment and not minimum cost of completed work\u2014in other words,\nneed for the completed public work is subordinated to the need for em-\nployment of otherwise-idle labor; (3) work completed is presumed to be\nthat which otherwise would not have been undertaken currently; (4) wage\npayments are primarily for subsistence, the gui4 pro quo aspect being\nsubordinate.\n\nWork relief, of course, can emphasize either work or relief. The de-\nvelopment of work relief during the 1930's was consistently in the direction\nof approximating regular work as much as possible. Although the WPA\nembodies more of the features of regular public work than any of the\npreceding work-relief programs, it is still a compromise. During the course\nof its operations, WPA has developed a body of principles and practices\nwhich are unique in the field of project operation and employment. Because\nof its relief aspect, work relief is distinguished from \"normal\" public work\nby such peculiar features as the low ratio of non-labor costs and the provi-\nsion of the maximum possible amount of direct employment, as well as by\nspecial problems of project operation arising from the necessity of selecting,\ncombining, and shifting types of projects to meet rapid changes in relief\n\n!

The actual wages paid totaled only 60 per cent of the product. This discrepancy\nmay have been an important factor in the large number of strikes during that year.\n\nI. Tbe Setting\n\nAmid the relief which followed the end of the first world war, under-\ntones of anxiety began to arise. In the world at large, there was the danger\nthat the forces of selfish nationalism might triumph. At home, worries\narose over the economic readjustment and the re\u00e9mployment of five million\ndemobilized soldiers and sailors. As the year 1919 opened, there were\nsigns that a domestic crisis might be close at hand. There was a decrease\nin the output of metals and their prices fell by 10 per cent from November\nto January. Chemicals and textiles fell in price by a similar proportion. Un-\nemployed men began to appear in the streets of our cities. Scattered groups\nof radicals began to dream of revolution. These very dreams roused fears\nand led to repressive measures.\n\nThe clouds of an impending depression were dissipated by the Victory\nLoan of April for no less than 41^ billion dollars, almost completely sub-\nscribed by the banks. With ample funds, the government proceeded to\nsettle its war contracts on. generous terms, to demobilize its armies, and\nto supply Europe with food, textiles and industrial materials. Stimulated\nby this transfusion of credit, industry rallied. The general level of whole-\nsale prices rose indeed by 17 per cent between April and December, while\nthe advance in house-furnishings amounted to 40 per cent, in textiles and\nclothing to 54 per cent, and in building materials to 56 per cent.

                    "SOME NEGLECTED RELATIONSHIPS IN THE\nBALANCE OF PAYMENTS\n\nUnder the new pattern analysis, a 4-item balance of payments (Merchandise, Capital,\nGold, and Miscellaneous) is studied as a 4-element equation. When the four items are\nranged in magnitude, there are seven limitations upon their size\u2014usually in the ratio of\none item to a second item. Transgressions of those mathematical ratios in estimates in-\nevitably cause \"Discrepancies due to errors and omissions.\" This contributes to pure\nscience. Further, the new analysis can sometimes be put to guarded use in localizing and\nbracketing errors in balance-of-payments estimates.\n\nItem-by-item differences between two 4-item balances of payments, both in equilibrium,\nlikewise make a 4-element equation. Therefore, fluctuations of estimates for one year com-\npared with the estimates of each other year of a series can condemn a specific estimate. The\nestimated item may be jointly erroneous with each of the three others, in turn, and always\ntoo large or always too small. A \"joint error\" with gold is especially condemning ; because\nold statistics are often trustworthy.\n\nThe accountancy plane of equilibrium in international dealings has been\ndismissed, sometimes, as too simple to warrant much analysis. That plane\nhas heretofore been supposed to involve merely the simple arithmetic of\ndouble-entry bookkeeping: the adding and subtracting of equals. Because\nthe debit and credit of each international transaction are equal the totals of\nall international transactions must likewise be equal.\n\nOf the two entries for each transaction with foreigners, one inevitably\naffects the international movement of short-term capital; barter is rare\nenough in practice to be ignored. Each credit in our balance of payments\nis an increase of American deposits abroad (a balance-of-payments debit) ;\nor, it is a reduction of foreign deposits in the United States (also a balance-\nof-payments debit) . The reverse is true of each debit in our balance of pay-\nments. Even when dollar paper currency is spent abroad or is mailed there\u2014\nby tourists, immigrants and others\u2014the currency pours through the \"re-\nservoirs\" of short-term capital, usually with little lag, freezing or thawing.\nFurther, gold shipments, often falsely declared to be the balancing item in\na balance of payments, are not exceptions; these, too, have double-entries\naffecting the international movement of short-term capital.\n\nThus offhandedly, the accountancy plane of international equilibrium\ncould be well enough pictured, heretofore. What challenged the wits and\nknowledge of many of the keenest thinkers among economists were other\nplanes of equilibrium. The accountancy plane was supposed to stop, dead,\nwith equal debits and credits.\n\nThis paper will describe some neglected mathematical relationships be-\ntween groups of debits and credits, inside the balancing grand totals of\ninternational accounts. What was speciously so simple will be shown to be\ncomplex. Equilibrium on the accountancy plane will emerge with new\nproperties which, incidentally, hold not only in international dealings but\nalso in domestic trade and virtually throughout all human economy.\n",

                    "RUPEE CIRCULATION IN INDIA\n\nSince the outbreak of the European war, the flow of rupee coins back from circulation\nto reserves, which has been going on for many years, has been reversed. The stock of rupee\ncoin in the Reserve Bank of India decreased from 750,000,000 rupees in September, 1939,\nto 300,000,000 rupees in July, 1940; while circulation increased from about 1,500,000,000\nto 1,950,000,000 rupees. This increase of coin circulation has been due partly to the\nproportional increase of note circulation, for which the coins serve as small change, and\npartly, in all probability, to some tendency to hoard coins in preference to notes, although\nat the present or any probable future price of silver they are not worth melting. To avoid\nexhaustion of the Reserve Bank's supply of coin, the government of India, in July, 1940,\nbegan the issuance of 1-rupee notes, which would be counted as \"rupee coin\" in the\nReserve Bank's accounts. Finally, in December, 1940, it announced a reduction in the fineness\nof the rupee from 11/12 to 0.500. It remains to be seen whether this section will be accept-\nable to the population.\n\nAt the outbreak of the European war in September, 1939, the circulation\nof rupee coins in India had reached its lowest level since the World War.\nIn that era the use of paper notes had perforce been greatly increased; in\nthe succeeding two decades they had become pretty generally acceptable.\nRupee coins had been steadily flowing back from circulation into the gov-\nernment's paper currency reserve prior to 1935 and thereafter into the issue\ndepartment of the Reserve Bank of India which took over the management\nof the paper currency on April 1 of that year.\n\nIn September, 1939, the quantity of rupee coin and of bullion derived\nfrom coins withdrawn from circulation was approximately as follows:\n\nMillions Equivalent\n\nof rupees millions of\n\nfine ounces\nIn circulation (including hoards) 1,500 500\nIn issue department of Reserve Bank 750 250\nTotal in monetary system (all in coin) 2,250 750\n\nHeld by government, withdrawn from monetary\n\nsystem (coin and bullion) 480 160\n\nAt the same time, the circulation of paper notes, issued in dominations\nof 5 rupees and upward, amounted to about 1,800,000,000 rupees, or con-\nsiderably more than the coin circulation, especially when allowance is made\nfor hoarded coins not in active use.\n\nAt the outbreak of the war in September, 1939, the price of silver in\nBombay jumped about 15 per cent, and has since remained, with minor\nfluctuations, at a level equivalent to about 50 cents per ounce as compared\nwith the American price of 35 cents. This disparity is caused by the exist-\nence of an import duty on the white metal in India and by restrictions on\nthe supply of exchange for purchasing it, so that the Bombay market is\n\"insulated\" from the American one. During the autumn of 1939 there\ndeveloped a large demand in Bombay for silver bullion. This was met\n",

            "found": "COMMENTS ON 100 PER CENT MONEY\n\nRecent discussion to the contrary, the chief argument for the 100 per cent reserve plan\nrests upon a monetary theory of economic fluctuations. The merit of the plan is that it\ntends to prevent investment in excess of voluntary savings. Other claims for the scheme\nare extravagant. Some of the advantages claimed can be obtained with less radical reform ;\nothers involve accompanying and offsetting disadvantages. Reduction of national debt, for\nexample, could be obtained through the 100 per cent plan only at the expense of bank\nearnings. Economic fluctuations would not be entirely eliminated. Indeed, minor changes\nin demand for idle cash balances can be better met under the present system. Since some\ndemand deposits are savings in the relevant sense, and some time deposits are not, the\nplan does not guarantee equality of savings and investment. It does tend to minimize\ndivergencies between them. If over-investment is not a problem of the real world, the\nplan is of no practical significance. Equality of saving and investment is not a sufficient\ncondition for a high level of income and employment. While too much has been claimed\nfor the plan, a step in its direction deserves serious consideration in view of the large excess\nreserves and the stimulus of armaments expenditures.\n\nControversy over the 100 per cent reserve plan has been revived by the\nappearance of two articles on the subject in a recent issue of this Review.*\nThe revival is opportune. The possibility that a strong recovery will de-\nvelop is no longer remote, member banks are in possession of nearly seven\nbillion dollars in excess reserves, and accordingly discussion of measures\nfor control of monetary expansion is no longer purely academic.\n\nAdvantage of the Plan\n\nContrary to Thomas,? it is my opinion that the chief argument in favor\nof the 100 per cent plan rests upon the monetary theory of the trade cycle?\nand that the peculiar feature of the scheme is that it appears to provide an\nautomatic check to investment in excess of voluntary savings.* The degree\nof effectiveness of the plan in preventing over-investment depends upon\nthe extent to which time deposits can be identified with savings, and\ndemand deposits with money. It is true that under a rigorous 100 per cent\nreserve plan, so long as the supply of currency is fixed, no increase in the\ntotal volume of demand deposits could arise except through a withdrawal\nof currency from private circulation. There is some justification, then, for\nregarding an increase in volume of demand deposits as the result of a\n\n?

Loc. cit., p. 316.\n\n*'That is, the sort of theory that traces depression to over-expansion of credit in the\nboom, with accompanying over-investment and distortion of the capital structure. Perhaps\nthe best known presentations of this theory are by Hayek (Prices and Production, London,\n1935, and Profits, Interest, and Investment, London, 1939) and Robbins (Te Great De-\npression, London, 1934) ; but it is worth noting that even some of the \"Keynesians\" have\nreverted to explanations of disturbances in terms of discrepancies between savings and\ninvestment. See, for example, Kaldor, \"A Model of the Trade Cycle,\" Ecoz. Jour., March,\n1940.\n\n*'The terms \"savings\" and \"investment\" are used throughout in the \"Robertsonian\"\nsense: savings are income of last period minus consumption of this period, investment is\nexpenditure on capital goods in this period.\n"

Few\nwill not agree that such a challenge is timely and well-put. I venture, however,\nto introduce a subject upon which altogether too little has been written.

When it is realized\nthat this was a period of upswing, experience can scarcely be held to demonstrate\nthe likelihood of ultimate success in stabilizing business at a tolerable level if\nhuge government expenditures are made during the early part of the downswing.\n\nELMzR C.

He\npoints out that an actual deterioration of individual economic welfare may be\nnaively classified as \"progress\" because of the illusion which results from the\nconversion of free goods into marketable products. Moreover, economists who\nare aware of the limitations of market measurement may use language insuffi-\nciently guarded to warn laymen and legislators from drawing false conclusions.\nIf this is true with reference to much of the literature dealing with individual\neconomic welfare, and it is, it seems equally appropriate to emphasize some\nrelated flaws in the exposition of the conception and measurement of \"the na-\ntional income.\"\n\nForemost among the difficulties confronting those who attempt measurement\nof \"the national income\" is the really insurmountable obstacle of the inappro-\npriateness of the market yardstick. All that the market yardstick can do is to\nyield a figure which shows the aggregate of all the incomes of the individual\nincome recipients of the nation. Such an aggregate no doubt has some usefulness,\nbut it is a mistake to label this aggregate a measure of \"the national income.\"\nEvery item of individual income entering into it is a relative and gets a par-\nticular numerical value from the fact that it assumes a certain position in rela-\ntion to all the other individual items. The substantive figures of private account-\ning, all of which are relatives, are useful as control devices in determining\ncomparative positions of individual business concerns, including households, one\nwith another. But the sum of the operating results of all these individual units,\nthat is the sum of a series of telatives, is certainly not a mere enlargement of\nindividual items. Among other things, this means that above all we are not\nentitled to take this sum of individual incomes and assume that it indicates any-\nthing with reference to the income possibilities of the economy if the stream\nof income were to be distributed on a different basis. (Shades of Huey Long!)\nHow much would sixty million tons of steel be worth if distributed equally\namong the gainfully occupied population ? On beyond this lies the consideration\nthat the physical items themselves would change if the claims upon the national\noutput were reshuffled. Thus not only may the market measure fail to include\nmany items which contribute to welfare, but it can give us only a very limited\n\n*S. von Ciriacy-Wantrup, Agrarkrisen und.

These have the effect of shifting the emphasis\nfrom more food to more of the right kinds of food. 'They imply that the\nmalnutrition which causes ill health is due to poor balance in diets as\nwell as to insufficient food.\n\nThese dual aspects of the problem, food and nutrition, suggest the\nbifurcated origin of the international food movement. On the one hand,\nit has sprung from an interest in adequate food for the poorer mem-\nbers of society, in making democracy mean at least enough to eat. On\nthe other, it is an outgrowth of the recent discoveries of the \"newer\nknowledge of nutrition.\"\n\n'The use of the term *movement\" in this connection is carefully con-\nsidered. There was initiated at a given point in time and place a defi-\nnite action toward better human feeding; and that action grew and\nexpanded into what took place at Hot Springs. What the confines of\nthis movement will be in the next several decades depends very much\nupon the course of world history. In due time, whatever happens, such\ngains as are achieved will spread out over society and the movement as\nsuch will fade out.\n\nThe time and place of initiation of that part of the movement that\nsprang from the newer knowledge of nutrition are the League of Na-\ntions, in the early 1930's. The Health Organization of the League had\nbeen working for some time on nutrition as a factor in health, and the\nInternational Labor Office had approached it from the standpoint of the\nwelfare of labor. But these efforts were of interest to scientists only\nuntil High Commissioner S. M. Bruce of Australia came forward at the\n1935 League of Nations Assembly with his proposal for the *marriage of\nhealth and agriculture,\" and the setting up of a *mixed committee,\"\ndrawn from agriculture as well as from labor and authorities on health,\nto consider the possibilities of a program that would relieve agriculture\nby disposing of its excess output at the same time that it would get\nmore food into the mouths of the world's underfed millions.\n\nThe Mixed Committee on Nutrition that followed comprised repre-\nsentatives of the two groups in the League that had been working on\nnutrition and of the International Institute of Agriculture (Rome),\nand a group of students of nutrition and food supply drawn from dif-\nferent countries. Its report, published in 1937, undertook first to state\nmore or less quantitatively the nature and extent of malnutrition in\ndifferent parts of the world. For example, it concluded that three-\n\n1 See. Nutrition and Public Health, League of Nations, Geneva, 1935.

Conference on Food and Agriculture which met\nat Hot Springs, Virginia, last May, comprising delegations from 45\ncountries, had a dual task; first, to point the way to increased agricul-\ntural production in the post-war world in order to provide nutritionally\nmore adequate diets for the people of every country, and second, to\nstart pruning, paring and weeding the jungle growth of restrictions that\nhave grown up to hamper the course of international trade in food-\nstuffs. It was hoped that the conference would set in motion the evolu-\ntion of a constructive international program for the production and\ndistribution of larger and more nutritious food supplies.\n\nFollowing as it did upon the work of the League of Nations Com-\nmittee on Nutrition, the Conference had little difficulty in putting a\nstrong case for expanding food production throughout the world:\n*\"There has never been enough food for the health of all people. . . .\nProduction of food must be greatly expanded. . . .\" It resolved that\n*the governments and authorities here represented immediately under-\ntake the task of increasing the food resources and improving the diets\nof their people.\" In asking for the creation of an international body\nto develop its program, the Conference assigned to it a composite\nr\u00f3le: to deal with nutrition, agricultural production and distribution.\n\nIf the governments of the United Nations were to act upon these\nresolutions in the same spirit in which they were adopted we might\nwitness a revolutionary reorientation of governmental policies dealing\nwith agriculture. In the recent past these have been aimed at increas-\ning prices in the interests of producers rather than at providing cheap\nand nutritious meals for the undernourished elements in the popula-\ntion.

But in most of these discus-\nsions the problem of international trade relationships between socialist\nstates and the analysis of the consequences of international exchange\nof goods and services and the movement of capital in a world com-\nposed of socialist planned economies has been neglected. Yet in view\nof the fact that socialism is essentially international in character, an\nanalysis of these relationships is clearly necessary.\n\nThe early socialist writers said little about this problem. This was due\npartly to their concept of a world revolution which would establish\nsocialism all over the world, thus ruling out international exchange in\nthe narrow sense, and partly due to the dislike of socialist writers of\npresenting a detailed analysis of economic relationships which would\nexist after the victory of socialism. Marx had outlined the general law\nof historical development from capitalism to socialism, but since it was\nimpossible to say exactly at which stage of capitalistic development\nthe actual transition to socialism would come, the specific pattern of\neconomic relationships under socialism was unpredictable and depended\non the particular historical conditions of this development. The early\nSocialist writers gave therefore only the barest outline of economic\nrelationships under socialism and expressed the belief that the diffi-\nculties, maladjustments, and frictions of the capitalist mode of produc-\ntion and distribution would be solved if the system of production\nfor profit were replaced by a system of production for use.\"\n\n* Mr. Hoselitz is research assistant for the Social Science Research Committee at the\nUniversity of Chicago and at the same time part-time research assistant at the Institute\nof International Studies at Yale University.\n\n1A statement by Karl Kautsky may serve as an example: \"In a socialist society it is\nnot profit but the wants of the members of society which constitute the incentive to\nproduce. Kind and size of production are determined by wants, and production increases\nonly in the degree as the wants of the members of society increase. . . . There does not\nexist any more the division of labor between industrial and agrarian countries. The antag-\nonism between export industries here and infant industries there, just as that between\ndomestic and foreign agriculture, which produce violent opposition today, cease to exist.\"\nHandelspolitik und Sozialdemokratie (Berlin, 1911), pp. 94-95.

For the most part such\napproaches have stemmed from Robert Hoxie's pioneer thinking in\nthe field. There is no need at this time to discuss these variations on\nthe original Hoxie theme, except to say that essentially these variations\nboil down to a conception of the existence of two kinds of labor organi-\nzations; namely, conservative and progressive.

When the war\nends, there will be a scramble by all nations for available supplies in order to restore their\neconomies to a peacetime basis as speedily as possible.\n\nExperience after the first World War has shown that such a scramble can result in\ncomplete demoralization of supply, price, and other factors in a peace-time economy. It is\nimpossible to see how such a situation can be met unless through some form of combined\nmachinery. Existence of the Combined Raw Materials Board might contribute substantially\nto the solution of this important postwar problem.\"\n\nIt will be noted that continuation of the Combined Raw Materials Board\nand others of the Combined Boards into the transition period at the end of\nthe war, while it would be in line with Professor Taussig's general position in\nfavor of gradual de-control, would differ from his proposal in several im-\nportant respects. The most important relates to the representation on the\ncontrol authority. At present, only the United States and the United King-\ndom are directly represented on the Combined Boards (except that Canada\nhas been given a place on the Combined Production and Resources Board).\nAllotment by the Combined Boards, unless their membership should be ex-\npanded, would not meet Taussig's desire for a broadly international arrange-\nment. His plan contemplated representation of consuming as well as supply-\ning countries on the central board of control and allotment which he pro-\nposed. Under this central board he wished to have committees on different\ncommodities, and on these committees representation would vary in accord-\nance with the commodity positions of the different countries.\n\nWashington, D.C.

This time, previous experience is being cited. The view appears\nto have gained wide acceptance that it was a mistake to abolish the wartime\ncontrols so suddenly after the last war. The result was a scramble for short\nsupplies, which brought sharp increases in prices and led to wasteful at-\ntempts by producers, handlers, and users to hold large inventories in anticipa-\ntion of further price rises. This, of course, further intensified the general short-\nage. The people in war-stricken areas, who had the direst needs but the least\nability to compete in a sellers! market, found it difficult to get the materials\nrequired to re-start their production, Everywhere complaints were heard of the\nshortage of raw materials. It was one of the principal topics of early post-war\nconferences on international economic questions. The first meeting of the\nInternational Labour Organization (November, 1919) and the first meeting\nof the International Chamber of Commerce (June, 1920) debated raw mate-\nrial allotment. The Council of the League of Nations at its tenth session\n(October, 1920) set on foot an inquiry into the difficulties experienced by\nmany countries in securing the imported materials which they needed,\n\nSuddenly, however, the boom ended, and the raw material situation re-\nversed itself, Before the expert engaged by the League had finished his report,\nprices had slumped disastrously. As the report put it:\n\nAccumulated stocks are vainly waiting for orders from purchasers. . . . Under the pres-\nsure of holders of stocks, the richer States have gradually come to abandon, or at least to\nlimit, the policy of restrictions and of export duties. . . . The decrease in prices is causing\nholders of stocks to place them upon the market at a very low price . . . while consumers\nare waiting for still more favorable purchasing conditions. . . .

To avoid\nthis result it appears essential, first, that the large block of enemy tonnage now idle in\nenemy or neutral ports should be brought into use; and secondly, that it should be used\nunder Allied direction and in accordance with a general Allied plan. . . .\n\nThese recommendations had been unanimously adopted. The statement went\non to say that the same considerations would appear to apply to raw materials\nand other commodities generally, and that persons representing the com-\nmodity interests involved appeared to be in full accord.\n\nIn answer to the telegram from Mr. Cotton, Mr. Hoover sent a message on\nNovember 8, 1918, which read in part as follows:\nThis Government will not agree to any programme that even looks like inter-Allied con-\ntrol of our economic resources after peace. After peace over one-half of the whole export\nof food supplies of the world will come from the United States and for the buyers of\nthese supplies to sit in majority in dictation to us as to prices and distribution is wholly\ninconceivable. The same applies to raw materials; Our only hope of securing justice in\ndistribution, proper appreciation abroad of the effort we make to assist foreign nations,\nand proper return for the service that we will perform will revolve around complete\nindependence of commitment to joint action on our part.\"\n\nMr. Hoover in the same telegram suggested a relief commission patterned\nafter the Belgian relief organization. Such a European relief commission\nwould \"above all\" prevent *the extension of the functions and life of Inter-\nAllied Food and Maritime Councils either now or after peace.\" Secretary of\nState Lansing, in transmitting Hoover's message, added that the Department\nof State entirely approved the policy thus set forth. Similar views were also\nheld by Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo and by Bernard M. Baruch.

The essential point is the\nestablishment now of a general policy of international allotment, on terms\nfair for all the world, allies, neutrals and enemies.\n\nPresident Wilson replied to Dr, Taussig that he had \"at once arranged, in\norder that the matter might have the most serious consideration, to have\nMessrs.

As long as agriculture was the dominant section of the economy\nand thereby provided the major portion of the real income of the economy,\nthis responsibility tended to mitigate the worst results of an industrial con-\ntraction.

Nevertheless, the\nfact that the farmer has made a living while he assumed an additional respon-\nsibility under the worst possible circumstances\u2014alone\u2014should indicate that\nenterprises in general could prosper if the responsibility was universally\nadopted to increase the flexibility of the economy and thereby maintain pro-\nduction and employment in the entire economy.\n\n"

During this same period, the\nadversely influenced enterprises will be taking some action to maximize profits\nor minimize losses. If they strive to reduce other costs they are contributing\nin some manner to increased efficiency since the enterprise can save very little\nby not using the productive forces which they are paying, and as the enter-\nprise must continue the purchase of some raw materials for labor to use.\n\nLikewise any action the enterprise takes toward increased income will be\nbeneficial as it will depend on the best use, not disuse, of the existing produc-\ntive facilities. In many cases an enterprise striving to get the most revenue\nout of an overexpanded production, without piling up a tremendous amount\nof inventory, will lower prices. Lower prices will have a further influence by\nenabling present customers to shift some of their expenditures and thereby\ntend to increase the ability of other enterprises to take listed employees.

But adjustment is stifled at its source by the legal framework of\nthe business enterprise which allows a discard of workers without any regard\nfor the ability of the workers to shift their services to other enterprises.

Rather the size of the gap is determined sometimes by '**banks,\nsometimes by foreigners, sometimes by the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, sometimes by the federal Treasury, and sometimes by busi-\nness corporations\" (p. 611).\n\nWith a directness that would delight the most old-fashioned quantity theor-\nist, Warburton identifies the \"real\" inflationary gap with the \"expansion of\ncash balances in the hands of individuals and business enterprises\" (p. 607).\nIn order to determine the pressure on prices arising from this gap for past or\nfuture periods, he would relate the increase in cash balances to the actual or\nexpected rate of change in production. This, in effect, means that consumer\nexpenditures are determined primarily by holdings of one kind of asset,\nnamely, cash, over which, Warburton says, individuals have little control. It\nneglects other kinds of assets and discounts the paramount influence of in-\ncome.\n\nWith this concept of the gap it is perfectly correct to say that the gap can\nnever be closed by a price rise. Nor can it be closed by increased production.\n\n*! *Measuring the Inflationary Gap,\" Am. Econ.

Some employers reported that they are giving up\nattempting to reward efficiency, because if they raise the pay of a good man,\nthe union then demands that this increase also be extended to others in the\nshop who may be less efficient, but who are performing the same work.\n\nTwo other factors have contributed to the spread of the general increase.\nFirst, the rise in the cost of living during the period under study naturally\ngave an impetus to this type of adjustment as the only fair means of dealing\nwith a condition affecting all employees alike. Secondly the gradual adoption\nby industry at large of the technique of scientific management with its job\nevaluation plans, time studies, and other intricacies has tended to introduce\na certain rigidity into the wage structure. The general uniform wage increase\nthen becomes the only means of adjusting wage levels without disturbing\nthe wage relationship of one job to another.\n\n2. Closely related to this first trend\u2014in that it, too, is a consequence of\nunion organization\u2014is the predominance of the \"cents per hour\" wage in-\ncrease. Wage increases in mass production industries, beginning with the April,\n1941, increase in the steel industry, have tended to be in terms of cents per\nhour, rather than in percentages. On the whole, investigation suggests that\nmanagement prefers the percentage increase while unions prefer adjustments\nin cents per hour. A number of employers reported that they disliked the\nlatter form of wage change because it raised the lower paid employee more\nthan in proportion to higher paid personnel and therefore further diminished\nthe differential between the skilled and unskilled.\n\nIn the steel industry, union leaders justified this narrowing process on\nthe grounds that the industry had developed an unwarranted spread between\nthe lowest and highest rate. But the steel executives maintained that this range\nwas consistent with the skills involved; that with a machinist's rate double a\nlaborer's rate there was an incentive for the latter to work himself up, but\nthat with the union narrowing this differential, the incentive to advance will\nbe seriously impaired. Other employers, however, considered the cents per\nhour increase more equitable in times of rising costs of living, since it gives\na larger percentage increase in income to those very groups of wage earners\nwho feel most severely the rise in living costs. Industrial unions are staunch\nchampions of this position; since they draw their membership primarily from\nthe ranks of the unskilled and semi-skilled it is natural that they should\nchampion that form of wage increase which does most to improve the eco-\nnomic position of their principal constituency.\n\n3. A third significant wage trend\u2014likewise a by-product, in part, of indus-\ntry's reaction to unionism\u2014is the spread of leader-follower relationships in\nindustrial wage policies.

                    "try even if this means higher than average earnings in the company having\nthe bonus plan, because it believes that management would not pay the\nbonus unless it paid for itself. Hence, employees in these companies reason\nthat they must be working harder or more efficiently than \"the other fellow\"\nand therefore deserve higher earnings.\n\nAs a consequence, up to the present, incentive plans have not proved a\nsuccessful means of stemming the rise in the base rate. Labor has been\nunwilling to accept incentive earnings as a substitute for increases in base\npay, because it has been confident of its ability to secure the latter. Now, how-\never, the War Labor Board's firm stand against unwarranted increases in\nbase rates, coupled with its authorization of increased earnings based upon\nincentive pay where such pay is in fact accompanied by increased production,\nmay compel a change in labor's attitude. Labor's traditional aversion to\nincentive plans, based upon a fear (often justified) that management would\nreduce base rates once production increased, need not prove a stumbling\nblock today, for labor's bargaining position under present conditions is so\nstrong that few companies could reduce rates even ii they wanted to. Both\nthe need for increased production and the demands of labor for some form\nof increase in remuneration make it likely that incentive wage plans will\nachieve increased popularity during the duration of the war boom.\n\nIn 1941, a substitute for wage rate increases more acceptable to labor than\nincentive pay was overtime pay. While many companies have adopted this\nmeasure, they realize that labor will not easily relinquish its high earnings\nafter the war, and that therefore substitution of overtime pay may be only a\ntemporary expedient. The final reckoning will come after the armistice when\nlabor may well demand increases in base rates to compensate it for the loss\nof overtime pay.\n\nStudy of wage increases in industrial concerns during the latter half of\n1941 revealed the development of several significant trends in wage policies\nwhich are likely to exert an important influence upon our post-war economy.\n\n1. Evident even to the casual observer was the emergence of the general\nuniform wage increase as the dominant form of wage adjustment in both\nlarge and small companies. General wage increases extending in equal amounts\nto all employees have long been common in large concerns, because they lend\nthemselves well to large establishments, create fewer economic grievances, and\ndo not disrupt job valuations. Until recently, however, wage increases in small\ncompanies were typically not of this kind, but rather varied with the indi-\nvidual according to his length of service, efficiency of production, loyalty,\netc. In the last few years, however, smaller companies have also tended to\nadopt the policy of granting blanket increases of a given percentage or cents\nper hour to all employees in the firm.\n\nEmployers, when questioned, admitted that this is bad policy, that it gives\nthe individual worker little satisfaction, and does not conduce to efficiency;\nyet despite the objections against it, this form of wage change is becoming\nthe dominant form in industry. The principal cause for its spread is union\npressure. Unions favor uniform general wage increases because they conform\nto the union program of \"getting something for everybody\" and because\n",

Inclusion in government contracts of\ncost-plus or flexible wage rate provisions made it possible for them to pay\nhigh wage rates without detriment to profits and thus considerably simplified\ntheir wage problem.? Other companies less favorably situated embarked,\nhowever, upon a \"middle of the road\" policy, granting wage increases with\none eye on labor turnover and the other eye on the future.\n\nConcerns which during this period were able to pursue successfully a wage\npolicy of moderation despite the growing scarcity of labor included companies\nin small communities at some distance from industrial centers; companies\nwith a record of steady employment? which were able to hold employees by\nreminding them of the temporary nature of defense jobs; and companies with\nfriendly employer-employee relations, sickness, health, and other employee\nbenefits. While factual evidence based upon more recent investigation of\nthese same companies is not available, it seems evident that the number of\ncompanies capable of maintaining a wage policy of moderation has suffered\ncontinual diminution. For one thing, war orders are more generally distributed\nthroughout industry today than was true in 1941 and labor has been quick\nto demand its share of the profits accruing from such production. Companies\nstill engaged in nonessential production find that benefits of employer benevo-\nlence\u2014to be reaped at some future date in the event of sickness or old age\n\u2014cannot compare with the jingle of hard cash as a means of retaining the\nloyalty of a working force depleted by the draft and the attraction of high\nwage war industries.\n\nBonus incentive plans have been seized upon by some companies as an\napparently ideal solution to the wage problem. Such plans would seem to\nafford a means of satisfying labor's demands for higher earnings during the\nboom, and at the same time of keeping costs and prices down, since the\nincreased output they elicit pays for the increased disbursements to labor.\nFurthermore, since bonuses automatically disappear when output is curtailed\nand profits decline, such plans would not burden post-war industry with high\nlabor costs.\n\nInvestigation reveals, however, that in 1941 bonus payments were not\nacceptable to labor as a substitute for wage increases. In a number of com-\npanies having bonus plans, unions insisted that regular hourly base rates be\nkept on a par with the rest of the community or with other firms in the indus-\ntry. Employers suggested two reasons for this attitude:\n\n1. Labor wants to raise base rates as high as possible during the boom so\nthat its earnings after the war will continue at a high level, even if some\nreduction in rates is made. Labor is looking ahead and realizes that, while\nbonuses will automatically disappear when production is curtailed, high base\nrates may stick.\n\n2. Labor insists that base rates be on a par with the community or indus-\n\n?^However, a number of employers with large defense contracts, while compelled to\nmake substantial wage incteases to attract and hold personnel, expressed concern regarding\nthe level of wage rates which would remain when the war boom was spent.\n\n*'There is a definite inverse relation between the average length of service of employees\nin a concern and its labor turnover.\n"

While some employers were content to deal with,\nlabor on an opportunistic basis, many companies\u2014particularly the large\nones\u2014had at this date already attempted to formulate definite, though\nadaptable, wage policies for the duration, Wage policies of companies with\nlarge defense orders were, of course, dictated largely by the need for attract-\n\n\"The writer is indebted to the Social Science Research Council for making possible a\nfield survey which covered 55 companies in 15 industry groups, including such large con-\ncerns as General Motors and U.

Agriculture has placed itself at a disadvantage in\nits dealings with the industrial section of the economy by assuming an addi-\ntional responsibility. Even though agricultural workers have moved into in-\ndustrial production during periods of expansion (when they were needed\nmost on the farm), these same workers have returned to the land when they\nwere discharged by industry during the periods of economic contraction and\ndepression (when they were needed least on the farm).\n\nThat this responsibility in agriculture was and is based on a family rather\nthan a legal relationship does not remove the fact that the responsibility has\ntended to maintain the real income produced and the employment of the\nfactors of production in agriculture when other sections of the economy were\ndeclining. As long as agriculture was the dominant section of the economy\nand thereby provided the major portion of the real income of the economy,\nthis responsibility tended to mitigate the worst results of an industrial con-\ntraction. The disappearance of the frontier and the dominance of industrially\nproduced goods now places the problem squarely on the doorstep of the\nindustrial section of the economy.\n\nIt is true that agriculture has not prospered in recent times and that farm-\ning is a way of life as well as a business enterprise, which gives agriculture a\nstaying power that the industrial enterprise does not have. Nevertheless, the\nfact that the farmer has made a living while he assumed an additional respon-\nsibility under the worst possible circumstances\u2014alone\u2014should indicate that\nenterprises in general could prosper if the responsibility was universally\nadopted to increase the flexibility of the economy and thereby maintain pro-\nduction and employment in the entire economy.\n\n"

As a\nresult some outstanding and highly respected economists have resigned and\nothers are going to follow.\n\nThe Congressional amendment poses a question to economists: What is\nwrong with us? Why is it desired and how is it possible to arouse the public\nagainst professors? Why is one professional group to be excluded from, an-\nother preferred for, the holding of certain governmental positions?\n\nThe ostensible reason for penalizing professors is that they, as a group,\nare incapable of fulfilling their administrative functions properly because they\nlack business experience. Formulating economic policies in any federal war\nagency requires two specific kinds of experiences: practical knowledge of the\ntechnical problems of production, marketing, and pricing of factors or\nproducts in the prospective industries and a clear understanding of the\nprinciples of a war economy. Practical business men are more likely to know\nabout trade problems, whereas professional economists are more apt in eco-\nnomic analysis. The new type of war administrator required for the direction\nof the developing war economy, versed in both practical and theoretical arts,\ndid not exist; he had to be trained in his job through trial and error.\n\nBoth business men and professional economists tried themselves; members\nof both groups failed and were weeded out, No statistics of the turnover and\nits causes are available but from the facts that have become public we can\ninfer that the obvious failures were more common among business men. The\ncontention of the Congressional amendment that managers of private enter-\nprises are the only effective public administrators is thus in conflict with the\npersonnel history of the federal war agencies.\n\nIf it had been the intention of Representative Dirksen to improve the\nadministration of war agencies, one of three possible directives could have\nbeen given to the administration. First, to require a preliminary training\nperiod of all division heads prior to their appointment. Second, to promote\npolicy formulating officials from the ranks of the existing personnel of war\nagencies. Third, to stipulate that the two leading administrators of a division\nshould be a business man and an economist who must be in agreement on main\npolicies. The second directive should, in our judgment, become the generally\n\n' Loc. cit.\n",

Finally, a committee on professors and the public service should\nbe appointed that ought to include representatives of all academic organiza-\ntions.

Introduction\n\nAlong with its answer to the principal problem which it set for it-\nself as to how competition allocates resources amongst various uses,\nneo-classical economics bequeathed to the present generation the much\ndebated proposition that competition causes output under \"diminish-\ning returns\" to exceed, and under \"increasing returns\" to fall short\nof, an output corresponding to the social optimum. Since this issue\ninvolves only negligibly any disagreement as to the economic facts,\nsince it is indeed almost a purely quantitative problem not complicated\nby ethical or other preconceptions, one may find difficulty in under-\nstanding how theorists such as Marshall, Pigou, Viner, Graham, Hicks,\nand Lange could be ranged squarely against Allyn Young, Knight,\nand Stigler. The answer seems to be that apparently simple technical\nconcepts are often fraught with confusing ambiguities; and the ex-\ntensive discussion of this subject over a period of years' reveals that\nthese ambiguities have already become perennial.\n\nThe effort to resolve the issues disputed amongst such distinguished\nprotagonists is in itself an interesting undertaking in the development\nof theoretical ideas, but there is also no lack of pragmatic justification.\nThe interpretation of certain commonly employed cost functions, of\nopportunity cost, and of marginal versus average cost can not be purely\n*academic\" matters. Furthermore, the Marshall-Pigou proposals of\ntaxes upon \"industries of diminishing returns\" and bounties upon\nthose of \"increasing return,\" and the Pigou-Graham proposals of a\nprotective tariff in certain instances upon much the same theoretical\nargument, lead directly to important questions of fiscal and commercial\npolicy.

In Section I, several\nalternatives to subsidies are explored, since they may be preferable to a\nsubsidy program in particular areas. Under certain conditions, a rise\nof prices might be the lesser evil.' Again, large price increases might be\naverted even in the absence of subsidies. The government has used with\ngreat success the techniques of averaging costs and differential pricing.\nIf these techniques are not practical and a rise of prices is to be avoided,\nthe government may then have to resort to subsidies.\n\nThe objectives of subsidies are considered in Section II. One ob-\njective is a reduction in the cost of living or a moderation in its rate\nof increase. Another and related objective is the prevention of a rise\nof prices for all supplies to a level set by marginal costs. By paying to\nproducers or suppliers in the form of a subsidy the excess of marginal\ncosts over average costs, the government can encourage additional out-\nput and yet prevent a rise of marginal costs from being translated into\na corresponding increase in prices for all units.\n\nThe more important categories of subsidy procedures are examined\nin Section III. (1) Government purchase and resale has been used\nwidely in the industrial area; but not sufficiently for the purpose of\nreducing the cost of living. (2) In subsidizing additional costs involved\nin high cost and additional output, the government has, in various\nways, stimulated output. (3) A disguised subsidy is involved in the\nassumption by the government of certain services which private enter-\nprise is unable or unwilling to perform at a reasonable price, and in\nthe sale of these services by the government, under certain conditions,\nbelow costs.\n\n* As the Director of the Office of Export-Import Price Control for over a year and a\nhalf, Mr. Harris has had considerable experience in the operational part of subsidy pro-\ngrams. Many subsidy programs, of which this paper gives the theoretical background,\nwere worked out in his office. Mr. Harris assumes personal responsibility for the views\nexpressed.\n\n'The Canadian Minister of Finance has said that subsidies are used \"in the interest of\nthe consumer . . . when there is no other way of assuring adequate supplies . . . at prices\n\npermitted by the price ceiling.\" Dominion of Canada Report of Wartime Prices and Trade\nBoard, September 3, 1939, to March 31, 1943, p. 22.\n"

                    "Comment on Review of Industrial Concentration and\nPrice Inflexibility\n\nOnce an author has committed himself to print he must stand the test of\nprofessional criticism, and such criticism is to be welcomed. However, criti-\ncism founded upon misunderstanding, careless reading or misinterpretation\nand likewise committed to print must stand the test of rebuttal, Mr. John\nM. Blair's review' of my Industrial Concentration and Price Inftexibility\n(Washington, American Council on Public Affairs, 1942) merits rebuttal\npartially on the grounds outlined.\n\nThe reviewer has concentrated upon two chapters of the book dealing with\nthe flexibility of prices relative to costs. The first of these, Chapter V, which is\nconcerned with methods, is somewhat tedious, and if the reviewer passed over\nit in haste he can hardly be blamed. Unfortunately, his criticism of the\nresults of the statistical study, Chapter VI, is largely invalidated by what\nwas written in the preceding chapter on methods.\n\nThe object of the investigation contained in these two chapters should\nbe clarified. It was to determine whether previous studies of the relation-\nship between concentration and price inflexibility (in the sense of amplitude\nof price decline during depression) had ignored variables other than concen-\ntration which would account for inflexible prices. The most important of\nthese other variables which suggests itself immediately but which had gen-\nerally been ignored is variation in prime costs.\n\nIf one industry experiences a drop of twenty per cent in its prime cost in a given period\nand another experiences a rise of ten per cent, it would be unreasonable to charge that,\nbecause the average price of the products of the first industry fell twenty per cent and\nthe average price of the products of the second remained the same, the second industry's\n\nprice was inflexible in view of the changes which occurred. Vet this is exactly the position\nwhich the National Resources Planning Board, for instance, must take?\n\nHaving determined that the relationship of price change to prime cost\nchange merited investigation, the writer then undertook to find the data.\n\nfreight absorption would in no way cure the latter situation and might, in fact, aggravate\nit. There is no reason for focusing upon freight absorption Per se as the principal monopo-\nlistic element or for arguing that the only way in which competition can be preserved is\nto insist upon the maintenance of uniform mill nets by each seller.\n\n^ Am.

As compared with\nthe (unknown!) distribution of income in 1939, almost everyone would agree\nthat the desired end is a more equal distribution. But, assigning some conven-\ntional measure of inequality, the acceptance of this end shrinks as the goal\nof equality is approached. Witness the less than unanimous approval of the\n$25,000 ceiling on salaries. Until the distant day when the welfare economist\ncan assign quantitative orders of importance to various (degrees of fulfill-\nment of) ends, therefore, it seems necessary for him to recommend only\ngradual changes of policy in many areas. This formal conclusion could, I\nthink, be defended on substantive grounds as the only approach which is\ncompatible with democratic social processes.\n\nA century ago John Stuart Mill observed: *Political Economy does not of\nitself instruct how to make a nation rich; but whoever would be qualified to\njudge of the means of making a nation rich, must first be a political econo-\nmist.\" His statement implies the still fundamental and unfulfilled task of\nthe economist.\n",

Talcott Parsons probably had economists in\nmind when he wrote: *For it is a fact that social existence depends to a large\nextent on a moral consensus of its members and that the penalty of its too\nradical breakdown is social extinction, This fact is one which the type of\nliberal whose theoretical background is essentially utilitarian is all too apt to\nignore\u2014with unfortunate practical as well as theoretical consequences.\"*\nAt the level of economic policy, then, it is totally misleading to talk of ends\nas individual and random; they are fundamentally collective and organized.\n\nIf this conclusion be accepted, and accept it we must, the economist may\nproperly exceed the narrow confines of economic analysis.

Some time ago the battery manufacturers went part way with us on this and\naccepted lamps of two battery lives instead of three. This has worked out very satisfactorily.\n\nWe have been continuing our studies and efforts to bring about the use of one-battery-\nlife lamps. I think you will be interested in the attached analysis . . . covering the various\npoints involved in going to the one-battery-life basis.

Ax Alternative\n\nOne may still argue along somewhat different lines that the economist may\nnevertheless put behind his recommendations of policy what little prestige\nthe Office of Price Administration has left him. The fundamental point of\nthis alternative approach may be developed by a brief examination of the\nthesis implicit in the newer welfare economics: that all ends other than\nmaximization of income are value judgments (or, in some sense, more de-\nbatable value judgments) and accordingly unsuited for scientific purposes.\n\nThe familiar admonition not to argue over differences in tastes leads not\nonly to dull conversations but also to bad sociology. It is one thing to recog-\nnize that we cannot frove, by the usual tests of adequacy of proof, the supe-\nriority of honesty over deceit or the desirability of a more equal income dis-\ntribution. But it is quite another thing to conclude that therefore ends of\ngood policy are beyond the realm of scientific discussion.\n\nFor surely the primary requisite of a working social system is a consensus\non ends. The individual members of the society simply must agree upon the\nmajor ends which that society is to seek. If any large share of the population\nactively disagrees with the society's ends, and in particular if it believes that\nthe system is unfair by that group's criteria, the social system will surely\ndisintegrate, probably with violence.\n\nThis view is almost axiomatic in modern social theory; a society is in fact\ndefined in some such terms as *a group of individuals held together by a\ncommon dominant purpose and functioning as an entity.\"5 It would be easy\n\n*W.

Nothing scientific can be\nsaid about distribution, but in appraising exchange policies we may make use\nof two well-known theorems:\n\n1. The marginal rates of substitution between commodities must be equal\nfor all individuals. If this is not so, an exchange of goods will help one person\nwithout injuring the other?\n\n2. Marginal costs must equal prices. If this condition is not met it is pos-\nsible to reallocate resources in such a way as to increase outputs of some\ngoods without decreasing outputs of any.?\n\nIf these theorems are applied to the problem of international trade, for\nexample, they show that income (of all countries together) is maximized by\nfree trade. If landlords are injured by a repeal of Corn Laws, they can be\nrecompensed and there will still be an unencumbered increase in income re-\nsulting from the adoption of free trade. Thus, without facing the ethical ques-\ntion of whether landlords' income is more or less important than consumers'\nincome, one can conclude that free trade is desirable. Whether landlords\nshould in fact be recompensed is of course an ethical problem concerning\nwhich these writers do not venture to make recommendations. (It is fair to\nsay, however, that no undue enthusiasm is displayed for recompensation.)\n\nIL The Objections\n\nAn extension of the foregoing argument will suggest the leading objections\nwhich may be raised against the new welfare economics. Consider theft; our\npresent policy toward this means of livelihood probably has adverse effects\non the national income. Prevention of theft and punishment of thieves involve\nsubstantial expenditures for policemen, courts, jails, locks, insurance salesmen,\nand the like. By compensating successful thieves for the amounts they would\notherwise steal, we save these resources and hence secure a net gain. (If this\npolicy leads to an undue increase in declarations of intent to steal, the retired\nsuccessful thieves\u2014who, after all, have special talents in this direction\u2014may\nbe persuaded to assume the police functions.) A similar argument could, I\nthink, be adduced to show that wars should be fought with checkbooks.\n\nThe replies to this reductio are obvious enough. It may not be quite so\nobvious that they are all applicable to the (typical) case of free trade, so the\nanalogy will be pressed. First, it would outrage our moral sensibilities to pay\nvoluntary tribute to thieves. The maximization of real national income is not\nthe only end of a society. Is it even the first? But surely this point is also\n\n? Movements to a contract curve, in Edgeworth's terminology, can be mutually satis-\nfactory; see my Tteory of Competitive Price, p. 79.\n\n*'This theorem is often stated in terms of proportionality of marginal costs and prices.\nBut in this form it contradicts the first theorem since leisure, one of the uses of a resource,\nmust have a marginal rate of substitution for any other use equal, and not proportional,\nto the price ratios. Indeed proportionality seems to be merely an obvious and sterile\nmathematical generalization.\n\n*'The example is not ideal since it entails the obvious value judgment that income of\nforeigners is as important as income of natives. But this ethical element could also be\nremoved by suitable recompensation by a country of other countries which refrain from\nexploiting it monopolistically.\n",

ARISTOTLE,\nEthics.\n\nThe official view of economists toward questions of welfare has undergone\na complete cycle since the beginning of the nineteenth century. In the classical\nperiod it was not often considered necessary to argue that good theory was\ngood policy. The Benthamites, for example, would have deemed it an empty\u2014\nnay, a misleading\u2014gesture to add, after a demonstration of the desirability\nof free trade, *not speaking, of course, as a scientist.\" Thereafter a reaction\nset in, and grew in authority until recent times. The official attitude (of which\nRobbins is perhaps the best known contemporary exponent) now became\nmore austere: the study of ends was held to be a problem in ethics and the\neconomist qua scientist had no special competence in this field, even as applied\nto economic policy. Quite recently there has been a return to the view that\nthe treatment of welfare problems is an integral part of economic analysis.\nThe new welfare economists claim that many policies can be shown (to other\neconomists?) to be good or bad without entering a dangerous quagmire of\nvalue judgments.\n\nIt is the purpose of this brief paper to examine this latest development. The\nargument will be summarized in Section I, it will be criticized in Section II,\nand an alternative method of embracing welfare economics will be suggested\nin Section III.\n",

                    "Thus, in the case of cold-rolled strip, which is used by Dr. Stigler as an\nexample, the percentage decline in the mill net figures between the smallest\n(1 to 3 tons) and the largest (300 to 1,000 tons) size groupings amounted to\n48.1 per cent. But the decline in the published figures (i.e., base price plus\nquantity extras) between the same size groups is only 8.2 per cent. In other\nwords, the decline in the published quantity extras comprises only a small\npart of the total decline shown in the monograph. This generalization, as may\nbe noted from the table, is true of all the other products analyzed in the\nmonograph, with the exception of steel plates for which the published quantity\nextras on very small shipments are comparatively high.\n\nFor Dr. Stigler's contention still to be tenable, it would be necessary that\nthe remainder of the decline in the mill net (i.e., that which is not due to the\nsmall decrease in the published quantity extras) be caused by a decline in\npublished quality extras. The assumption, however, that large buyers generally\npurchase steel of lower quality than small buyers simply has no justification\nin fact. Rather, the converse tends to be true. In the monograph, it was pointed\nout that ^. , . quality demands on large orders are frequently very exacting\"\n(p. 23). This represented a considerable understatement. The practice of the\nautomobile industry in demanding, and obtaining cold-rolled sheet and strip\nof extraordinarily exacting quality specifications is a well-known case in point.\n\nThus it does not appear that a decline either in published quantity extras\nor in published quality extras, or in both, could be responsible for more than\na small proportion of the decline shown in the mill net figures.\n\nThis indicates the existence of hidden concessions from extras, and it was\nconcessions of this type which were regarded in the monograph as discrimina-\ntory. But Dr. Stigler argues that these concessions might be justifiable on cost\ngrounds and therefore would not be discriminatory.\n\nThis may or may not be true. However, this argument that hidden conces-\nsions are not discriminatory if they reflect decreases in costs would indicate,\nif such were the case, that the published extras are discriminatory. In addi-\ntion, the argument is rather academic since no cost data by size of ship-\nment are available (or likely to be available because of the tremendous prob-\nlems of statistical compilation involved) and since it appears unlikely that\ndecreases in costs would be equal to the declines in the price figures, as shown\nin the monograph. One reason that the declines in costs would probably be\nless than the declines in prices is the fact that each shipment usually does not\nrepresent a separate rolling, since it is the practice of steel mills to group\ntogether a number of qualitatively similar orders which are then run as one\nrolling.\n\nFinally, in trying to make the point that price discrimination might not\nbe indicated by the data in the monograph, Dr. Stigler overlooks the declines\nshown in the base prices. These declines can only be regarded as discrimina-\ntory, since for a given product the base price is supposed to be the same for\nall buyers, regardless of the quantity or quality of the purchase,\n\nJouw M.

If it be held that the basic fiscal period\nfor which we should seek a balance of the budget is not a year but,\nsay, five years, or the period of the business cycle (if that can be suffi-\nciently precisely determined), then, it will be held presumably that,\nif we go into debt during a part of this longer fiscal period and get out\nlater, the budget is not out of balance during the period. From this\nlonger-term point of view, borrowing to meet current expenses during\nany one year is to be regarded as budget borrowing.\" But from the\nannual point of view such borrowing clearly involves budgetary un-\nbalance.\n\nThe emphasis which Professor Fairchild places upon the annual\naspects of fiscal planning leads him to object to so-called permanent\nappropriations as hampering the development of a \"single unified\nplan\" of federal finance for each year.

First, the taxation of spending not only reduces the ability of\nthe community to buy consumers! goods, but in addition encourages in-\ndividuals to save in order to reduce their tax liability. Second, the spend-\nings tax tends to immobilize savings already made. Especially if rates\nare sharply graduated, individuals with substantial savings are likely to\nhesitate to use them for consumption if a large proportion of this spend-\ning is absorbed as tax. Third, both in the higher and lower income\nbrackets income tax rates can become so high as to reduce incentive to\nproduce. A spendings tax avoids the difficulty by substituting a spend-\nings base for an income base so that marginal income tax rates need\nnot become high enough to exert this effect on incentive. Fourth, the\nincome tax is not sufficiently free from inequities to justify further\nimportant increases in rates without refinements in the concepts of\ntaxable income and the taxpayer unit, and in the rate structure, which\nwill require much time and effort to achieve. The enactment of a spend-\nings tax as a supplement to the income tax would make it possible to\nminimize the effect of some of these inequities because at a certain point\nthe tax base would be changed from income to spendings.\n\n\"The first and second of these arguments in favor of the spendings tax\noffer a means of minimizing price inflation, and therefore constitute\nthe primary reason, in the economic circumstances which have prevailed\nup to and through the winter of 1942-43, for urging the adoption of the\nspendings tax. The third argument is especially important when income\ntax rates have been increasing rapidly, but it might have to be re-\nevaluated as the economy became accustomed to high income tax rates.\nFor the purposes of this paper it is mainly the fourth in which we are\ninterested.

There is no reliable indicator that a huge deficit-financed public\nspending program can evade these issues, if it is to create full employment.\n\nThe **no analogy between private and public debt\" spokesmen are strangely\ninclined to sidestep adequate discussion of these issues, In all major instances\nwhere the governments have assumed prime responsibility for output, such\nefforts have been associated with a regimented society.\n\nFurthermore, the growth of a vast public debt would probably encourage\nan increase in the rentier class; the debt would tend to be held largely by the\nbanks and other savers.

What then, may one ask, becomes of the statement that \"Every\nanalogy [of public borrowing] to private borrowing must be completely\nfalse\"?\n\nAs for the day of reckoning, both private and public debtors must avoid\noverextension as evidenced by the bankruptcies of private concerns and the\ninflation, devaluation, and debasement experienced by governments all over\nthe world and through all history.?\n\nTo be sure, there are cases where public debts have grown steadily over\nmany decades without serious difficulty arising. Are there any cases of record\nwhere governments have systematically over long periods of time, as is now\nproposed for the next decades of the United States, deliberately operated on\nvast deficits for extended periods in order to inject into the economy substan-\ntial quantities of extra purchasing power?\n\nSustained and perhaps perpetual deficit financing is justified on the theory\nthat it will so stimulate the economy that additional interest payments will\nbecome quite manageable. The same argument may be made for expanding\nprivate borrowing booms, so long as they last. May the same doubt not be\nraised of perpetually expanding public loans? When borrowing slows down,\nthe economy is likely to stagnate. Additional funds borrowed and spent by\nprivate or public bodies are subject to the principle of the multiplier including\nthe leakages. Once the rate of new loans declines, the economy shrinks; this\nis true of private loans and nothing has been stated to show that public bor-\nrowing is not subject to this same variant of the deceleration principle.\n\nEmploying public borrowing to mitigate the business cycle with the conse-\nquent alternating periods of debt-creation and debt-repayment, thus balancing\nthe budget over the course of the business cycle, is generally accepted by\neconomists as desirable policy. But the recent proposals of those who think\nthat our *mature economy\" calls for perpetual public deficits raises entirely\ndifferent questions.\n\nA private concern\u2014the New York Central Railroad, for example, in the\nfirst 75 years of its history\u2014may go ever deeper into debt so long as the\nfunds are being put to productive purposes and the servicing of the debt is\nadequately safeguarded by the earnings of the company. Similarly a govern-\nment may raise its debt obligations and keep them under manageable control\nso long as the incomes of the people and therefore their taxpaying capacity\nare favorably conditioned. The credit of the government, and therefore its\nability to sell new obligations at moderate interest rates, depends upon the\nlenders! views as to the ultimate solvency of the debtor; the same is true of\nthe New York Central Railroad or any other private borrower.

'The two curves, contends Mr. Kemp, \"differ both in mechanics and in\nunderlying assumptions.\" The Marshallian curve is based upon a utilitarian\nphilosophy which assumes that total utility can be measured quantitatively.\nThe Paretian curve is not based on any such assumption. Hence Mr. Kemp\nsuggests that, to avoid the confusion resulting from the fact that both types\nof curves are used in the formulation of the theory of international values,\na special name be given the Marshallian curve.\n\nIn his rejoinder to Mr. Kemp's criticism Professor Whittaker, in the\nDecember number of the Review (pp. 835-36), admits the validity of\nMr. Kemp's contention that the Marshallian curve is not identical with the\n*jndifference curve\" as used by the members of the Paretian School.

In the Cement Case before the Com-\nmission in the fall of 1942, counsel for the Commission states: *If a\nsingle corporation owned all the mills and attempted to operate them,\nthat is just what it would do to prevent them from competing with\neach other. Such a monopoly would act just as respondent manu-\nfacturers under separate ownership are acting when they use the\n[multiple] basing point system.\"* This statement is incorrect. A\nmonopolist would never adopt the basing-point system, since he could\nalways increase his profits by leaving the price pattern unchanged and\neliminating cross-hauling. It follows that if, as is contended by its\nopponents, the existence of the system implies collusion, it is collusion\nshort of complete agreement. On the other side, it is contended for the\nrespondents in the Cement Case: \"The term [imperfect competition]\nhas no relation to monopoly, does not shade into monopoly. ... It isa\nnatural phenomenon and is the inevitable form of competition in all\nmanufacturing industry. It is entirely consistent with free competition\nand does not imply less or weaker competition, since it is frequently\nmore keen and vigorous than *perfect competition! would be.\"* Suffice\nit to say that no economist would endorse this statement; but the\nstatement was made by learned counsel who had heard the testimony\nof a galaxy of economic talent.\n\nConvincing evidence can certainly be adduced that the basing-point\nsystem neither conforms to the economist's ideal of perfect competition,\nnor to his anathema, pure monopoly. But surely it is obvious that the\nmonopoly-competition controversy from an economic point of view is\nbarren, since the basing-point system involves imperfect competi-\ntion, containing elements both of competition and monopoly; and to\nabolish the basing-point system and require, say, f.o.b. mill pricing\nwould merely substitute one form of imperfect competition for an-\nother. This is the point of view of J. M. Clark? and M. G. de Chazeau.*\nAlthough these writers have clearly recognized the nature of the prob-\n\nfor getting to the heart of economic problems.

Each is forced by the situation itself\nto take into account the policy of his rival in determining his own,\nand this cannot be construed as a *tacit agreement! between the two.\"?\nA further assumption is that \"if each seeks his maximum profit ration-\nally and intelligently, he will realize that when there are only two or\na few sellers his own move has a considerable effect upon his com-\npetitors, and that this makes it idle to suppose that they will accept\nwithout retaliation the losses he forces upon them.\" As a consequence,\n*No one will cut from the monopoly figure because he would force\nothers to follow him, and thereby work his own undoing.\"?\n\nIn evaluating the assumptions underlying duopoly and oligopoly it\nshould be observed that an essential feature of ordinary market com-\npetition is that traders have as complete a knowledge as possible of\nsupplies, bids, offers, prices, etc. In the light of all the available in-\nformation, traders are constantly readjusting their buying and selling\nvaluations; each one is constantly forced to consider the action of his\n\nEprrow's Nork: The author is professor of economics at the University of Washington,\nSeattle.\n\n!

Industrial production and wholesale prices stood at 107\nand 93, respectively, on a 1935-39 base. Three years later, in August\n1942, gross national product was 167 billion dollars (annual rate),\nindustrial production was up 74 per cent, and all wholesale prices\nexcept farm products and foods had risen 19 per cent. Farm prices, on\nthe other hand, had risen 85 per cent, while an important fraction of\nthe 18 per cent increase in agricultural production must be credited\nto favorable weather.\n\nExcept for imports and strategic war materials, the impact of the\nwar at the outset was largely speculative. Spot prices of 28 basic\ncommodities and of critical materials jumped 25 per cent in September\n1939. But the cost of living was almost unchanged at the year's end,\nand nine months after the attack on Poland the entire price structure\nhad softened and production was drifting back toward pre-war levels.\n\nFollowing the swift conquest of France and the expulsion of the\nBritish army from the continent, this country launched a 12-billion-\ndollar defense program. The Advisory Commission appointed to direct\nthe program included a Division of Price Stabilization. In the field of\ndirect price control, the job was mainly to restrict speculation. The\nconference (or *jaw bone\") method of price control was successful in\nthe case of copper, steel, and many other metals but was less success-\nful in the case of lumber.\n\nFrom the middle of 1940 until the spring of 1941, total industrial\nproduction increased 25 per cent while durable goods production in-\ncreased 43 per cent. Wholesale prices rose only 3 per cent. The spring\nof 1941 marked a turning point on the price front.

The existing explicit price schedules covering a number of spe-\ncifically defined commodities were mainly continued, but to the re-\nmainder of the economy the new regulation applied, with a group of\nimportant exceptions, a general \"freeze\" of the prices of all goods\nand services at the highest levels at which actual deliveries or offers\nwere made during the base-period of March 1942. The areas directly\naffected by this new control were primarily the retail sales of com-\nmodities and services, though manufacturing and wholesaling were\ndirectly influenced in many cases and indirectly in others.\n\nThe record of administration of this regulation has been one of con-\ntinued retreat from the declared objective. In almost the first days of\nits life, a procedure was established for adjusting the individual re-\ntailer's prices upward to the going-level for specific classes of sellers in\nparticular communities. The same principle was later applied to whole-\nsaling and manufacturing. There followed a succession of amendments\nauthorizing increases in the general level of prices for particular com-\nmodities, and establishing the governing principle of replacement\ncosts plus customary rates of markup for certain groups of seasonal,\nnew and unstandardized commodities covering a wide range of both\nconsumer and producer goods.\n\nOn the enforcement front also difficulties were encountered. The\neducational task proved to be a formidable one, particularly at the\nretail level where the most severe problems had been anticipated. The\ncontrol of services raised almost insurmountable difficulties. Compre-\nhensive price freezing is at best extremely hard to enforce.

General equilibrium is nothing more than\nthe problem of the interaction of individual economic organisms, under\nvarious conditions and assumptions; as a necessary preliminary to its\nsolution, an adequate theory of the individual organism itself is neces-\nsary. This consists of two main parts: first, an account of the circum-\nstance, or environment, facing an economic organism, described in in-\ndividual demand curves, purchase curves, expectations, and so on,\ntogether with a \"principle of maximization,\" a criterion by which to\njudge the various possible actions of the organism in order to select the\n*best.\" Second, from the principles discovered in the first part of the\ntheory, a technique must be devised to describe the reactions of an or-\nganism to changes in its environment: how, for instance, a change in the\ndemand for its product will affect its sales.\n\nThe \"Cambridge Theory\"\u2014if so we may describe the essentially\nsimilar' doctrines of Mrs. Robinson and Professor Chamberlin\u2014made\none important step forward in the techniques of analysis, 7.e., the use of\n",

                    "Saving of Individuals in Relation to Income\n\nIn a recent article Mordecai Ezekiel raised the interesting question as to\nwhether individuals in this country tend to persist in habits of consumption\nspending; that is, whether during years of decreasing income they tend to\nspend more and to save less in relation to their income than during years of\nincreasing income. Partly to answer this question, Ezekiel made two analyses,\none of data on private saving and the other of data on consumption. Un-\nfortunately, both analyses include serious errors of data or of interpretation,\nas we shall briefly point out.\n\n1. Functional Relation of Saving and Income. By an oversight, the values\nfor saving (total offsets to saving, according to the Currie definition) as given\nby Ezekiel in his Tables I and II and also as plotted in his Figures 2 to 5 are\nall erroneous for the years 1929-40 because they omit the net contributions\nof the state and local governments. The omitted amounts varied from 1.4\nbillion dollars in 1931 to minus 1.2 billion dollars in 1934. The corrected values\nare plotted in Figure 1.? Comparison with Ezekiel's corresponding Figure 5\nshows that the corrected points for the seven depression years 1930-36 lie only\nabout half as far, on the average, from the trend line drawn symmetrically\nthrough them.\n\n2. Functional Relation of Consumption and Income. In his Figures 8 and 9\nEzekiel plots consumption as a function of net national income whereas he\nshould have used gross private income as in his Figures 4 and 5. Estimates\nof consumption are obtained by subtracting estimates of saving from estimates\nof income; hence, a plot of consumption vs. income is also a plot of saving vs.\nincome; and the choice of income used determines the kind of saving plotted.\nAs a result of Ezekiel's choice of net national income, his Figures 8 and 9\nand his corresponding equation really relate to net total saving, including\ngovernment net saving, instead of to private saving; hence, no conclusion\nas to spending habits can be drawn from this analysis.\n\n3.

                    "Buchanan's Theory of Fluctuations in Business Profits\n\nIn the December, 1941, issue of the Review! Professor Buchanan proposed\na \"general theory\" which accounts for fluctuations in business profits in flexi-\nbilities in demand and price as they affect gross income, and the degree of\nproportional variation of expenses relative to this income. Of prime importance\nin the explanation of the failure of expenses to vary proportionately with gross\nincome are the arbitrary and illogical accounting methods of the rule of *'cost\nor market whichever is lower\" for inventory valuation and the straight-line\nmethod of depreciation. Because of this fact, he says, it is time to re\u00e9xamine\nthese accounting techniques of the individual concern because of the adverse\neffect which they have on the total economy.\n\nBoth of these accounting techniques, according to Professor Buchanan,\naugment profits in prosperous years and diminish them in poor ones. It is\ngenerally true that in the case where market values at the end of the year\nare less than cost, accountants may allow, and perhaps erroneously, an external\nfactor of price fluctuation to affect the cost of goods sold, and this practice\nmay accentuate the fluctuation in business profit for that year.? The net effect\non the profit for a particular year depends, of course, upon whether the\nbeginning inventory was taken at cost or at market prices. Accountants will\nnot, however, understand or agree with his statement that the rule of the\n*]ower of cost or market\" augments profits in periods of rising prices (p. 738).\n\n* Details of the calculations, based largely on Kuznets, of. cit., will be furnished by the\nwriter on request.\n\n1 N.

                    "Price Control and Rationing\n\nCertain of the recent contributors to the Review writing on price control and\nrationing have ignored what seems to be the most important question of all.\nMost people concede that the present war will be in part decided by the rela-\ntive economic efficiency of Germany and the United States. Hence the ultimate\ncriterion of any program for freezing prices and rationing commodities should\nbe its contribution to economic efficiency as judged by wartime needs; i.e.,\nthe satisfaction of only the most essential needs of every family or person with\na minimum expenditure of resources retained from the war effort. Compared\nwith this it is immaterial if the prices of goods rise or fall.\n\nThe Administration presumably has no trust in the allocating efficiency of\nthe price system in time of war because of the considerable income inequalities\nwhich exist amongst consumers and because contracts based on costs prevent\nmaterial prices acting as rationers amongst defense firms. The increasingly\nfavored alternative is to distribute agents and final products by direct action\nmethods and to freeze the devitalized prices according to popular dictates.\nFailing supplies of essential products will then be subsidized.\n\nThis cure may be worse than the ailment. The labor cost of bureaucratic\nallocation is considerable for all concerned. It would be an overly complicated\nrationing scheme which would ensure the marginal employment of all scarce\nconsumption goods being of equal importance. Obviously, this goal will never\n",

During the past ten years the discussions of\ndeficit financing have revived this issue but apparently have done little\nto settle it. Those who, following the Keynesian analysis, have favored\ndeficit financing have concentrated their attention upon the income-\ngenerating potentialities of debt creation and have dismissed the ques-\ntion of the burden of the debt in later years with the general statement\nthat an internally-held debt imposes no economic burden. On the other\nhand, those who have made special studies of the latter question have\nfrequently arrived at a different conclusion.\n\nSince the federal debt will increase greatly during the present war,\nit is a matter of considerable importance to know whether that debt\nwill be an economic burden in the post-war years. It might influence\nour attitude toward borrowing during the war; it would certainly affect\nour attitude toward deficit financing after the war.\n\nIn the discussion which follows it is assumed that the large post-war\ndebt will be held internally, that a considerable proportion will be held\nby commercial banks, and that the debt will never be reduced substan-\ntially, but that interest will be paid regularly. It is also assumed that\nCongress will continue to frame tax laws as in the past, giving more\nheed to political than to economic considerations, but that the level of\ntaxation will be much higher than in the past, with considerable re-\nliance upon a progressive personal income tax and a heavy corporate\nincome tax.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the point under consideration is the\n\n'See, for example: Ursula K.

This magnitude\nchanges from hour to hour and from year to year. Alterations of this\nmagnitude have highly significant consequences. One of the most\ndangerous economic fallacies is, then, the idea that saving equals in-\nvestment. Real saving is but another aspect of real investment; but\nit is financial saving, not real saving, that diminishes the demand for\ngoods and expands the demand for securities.\n\nSome precision will be needed in this analysis. The following defini-\ntions are therefore submitted not because they are especially novel,\nbut because the rigidity of concepts characteristic of investment analy-\nsis will facilitate revelation of the elements omitted by Mr. Keynes\nand by many other writers. References to their writings must, how-\never, be restricted severely. Even the briefest examination of each of\nthe many differences among concepts would expand the discussion of\ndefinitions to such length as to preclude a survey of the results that\ncan be secured through the use of more accurate concepts.\n\nIn order to examine the phenomena significant for this purpose, all\nassets or property must first be divided into three classes: money,\nproducts, and rights. Money will exclude interbank and United States\ngovernment deposits but will include all other demand deposits and\ncurrency in circulation except cash in the vaults of active banks. The\nsignificant distinction is, therefore, that between the next two items.\n\nA $roduct is any good such that its sale creates either income or\nordinary revenue for some producer. Because of this resort to an\naccounting concept, products may be distinguished from other goods.\nThese products include business inventories as well as the services\nrendered by men and by property. The purchase of a product by either\nbusiness man or consumer advances the process of current production\nthrough one step.\n\nRights, as the term will be used here, consist of all assets not in-\ncluded within the definitions of money or of products. A house, when\nin the possession of some home owner, would therefore be a right;\neven though a few months earlier, if then in the possession of some\nspeculative builder, that house would have been a product. To a home\nowner the selling price of his house would not be ordinary revenue.\n",

In September 1940 when\nefforts at price control were first informally begun, there were already\nthose, marked by the experience of 1917-18, who advocated a general\nfreezing of prices and wages. The majority of economists, however,\nopposed such wide and drastic action at that time. The impact of the\narmament program was still extremely uneven, and it was felt that price\nand wage increases in certain areas might usefully serve to redistribute\nresources and to stimulate output, at least up to the level of current\nfixed capacity. Control was instituted in those individual markets where\nexisting and anticipated war demands were most strongly felt and where\nsubstantial price increases had already taken place\u2014at first largely\nmetals and metal products, and lumber. During the year 1941 most of\nthe basic materials, other than farm products, and some semi-fabricated\nand finished goods, were brought under control.\n\nBetween February and December 1941 some 45 formal price sched-\nules were fixed. In December 1941 and January 1942, with the sharp\nacceleration in production and production plans, 42 schedules were re-\nquired. In the year ending January 1942 the average monthly increase\nin wholesale prices was at a rate of 1.7 per cent; in the month after\nPearl Harbor, at a rate of 2.6 per cent. Retail prices rose even more\nrapidly. The control of prices through individual markets was no longer\nfeasible.\n\nBroadly, then, history will regard selective price control as the instru-\nment more or less appropriate to the early stages of rearmament, the\n\n'Eprrom's NorE: This paper was presented to the Review by Professor Edward S.\nMason, chairman of the Conference on Price Research, with the following note: \"The\nannual meeting of the Conference on Price Research at the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, May 8, 1942, was devoted to a discussion of general maximum price control and\nof rationing. The speakers at the conference were Donald Humphrey, Hans Neisser, Paul\nO'Leary, Harold Rowe and Richard Gettell of the Office of Price Administration, and\nA. F. W.

                    "By W. ALLEN WarLis\n",
                    "I\n\nThe growing scarcity of consumers' goods makes the problem of\nrationing them increasingly urgent. Sugar, typewriters, bicycles, auto-\nmobiles, tires, and gasoline are already subject to direct administrative\nrationing. Although no widespread infringement of the sugar regulations\nis apparent, the experience with tires and gasoline, if it should become\nmore general, would be tragic. Even with sugar the cost of administra-\ntion is not to be blinked at in a country straining every nerve toward\nwar production.\n\nA fundamental difficulty with administrative rationing is that equal\nallotments do not result in equal treatment or equal sacrifice. This has\nbeen recognized for tires and gasoline, and varying quantities have been\nallowed different classes of consumers. But no administrative board can\nappraise the merits of claims for allotments above the minimum, nor\ncan it control the disposition of the commodity once allotted. Perhaps\nit can determine that a gasoline user's work is important for defense\nand that no public conveyance is available; it cannot judge whether he\ncould shift his residence, change jobs, ride with a neighbor. And most\nof its problems are far more complicated than this one. For success a\nrationing board requires a nearly unanimous feeling by the general pub-\nlic that rationing is necessary, that the board's methods are proper,\nand that its administration is competent, uniform and impartial.\n\nIn our economy goods have normally been apportioned through the\nprice mechanism. The commodity goes to those who want it badly\nenough to pay the price, this being dependent upon need or taste for the\ncommodity, upon the acceptability of substitutes, and especially upon\nincomes. 'The income element in determining the distribution of goods\nand services is always a source of social concern. This concern occa-\nsionally results in direct allocation of goods and services outside the\nprice system, notably free education and medical facilities, and more\noften it leads to efforts to redistribute income, notably through pro-\ngressive income, gift, and inheritance taxes.\n\nIn wartime the r\u00f3le of income in rationing through the price mecha-\nnism becomes crucial, whether the peacetime distribution of income\n",

                    "Introduction\n\nRationing is a logical concomitant of any policy designed to control\nretail prices, since it is the only way in which the discrepancy between\nmounting consumers! demand and limited supply can effectively and\nequitably be handled. To fix prices at the retail level without a general\nplan for rationing would result in an informal sort of rationing by the\nseller wherein any prejudice or preference he may have could exert an\nundesirable influence; iso facto rationing is a prerequisite to any pro-\ngram which would distribute limited supplies equitably to the consum-\ning public.\n\nSince the fundamental theory of rationing is to equate demand and\nsupply and thereby perform (in a limited sense) the function of the\nprice mechanism, any plan of rationing must seek to regulate the flow\nof rationed commodities from the manufacturer to the retailer as well\nas the ultimate sale to the consumer. Once it is decided some form of\nrationing is necessary, fari passu it follows that a complete program\nco\u00f3rdinating output and consumption must be adopted. Specific ration-\ning, such as point rationing, if effectively administered, can equate\ndemand and supply and distribute limited supplies equitably among\nthe consuming public. Specific rationing has the virtue of being able to\nmeet particular problems of economic maladjustment as they arise.\nGeneral expenditure rationing, while it will bring about a state of sta-\nbility in the general price level, will create innumerable problems of\ndisequilibrium in the case of particular commodities, the impact of\nwhich would tend to disrupt the entire economy for some period of time.\n\nAs this discussion is developed, it will be shown that, though Mr.\nKalecki fully appreciates the theoretical necessity of a program of ra-\ntioning, his plan for carrying out such a program is both theoretically\ninvalid and practically quite unworkable.\n\nThis paper will demonstrate that the general principle of expenditure\nrationing is quite incompatible with the present program for price\ncontrol in the United States.\n",

                    "I. Introduction\n\nModern economic analysis might be dated as beginning with the\nintensified study of the forces of demand. The use of the demand curve\nhas accompanied this development almost from the start. Nevertheless,\ndespite the importance of this analytic tool there are few thorough-\ngoing discussions of the foundations on which the curve rests. Isolated\nremarks are found in abundance, especially so in recent years when the\nconventions of earlier practice have been called into question. It is\nprobably time to integrate these remarks and to see where they lead:\nto contrast them to the older ideas and their end-results.\n\nIn the discussion, attention will first be devoted to the older, and\nmore usual, views of the demand curve. Actually this amounts to an\nexamination of Marshall's assumptions. For not only did he take the\ntrouble to mention its grounding, in contrast to lesser luminaries, but\nhe also did most to implant the curve in the general and professional\nconsciousness, although not actually the first to use the concept.\"\n\nAfter surveying Marshall's ideas, stress will be placed on the major\ntheme of the article, namely, of the interrelations among demand curves.\n\"Then, after consideration of some supplementary matters, a restatement\nof the assumptions on which the demand curve rests will be offered.\n",

Among those who antedated Marshall were Cournot, Jevons and Walras in content\nif not always in geometry. Vet I think the r\u00f3le attributed to Marshall is merited. But\nsee the use made of the curves by Fleeming Jenkins, The Graphic Representation of the\nLaws of Supply and Demand (London: Series of Reprints of the London School of\nEconomics, No. 9, 1931).

He shows\nthat the replacement of labor by the machine may reduce the utilization\nof existing equipment, because it sy increase the volume of speculative\nbalances and /ower the size of the current money flow. Throughout my paper\nI assumed, in accordance with most of the former writers on the subject\nof technological unemployment and for the sake of the argument, that *'Say's\nLaw\" was in force, i.e., that an appropriate money flow was maintained. Since\nMr. Hagen admits that this is possible (second paragraph, second sentence of\nhis note), my analysis seems to cover wider grounds than his. Moreover, one\nfundamental proposition of short-run price theory, viz., that supply curves\nare positively inclined, is needed by Mr. Hagen as well as by me, although Mr.\nHagen seems to dispute that. Were the supply curves horizontal, then total\nunemployment (voluntary and involuntary) in the Keynesian system (which\nunderlies Mr. Hagen's argument) could be eliminated by the simple device\nof increasing the stock of money. Surely, unemployment existing solely because\nof the inadequacy of the monetary institutions could not be called technologi-\ncal according to customary terminology.\n\nMr. Hagen misjudges the relative positions of our theoretical arguments\nbecause he seems to have difficulty in recognizing a theoretical idea if it is\ncouched in terms he is not accustomed to. Witness his footnote 4: *Neisser's\nargument that the quantity of fixed capital is of peculiar importance . . .\nin limiting employment, seems totally untenable. . . .

                    "The Introductory Course: Comment\n\nExperience has led me to agree with many of the comments of Messrs.\nRichard Clemence and Francis S. Doody, in the June issue! as to the diffi-\nculty of teaching theoretical economics to beginning students who are uncon-\nvinced of its value and whose economic studies are confined to a single semes-\nter or academic year. I should suggest, however, that this objection holds not\nonly against the type of theoretical presentation normally given freshmen\nand sophomores, but also against the Keynesianized presentation advocated\nby Messrs. Clemence and Doody and embodied to a considerable extent in\nthe excellent text of Messrs. Meade and Hitch. The propositions of Mr.\nKeynes and his followers appear to the typical college sophomore\u2014and I\nthink I speak from experience\u2014as difficult and as abstract as do the rami-\nfications of comparative advantage, marginal utility, or monopolistic com-\npetition. Students with business experience are frequently dissatisfied with\nthe stress laid by Mr. Keynes on interest as a causative factor in determining\nthe level of income and employment. Others refuse to accept the savings-\ninvestment equality without a great deal of highly involved and elaborate\nargument along Robertsonian lines. A smaller and more select group regularly\nobjects to the treatment of all labor as homogeneous. Disentanglings and\nmodifications are of course possible, but they take more time than they are\nworth, except to a tiny minority of potential economics *\u00abmajors.\"\n\nIn attacking the essentially institutional introductory course, Messrs\nClemence and Doody do not lay sufficient stress, it seems to me, on three of\nthe most telling objections to it: First, the inclusion of so wide a range of\ntopics and problems as is included in any of the institutionalist texts, or even\nthe inclusion of any profuse selection therefrom, makes the discussion of any\nsingle topic, be it banking or war economics or social security legislation,\nso sketchy as to add little but memorized facts to the student's pre\u00e9xisting\nknowledge as obtainable from the daily press. Second, this sketchiness of\ntreatment, plus the absence of any standards of theoretical reasoning, serves\nto strengthen the student's initial appraisal of economics as a branch of the\nforensic arts, in which any opinion is as good as any other, and in which\nacceptance is dependent on oratory and authority.

                    "Over 7 billion dollars in foreign-owned assets are now subject to\nregulation by the United States Treasury Department. (See Table on\np. 266.) The presence of extensive exchange controls in a country long\ndistinguished as the foremost champion of free exchange raises ques-\ntions of the most far-reaching significance for the future course of\ninternational finance. It will be the concern of this paper to examine the\ncircumstances under which the American controls operate with a view\nto determining what conditions may be necessary or desirable before\nthe United States can safely reopen its money markets to foreigners.\n\nThe immediate objective of any exchange control is to bring foreign\ntransactions under the scrutiny of a governmental agency in order that\nthe particular purposes of the government may be enforced. While\nthese purposes differ widely among the various countries, they ordi-\nnarily are concerned with (1) the rationing of foreign exchange ren-\ndered scarce by continued strains, arising from the balance of payments,\non cash resources,? and/or (2) the supervision of imports with a view\nto influencing the terms of trade or in support of internal economic\npolicies of the government. In general it may be said that government\nintervention in the foreign exchange markets has been provoked in most\ncases either as a necessary feature of governmental regulation of trade,\nor as a sort of temporary receivership for deranged national accounts,\nwhere the alternatives\u2014uncontrolled currency depreciations or formal\ndevaluations\u2014were thought to be more onerous methods of securing\nthe needed correction in the balance of payments.\n",

The hypotheses tested in the last article were:\n\n1. Saving is a function of the current level of income, increasing as\nthe level of income increases, but at a higher rate.\n\n2. Consumption is a function of the current level of net income, in-\ncreasing as the level of income increases, but at a lower rate than in-\ncome.\n\n3. The patterns of thrift, expenditure, and consumption at any given\nlevel of income are habitual patterns of action, changing only gradu-\nally in time, so that changes in current income received by each group\nproduce reasonably consistent changes in total consumption and saving.\n\nIn this article we shall examine for the same period the apparent\nrelation of investment to income while holding constant, where possible,\nthe effects of other related factors. Since by our definition in any one\nyear total investment equals total saving, the over-all relation must be\nthe same as that already shown in Figures 4 and 5 of the previous\narticle. This presents a difficulty which is similar to that of attempting\nto derive both a demand curve and a supply curve from a series of prices\nand quantities. However, we may gain a much better understanding\nof how the yearly equilibrium of total saving and investment happens\nto have been struck at the levels of gross national income prevailing\nduring each of the past twenty years if we look further into the com-\nponent elements of investment and how they are related to income and\nother factors.\n\nIn addition to studying the behavior of investment under the fluctuat-\n\ning conditions of the past twenty years, we shall also investigate what\n\n!

Since the phrase is now break-\ning into the newspapers economists are obliged, if only in self-defense,\nto have a clear understanding of it.\n\nThe currency of the phrase is, of course, a reflection of the enormous\nwartime increase in government spending and the resulting danger of\nserious inflation. Although the phrase is new, the idea that it represents\nis familiar; namely, the excess of demand over supply at a specified\nprice, applied to total effective demand, aggregate supply, and some\nprice level. The concept is most often used in connection with tax policy,\nspecifically in calculations of what amounts of additional taxation are\nrequired to prevent inflation.\n\nInstead of considering first the meaning or rather the various mean-\nings of the term \"inflationary gap\" and then considering estimating pro-\ncedures, it may be more instructive to reverse the order and to consider\ntwo estimating procedures first and then to compare their meanings.\n\nAll procedures involve a comparison of estimates of the potential real\noutput of goods and services with estimated demand, based upon as-\nsumed levels of defense expenditures. In most cases some recent date is\ntaken as a base. It is assumed that the prices of this base date are the\nones to be stabilized and therefore that the gap at that date is zero.\nConsequently, the various supply and demand factors are expressed in\nterms of changes from that base.\n\n1. The procedure used in a report soon to be published? compares the\nexpansion of real output with the increase in defense expenditures\n(supposedly on the basis of deliveries of defense material) and obtains\nas a difference the necessary reduction of civilian output.

I shall pass in review, and appraise, a recent\nnewcomer in the long series of efforts at quantification in economics,\nthe literature on statistical cost functions.\n\nThe subject invites comparison with a closely associated develop-\nment, the measurement of demand functions. From Gregory King to\nMarschak's most recent contribution, the process has been one of ever\ncloser interpenetration of facts and theory. It is typical, for instance,\nthat even to Marshall, aware though he was of the influence of factors\nother than price, elasticity of demand exclusively meant elasticity\nwith respect to price, all other factors expressing their influence\nthrough either shifts or distortions in that price-quantity function.\nMarshall never used the concept of income-elasticity of demand. It\nwas for H. L. Moore, the econometrician, to develop the idea of gen-\neralized partial elasticity coefficients of demand. As to the particular\ndependence of demand upon income and its elasticity, a relatively\nrecent, and essentially measurement-inspired addition to the econo-\nmist's toolbox, its possibilities for the further development of theo-\nretical reasoning have already been exploited by Bowley and Allen,\nand have certainly contributed to shape Hicks's ideas. In other words,\nMarshall, the theorist, could afford to be content with stating \u00a3e law\nof demand\" ceteris paribus. But attempts at measurement very soon\nmade it necessary to find out what exactly the more important ones\namong the \"other things\" really were. For measurement of the price-\nquantity function is possible only if the influence of the ce\u00a3era is suc-\ncessfully eliminated, and in order to eliminate we must know Aat and\nhow much. The devices invented for the purpose of isolating what to\nMarshall was \u00a3\u00a3e law of demand have in turn proved stimulating to\nreasoning of a purely theoretical kind.\n\nLater I shall examine whether a similar development can be expected\n\n'A paper presented at a joint meeting of the American Economic Association and the\nEconometric Society, held in New York, December 29, 1941.\n"

Students,\nin larger and larger numbers, are looking to the teacher of economics\nfor an explanation of the great changes that are everywhere taking\nplace.\n\nIn quieter times students begin their study of economics without\na great deal of enthusiasm, and the first few meetings of the class often\nsucceed in putting an end to whatever small interest in the subject they\nmay originally have had. In days like the present, however, the teacher\nof economics, in his annual retreat from reality, finds it increasingly\ndifficult to take his students with him. He is brought face to face with\nresponsibilities which become no easy matter to evade. Not that most\nteachers are particularly anxious to evade their responsibilities to their\nstudents, but in more peaceful days they may easily do so without being\naware of the fact. This is no longer possible in periods of rapid and\nviolent change, and the teacher of economics finds himself in a difficult\nand embarrassing position. The teacher himself, we hope to make clear,\nis not wholly to blame for his predicament. It is but one of the\nsymptoms of the generally unsatisfactory state into which the course\nin introductory economics has fallen. Indications are not lacking that\nthere is a growing appreciation of the inadequacy of much of our teach-\ning, and the time may well have been reached for a clear formulation\nof the issues.\n\nThe teacher of economics has accepted a position carrying with it\ngreat responsibilities, for he claims to possess both an understanding\nof the course of events beyond that of ordinary men, and the ability to\nimpart this knowledge to others. The results of current teaching in\nmost courses in general economics, however, make it difficult to believe\nthat most teachers are living up to their claims. Economists, of course,\ndo not pretend to be able to explain everything important that is\nhappening in the world of reality. Yet, nearly every competent teacher\nof economics knows vastly more of vital interest to his students than\nhe ever tells them. Our students need all the help we can give them\ntoward an understanding of the forces shaping the future of America\nand of the world, but we seem obstinately determined to talk about\nanything and everything else.\n",

                    "War Financing and the Distribution of Income*\n\nIt is commonly asserted that one advantage of borrowing over taxation in\nthe present juncture is that taxes enacted now will distribute the burden less\nequitably than would later peacetime taxes collected to pay off the bonds.?\nThis assertion does not seem to me at all to reach the real issues involved. It\nhas little relevance for the distribution of the current war burden, and it\nseems as likely as not to be incorrect in viewing the distribution of income by\nclasses over time.\n\nIt is surely well established by now, though unfortunately not yet recog-\nnized by some of our congressional leaders, that the burden of the present war\neffort cannot be sloughed off by this generation onto later ones, by borrowing\nor otherwise, Thus the argument that future peacetime taxes may be more\nequitably allocated than present ones is largely irrelevant for discussion of an\nequitable distribution of the current war burden, even assuming that future\ntaxes actually can be more equitably distributed (which is far from certain).\nIn considering the allocation of the burden of war financing, the real com-\nparison must be between the distribution of the tax burden now and the bond\nburden now (including the price inflation which will probably come with bor-\nrowing), rather than between present and future taxes. And if it is true that\nthe very low income groups lose especially from inflation\u2014and there is con-\nsiderable truth in the statement\u2014then even the fact that the rich buy the\nbonds does not necessarily mean a more equitable distribution of the present\nburden through borrowing, since borrowing from the rich is especially likely\nto draw on otherwise \"idle\" funds and speed price inflation.\n\nThe question of the relationship of war financing and income distribution\nover time (as distinct from the distribution of the war burden) is a much more\nsubtle one than has been generally recognized. It is by no means clear that\nthe low income groups are better off if we borrow now than if we tax, even\nthough future taxes are. assumed to be more progressive than present ones\n\n! am indebted to Dr. R.

His explanation of this is facili-\ntated by the distinction between loan interest and basic interest. Loan interest\nis used in the ordinary sense, referring to the amount of money paid by bor-\nrowers to the lenders of liquid funds. According to Gesell, the loan rate must\nalways equal the rate of return on real capital assets, whether the loan be\nmade in conventional money or stamped money. Loans contracted in stamped\nmoney will bear (loan) interest as long as the demand for loan capital exceeds\nthe supply at a zero loan rate.'* A zero loan rate must await the day when\nunimpeded accumulation causes capital assets to lose their scarcity value.\n\nIn saying that basic interest would disappear with the introduction of\nstamped money, Gesell means that the consequences which flow from the use\nof conventional money would be eliminated and processes set in motion which\nin time would reduce the loan rate and the real rate to zero. When this has\ncome about, interest income will disappear, and rentier capitalism will be at\nan end.\n\nIn this respect Gesell's ideas on long-run social reform are closely analogous\nto Keynes's *euthanasia of the rentier.\"*5 'The secular decline in the marginal\nefficiency of capital is another expression for Gesell's long-term reduction in\nthe rate of return on real capital. Keynes tells us he believes that, within a\nperiod of a generation or two, unchecked accumulation would make capital\nassets so abundant that they would cease to yield a return in excess of their\ncost.^ Both Keynes and Gesell maintain that pure interest can be made to\ndisappear without socializing the instruments of production. In the new so-\nciety individuals would still be free to accumulate, but their wealth would\nnot grow automatically through interest accruals. Nevertheless, skilled risk\ntakers would be free to venture their capital in new and uncertain enterprises,\nand if successful, would get a return in excess of their original investments.\nThus the advantages of individual initiative and enterprise would be retained,\nwhile nonfunctional income and other undesirable features of the capitalist\nsystem would disappear.\n\nThe immediately significant difference arising from the substitution of\nstamped money for conventional forms is that all resources would be con-\ntinuously employed. Basic interest would not exist as a barrier frustrating new\ncapital formation.

In Hitler's famous list of twenty-five points, one of\nthe two points in bold-faced print calls for the *Brechung der Zinsknecht-\nschaft,\" i.e., for the abolition of *interest slavery.\" Although this anti-finance\ncapital outlook is significant, care must be taken not to identify the liberal,\nhumanitarian premises of Gesell's program with the fundamentally different\ntotalitarian premises of the Nazi party.\n\nIn order to explain how unemployment, crises and unearned income could\nbe remedied, Gesell employs a threefold classification of interest rates: the\nbasic rate (a theoretical rate), the rate of return to real capital (an estimated\nrate), and the loan rate (a contractual rate). Basic interest is described as a\npurely monetary phenomenon which has nothing to do with time-preference,\nwaiting, or the so-called *productivity\" of capital. It does not represent any-\nthing which exists in the real world, or at least there are no direct outward\nmanifestations of its existence. Gesell says, for example, \"Basic interest has\nup to the present escaped observation because it was concealed behind its\noffspring, ordinary interest upon loan-money. . . . Basic interest is a unique\nphenomenon which must be considered by itself; it is a fundamental economic\nconception.\"5 Attempts to apply the test of correspondence between the con-\ncept \"basic interest\" and the object signified by it are certain to yield nega-\ntive results because there is no signification of object. The concept has mean-\ning, but there is no question of its (immediate) truth or falsity. There can be\nno appeal to facts on this level of analysis.\n\nGesell attempts to clarify *basic interest\" by contrasting it with the *rate\nof return on real capital,\" i.e., with the hire price paid to the owners of assets\nother than money. In comparing this rate with the basic rate, he hastens to\nadd: *We ought to cease designating two such fundamentally different things\nby the same word, interest\"? This is the reference of Keynes's statement that\nGesell distinguishes clearly between the rate of interest and the marginal\nefficiency of capital.!?\n\nThis same distinction between basic interest and interest on real capital is\nalso used to contrast the declining rate of return on real capital assets with\nthe constant rate of return on money. In this way Gesell points out that it is\nthe money rate of interest which checks accumulation and impedes production.\nThe accumulation of capital assets in no way reduces the independently de-\ntermined money rate of interest. On the other hand, the accumulation of\ncapital assets does lower the rate of return on real capital. When the latter\nfalls below the basic (money) rate, accumulation ceases because it is now\nmore profitable to hold money than to invest. This forces those who need\nmoney as a medium of exchange to pay the (now) higher basic rate. This basic\nrate, according to Gesell, corresponds to the \"difference of efficiency between\n\n* Gottfried Feder, Hitler's Official Programme (London: Allen and Unwin, 1934), p. 40.\n\n* Natural Economic Order, pp. 265-66.

Sozialem Staat? contained the kernel of his ideas on monetary policy.\nBetween 1891 and 1898, Gesell published five other works on monetary\npolicy, but nothing specifically on monetary or general economic theory.\nThese were the formative years of his career.\n\nWhen Gesell returned to Europe in 1900 to reside in Switzerland and\nGermany, his practical reform proposals had already been worked out and\npublished in all their essentials. The formulation of his theory came later. In\n1911 he published Die neue Lehre vom Geld und Zins, which formed the\ntheoretical basis for his system of social reform.*\n\nA more detailed discussion is needed to indicate the logical, as distinguished\nfrom the chronological, relation of Gesell's program to his economic theory:\nfirst, because it has been the source of more misinterpretation of his position,\nand second, because of the somewhat more complicated nature of the prob-\nlem. Keynes, for example, has reversed the relation between Gesell's theory\nand program. In discussing Gesell's theory of interest, Keynes says Gesell\n*carried his theory far enough to lead him . . . to the famous prescription of\n*stamped' money.'* Keynes conveys the impression that Gesell arrived at his\npractical suggestion in spite of a *great defect\" in his theory, whereas it would\nbe more accurate to say that Gesell's theory is not, in some important respects,\nan adequate explanation of his practical suggestion. His theory is a refine-\nment of his insight that money should be forced to circulate by means of a\nperiodic tax which would offset the preference of wealth owners for *hoard-\ning\" money rather than spending it for some form of consumable or produc-\ntive wealth.\n\nGesell's contention that interest is a payment to prevent the *hoarding\" of\nmoney classes his interest theory with the \"exploitation\" doctrines of other\nsocialists. He regards the share of total social income represented by interest\nas a deduction from the income created by laborers, including industrial capi-\ntalists. His theory of interest is not, however, the same as the exploitation\ntheory of Marx. Gesell's position is both anti-classical and anti-Marxian. Al-\nthough he avowed himself a socialist and professed to be attacking capitalism\nas a whole, his anti-capitalistic position must be interpreted in terms of his\ndefinition of capitalism as \"the interest exploiting system.\"* In this particular\n",

The relation\nbetween the theoretical and practical aspects of his analysis has been either\nignored, misunderstood or distorted.\n\nGesell's objective as a social reformer was to attack rentier capitalism and\nto substitute in its place an interest-free society. To fortify his reform posi-\ntion Gesell developed a system of economic theory in which he tried to demon-\nstrate that the nonutilization of resources and the presence of nonfunctional\nincome are the inevitable accompaniments of prevailing financial institutions.\nThe most important single phase of his theory as a whole is his theory of\ninterest. In its critical aspect this theory represents an attempt to show that,\nin a system of conventional money, interest income is a payment to prevent\nthe hoarding of money. In its positive aspect the theory is an attempt to\nshow that the introduction of stamped money would eliminate \"basic interest\"\nand thus pave the way to an interest-free economy, The purpose of this note\nis to show that Gesell's theory in general and his theory of basic interest in\nparticular represent an argument for his stamped money proposal. This may\nbest be shown by indicating that the practical insight which led Gesell to\npropose a tax on money was chronologically as well as logically prior to his\ntheoretical system.\n\nThat the practical aspect of Gesell's thought was chronologically prior is\nnot difficult to demonstrate. In 1886, at the age of twenty-four, Gesell mi-\ngrated from Europe to the Argentine to engage in foreign trade and small-\nscale manu\u00edacturing. There he witnessed one of the most speculative episodes\nin the history of modern capitalist development. The great boom from 1885\nto 1890 preceded a long and severe depression which lasted for the duration\nof Gesell's stay in the South American republic. The frustration of industrial\nactivity produced a strong current of resentment against the speculating\nfinanciers, brokers, stock jobbers and mortgagees.

It seems desirable, while\nmemories are reasonably accurate and some of the correspondence relating\nthereto is still available, to give a brief history of this protest. Since my friend,\nProfessor Clair Wilcox of Swarthmore, who was the leading spirit in the\nmatter, declines to tell the story, I take the liberty of doing so.\n\nWith the sharp division of economic opinion in recent years on so many\nissues of public policy, it is hard today to realize the almost unanimous op-\nposition of economists, in the spring of 1930, to the tariff bill then pending\nin Congress. Economic faculties that within a few years were to be split\nwide open on monetary policy, deficit finance, and the problem of big busi-\nness, were practically at one in their belief that the Hawley-Smoot bill was an\niniquitous piece of legislation. What later developed into a statement backed\nby over 1,250 economists originated in a very modest way out of the desire\nof Wilcox and some of his associates at Swarthmore to voice their protest. At\nthe suggestion of Wilcox, Professor Paul Douglas of the University of Chicago,\nwho was then temporarily at Swarthmore, drafted a statement in March that,\nwith some changes in phraseology, was the one given to the press five weeks\nlater. It was decided to ask an economist at each of various eastern uni-\nversities to sponsor the statement, and then to send it to a member of the\neconomics faculty at each American college, with the request that he solicit\nsignatures from his colleagues. Professors E. M. Patterson of Pennsylvania,\nFrank D. Graham of Princeton, Henry Seager of Columbia, Irving Fisher of\nYale, and F. W. Taussig of Harvard, were asked to join Wilcox and Douglas\nin sponsoring the statement. This they all agreed to do. As a result of the\ncomments of these men a few changes were made in the text, and at the sug-\ngestion of Fisher a paragraph was added pointing out the significance of\ntariff policy in connection with America's creditor position.\n\nFisher also made the suggestion that the entire membership of the American\n",

                    "I\n\nIn 1940, output per man-hour in American nonagricultural industries\nwas roughly double that of 1920. In few periods of history has capacity\nto produce goods grown more rapidly than in the last twenty years. The\nindustrial research staffs of American business in 1940 were nine times\nas large as in 1920, and so also were expenditures on research. At no\ntime in the country's history had its capacity to increase production\nbeen so great. And yet the community which possessed this unparalleled\nproductive capacity to improve methods and products did not glory in\nits strength. It was perplexed and baffled. Instead of looking forward\nconfidently to achieving ever rising standards of living, it dreaded the\nfuture. It asked whether investment opportunities were becoming per-\nmanently insufficient, whether the rules for achieving prosperity were\nundergoing fundamental changes, whether new conditions were making\nits economic institutions no longer workable.\n\nThis sense of doubt and inadequacy did not exist, in the United States\nat least, before 1929. It was created by the depression and by the dis-\nappointing recovery. The great national effort required by the war may\nprove to be precisely what is needed to restore the country's faith in its\ncapacity to master great problems. Nevertheless, the task of winning\nthe peace requires that we face frankly the questions raised by the de-\npression and the disappointing recovery. Is it true that new conditions\u2014\nthe decline in geographical expansion, the drop in population growth,\nshifts in economic and political power, and changes in public policy\u2014\nare radically altering the problem of maintaining employment, so that\nplans for the post-war world must envisage important changes in policies\nand institutions? The thesis of these remarks is that the answer to this\nquestion is a qualified Yes.\n",

These studies have led to the\nconclusion that many farm problems, such as restricted domestic markets, excess farm\npopulation, and technological displacement, could find lasting solution only in reasonably\nfull industrial production and employment. This has led in turn to reconnaissance studies\nin the field of industrial economics to determine basic reasons for chronic industrial\nunemployment and low production and to develop possible programs of action to correct\nthose situations. The author feels that perhaps three-quarters of the farm problem lies\nin this field of industrial economic policy, and that programs or actions of farmers\nthemselves can do little to correct this phase of the farm problem. Hence this exploratory\nwork.\n\n*I am indebted to John Maynard Keynes, Alvin Hansen, Gerhard Colm, Walter Salant,\nHans Neisser, and A.

Few of them have given attention\nto the short-run period; and none of them has studied the probable\neffect of taxes on prices in the market period.' The present article is\nconcerned, therefore, with an analysis of the effect of taxation on the\ndisposition and price of goods already on hand, under conditions of\nboth pure and monopolistic competition. In this analysis, it will be\nshown that taxes which affect the disposition of stock-on-hand also af-\nfect simultaneously the rate of output in the succeeding production\nperiod. In other words, it will be shown that the seller's market period\nplans and short-period plans are synchronized? It is the reality of this\nsynchronization which has dictated the substitution of a sequence analy-\nsis for the Marshallian static analysis in the present study.\n\nIn Part I of this analysis, it is assumed that sellers have on hand a\nhighly perishable product for which there is neither the possibility of\ncarry-over nor of self-use. In Part II, it is assumed that carry-over and\nself-use are possible. The two parts of the study are not, however, of\nco\u00f3rdinate importance.

The definitions\nof pure and monopolistic competition which have been adopted in this article are those\nwhich have been given by Professor Chamberlin in The Theory of Monopolistic Compe-\ntition, 3rd ed., pp. 7-9. The analysis of the effect of taxation on price under monopolistic\ncompetition involves the following additional assumptions: (1) that there is complete\nprice interdependence between sellers, and (2) that the effects of selling costs, the total\nof which is assumed to be constant, are represented in the demand curve for the product\nof each firm. Under these assumptions, any one firm may be regarded as a representative\nmember for the group.\n\n*Tn the present study, it is assumed that a producer's plans do not extend beyond the\nmarket period and the succeeding production period. The length of this succeeding perioc\njs assumed to be typical of the production of a particular commodity, with existing scal\nof plant. It is such a \"succeeding period\" which is called the \"short-run period\" in tht\npresent article.\n"

Yet neither author thought it worth\nwhile to give more than passing notice to the phase of his subject which\nby the end of 1941 was the principal topic of discussion; namely, the\nprevention of an unduly rapid rise of money income. For both authors,\nthe fiscal and monetary problem was the prevention of deflation.\n\nObviously, if public expenditures are to be effective as an income\nstimulant they must be so financed as not to decrease other expenditures\naccordingly. Hence the choice for both authors is between deficit ex-\npenditures financed by borrowing from banks with excess reserves or\nfrom holders of capital balances (or conceivably by the issuance of\npaper money), and taxes that do not decrease either private consump-\ntion or private investment. Villard's emphasis is on deficit financing, the\nestate tax being the only important tax which he finds free from a\nsuspicion of having *income-decreasing\" effects.

The ad-\nvantage of considering them separately lies in the fact that a remedy ap-\npropriate to one of them will not necessarily be appropriate to the others.\n\nProposals so far advanced for dealing with the post-war problem for the\nmost part envisage large scale public works of various kinds, the expansion\nof social security programs, governmental action looking toward the revival\nof international trade, etc. These programs, necessary and proper though they\n",

On the basis of his analysis he finds that consumer\nexpenditure and the rise in prices in each of the years 1941, 1942 and\n1943 were about what would have been expected in the absence of\nprice control, rationing, and bond drives, and from this he concludes\nthat these controls have had little influence on the aggregate amount\nof consumer expenditure or on the general level of prices of consumer\ngoods and services.\n\nAlthough Mr. Warburton's argument is ingenious and some of his\n\n* Mr. Mosak is Chief of the Economic Analysis and Forecasting Branch in the Research\nDivision of the Office of Price Administration.

This assumption is not strictly correct, primarily because the supply of\ngoods sold to consumers differs from current output by the amount of changes in inven-\ntories of these goods and such changes are affected by the level of consumer expenditure.\nThe error involved in making this assumption is small, however, and does not affect the\nbroad issues under discussion.\n"

Fiscal policy should be directed at reaching the incomes which in-\ndividuals derive from their property interests in this type of business exactly\nas is done in the case of the partnership and the one-man business. Yet as\nlong as we have a sharply progressive personal income tax which fails to\nreach undistributed corporate earnings an important part of currently pro-\nduced income can escape taxation indefinitely. Corporate earnings cannot be\nignored, therefore, without a drastic redefinition of personal income to in-\nclude annual changes in the net worth of individuals, and this would impose\ntoo serious an administrative problem to be lightly contemplated.\n\nThere is a simple way out. It is to tax the entire income of the corporation,\nincluding that paid out as interest on long. and short-term obligations, at\nthe maximum rate applied on personal incomes with full credit to the in-\ndividual for the tax paid by the corporation on his behalf. The individual, of\ncourse, would have to include in his gross income his share of the earnings\nof the corporation before the tax. Assumption of the tax by the corporation\nshould be prohibited.\n\nUnder this arrangement a stockholder would be informed, for example, that\nhis share of the taxable earnings of a given corporation was $100, that,\nsay, $60 had been paid to the United States Treasury, that $20 had been\nplaced to reserves, and that a check for the balance, $20 was enclosed, to-\ngether with a certificate showing the amount of the tax. The certificate should\nbe made fully negotiable and should bear interest. The taxpayer would then\nfigure his taxable income on the basis of $100 received from the corporation,\nfigure his liability and pay the tax in the required installments in the event\nthat he sold the certificate. If he elected to hold the certificate, he could use it\nas an offset or as the basis for a claim for a refund in the event of an over-\npayment.\n\nThis method of taxing a corporation would require some changes in the\npersonal income tax. One would be to abandon the double tax structure made\nup of a normal and surtax in favor of a single schedule of rates applicable\nto net taxable income. The maximum rate should be brought down as rapidly\nas possible to a figure that would not paralyze risk taking. Fifty per cent\nseems to me to be the appropriate maximum applicable on the fraction of\nincome above, say, $500,000. This maximum should remain unchanged over\nextended periods of time, but whenever it was changed the corporation with-\nholding tax should be changed accordingly. To meet the changing require-\nments of government and the changing requirements of the economy in the\ndifferent phases of the business cycle, the beginning and intermediate rates\nshould be varied, as well as certain excise taxes. Our yen for progression can\nbetter be satisfied by the maintenance of a highly progressive federal estate\ntax and through a spending program which benefits the poor without coddling\nthem, i.e., expenditures on education, vocational training, health, etc.\n\nSuch a reform would have several advantages: It would give us a stable\ncorporation withholding tax which would assure the government of ample\nrevenues while the Treasury was working out with the individual his exact\ntax liability. A substantial fraction of personal incomes would be taxed in\nthe year of accrual. In a bad year a taxpayer would not have to pay out of\nlean income a tax on income that may have accrued over several years within\n"

It is merely one way of saying that theory and practice are\ninseparable, and that policy is psychologically prior to theory.\n\n'The logical continuity between Parts II and III of von Mering's article\nappears to rest on an exaggerated distinction between \"theorist\" and *poli-\ntician.\" The theorist is viewed first and most importantly as one who elabo-\nrates those aspects of policy to which his theory leads him. Thus we find\nvon Mering saying *. . . Keynesian theory advocates a policy.\" Though\nKeynes's interest in social reform is mentioned, there is no suggestion in\nvon Mering's analysis that a certain theory is articulated because the prag-\nmatically selective perspective of the theorist leads him in that direction.\nIt is easier to agree with von Mering that the politician has little interest in\ntheory per se. The politician likes and dislikes theories because they are or\nare not congenial to the kind of policies for which he stands. The net out-\ncome is popularity for those theories which are most in keeping with political\ntrends. But the world of policy is prior to the world of theory not only in\nthe sense that theories which are to survive must conform to underlying\npolitical trends, but also in the sense that the thought of \"theorists\" represents\na more sophisticated way of thinking about policy. It is commonplace that\nthe \"practical\" man with his characteristic repugnance for \"theory\" does not\nescape theory, but merely succeeds in fooling himself and perhaps others by\nconcealing his generalizations. In von Mering's context a better distinction\nthan that between \"theorists\" and \"politicians\" would be between *good\"\ntheorists and one tvpe of bad\" theorists, and between articulate and con-\ncealed generalizations.\n\nConcretely, in the case of Keynes we have a theorist who has been as\nvitally concerned with policy as any other living economist. He had plans\nfor revising the Versailles Treaty, for monetary reform in the twenties, for\nrelieving unemployment in 1929, a *plan to save the world\" at the World\nEconomic Conference in 1933, a plan to \"pay for the war\" in 1939, and\nmore recently a plan for international monetary stabilization as a phase of\npost-war reconstruction. A study of Keynes's thought in the years in which\nthese writings were appearing shows clearly that his practical concern has\ndirected his theoretical emphasis. Keynes the man of policy has given vitality\nto Keynes the man of theory. He has had ideas in the sense of Dewey's \"plans\nof action.\" Because he was so vitally interested in policy he worked out his\nnew general theory as an argument for his policy. Thus he drew economic\ntheory back to the path of realistic policy.\n\nIt is true, as Dr. von Mering says, the policy for which Keynes stands\nwas already becoming accepted by statesmen and politicians. Here Keynes's\nposition as an interventionist is analogous to Adam Smith's position as a\nspokesman for laissez-faire. Smith criticized mercantilist theory and policy\nin terms of a policy which was already becoming accepted. Likewise Ricardo\ncriticized the corn laws with a new economic theory which arose from\nincreasingly popular free trade ideas.

Few economists would\ndissent from the proposition that if economics is to be a science, there must\nbe an appeal to facts in testing hypotheses.!? Unfortunately the kind of theory\narticulated by economists has too frequently remained of a purely formal\nnature, and on this level propositions defy an appeal to facts. If there is to\nbe empirical verification, some kind of operations, i.e., some policy, behavior,\nor plan of action must be involved either explicitly or implicitly. Thought\nis directed by the necessity of action. If we start with theory, we should try\nto discover its operational meaning, i.e., the operations necessary in order to\nput the theory into practice. After discovering the meaning of the theory in\nthese terms, we may proceed to investigate its validity by an appeal to facts.!?\n\nDr. von Mering's article suffers from the lack of a clear-cut distinction\nbetween meaning of theory and workability of program. Part II is actually\n\u00e0 criticism of the workability of Keynes's program rather than a criticism\nof Keynes's theoretical concepts. Keynes's theory has its meaning in terms\nof a program of reform. One should ask what policy is the counterpart of a\ngiven theory. When von Mering points out that policies other than those\nadvocated by Keynes might follow from Keynes's theory, he is indulging in\nanalyses which have no relevance so far as Keyenes's theory is concerned.\nIn brief, I am contending that these general Keynesian concepts have a\nspecific practical meaning, discoverable by the operational approach, and\nunless this is realized and taken specifically into consideration in evaluating\nand criticizing his theory, we are in danger of wandering all over the place\nand probably will succeed only in replacing the criticized theorist's ideas on\npolicy withour our own ideas about what is better policy. This does a theory\nthe injustice of not criticizing it on its own ground. Von Mering is guilty\nof wandering when he points out that fear of changes in the rules of the\ncapitalistic system may increase investors! preference for liquidity, and again\nwhen he says that the governmental intervention suggested by Keynes may\nlower the marginal efficiency of capital, reduce the inducement to invest and\nthus defeat the main purpose, which is to increase total employment. Von\nMering may be correct in these contentions regarding the workability of\nKeynes's program. But that is not the point here. The point is that he raises\nthe wrong question when he asks, *Does the suggested policy follow neces-\nsarily from the theory?\" It seems doubtful that any policy follows necessarily\nfrom any set of abstract theoretical concepts.

But Keynes's practical sense\nIs too strong to lead him to attach sole importance to the interest rate and so\nwe have the parallel stress on the marginal efficiency of capital, as mentioned\nabove.*\n\nThis illustrates, if only inadequately, what is meant by finding the opera-\ntional definitions of theoretical concepts such as the propensity to consume,\nthe marginal efficiency of capital and liquidity-preference.

The operational approach has come to play an important r\u00f3le in\nmodern philosophy and natural science, but it has been used hardly at all in a\nself-conscious manner in economics. While no attempt will be made here to\nexplore the full implications of this approach to economic concepts, a few\nsuggestions may serve to indicate how such an approach might be applied to\nKeynes's theory.\n\nKeynes tells us the three main gaps in economic theory have been \"the\nanalysis of the Propensity to Consume, the definition of the Marginal Effi-\nciency of Capital and the theory of the Rate of Interest.\"? Around these\nconcepts center the distinctive aspects of Keynes's theory. The operational\nmeaning of these three independent variables can be discovered easily in\nspecific policies advocated by Keynes. Each points to some aspect or sector of\nthe economy which, in Keynes's view, should be influenced to alleviate the\noutstanding fault of modern economic society, unemployment.\n\nIn Keynes's theory the propensity to consume has its most important\noperational meaning in terms of reducing inequalities in the distribution of\nincome and wealth. A more equal distribution would increase the demand for\nconsumers! goods from a given level of national income and thus induce a\nlarger volume of employment and income. The specific means of achieving\nthis aim is through highly progressive taxation in the form of income taxes and\ndeath duties.\n\n'The chief characteristic of the marginal efficiency of capital is its great\ninstability. It is so unstable that at times it may fall so low that no reduction\nin the rate of interest can induce sufficient investment. To alleviate the con-\nsequences of instability in the marginal efficiency of private capital Keynes\nadvocates government direction of total investment, including a public works\nprogram.* In addition, since the stock market is partly responsible for the\ninstability of the marginal efficiency of capital, Keynes recommends a stock\ntransfer tax to keep speculators out of the stock market so that it may function\nin the interest of enterprise rather than speculation.\n\nThe uniqueness of the Keynesian theory of the rate of interest runs in terms\nof the importance of controlling the rate of interest. Here the novel concept is\nliquidity-preference. The essence of liquidity-preference for the speculative\nmotive is that people prefer to hold their wealth in the form of money because\nthey anticipate or fear that the rate of interest may rise in the future to such\nan extent that the loss in capital value from the higher rate of interest will\nmore than offset the temporary gains in the form of annual yields at the exist-\ning low rate of interest. In order to lower the long-term rate of interest it is\nimperative to convince wealth-holders that the long-term interest rate will not\n"

Von Mering's\nprincipal conclusion is that political trends largely determine important new\ndevelopments in economic theory. The adaptation of theory to political trends\nmay take place merely by shifting the emphasis on one or the other of the\nvarious data in the economic system. Without attempting to belittle the\nachievements of Lord Keynes, von Mering attributes the great triumph of the\nGeneral Theory to the fact that it lends scientific support to the important\npolitical trends of the time, whereas the body of doctrine Keynes attacks,\nso-called \"classical\" theory, is often out of line with the necessities of present-\nday economic interventionism. Von Mering expresses surprise that Keynes, in\nreferring to the r\u00f3le of ideas in history, does not mention Pareto's view con-\ncerning the relation between nonlogical sentiments and logical derivations. I\nam surprised that in a discussion of methodology dealing particularly with the\nrelation of theory to practice von Mering does not even mention American\npragmatism. In the following discussion some contributions of pragmatism are\napplied to the problem of the relation of economic theory to policy in the\ncontext in which von Mering discusses it.\n\nWith Dr. von Mering's general conclusion that vital new developments in\neconomic theory arise in close association with problems of economic policy,\nthe writer is in complete agreement. One need only look to the great figures in\nthe histoy of economic thought to find substantial verification of this general\nconclusion. My fundamental criticism of Dr. von Mering's position is that in\nPart III of his article he concludes that policy is prior to theory, whereas he\nanalyzes Keynes's theory in Part II as though theory were prior to policy. The\nrange of consideration is broader in Part III than in Part II, but there is\nnothing in the breadth of consideration which calls for a shift in ground so far\nas the priority of policy is concerned. The following quotations indicate that\nvon Mering assigns priority to Keynes's theory in the sense that he looks on\nKeynes's policy as something which should follow from his theory. In opening\nPart II he poses the question to be answered: \"Does the suggested [ Keynes's]\npolicy follow necessarily from the theory?\" and again, \"The question arises\nwhether, within the framework of the Keynesian theory, the measures just\nmentioned are the only ones to assure full employment\"; and at the close of\nthis section, *. . . the Keynesian theory . . . advocates a policy. . . .\"? I do not\nmean that one cannot start with theory and proceed to an analysis of policy.\nIn fact the following discussion will suggest what seems to be the appropriate\nmanner of doing this. The weakness of von Mering's position lies in the way in\nwhich he relates a particular theory to the theorist's policy. His approach fails\nto consider that paralleling his proposition that politicians prevail over\ntheorists is the no less significant proposition that important new developments\nin economic theory arise specifically from the thought of those who are them-\nselves vitally concerned with problems of contemporary policy. This is not the\nplace to demonstrate the general validity of this latter thesis, but it will be\nshown to apply to Keynes's theory, the particular subject of von Mering's\ninvestigation.\n\n?

The Bureau does not price the very\nlowest qualities of most goods. For families at the lowest income levels there\nis no other alternative, when the poorest quality disappears, but to buy a\nhigher quality even though the price is much higher. It is not possible, as it is\nat the average income level, to shift to a poorer quality item at a price the\nsame as the previous higher quality item. (In addition, of course, increases in\nprices of any item have a greater percentage effect in terms of the income of\nthe lowest level income receivers than at the average level.) Therefore, the\neffect of the BLS index is to *understate considerably the rise in prices en-\ncountered by the families at the bottom of the income scale . . . an important\nfact that should be kept in mind by those who use the index.\"\n\n4.

Before discussing this issue, I should\nlike to comment briefly on the insufficiently informative, and therefore mis-\nleading, character of the review as a whole. By confining himself to an at-\ntempted refutation of Pierson's supposed heresies against the neo-orthodox\npublic investment approach, Professor Sweezy has overemphasized the contro-\nversial elements in the book and has ignored Pierson's own statement that:\n*What follows is not a frogram for ending unemployment.

An example of an actual full-employment program, or\nrather of one segment of such a program, is to be found in Pierson's article:\n\"The Underwriting of Aggregate Consumer Spending as a Pillar of Full Em-\nployment Policy,\" appearing in the same issue of the Americam Economic\nReview? as Dr. Sweezy's review.\n\nI think it genuinely unfortunate that in his interpretation of the purpose\nof the book Dr. Sweezy has failed to inform the reader of its several major\ncontributions to the scientific understanding of objective economic relations.\nAmong these contributions may be mentioned the pioneering, and as yet un-\nequaled, theoretical analysis of the importance and meaning of full employ-\nment and its relation to optimum allocation, the enlightening discussion on the\nnature and forms of production planning and their relation to production for\nmarket, and the exceptionally interesting analyses of the relations to full\nemployment of monopoly, of price level changes, and of foreign trade.\n\nProfessor Sweezy's basic criticism of Pierson's proposal to underwrite\n\n?

An estimated one-fourth of the total,\nvalued at some 15 billion dollars, will consist of non-ordnance items\nof which perhaps half may be located within the United States, the\nrest abroad.

Consequently, Mr. Kaplan\nestimates that 2 to 27/7 billion dollars of contractors! inventories may\nbe suitable for the civilian market.\n\n'The estimate of 1577 billion dollars of government-owned plant and\nequipment is exclusive of military installations. Considerably more than\nhalf of the total has been expended for equipment as contrasted with\nbuildings and structures. Just what proportion may be salable for\ncivilian purposes is questionable; the salable portion probably should\nnot be estimated at more than one-half of the total.\n\nTo summarize the above, the close of the war may find the govern-\nment in possession in this country of approximately 6 to 7 billion\ndollars of surplus goods inventories, exclusive of ordnance, aircraft and\nshipping items, and private contractors possessed of 2 to 3 billion\ndollars of salable commodities. While the government will own more\nthan 15 billion dollars! worth of plant and equipment, no more than half\ncan be expected to be of value commercially.\n\nNo one who has given the matter attention would regard the above\nestimates as useful except as a rough index of the magnitude of the\nsurplus problem.

But the evaluation of an\nentire operating economy, not simply as an investment for outside\ncapitalists, but in terms of whether it is a \"going venture,\" and in an\neffort to ascertain what population it can eventually support without\noutside aid at given standards of living, this is a relatively novel prob-\nlem.\n\nIt seldom occurred to observers to question on economic grounds\nthe mass population movements and colonization ventures of the\nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The existence of large areas,\nsparsely populated by any conceivable standards, the willingness of\nmasses of people to migrate thereto, and the eagerness of investors to\nsupply the necessary capital afforded little basis for criticism. The\nequally obvious returns to the countries whence came the people and\ncapital, in the form of greater markets, greater returns on investments,\nand higher levels of real income than could have been obtained in the\nabsence of such developments, likewise seemed to render superfluous\nany independent external evaluation of these developments.\n\nThe advantages of free international movements of men and capital\nare no longer considered so obvious. The objections which have been\nraised against them have been based, consciously or unconsciously,\nupon a species of evaluation of the current position and future\npotentialities of the economies concerned.

                    "576 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW [SEPTEMBER\n\nno attempt has been made to isolate completely fluctuations in wage rates.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics figures on increases in average hourly earnings\ninclude such factors as premium pay for overtime and night work, incentive\nplans, upgradings, inter-industry shifts in the distribution of manpower,\nchanges in the composition of the work force, etc. In my paper I cited a study\nby H. M. Douty in the Monthly Labor Review of November, 1943, in which\nhe attempts to correct the BLS figures for overtime premium pay and shifts in\nmanpower distribution. The corrected figures show an increase in average\nhourly earnings (manufacturing) of 5.2 per cent from October, 1942, to July,\n1943 (the first 9 months of the stabilization program), as compared with a\n7.8 per cent increase during the previous 9-month period. Although these\nfigures include the other factors cited above, Mr. Douty states that they repre-\nSent *an approximation of changes in average basic wage rates.\" Since Mr.\nDouty is employed by the National War Labor Board, it is to be presumed\nthat he is conversant with the \"official\" views on these matters.\n\nMr. Derber's second comment is in reference to my statement of the man-\ndate given to the Board by Congress and the President. Exception is taken\nto use of the phrase \"rare and unusual.\" Let us examine the only bases on\nwhich increases were to be approved under this mandate.\n\nFirst, maladjustments, or the Little Steel formula: When the country as a\nwhole is considered, the great bulk of plants in manufacturing had effected\nincreases of 15 per cent or more prior to the wage stabilization order.\n\nSecond, inequalities or gross inequities: Although this criterion was abused\nto some extent in the early months of the Board, the November 6, 1942, state-\nment of policy issued by the National Board was rather strict in its interpre-\ntation. Under the present bracket policy, the bracket minimum, which is\ngenerally the terminal point for wage increases, is usually set, not at the\nmidpoint or weighted average of rates being paid for a particular job in a\nparticular locality, but 10 per cent below the weighted average, or at the first\nsignificant cluster of going rates. The *stragglers\" are thus eliminated. Hence,\npresumably only these relatively low wage firms, which would represent a\nminority, would be able to secure approval for wage rate increases.\n\n\"Third, substandards of living: The percentage of workers falling into this\ncategory would depend upon the definition of the term. If $3,000 per year\nwere set as the minimum standard wage, the great bulk of Region IV workers\nwould be considered as living at substandard levels. If substandard were de-\nfined in relation to industry and area patterns, a considerably smaller per-\ncentage of workers would fall into the substandard category!\n\nFourth, prosecution of the war: This has been so interpreted as to apply\nonly to those \"rare and unusual\" cases certified to the Board by another war\nagency.\n\nMr. Derber's third point, with respect to the inflationary character of\ncertain socially desirable practices, is in the same category with the usual plea\nof the individual applicant to the Board who contends that his particular pro-\nposal for increases could not possibly be inflationary because it would mean only\n2 cents to a hundred people! Evidently Mr. Derber missed that sentence in\n"

The source of supply lies in one\u2014or at most\ntwo or three\u2014countries. The bulk of demand lies in other and non-\nproducing countries. Hence a political frontier lies between production\nand consumption, between sellers and buyers, between the two parties\nto the bargain by which the industry is carried on. As a result there\nis no correspondence between the political control and the thing to be\ncontrolled. Accordingly an attack on the problem can not begin with\nobjectives and pass on to policies and program; it must, in addition,\ndiscover or contrive an agency or agencies of regulation.\n\nIf each producer were a separate business unit, nationality might\nnot be a confusing factor. For, tariffs and customs restrictions apart,\nregulation might be left to the market, where political allegiance is an\nirrelevance. But the very fact that the purchasers are under another\nflag tends to remove the legal barriers\u2014and to weaken the moral\nscruples\u2014which stand in the way of collective action by the producers.\nIt makes it easy for them to respond to the \"felt need\" for association,\nto make secure their business, to stabilize their prices, to fix their terms\nof sale. To the buyer is left only the option\u2014in respect to a strategic\nmaterial a nominal one\u2014of taking or leaving it. In ordinary speech,\nthere is monopoly; in legal terms, the contract has gone unilateral; in\ndownright fact, the consumer has been disenfranchised.\n\nIn such a situation the ordinary remedy would be to invoke the\npower of the state\u2014to end the monopoly or to subdue it to the public\ninterest. Here such a resort\u2014except by an uncertain and circuitous\nroute\u2014is out of the question. For the parties who have been put at a\ndisadvantage are not citizens of the states which alone have the power\nto act. A shrewd lawyer will assert that there are devices, e.g., an action\nin rem against the goods, by which jurisdiction can be asserted. Such\nlegal moves, however, are tortuous, uncertain, inadequate to secure\nresults.

That gap, I believe, can be\nbridged by consideration of the possibility that, in the present state\nof statistical information, the approach from monetary theory provides\na more usable over-all measure of how people adjust their expenditures\nto wartime changes in income than does analysis of the customary\nuse of income.\n\nBoth approaches to wartime inflation in the prices of consumers'\ngoods and services start from the habits of individuals regarding their\nexpenditures. The use of income approach asks the questions: What\nis the usual or expected relation of consumers' expenditures to their\nincomes? With a given change in income, what change in consumption\nexpenditure is likely to occur? The monetary approach asks the\nquestions: What is the usual or expected relation of consumers! expendi-\ntures to their cash balances, or of cash balances to expenditures?

The most usual variation in individual incomes was six to seven\ntimes as much income in the year of largest disposable income (1942) as in the\nyear of lowest income (1933). For one family the variation was as high as\nseventeen times as much income in 1942 as in 1933.\n\nIf these family records are grouped in thirds according to amount of dis-\nposable income\u2014under $1500, $1500-$2499, and $2500-and-over\u2014the wide\nvariation in income over the 10-year period seems even more startling (Table\nI). Over four-fifths, or 84 per cent, of the families had less than $1500 in 1933,\nwhile in 1942 only 6 per cent of the families had less than $1500.\n\nADisposable income as used here is the net money receipts after income taxes and\ninterest payments have been subtracted.\n",

Nussbaum and Schweitzer, in the Review for\nDecember, 1943, raise a most important question about the hostility of Con-\ngress to economists, especially in OPA, but they have not yet put their question\nin a form that makes it possible to get an accurate or enlightening answer.\n\nCongress put into the law a requirement that policy-forming executives in\nOPA must have business experience, but that was not an expression of prefer-\nence as between business men and professors. Although Congress did not make\nit wholly clear, they were protesting against something quite different\u2014the\nfilling of government jobs with economists chosen because they were opposed to\nbusiness. The position of Congress was, very properly, that whether this ob-\njective was good or bad, the American people had not appoved it; they had\nnot given approval to stringent wartime controls as a means of changing the\neconomic system, but, rather, it was an obligation of honor not to use their\nself-denial to proceed with an undiscussed change in the character of the\neconomy.

                    "The substance of the above analysis is that while transportation costs,\nwages, rent, and interest costs of retailers in Alaska do demonstrate the neces-\nsity for prices somewhat higher than those in Seattle, they do not demonstate\nthe necessity for prices as high as those actually charged. The implication is\nthat entrepreneural earnings per dollar of investment are Aigker in Alaska than\nin Seattle.\n\nAlaskan merchants are not aware of the fact that their earnings are higher\nthan those of Seattle merchants. For one thing, their concept of normal is\nhigher than the concept held by retailers outside. But more important is the fact\nthat in their thinking they do not differentiate carefully between \"expenses\"\nand \"capital expenditures.\" It is quite common for Alaskan entrepreneurs to\nstart a new enterprise on a very small scale and then to finance expansion by\nthe re-investment of earnings. On the basis of orthodox accounting, the entre-\npreneur makes an enormous rate of profit on his investment each year, but in\nAlaska it is customary to enter the cost of such expansion on the books as a\ncurrent cost of operation.5 As a result of this practice, the books of an enter-\nprise may show small profits year after year while the proprietor actually is\nbecoming wealthier and wealthier. Such accounting procedure is considered\nto be quite proper in Alaska.\n\nThe normality of high rates of profit is probably historic in origin. Most of\nthose emigrating to Alaska in the nineties went there to search for gold and\nmany found it. To such, prices meant nothing so that there was little consumer\nopposition to high prices. On the other hand, the entrepreneurs who entered\nthe Territory during the boom times were, for the most part, attracted there\nby the possibilities of making a \"killing\" in a short time. When the boom\nsubsided many of these merchants closed up shop and returned to the states.\nBy this time permanent inhabitants of the Territory had become accustomed\nto paying high prices. The merchants who remained in business kept prices as\nhigh as the traffic would bear and their efforts were aided by the absence of\nnew entrepreneurs. When cheechakoes\u2014newcomers in the Territory\u2014inquire\nabout the high prices, they are given the stock answer, *High transportation\ncosts.\"\n\n\"This raises the question of why new entrepreneurs did not appear to force\nprices down to a competitive level. The answer is not difficult to find. Most\nof the white inhabitants of the Territory were trappers, miners, or fishermen\nwho knew little about the intricacies of operating a retail establishment. The\nnumber of local entrepreneurs was further decreased by the abnormally large\ncapital investment prerequisite to opening a retail establishment of any size.\nThose who accumulated sufficient wealth from gold prospecting to become\nmerchants chose rather to go \"outside\" to live. A few, with more initiative,\n\n*For example, one small business moved to a new location at a cost of $2,500. This\nexpenditure was for a new store front, installation of equipment, etc., and could quite\nproperly have been charged to operations over a period of several years. However, the\ncharges became a part of the costs of operating for the month in which the change was\nmade. Small businesses are not the only ones that pay off their capital investment in a\nsingle accounting period. C. L. Andrews, in The Story of Alaska, cites the example of the\nCopper River & Northwestern Railway constructed at a cost of $20,000,000. It was paid\nfor out of the profits of the first year's copper mining.\n",

But on the\nwhole wages paid in Alaska are seldom twice the wages paid for the same type\nof work in the Seattle area. Even then, a wage rate twice as high as outside\nwould not necessarily mean twice as much labor costs to the merchant since\nAlaskan labor is very efficient and Alaskan retailers are economical in their use\nof labor. Since establishments are small, much of the labor required is pro-\nvided by the proprietor, aided by members of his family. Then, it must be\nremembered, the base to which the markup applies (landed cost) represents a\nsmaller quantity of goods in Alaska than outside, so that less labor service per\ndollar of goods handled is required. AIl of these factors taken together warrant\nthe conclusion that labor costs in Alaska, while higher than those outside, are\nnot as much higher as the higher markups would warrant.\n\nBesides labor, operatings expenses include rent, light and heat, taxes, and\ninterest on investment. It is difficult to compare rents paid by merchants doing\nbusiness under frontier conditions such as exist in Alaska with rents paid by\nmerchants outside. An Alaskan merchant rents floor space, the location and\nappearance of his premises being of secondary importance to him. Thus the\nfact that a building of modern design would command a larger rental in Alaska\nthan outside is largely academic, since most businesses there do not find it\nnecessary to use buildings comparable in attractiveness to those used by out-\nside merchants, When these factors are considered, there is no reason for\nsupposing that rent per unit of merchandise handled is as high in the Territory\nas it is, for example, in Seattle.\n\nExpenses such as light and heat, while somewhat higher in Alaska, do not\nbulk large and so are not significant to aggregate operating expenses. Taxes in\nthe Territory are lower than those in any of the forty-eight states. This leaves\nonly interest on investment.\n\nBecause Alaskan retailers are located so far from their wholesalers, they\nmust make allowances for delays in shipments. They do this by carrying larger\nstocks of goods. These large stocks result in a greater investment per dollar of\nsales than is normal for retailers in the States. For example, a merchant in\nAnchorage told the writer that he has $3.00 invested for each dollar of goods\nhe sells: one in the goods delivered to the customer, another in goods en route\nnorth to replace the goods sold, and a third accompanying an order south. He\nfelt, therefore, that his gross profit on a dollar of goods sold should be three\ntimes greater than the gross profit of a Seattle merchant in order to earn\ninterest charges on the two dollars! additional investment.\n\nObviously distance from Seattle wholesale markets does increase the invest-\nment of Alaskan merchants per dollar of goods sold, but interest charges at\n8 per cent on an extra two dollars! investment only amounts to 174 cents a\nmonth. Thus, assuming a turnover of four times a year as compared, say, to a\nSeattle merchant's turnover of twelve, an Alaskan merchant would only have\nto increase his markup by 4 per cent of cost to compensate for his added\ninvestment.\"\n\n\"Were it not for the time involved in transportation the turnover period in Alaska\nwould be the same or shorter than it is in Seattle due to the fact that most Alaskan mer-\nchants do not stock style goods and to the fact that markets there are sellers! markets.\n",

The expression has taken\nthe form of unaffiliated unions on a local, industrial, and national scale.\nSome of these organizations employ the same devices used by their\naffiliated rivals; others scorn such devices and place their faith in a\ncommunity of interest between employer and employee rather than in\nconflict of purposes. In the traditional sense, some of them are not\ntrade unions at all, but depend upon employer good will to secure\ntheir demands. For the most part, however, they are genuinely inde-\npendent of the employer and depend upon their own power in col-\nlective bargaining. Many of them, probably the largest number, have\nnever tested their strength in a strike.\n\nThe railroad brotherhoods (themselves unaffiliated) and the Ameri-\ncan Federation of Labor long dominated the field of trade union activity\nin the United States, and that dominance obscured the fact that\nAmerican workers actually shared many of the notions held by other\ngroups in the population. The loudest voices heard in legislatures and\nacross collective bargaining tables have been those of the AFL, the\nbrotherhoods and, more recently, the CIO.

The\npresent writer does not intend to elaborate on the various reasons which\ncan be advanced for the high reputation of the new theory, apart from\nits intrinsic value. But a few points may be mentioned briefly which\npossibly serve as an explanation.\n\nMr. Keynes was a professional economist of great fame before he\nwrote his General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. 'The\ntraditional theory, based mainly on the assumption of private com-\npetition and nonintervention of the government, was unwilling to\ntake the institutional arrangements of the late social liberal era, such\nas powerful, government-protected labor unions, and large-scale gov-\nernment expenditure for the unemployed, as unalterable facts. Conse-\nquently, the neoclassical writers could not give a sufficient explana-\ntion, or rather, they could not indicate a proper remedy, for unem-\nployment to all those who believe that the laws and regulations of\nsocial liberalism cannot be restricted but only extended.\n\nEconomists had done research on the lines of the neoclassical school\nfor many years, apparently pushing forward to the limits in many\nspheres of investigation. Te General Theory became a powerful stimu-\nlus to new inquiries in the far-flung regions of economic studies.\nTheorists with the ability or at least with the inclination to argue by\ndeduction, especially with the aid of mathematical analysis, found\na fertile, almost inexhaustible new field of speculation and \"pure\" rea-\nsoning.

These men are Werner\nSombart, Johann Plenge, and Paul Lensch. Of the three only Lensch was\nan official party member. Sombart, it is true, had been sympathetic to the\nlabor movement and had been fascinated by Marxian ideas, but he was a\nstrong individualist intellectually and there is no doubt that his ideas were\ndeveloped quite independently of his acquaintance with socialist doctrines.'*\nSombart himself, even before his break with the socialist movement, would\nhave been the first to say most decidedly that he remained a partisan only as\nlong as he found himself in agreement with Marxian ideas.\n\nPlenge was never a socialist and never understood either Marx or the later\nsocialist theories, This is rather neatly shown in a book review of Plenge's\nMarx und Hegel which Franz Mehring wrote in 1911.!5 The review is a biting\nsatire of Plenge's ignorance of Hegelian and, above all, of Marxian doctrines.\nEven if this testimony of an eminent socialist theorist were not available,\na glance at Plenge's writings would convince anyone of his utter incompetence\nto stand for anything but his own narrow views; he will also learn that Plenge\nwas not only not a socialist, but not even a worthy critic.\n\nThere remains Lensch. Lensch actually was a socialist, and in his younger\nyears had belonged to the radical wing of the party. He became a deputy to\nthe Reichstag and (together with Haase and Karl Liebknecht) opposed the\ngranting of war credits to the government when it was discussed in the\nAugust 3, 1914, session of the Social Democratic Reichstag fraction. It must\nhave been in the short period between August, 1914, and the spring of\n1915 that he changed his views completely. Part of this change might be\nexplained by Lensch's ambitious character, and by his quarrels with the other\nleaders of the left wing (especially with Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg).\nBe that as it may, one thing is certain: Lensch's conversion was not repre-\nsentative of socialist opinion in general, and his nationalistic outburst was\nflatly repudiated by the majority of the party. Lensch's pamphlet, Die\ndeutsche Sozialdemokratie und der Weltkrieg, was subjected to a ruinous\ncriticism by Karl Kautsky and Gustav Eckstein, who attach to Lensch's\npamphlet such epithets as \"ridiculous,\" *directly wrong,\" and \"erroneous.\"7\n\nIn general the attitude of German socialists during the First World War\nwas one of surprising detachment and objectivity.

It would be strange indeed\nif Bebel had meant these words seriously, since in his report to the Social\nDemocratic Party Conference of the same year Paul Singer, the chairman of\nthe conference, reaffirmed the attitude of the socialists to the military pro-\ngram of the government: *Not a man, not a penny for militarism, for the\nruling military system.\"!* This anti-nationalistic attitude of the socialists on\nnumerous other questions\u2014on agricultural policy, anti-monopoly policy, in-\nternational treaties, colonial policy, and others\u2014could be demonstrated by\na mass of similar evidence.\n"

The reason for this is to\nbe found not only in the more compact logical theory of Marxism, but also\nin the fact that the German socialist movement carried forward the rationalist\ndemocratic ideals adapted from the French Revolution. These ideas had\nslowly filtered into Germany until they had provided the impetus for the\nrevolution of 1848. This revolution for a liberal bourgeois democracy was\nhailed by the socialists as their work, and later they always identified their\npolitical aims and ideals with a considerable part of those held by the 1848\nrevolutionaries. Professor Hayek has thus to admit that after 1870 \"the\nnational socialist elements receded for a time into the background.\"? This\nis rather an understatement since the national elements were completely ab-\nsent among the socialists, even among those who, following Eduard Bern-\nstein, had given up the theory of the social revolution.

It is im-\npossible here to mention all the incidents between the socialist party and\nthe guardians of the idea of a strong nationalist state\u2014in the Reichstag, in\nthe press, and in scientific literature. It must suffice to mention just a few\nexamples. The socialists voted and agitated consistently against government\nmonopolies: for instance, in 1874-76 against the state ownership of the rail-\nroads and in 1882 against Bismarck's tobacco monopoly. In 1892 there took\nplace in socialist circles a debate on state socialism. (The issue was discussed\nat the party conference of 1892 at Berlin and a resolution condemning state\nsocialism was passed by a unanimous vote, The argument was summarized by\nWilhelm Liebknecht, one of the leading socialist deputies: \"The nearer capi-\n\nin his Ferdinand Lassalle und seine Bedeutung f\u00fcr die deutsche Sozialdemokratie (Jena,\n1911), which is criticized in S.

Economically Fichte was a mercantilist; po-\nlitically he became, under the impact of the Napoleonic wars and the elo-\nquent manifestation of the weakness of a divided Germany, more and more\nof a nationalist, without, however, losing himself in purely chauvinist argu-\nments, Later socialists became acquainted with some of Fichte's works chiefly\nthrough Lassalle who considered him an important political philosopher. It\nwould be wrong, however, to claim that he was regarded by anyone as a\nfather of socialism; certainly his influence was much less than even that of\nHegel. It is true that the socialists noted with satisfaction the occasional anti-\nfeudalistic, anti-clerical, or egalitarian ideas in Fichte, but they did the same\nwith the Greek philosophers, the medieval and humanist utopians, and the\nreligious reformers. It would be almost equally preposterous to regard Plato,\nThomas More, Jan Hus, Thomas Campanella, or Winstanley as fathers of\nGerman socialism.?\n\nThe case of Lassalle and Rodbertus is somewhat different from that of\nFichte. Their doctrines were adopted more fully by the socialists than those\nof Fichte, but only in a very limited sense can they be regarded as fathers\nof national socialism. (It would be especially strange if the national socialists\nso regarded Lassalle, who was of Jewish parentage.) The original national\nsocialist writers were not acquainted with either Lassalle or Rodbertus. Their\nnames do not even appear in the writings of Rudolf Jung, Count E. v. Revent-\nlow, and Gottfried Feder. It is likely that Lassalle and Rodbertus were not\nintroduced in the national socialist literature until 1934 by Sombart in his\nDeutscher Sozialismus. A\u00edter that, occasional references to Rodbertus and\nLassalle appear, but I have been unable to locate a single source which\ntreated their views with genuine understanding.*\n\nLassalle and Rodbertus developed similar political philosophies, both as-\nsigning to the state an economic r\u00f3le. Their views were based on the Hegelian\nRechtsphilosophie, but whereas Marx, who also derived his philosophical\ninspiration from Hegel, *turned the Hegelian philosophy upside down,\"\nLassalle and Rodbertus followed Hegel in maintaining that the state is a\nmoral category (sitiliche Idee) standing above the individual. But whereas\nfor Hegel this moral category was absolute (i.e., objectively fixed) and the\nindividual completely subordinated to the state and its purpose, Lassalle\nand Rodbertus assigned to the state a purpose derived from the individuals\ncomposing it. The purpose of the state according to them is to bring about\nthe greatest freedom of the individual, which it achieves by being a welfare\nstate, a \"sozialer Staat.\"5 This view is most clearly expressed by Lassalle in\n\n*In the latter part of the nineteenth century it became fashionable among German\nsocialists to look for egalitarian ideas among the old philosophers and reformers. The\ntwo outstanding examples of this literature are found in Karl Kautsky, Die Vorl\u00e0ufer\ndes neueren Sozialismus (Stuttgart, 1895), and Georg Adler, Geschichte des Sozialismus\nund Kommunismus von Plato zur Gegenwart (Leipzig, 1899).\n\n* The fullest discussion of Rodbertus and Lassalle in national socialist literature is to\nbe found in Friedrich Schinkel, Preussischer Sozialismus (Breslau, 1934), which shows\nlittle understanding of the economic or political theories of either of the two men.\n\n\"The chief exponent of Lassalle's \"state\" or \"national\" socialism was Berhard Harms\n"

                    "I\n\nIn Chapter XII of his recent book, T'e Road to Ser\u00eddom, Professor\nHayek undertakes to show that the political philosophy of German national\nsocialism has its roots in the teachings and doctrines of German socialists.\nProfessor Hayek claims that \"the support which brought these [national\nsocialist] ideas to power, came precisely from the socialist camp,\" that, at\nleast in Germany, *the connection between nationalism and socialism was\nclose from the beginning,\" and that *it was largely with the assistance of\nold socialists that the beginning which produced national socialism rose\nduring this period.\"? This paper will examine the correctness of these state-\nments in view of the political and economic ideology of German socialism.\n\nProfessor Hayek bases his argument on two types of evidence. First, he\nreminds us that pre-1914 German socialism counted among its forbears the\nsame men\u2014-Fichte, Rodbertus, and Lassalle\u2014who are at present recognized\nas the intellectual fathers of national socialism, Second, he quotes several\nauthors whose ideas he claims were formed by their study of Marxian writ-\nings and who expressed strongly nationalistic views. These two facts he con-\nsiders sufficient evidence to convict the German socialist movement of ad-\nherence to extreme nationalism, to a glorification of state power at the ex-\npense of the individual, and to an ideology diametrically opposed to that of\ntraditional liberalism.\n\nA proper analysis of the economic and political ideology of any group con-\nsists in tracing the historical influences operative on the representative ex-\nponents of the group and in fully discussing their views. With the exception\nof Bebel, none of the men referred to by Professor Hayek can be regarded\nas having held leading positions among socialist writers or politicians. The\nappeal to Fichte, Lassalle, and Rodbertus is also deceptive. The fact that\nthese men are regarded as intellectual forbears of socialism and of national\nsocialism does not mean much by itself unless a thorough analysis is made\nof why they have attained this position and which parts of their theories\nhave been taken over. How misleading the simple appeal to spiritual father-\nhood can be is shown by reference to contemporary America, where we find\nsuch diverse groups as the Republicans and the Communists appealing to\nLincoln as their political ancestor; where we find monopolists calling on\nJefferson to protect their \"freedom of enterprise\" from the trust-busters who\nclaim to act on principles of that same Thomas Jefferson.\n\nBefore we can clearly understand the influence of Fichte, Lassalle, and\nRodbertus on both the socialists and national socialists, we must investigate\nbriefly the part of their doctrines that has been adopted by each group.\nFichte started as an admirer of the French Revolution and in his younger\nyears published political tracts abusing the feudalistic and absolutist trends\n\n!

The question is, What do these fine phrases mean?\n\nFor the overwhelming majority of mankind throughout history the answer\nto this question has been provided by revelation and authority, and, con-\nversely, faith and obedience. But the development of reason destroys the\nintellectual sanction of authority and the validity of revelation, with the\nconsequence that reason finds itself confronted with the sixty-four-dollar\nquestion.\n\nThe classical theory of the organization of the economic life of the com-\nmunity through the medium of price is a part of the effort we have made to\nanswer that question. I don't see how anybody can challenge this. It has\nbeen declared and explained over and over again in a thousand different ways,\nand nobody has ever even attempted to explain the origin and growth and\npresent meaning of the price theory in any other way. The question is\nwhether the answer is correct and adequate. Offhand denial that it is any\nanswer to any question seems to me to mean only that the deniers know\nin their hearts that it will not do.\n\nWhat form does the answer take? In effect it is that of referring the\nwhole problem to the individual conscience, one which comports closely with\nthe whole \"Protestant\" trend of modern times, as many students have\nexhibited at length.

The major objec-\ntion to this view, as presented, is not that it won't work? but that it is in-\nadequate, myopic and unbalanced. These faults stem from its failure to\nanalyze and appraise its policy goal. Full employment is neither a simple\nnor an absolute concept. Most of us do not want jobs so much as we want\nthe kind of employment that is compatible with our tastes and our abilities;\nand, more important than either, we require some measure of security of\nincome and the maximum possible opportunity for the independent satisfac-\ntion of our preferences, the exercise of our respective skills and the develop-\nment of our faculties. Full employment, then, is not a simple economic objec-\ntive; it is a complex way of life within which conflicting ends must be com-\npromised to provide the greatest benefits at the lowest feasible cost.\n\nThe full employment goal, as the kind of society in which one wishes to live,\nwill vary from one country to another depending on its cultural and economic\nstandards of living, the heritage of its past and its hopes for the future, By\nneglecting this fundamental fact, the Conference implicitly applied a foreign\nand, in my judgment, a false set of values to its problem. As a nation's stand-\nard of living rises, and ours is the highest in the world, individual oppor-\ntunity and self-determination become increasingly important. The freedom of\nthe individual, political and economic, is an essential ingredient of the full\nemployment goal. Direct state control is a positive, albeit in some cases a\nnecessary, evil.\n\nThe real problem in this country, then, is what is the highest level of\nproductive employment, economic security and standards of living that can\nbe achieved and maintained without direct state controls. This does not imply\nlaissez-faire. The responsibility of the state to establish monetary-fiscal\npolicies and to develop a program of essential public works designed to main-\ntain high employment is at last recognized. The right and duty of the state\nto promulgate and enforce standards of conduct and to protect society against\ninvidious practices of monopoly and quasi-monopoly, whether of business\nfirms or trade unions, are not challenged.

The wartime control agency can and does rely heavily on a general\nfreezing of prices at some arbitrary date. The maintenance of profit margins\non particular products as cost elements change is not vital when the product\nis no longer produced or the firm is already subject to excess profits taxes\nbecause of its earnings from war business. As long as money income and\naccumulated savings in liquid form available for consumption expenditures\ngrossly exceed production possibilities, some measure of price control may\nbe required if inflation is to be held in check. Even after the transition from\nwar to peace, it is conceivable that the attempt to maintain a satisfactory\nlevel of employment will so lower the threshold of inflation that selective\ngovernment control over prices will have to be retained.\n\nBut the object of the Conference is not primarily inflation control. It\nproposes rather to secure for the public the benefits of productive efficiency\nthrough the mechanism of price control and cost appraisal. The object \"should\nbe to achieve, not so much low prices in themselves, as a reasonable relation\nbetween prices and the costs of efficient production, and between the prices\ncharged for different kinds of goods\" (p. 60). Our own experience in public\nutility regulation provides little basis for optimism in such a project. If prices\nare to be fixed by costs, the incentive to increase business income in the guise\nof costs has usually required a proliferation of controls which in the end may\neffectively substitute the judgment of the pricing authority for that of man-\nagement. Combined with profit limitation, price control may lower the quality\nof management and discourage the search for new production opportunities\nand technological improvements.'? If the size of the cake is reduced, the satis-\nfaction of receiving a larger proportionate share may be a poor consolation for\nthose who like cake.\n\nQuite apart from the gigantic task of compiling and analyzing operating\ncosts (and without regard to imponderables in interpretation), the extension\nof price control throughout the economy is of dubious benefit to the con-\nsumers for whose protection it is derived.

To attain and maintain aggregate markets which will provide high\nlevel employment under a free enterprise system is a difficult and, as yet, an\nuntried task. It requires that government establish and maintain a tax system\nwhich will not stultify the willingness to assume risks; that it co\u00f3rdinate the\ncontrol of bank credit with monetary-fiscal measures designed not only to\ndamp inflationary pressures but also to stimulate consumption'? and private\ninvestment?! when markets weaken; that it be prepared to supplement general\ncounter-deflationary measures with a program of public works, if necessary;\nand that it destroy or subjugate monopoly elements (whether business or\ntrade union) which threaten the goal by restrictive tactics.

The Control of Prices\n\nWhere imperfect competition or monopolistic factors exist, the Conference\nbelieves that neither competition nor market forces can be expected to bring\nabout desirable adjustments, Both business and the trade unions must, there-\nfore, be governed by public codes of conduct and their actions submitted *'to\nthe scrutiny of impartial authorities representing the public interest\" (p. 14).\nThis control is suggested for wages and prices as well as decisions with respect\nto conditions of employment, the demarcation of trades or the volume of pro-\nduction. But only price control is discussed extensively.\n\nMaximum price control is apparently expected to be practically universal.\nBased on mandatory uniform cost accounting, maximum prices would be set\non standardized goods to allow to producer and distributor no more than a\nreasonable profit under efficient operation. (High-cost producers, it is sug-\ngested, should be forced out of the market by price control.) The area of\nstandard goods, and therefore of standard price regulations, should be ex-\n\ntaxation.

Smithies takes no exception to the use of the term.\nIndeed, he goes Beveridge one better by proposing that the arbitrary element in Bev-\neridge's *double-budget principle\" might be avoided by choosing between increasing public\nexpenditures or reducing taxes on the basis of comparative social utilities. At the desired\nlevel of total outlays, \"the 'marginal social utility! of taxation should be equal to the\n*marginal social disutility' of taxation\" (of. cit., p. 359).\n\nThe concept of relative social utility is not without meaning as a philosophy of\ngovernment action. Within limits, it even provides practical guidance. Alternative\nproposals for public expenditure can be appraised roughly in terms of their relative\nsocial value. In terms of the incidence of the tax structure, a presumption may even\nbe established that projects so chosen are worth more than the incremental loss to\nthe taxpayers as long as aggregate government expenditures are small. But this conviction\nis dissipated as the volume of public expenditures increases relative to,national income\nand it vanishes entirely when the principle is raised to the status of a rational marginal\ncalculus.

But in the absence of any consideration of the compo-\nsition of the unemployed, of the nature of the costs of reducing the level of\nunemployment, or of the significance of the phrase \"the nearest possible\napproach,\" the objective can hardly be appraised.\n\nA clear definition of the full employment goal is crucial for understanding\nand for intelligent decision of the issues raised. There can be no quarrel\nwith the conclusion that *the government in running its own affairs, cannot\nignore the effects of its actions on the capitalistic system.\"? In this sense, if\nno other, the government must accept responsibility for the formulation and\ncarrying out of a full employment program. If the policy goal is to induce\nhigh employment levels without inflation, prevent major fluctuations in em-\nployment and assure economic security through comprehensive unemploy-\nment insurance and social security, this responsibility of the state can\nprobably be discharged within the framework of its traditional peacetime\npowers without substantive modification of the free enterprise system. But if\nthe goal is a guarantee of jobs (as opposed to income security) for all those\n\n? A. Smithies, 4r. Econ. Rev., Vol. XXXV, No. 3, p. 366.\n",

It is not a set of conclu-\nsions derived from any inductive analysis, to which the reader is exposed, of\neconomic forces underlying business fluctuations and unemployment. Nor is it\na deduction from stated premises or principles with which the reader might\nagree or disagree. It recommends a program which lodges in public authority\nthe final control of basic economic decisions, such as the direction and location\nof real investment, the use of corporate surplus above a reasonable return\nto shareholders, the determination of wages and prices, etc. But, at the same\ntime, it pays lip service to the importance of flexibility and efficiency in pro-\nduction and to the vital need for vigorous private enterprise and co\u00f3peration\nbetween management, labor, and the state.\n\nAt the risk of misrepresenting the real position of the Conference, I\nhave focused attention on the controls which are recommended rather than\non observations with respect to the desired operation of the economy which\nmay or may not be consistent with those controls. And I have directed my\ncomments primarily to the implications of, and the necessity for, those con-\ntrols rather than to the structure of administrative agencies through which it\nis proposed that they be exercised. Finally, because of the breadth of the\nsubject and the limitations of space, I have concentrated on the central\nideas of the Statement even though this procedure magnifies the scope of\napparent disagreement.\n"

                    "There is a growing trend of thought, especially prominent in Great Britain,\nthat economic salvation after the war must be sought in state control. The\nmain current of this opinion flows from many springs: the failure of free\nenterprise to maintain a reasonable level of employment between the two wars;\nthe debacle of the thirties; the rending of the illusion that competition and\nself-interest will secure a desirable adjustment of supply to demand and an\neffective tendency toward full employment; the recognition of pervasive\nmarket imperfections and wastes (call them wastes of competition or mo-\nnopoly as you will); and a complete system of war-born direct controls\nwhich public inertia, fear of the future, the vested interests of those in control\nand conviction as to the benefits of a planned economy now conspire to project\ninto the post-war. These, and similar influences, have produced in Great\nBritain Employment Policy and Organization of Industry after the War (the\nprimary subject of this paper), the Government White Paper on Employment\nPolicy, the Economics of Full Employment prepared by members of the\nInstitute of Statistics at Oxford, and the more imposing Report on Full Em-\nployment in a Free Society by W. H. Beveridge.' While these documents differ\nin the detail of their recommendations, and even more in quality of analysis\nand adequacy of presentation, they reflect a similar spirit and a similar con-\nviction,\n\nEmployment Policy and Organization of Industry after the War is essen-\ntially a policy statement, a compilation of ideas and. suggestions for \"a\nnew advance . . . in the control and organization of our national resources,\"\nto use Mr. G. D. H. Cole's words in the Preface. This Statement, as a com-\npromise among the varying opinions of the 33 Conference participants, suf-\n\n^Unless specifically noted to the contrary, all page references in this paper are to\nEmployment Policy and Organization of Industry after the War, a Statement Deriving\nfrom a Conference at Nuffield College, England, in May, 1943. (London: Humphrey\nMilford, Oxford University Press, 1943, pp. 70, 2s. net). References to the \"Conference\"\nor to the \"Statement\" denote this document. While no attempt has been made to\nreflect the shifting and more guarded shades of opinion in the subsequent publications\nnoted, the aspects of the Statement selected for comment are sufficiently common (if\nimplicit) to the general approach to warrant more careful consideration than the\nStatement itself might justify. The Government White Paper on Employment Policy\nleast reflects the viewpoint here under discussion.\n\nFor a more sympathetic treatment of the British approach to post-war employment,\nsee Arthur Smithies, *Full Employment in a Free Society,\" 4m. Econ. Rev., Vol. XXXV,\nNo. 3 (June, 1945), pp. 355-67. I shall have occasion to refer to this review of the\nBeveridge Report in the course of this analysis.\n",

He avers that the Soviet econo-\nmists' acceptance of the law of value under \"socialism\" is merely the result\nof a *terminological muddle surrounding the notion of \"law'\" (p. 861). The\nRussians, however, are not muddleheads. They have deliberately accepted the\nvalidity of the law of value for the Soviet Union because in the economic\ncategories used by Marx in Capital they have found the theoretical reflection\nof economic reality. Since, however, Marx's entire analysis of the law of\nvalue is based upon its specifically capitalistic content, the Soviet economists\nwere constrained either to revise the concept that the Soviet Union is a\n\"socialist society,\" or to revise the concept that the law of value is dominant\nonly in a capitalist society. It is not surprising that they chose to revise\nMarx instead of the Soviet Constitution.\n\nThe Soviet economists have solved their dilemma.!? It is up to Mr. Baran\nto solve his dilemma of assuming, on the one hand, that Russia is a \"socialist\nsociety\" and, on the other hand, asserting that the law of value is dominant\nonly in a capitalist society.

My\ngeneral suggestion is that the operational approach, which has proved so\nuseful in other fields, may be useful in this connection in economics. Dr. von\nMering tolerates the operational method in natural science, but he apparently\nrejects its use in economics, and objects violently to my particular application\nof it in the latter field. The operational approach means that concepts are to\nbe stated in terms of \"operations,\" which in economics means in terms of\nalterable behavior, or plans of action. My particular suggestion is to use\nthe operational method of inquiry to suggest hypotheses for relating distinc-\ntive theoretical concepts in a body of theory like that of Keynes's to concrete\nproposals by the same theorist in the field of policy. I have contended and am\nwilling to defend in detail the proposition that the meaning of Keynes's theory\nas a whole and of his special concepts like liquidity-preference, marginal pro-\npensity to consume, and marginal efficiency of capital is to be found in rela-\ntion to Keynes's program of reform. This is the essence of my suggestion that\npolicy may be viewed as the operational meaning of theory. Dr. von Mering\nmay legitimately question the usefulness of this approach, but it obviously\nhas nothing to do with any desire to rule society, to vindicate particular\npolicies, or to play tricks on unsuspecting people. It is, like Peirce's pragmatic\nmaxim, a suggestion for the clarification of ideas, which in turn is prerequisite\nto scientific evaluation of economic theory and policy.\n\nI have criticized Dr. von Mering for failing to make a clear-cut distinction\nbetween meaning of theory and workability of program. Not until the meaning\nof a theory has been established in terms of alterable behavior (plan of action)\nare we in a position to raise the further question of the validity of the system\nof thought. Since any body of doctrine contains within it special practical and\nethical presuppositions, its concepts and propositions cannot legitimately be\ncriticized in terms of the concept and propositions of another system of theory,\nwhich has different practical and ethical presuppositions. Having previously\ndiscovered the meaning of the concepts, we are in a position to raise the\nfurther question of the workability of the course of action with which that\ntheory is associated, i.e., for which it is an argument. Whether or not the pro-\ngram can realize the practical and ethical aims in terms of which it is projected\nis to a large extent a matter of historical circumstances, such as the prevailing\nstate of the industrial arts.\n\nOne of the great faults of economics is that what passes for scientific criti-\ncism is hardly more than polemical dogmatism in which one set of practical\nand ethical values is used as the basis for criticizing another set of practical\nand ethical values. Instead of lowering the quality of discussion among\neconomists, as Dr. von Mering alleges, the adoption of the above suggestions\nwould, I believe, provide the best possible means for elevating the quality of\ndiscussion and criticism in the field of theoretical economics.\n\nDuprrv DirLLARD*\n"

Part of the\ndecrease in the cost, however, stems from the fact that today, more than\nin the last war or in 1940, greater reliance is placed upon short-term and\nspecial issues. Consequently, if the current pattern of rates has to be changed\ndrastically in the early post-war years, the saving on interest charges may be\ntransitory and illusionary. On the other hand, the 35 billions of non-\nmarketable Treasury bonds are so priced with respect to redemption as to\ndiscourage excessive sales by investors prior to final maturity date.\n\nThat most of the reduction in the average interest rate is due to an\nincreased weighting in the direction of the lower-yielding short-terms is\nshown by the following comparisons: although the over-all average interest\nrate decreased from 2.260 per cent to 1.925 per cent from 1942 to 1944,\nthe yields of taxable federal bonds (7-9 years) increased from 1.93 per cent\nto 1.94 per cent, and the yields of longer maturities (15 years or more)\nincreased from 2.46 per cent to 2.48 per cent.\n\nThis is not the place to do more than mention just how the reductions\nin the computed rate of interest have been achieved: by the Federal Reserve's\nmaking large amounts of cash available to banks through open market\noperations, by the using up of excess reserves, and by the unwillingness of\nbanks to risk a rise in long-term rates\u2014all of which encourage the purchase\nof large amounts of low-yielding short-term securities. Furthermore, there\nhas been a deliberate Treasury policy of tailoring yields to the market\nrequirements of different groups with some savers being privileged to buy\nrelatively high yielding issues while banks are confined to lower yielding\nones.\n",

This is certainly not the place to discuss bank earnings,\nalthough it can be shown that comparatively they are not excessive. The\npoint to be emphasized is that it seems quite obvious that the structure of\ninterest rates should be fixed, if it is to be subjected to regulation, after\nconsidering factors other than bank earnings. If the economy demands a\nlower structure of interest rates, a more conclusive argument surely could\nhave been advanced by Mr. Samuelson and his barber.\n\nMr. Samuelson also asserts that this could have been a one per cent war\nrather than a 2 per cent one. He dismisses the statement that interest rates\nmight have an effect upon private consumption and investment, although he\nconcedes that \"they may have had some minor effect upon the form in\nwhich wealth is held.\"* He does not choose to explore this possibility further,\nalthough it is deserving of additional analysis. It must not be forgotten\nthat the banks are not for the most part permitted to subscribe to securities\nin war loans and are not even permitted to purchase certain types of securities\navailable to other investors in the open market. They have been restricted\nto short-term, low interest bearing securities. One of the reasons that banks\nhave been able to purchase these securities is that corporate and other\ninvestors have preferred to hold deposits. If corporations and others pur-\nchased securities, then the banking system would have had less funds to\ninvest. This fact is very seldom realized by those who discuss the question.\nLike Mr. Samuelson, I do not wish to go into this subject because it is\nextremely complicated but it may be suggested that the interest rates offered\nto corporate and other investors are insufficient to induce them to part with\nliquid funds. To induce these investors to invest liquid funds, i.e., to change\nthe form in which wealth is held, might have required higher rates of interest\nthan those paid on securities held by banks. In discussing the interest rate\nat which this war is being financed it is well to consider this fact. This\nagain emphasizes the fact that the fixing of a given structure of interest\nrates can only be undertaken after considering a great many factors.\n\nThere are a great many aspects to this problem which Mr. Samuelson has\nnot discussed and I have not raised them here. My only objective has been\nto point out that, if a lower structure of interest rates is desirable, a much\nstronger argument than the fact that the banking system would not be hurt\nby a rise in the structure of interest rates should be cited. The determination\nof a structure of interest rates in wartime should only be undertaken after\nconsidering needs of the economy, the investment responses of savers to\nvarious interest rates, the relative costs incurred by the government, and\nthe inflationary or deflationary results of various methods of financing.\nFinally, it has been pointed out that the banking system is following con-\nsciously a portfolio policy which will result in as little loss as possible in\nthe event that the structure of interest rates might rise.\n\nGxzongcE W.

                    "672 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW [SEPTEMBER\n\nback within three years. This conclusion follows from the unrealistic interest\nrate structure assumed by Samuelson and after making a slight error in\ncomputing the ratios of new to old capital values. (While the academician\nwill find such an error trifling, to the average banker it might mean the\ndifference between a profit and loss on the bond transaction.) What is some-\nwhat surprising is that Mr. Samuelson should have taken so much pains to\nmake a calculation of this type when even the lowliest bank clerk could have\ntold him, even if his barber could not, that banks are endeavoring to main-\ntain a short position in order to minimize the loss which a rise in interest\nrates with a longer position would produce.\n\nMr. Samuelson used in his calculations the United States Treasury report\non the ownership-distribution of U. S. government securities as of February\n29, 1944. Thus it will be noted that his figures are on a \"due or first\nbecoming callable\" basis. With a rise in interest rates it is extremely unlikely\nthat any securities will be called in order to refund them into securities bearing\na higher coupon. Consequently, such calculations should be made on a\n\"maturity\" basis. However, using his figures, it might be well to note that a\n3.29 per cent decline in the value of U. S. government securities would have\nimpaired at that date about 25 per cent of the total capital invested in banks.\n\nIt should be pointed out that the banking system would recover these\nlosses over a period of time, the length depending upon the maturity\ndistribution. During that period, it would be \"frozen in\" to a given maturity\npattern. Mr. Samuelson seems to feel, however, that earnings of the banking\nsystem upon the existing portfolio would increase. He states that \"immediately\nafter interest rates have risen and capital values have scaled down, all parts\nof the portfolio, old as well as new, began to earn the higher rates.\"* He\nargues that this is true because the earnings will be made up not only of\nthe coupon return but of the amortization of the discount, and this will mean\nnew higher earnings. From the point of view of the banking system, however,\nthese \"new higher earnings\" will be purely nominal. In *writing down\"\ncapital values, losses will be established and the amortization of discount\nwill merely recover these losses.\n\nIn another place, he suggests that the bonds can be carried at cost. (He\nprobably means amortized cost.) If this is done, then it should be obvious\nthat the return will remain the same. The \"new higher earnings\" will not\nmaterialize until re-investment takes place. But it should be emphasized\nthat the re-investment will not be possible until the securities mature. A rise\nin interest rates is not, therefore, going to be the immediate bonanza for\nbanks which Mr. Samuelson seems to envisage.\n\nMr. Samuelson states further that if his argument is \"rightly interpreted,\nit will be seen that mine is an argument against interest rate increases, not\nin favor of them.\"5 'The logic of arguing for a lower rate of interest on the\nground that an increase would not hurt the banking system is diff\u00fccult to\nunderstand, but apparently it follows from his argument, already commented\n\n*!Am, Econ.

Malthus also dissented\nsomewhat irrelevantly, \u00e0 $ropos of rejecting J. B. Say's theory of\nmarket gluts (\"d\u00e9bouches\") which was accepted by Ricardo and his\nfollowers. In his general text (1821) Malthus presented oversaving as\nthe cause of the industrial depression in Great Britain between 1816\nand 1821. Views similar to those of Malthus were expressed by his\ncontemporaries, Thomas Chalmers and Sismondi.\n\nThe debates in Parliament during these years revealed general\n\"bewilderment\" regarding the causes and possible remedies for this\ndesperate situation. The commercial and financial depression in the\nUnited States at the same time was attributed by tariff beneficiaries\nto the malevolent dumping of goods by English merchants at cut-\nthroat prices, and this has ever since been a stock argument for\npermanently high restrictive tarif\u00eds.\n\n2. More Recent Oversaving Doctrine\n\nSome half-century later the oversaving doctrine was advanced in\nthe United States by an active-minded octogenarian, Uriel H. Crocker,\n\n*' The present paper is a by-product of unremitted studies in the history of economic\nthought, by the senior Past President of the American Economic Association, Professor\nEmeritus of Political Economy in Princeton University.\n\n?

These have\nbeen clearly stated in official declarations and one of them is to make\nthe currency of different countries again freely interchangeable.\n\nApplied to our particular problem, this implies that we want an\nexchange rate which equates demand and supply in a free market, that\nis, a market in which everybody is allowed to buy and to sell curren-\ncies of all countries. This is, of course, the ultimate ideal, which cannot\nbe realized at once. All experts agree that in most countries more or\nless stringent controls of the foreign exchange market will have to be\nmaintained for some time after the war. The scope, stringency and\nduration of these controls will be discussed later and will partly depend\non the rates which are chosen. But certain features of a free market\ncan and should be introduced right from the beginning: The ex-\nchange rate of a currency should be uniform, non-discriminatory. That\nis to say, the same rate should be applicable to all types of transactions\nand to all individuals, to commodity trade as well as to services, capi-\ntal and interest payments. Applied to more than two countries, this\nimplies that the rates should be consistent, that is to say, cross rates\nshould be equal to direct rates. Another postulate is that rates should\nbe as stable as possible.\n\nAnother partially conflicting objective of foreign exchange policy\nwould be to influence the terms of trade. The realization of this objec-\ntive would usually imply an overvaluation of the currency, because\nthere is a strong presumption that the setting of a high level of a coun-\ntry's currency (or an appreciation) tends to improve the terms of trade\nand a low level (or depreciation) tends to deteriorate them.\n\nSo long as exchange control is maintained this objective can be\nattained to some extent, although the abstention from discriminating\npolicies, which is implied by the postulate of uniformity and consistency\nof exchange rates, imposes severe restrictions on any attempt at doctor-\ning the terms of trade. If exchange controls are altogether removed it\nwill be found that for most countries there is very little or no leeway\n\n* The author is professor of economics at Harvard University.\n"

Introduction\n\nIn his Report on Full Employment in a Free Society, Sir William\nBeveridge has been untrammeled by official reticence in stating what\nhe considers to be the implications of a full employment policy. He con-\ntends that, to deserve the name, a full employment policy must mean\nthat the central government accepts responsibility for the level of\nemployment: *Full employment cannot be won and held without a\ngreat extension of the responsibilities and powers of the State exer-\ncised through organs of the central Government. No power less than\nthat of the State can ensure adequate total outlay at all times, or can\ncontrol, in the general interest, the location of industry and the use of\nland. To ask for full employment while objecting to these extensions\nof State activity is to will the end and refuse the means. It is like shout-\ning for victory in total war while rejecting compulsory service and\nrationing\" (p. 36). He reinforces his argument by demonstrating that\nfull employment has not been maintained for extended periods in the\npast, and arguing there is no theoretical reason to believe that it will\nbe maintained in the future if the State does not accept this responsi-\nbility.?\n\nSir William goes further in his definition of the fullness of full\nemployment than is usual amongst economists. In rejecting definitions\nwhich permit the number of unfilled vacancies to be less than the num-\nber of unemployed, he states: *Full employment in this Report means\nmore than that in two ways. It means having always more vacant jobs\nthan unemployed men, not slightly fewer jobs. It means that the jobs\nare at fair wages, of such a kind, and so located that the unemployed\nmen can reasonably be expected to take them; it means by consequence,\nthat the normal lag between losing one job and finding another will be\n\n* The author, on leave from the University of Michigan, where he is associate professor\nof economics, is at present chief fiscal analyst in the Bureau of the Budget, Washington,\nD.C.

The level of private consumption and investment expenditures may\nalso be affected by adjusting the kind of taxes and public expenditures in-\ncluded in the budget totals, and under certain conditions public expenditures\nmay provide for a net addition to national income, even though there is no\ndeficit and the level of private expenditures does not increase.\n\nAdjusting the level of expenditures relative to tax yields is thus only one\namong several approaches.

If the initial deficiency\nin over-all expenditures is large, we have seen that the balanced budget ap-\nproach will require exorbitantly high levels of expenditures and taxation, both\nof which will tend to depress private investment. If, as a result, private\ninvestment expenditures are depressed, budget figures even higher than those\nshown in Table II are needed. If the unfavorable reaction of private investors\nis violent, tax-financed additions to expenditures when carried beyond some\npoint may well lower rather than increase the over-all level of income.\n\nAll this points to the conclusion that a substantial deficit will be needed\nunless we succeed by non-fiscal means to narrow down the initial deficiency in\nthe over-all expenditure level to much below the illustrative figure of 30 billion\ndollars used in the preceding discussion. If a large deficiency remains to be\nfilled through fiscal measures, after other policy approaches have been ex-\nhausted, it will be neither desirable nor feasible to make expenditures suffi-\nciently large to balance the budget at full employment. Instead, a thoroughly\nworth-while expenditure budget should be provided including expended social\nsecurity and adequate developmental programs stimulating to private invest-\nment, but excluding made-work projects.?? On the basis of such an expenditure\nprogram the level of taxation should then be set sufficiently low to leave such\ndeficit as the economic situation may require in the average year. After the\nbudget is thus adjusted to the longer-term needs of the economic situation,\nshort-term variations in underlying conditions and localized relief needs re-\nmain to be met by a flexible expenditure program and an elastic tax system,\nincluding flexible income tax rates.

If\nfiscal policy can be successful in assuring a high and stable level of income,\nthis very assurance will undoubtedly contribute to a higher level of private\ninvestment. Also, private investment may be stimulated directly through de-\nvelopmental programs such as power development, urban redevelopment and\nso forth. Well-selected reductions in tax rates may give further incentives to\nprivate investment.

The gross national\nproduct for the year 1950 is widely estimated at about 200 billion dollars under\nconditions of full employment.

In other words, with respect to the term\n\u00ab (E, 4- E,) it is assumed that no additional taxes are paid by the recipients\nof the additional government payments. The fact that additional taxes are\npaid by this group and that the net increase in their expenditures falls short\nof \u00ab (E, -- E;) is allowed for in deducting QT, where T covers all additional\ntax yield.\n\nChanges in tax yield are here considered the primary planning factor, the\nnecessary changes in tax rates being determined by the changes in yield and\nincome. The opposite approach could be taken but would be less useful? As\na matter of fiscal planning, yield adjustments are the primary objective and\nchanges in tax rates the means to accomplish them. In planning rate adjust-\nments to bring about the desired change in yield, secondary changes in yield\ndue to changes in the level of income and hence in the tax base must not be\nneglected. As a matter of legislation, action is taken in terms of rate adjust-\nment but the final purpose is adjustment of tax yields.\n\nThe change in yield, or T, may be positive or negative, depending on whether\nthe yield provided for in the adjusted budget falls above or below the initial-\nly assumed level. T' is equal to zero if the yield level is unchanged. It should\nbe noted that 2-T refers to increments or decrements in tax yield only, so that\nBT does not allow for changes in private expenditures brought about by chang-\ning the sources from which the initially assumed amount of tax yield is\ndrawn, as, for instance, by changing from excise to income taxes.'?\n\nThe multiplier k is here applied to initial changes in private expenditures\non consumption or investment. It is based on the marginal propensity to con-\nsume of the community at large, not on a or f which reflect the consumption\nhabits of certain groups only. Usually, & is based on the community's mar-\nginal propensity to consume out of income before tax and thus allows for\nleakages from additional tax payments, in this paper it is based on consump-\ntion out of income after tax. Since the multiplier is based on the community's\nmarginal propensity to consume out of income after tax, & will remain con-\nstant when tax rates fall and fall when tax rates rise. This avoids considerable\ndifficulties which can only be mentioned here. If, for instance, expenditures\nare increased to sustain a higher level of income and the tax rate is held\nconstant, the initial increase in expenditures must be sufficiently high to allow\n\n? An alternative approach would be to define a as the propensity to consume out of\nincome before tax and T as such addition to tax yield as results from an autonomous\nincrease in tax rates only, excluding such additional yield as results from an increase in\n\nthe tax base. The net result, in terms of the addition to total income, would be the same\nfor both approaches.\n\n?' The lower the initially assumed yield level, the less serious is this defect. At the cost\nof some complication it may be remedied by adding another term to expression (1).\n\nThe difficulty might be avoided by redefining G to be the deficiency in income on the as-\nsumption of a zero (rather than a balanced minimum) budget. This would have the\nadvantage of making T' identical with the over-all yield level, so that changes in the f\nfor the total tax yield would be accounted for. But this would be more than offset by the\ndisadvantages of this approach, in particular (a) it would pose the altogether unrealistic\nproblem of having to estimate G for the assumption of zero public expenditures and (b)\nit would exclude the analysis of budget adjustments involving a reduction in tax yield.\n"

They greatly depend upon the kind of policy by which\nadjustments in the expenditure or yield levels are brought about. The \u00ab\napplicable to transfer expenditures may exceed or fall short of the a for real\nexpenditures. Thus, if the additional expenditures are relief payments, \u00ab may\nbe close to one; if they are for debt redemption, \u00ab may be close to zero. If\nthe expenditures qualify for inclusion in E, it is likely that \u00ab will fall some-\nwhere in between these extremes. Similarly, if the change in tax yield is in\nsales tax yield, 8 may be close to one; if the estate tax yield is involved, 8\nmay be close to zero. The 9 applicable to the corporation tax depends upon\nits incidence. To the extent that the tax is reflected in higher prices or lower\nwazes, & will be rclatively high; to the extent that the tax is reflected in\nreduced dividends, & will be less, and where the tax is reflected in the reten-\ntion of less earnings, 8 will be equal to zero. By defining the revenue item as\n-cOT, the implicit assumption is made that the Q applicable to borrowing is\nequal to zero. This assumption is not entirely realistic, even for the case of\ndepression borrowing, but is made to simplify the problem.\n\nThe cAange in tax yield, or 2- T, includes all changes in yield, whether due\nto changes in the tax base (brought about by increased consumption, invest-\nment and public expenditures) or to changes in tax rates. When government\nexpenditures (E, 4- E,) increase and the tax rate remains unchanged, T' will\nbe positive since a part of the additional income received from the government\nwill be returned to the Treasury in taxes.

During a depres-\nsion period, for instance, fiscal planning calls for taxes which are drawn from\ntaxpayers whose marginal propensity to consume is low relative to that of\nincome recipients as a whole, and for expenditures going to recipients whose\npropensity to consume is high relative to that of the community as a whole.\nThe opposite tends to hold during a period of inflation.

For half a century thereafter, the intelligent reading public looked\nforward to the position taken by Cassel on the important economic and social\nissues of the day. His career as a teacher extended from his appointment as\nprofessor in economic and financial science at the University of Stockholm\nto emeritus status in 1933. His career as a consultant began in 1904 with an\nappointment (held until 1917) as adviser to the Department of Finance.\nThereafter he was a member of the bank commission in 1917, a member of\nthe economic council, 1920-21, and an adviser to the railroad council, 1924-26.\n\nDuring the First World War, Cassel was asked by the government of Ger-\nmany to help solve some of the country's pressing economic problems; in 1922\nhe advised in the establishment of the Russian State Bank; and in 1928, he\ntestified before our House of Representatives Currency and Banking Com-\nmittee as to means for stabilizing the purchasing power of the dollar. He\nwas the Swedish delegate to International Chamber of Commerce meetings\nduring the twenties at London, Rome, Brussels, Stockholm, and Amsterdam;\nand he participated in the World Economic Conferences of Genoa (1922)\nand London (1933).\n\nCassel enjoyed as wide recognition and honor as ever has been accorded\nan economist during his lifetime. His books were translated into many for-\neign languages. He held honorary degrees from a number of universities,\nand occupied honorary lectureships at Oxford, London, Geneva, Columbia,\nand Chicago. He was an honorary member of the American Economic Asso-\nciation and a member (1914), gold medallist (1922), and president (1926)\nof the Royal Swedish Academy. Commenting upon his death, a Stockholm\nnewspaper wrote that he was a whole academy in himself.\n\nCassel was essentially a liberal in economic philosophy in his belief in the\nefficiency and benefit of a competitive price economy. This liberalism is appar-\nent in the books already cited and, more particularly, in Recent Monopolistic\nTendencies in Industry and Trade (1927) and Socialism and Progress (1928).\nCassel frequently warned against the outcome of authoritarian tendencies in\neconomic policy: \"The arbitrariness, the mistakes, and the inevitable contra-\ndictions of such a policy will, as daily experience shows, only strengthen the\ndemand for a more rational coordination of the different measures and, there-\nfore, for unified leadership. For this reason Planned Economy will always tend\nto develop into Dictatorship.\" Tributes written by Cassel's outstanding stu-\ndents, Professor Bertil Ohlin| now Swedish Minister of Commerce, and\nSenator Gunnar Myrdal, pointed to Cassel's faith in rationalism, in progress,\n\nand in the final victory of common sense.\nTTA oC LE.

                    "OBITUARIES 509\n\nMonetary System. (1931), and The Downfall of the Gold Standard (1936).\nMonetary analysis and policy in the inter-war years were strongly influenced\nby these writings and by Cassel's participation in the numerous international\nconferences of that period.\n\n'The idea of \"purchasing power parity\" as the equilibrium value of foreign\nexchanges was not Cassel's discovery, but its popularization was undoubtedly\nhis accomplishment, Originally the concept was introduced by Cassel in the\nso-called absolute form: the international exchange ratio of two currencies\nwill tend to settle at the ratio of the absolute height of their price levels.\nBecause the costs of transportation of goods or obstacles to trade, such as\ntariffs and quotas, might operate unequally as between two countries, the\nabsolute form was rather quickly supplanted by the relative form: the equili-\nbrium rate of exchange would move, relatively to its position in a base year\nwhen equilibrium in the balances of payments could be assumed, in the same\nratio as the relation of changes in the price levels. Purchasing power parity,\neven in this formulation, has to be corrected for changes in relative trade\nobstacles, in international demand, in relative costs, and for protracted capital\nmovements.\n\nDespite these limitations, and especially if Cassel's wholesale price index\nis supplanted by one more appropriate to international equilibrium, the device\nmay be useful in forecasting the future level of a given exchange if it is free\nto move. Cassel utilized the idea, known in this context as the \"inflation\ntheory,\" to refute the official apology propagated by Germany that the com-\nplete depreciation of the mark in 1923 was explained by a mere scarcity of\ngoods and by an un\u00edfavorable balance of trade. He also based upon the parity\ndoctrine his adverse judgment against attempts to restore badly depreciated\ncurrencies to their old values.\n\nDuring the twenties Cassel predicted a world shortage of gold. This was\npartly derived from his explanation of secular price movements in the century\nfrom 1810 to 1910 in terms of the deviation of the stock of monetary gold\nfrom a. computed normal increase of 2.79 per cent per annum which would\nparallel the secular increase of physical output. There are grounds for skep-\nticism concerning this analysis, as for example the effects of changing from\na silver or a bimetallic to the gold standard in the chief trading nations during\nthe century. But the devices recommended by Cassel for alleviating a gold\nShortage by monetary changes have meanwhile come into practical acceptance.\n\nIn the field of business cycle theory, Cassel has been less influential than\nWicksell. Common to both was the doctrine that cycles consist primarily of\nalternations of an excess of investment over saving and the reverse. The only\ncategoric difference lay in Cassel's contention that the \"natural\" or \"real\"\nrate of interest would tend to conform to the market rate, whereas Wicksell\nheld the reverse. Curiously enough for the proponent of such a doctrine,\nCassel was completely out of sympathy with the recent doctrine of Keynes\nand Hansen.\n\nAn adequate appreciation of the significance of Cassel leads beyond the\nrealm of scientific literature to his extensive popular writing, his wide partici-\n"

                    "On January 15, 1945, Gustav Cassel died, the dean of Swedish economists\nand one of the most renowned economists throughout the world in the present\ngeneration. Cassel's international repute rested upon his extensive writing\nthrough the greater part of his seventy-eight years of life, his active partici-\npation in public affairs both at home and abroad, and his influence as a teacher\nand publicist.\n\nCassel's contributions to the literature of modern economics are found\nprincipally in the four fields of value theory, monetary problems, the analysis\nof business cycles, and the critique of socialism. His first notable publication\nwas made in the field of value and distribution theory in TZe Nature and\nNecessity of Interest (1903). He was chiefly concerned in this work to dem-\nonstrate a separate productivity inhering in capital, explicable on the grounds\nof scarcity of supply without recourse to psychological determinants; but the\ntreatise illuminated the theory of capital in many ways. The services of capital\nwould be scarce and valuable even in a socialist state: the problem of why\ninterest exists should not be confused with the ethical issues raised by the\npossibility of living through owning. Students of capital theory will recall also\nCassel's suggestion of what we now call a backward rising\" capital supply\ncurve, and his idea that interest rates (expressed as the number of years\npurchase) may have some connection with average life expectancy.\n\nHis systematic works in value theory include Outlines of an. Elementary\nTheory of Prices (1899), Fundamental Thoughts in Economics (1925), and\nA Theory of Social Economy, first published in German in 1918, but not\navailable in English until 1924. Translated into several languages, the Social\nEconomy came quickly to be a standard treatise and a widely used textbook\nin universities throughout the world. It departed from the neoclassical tradi-\ntion in rejecting what the author regarded as unprofitable speculations as to\nthe subjective attitudes of suppliers of economic services. Though this ap-\nproach would be favored by the behaviorist psychology, Cassel's substitution\nof a mere principle of scarcity for the idea of subjective value underlying the\nphenomenon of price has not found general acceptance, witness the current\npopularity of the indifference analysis. The work recommends itself chiefly\nas a particularly lucid exposition of price theory along the lines of the Walras\ntradition.\n\nCassel's influence upon the world of practical affairs has been largest, how-\never, in the realm of monetary phenomena. It is here that we find the largest\npart of his writing for scientific journals and newspapers, and his excellent\ntracts for the times: TZe World's Monetary Problems (1912), Money and\nForeign Exchange after 1014 (1922), Outlines of the Development of the\n",

The Food Stamp Plan\nwas a program of the Department of Agriculture for the disposal of\nsurplus commodities to needy persons and was in operation from 1939\nto 1943. Indifference curve technique is employed in this analysis. The\nmethod used is an adaptation of that of J. R. Hicks, as set forth in his\nValue and Capital.\n\nThe accompanying chart provides the essential assumed data for\nthe analysis. The assumptions involved in the chart are such as to\nmake the situation of the hypothetical individual reasonably typical\nof actual situations.\n\nIt is first necessary to explain the chart in detail. Let it be supposed\nthat the individual devotes all of his income to two commodities, food\n(on the x-axis) and non-food (on the y-axis), and that his income is\nobtained and expressed as non-food. The unit of measure for food\nis taken to be the quart; for non-food the pound. The lines RR;, RR;,\nQQ., etc., are sometimes designated, in this type of analysis, *outlay\nlines,\" because any \"consumption point\" on one of these lines (say,\npoint A on RR;) shows the amounts of food and non-food which could\nbe purchased by this person with the outlay of a given income (income\n60 pounds of non-food or 40 quarts of food in the case of RR;). They\nare also designated \"price lines,\" because the slope of the lines shows\nthe \"price\" or exchange ratio of food, in quarts, per unit of non-food,\nin pounds (or vice versa). The co\u00f3rdinates of any point on a line such\nas RR, express the amounts of food and non-food obtained by expend-\ning a given total income. Thus at point A on RR, 20 quarts of food\nand 30 pounds of non-food are obtained. The x-intercept (R;) shows\nthe amount of food (40 quarts) which would be obtained if all the\nindividual's income were devoted to food; the y-intercept (R) shows\nthe amount of non-food (60 pounds) which would be obtained if all\nhis income were kept in the form of and devoted to non-food.\n\n* The author, now in the United States Naval Reserve, assigned to the Office of Strategic\n\nServices, wishes to acknowledge the very helpful suggestions made by Dr. Peter G.'

The proposition that\n\"the thought of theorists represents a more sophisticated way of thinking\nabout policy\" means in less sophisticated words that theory and theoretical\nconcepts have to be used as tools for the vindication and carrying out of a\ncertain policy. I do not believe that Keynes himself would accept this inter-\npretation of his theory, and I am even doubtful whether American pragmatists,\nto whom Dillard refers, would agree to it.* It is one thing to regard ideas\nas plans of action in the field of natural science. It is another thing to apply\nthis consideration to the field of social science, as Dr. Dillard suggests. In\nthe former sphere the concept may well have some advantages, although\nthere are, even in that field, serious drawbacks. To use Bertrand Russell's\nwords: When what passes for knowledge is considered to be no more than a\nmomentary halting place in a process of inquiry which has no goal outside\nitself, inquiry can no longer provide intellectual joys, but becomes merely a\nmeans to better dinners and more rapid locomotion.* However, this drawback\nis nothing compared to the catastrophic results which would follow from the\ngeneral adoption of Dr. Dillard's view in the economic field. The conception\nof ideas as plans of action in physics and chemistry is based on the wish to\nforetell future events and thus to dominate the material world. The ultimate\ngoal of ideas used as plans of action in the economic sphere in conformity\nwith Dillard's proposition could be no other than to rule society. Ideas would\nbecome mere tricks, and theory would be degraded to propaganda. Because\nI do not treat the Keynesian concepts as having \"specific pragmatical mean-\ning, discoverable by the operational approach,\" Dr. Dillard declares me\n\"guilty\" of \"wandering all over the place.\" Well, I prefer to go on wandering\nto accepting his notion of economic theory.

Needless to say, this inference may\nwell be exerted by the way of determining first the social philosophy of the\nwriter. The main point is that notions of wZat skould be direct\u2014often un-\nnoticed by the theorist\u2014the conception of wZat is, or rather what is sup-\nposed to be. In order to prove that the Keynesian theory is a case in point\nI tried to show that the economic policy Keynes suggests as a consequence\nof his theory actually does not follow as a logical corollary from his theo-\nretical reasoning. In this connection Dr. Dillard expresses his \"fundamental\ncriticism\" of my position on the ground that in Part III of my article I\nconclude \"that policy is prior to theory,\" whereas I analyze *Keynes's theory\nin Part II as though theory were prior to policy.\" But is there really a con-\ntradiction? I am inclined to believe that a fairly careful reader could not\ndiscover any. In Part II I show that the policy suggested by Keynes does\nnot necessarily follow from his theory, as the reader would expect; and in\nPart III I conclude that policy and/or social philosophy may well determine\nthe structure of theory. Now Dillard takes issue with my question: *Does\nthe suggested policy [of Keynes] follow necessarily from the [Keynesian]\ntheory?\" and he calls this question *wrong.\" But why is the question wrong?\nIf a writer says, explicitly or implicitly, that if and only if ? (for example,\nmore equal distribution of income by heavy taxation of the wealthy), then\nq (full employment), and if I can prove that there may be q without ?, I am\nentitled to say that the explicit or implicit statement \"if and only if 5, then\nq\" is not true; and no pragmatist who regards logic as something more than\na political instrument will deny that.\n\nWhen I wrote my article I expected objections on the ground that I had\ndone Keynes an injustice by stating that somehow political purposes entered\nhis apparently \"objective\" theorizing. Now I am surprised to see that,\naccording to one critic at least, I have not gone far enough because I did not\nuse pragmatic philosophy as a means of solving the question concerning the\nrelation between economic theory and economic policy.\n\nLet us examine now the positive contribution of Dr. Dillard to our prob-\nlem. In suggesting an investigation of \"policy as the operational meaning\nof theory,\" he rightly points out that the operational approach has come to\nplay an important r\u00f3le in modern philosophy and natural science, and he\nadvances the undoubtedly original idea of applying that approach to eco-\nnomics. Fortunately we are not left in the dark about the way Dillard\nwants to apply the operational approach to economics, in particular to the\nKeynesian theory. *\"The operational concept\" is to be used \"to explain theories\nas plans of action in the sense that [John] Dewey defines ideas as plans of\naction.\" Dr. Dillard contends that the general Keynesian concepts have a spe-\ncific practical meaning, and he misses in my analysis the suggestion that a cer-\ntain theory is articulated because the pragmatically selective perspective of the\ntheorist leads him in that direction. . . . The world of policy is prior to the\nworld of theory not only in the sense that theories which are to survive must\nconform to underlying political trends, but also in the sense \u00a3Zat tke thought\nof 'theorists' represents a more sophisticated way of thinking about policy?\n\n* [talics are mine.\n"

                    "New England Mutual Savings Bank Laws as Interstate Barriers\nto the Flow of Capital\n\nI\n\nMuch has been written in recent years about state laws and administrative\nregulations that have caused state boundaries to become significant in an\neconomic sense. Attention has, for the most part, centered upon those particu-\nlar laws and regulations that have acted as trade barriers; little has been said\nabout those that have lessened factor mobility, particularly that of capital.\nSavings, before actual investment in capital goods, are highly mobile. As a\nresult, lower taxes, gifts of land for factory locations, anti-labor policies, etc.,\nare practices adopted by areas attempting to attract capital saved elsewhere.\nConversely, there have been legislative efforts in states that normally export\ncapital to hinder its emigration. The most important of these have had to do\nwith savings accumulated through mutual savings banks; in some states these\nlaws have been generalized to include investments made by trust companies\nand certain other financial institutions under state jurisdiction. Unlike state\ntrade barriers, which are a comparatively recent phenomenon, these impedi-\nments upon capital mobility are old and well established. Although they were\nof more consequence relative to the size and wealth of the United States forty\nyears ago than they are now, they still cause distortions in the geographical\nlocation of the investment of savings accumulated through savings banks.\n\nIn most of the seventeen states in which mutual savings banks are located,\nthe legislatures have prescribed the operating procedures which they are to\nfollow in considerable detail, including two types of investment restrictions.\nThe first is designed to protect the depositor from loss. Those falling under\nthis classification not only limit the fields of investment to those that the\nlegislators considered to be least speculative at the time of enactment but also\ninclude detailed credit tests which must be met by borrowers in the approved\nfields before the securities they have issued are legally approved for savings\nbank investment. The New York law has the best provisions of this type\nalthough somewhat similar ones are also found in those of most other mutual\nsavings bank states, including New England.\n\nThe second type of restriction has been designed to aid borrowers within a\nstate (or regional group of states) rather than the depositors. These have been,\nand remain, characteristic of the New England laws. There are three methods\n\n? Le, co\u00f3peratives which follow the price policies recommended here.\n?'The desirability of producer co\u00f3peratives is another story.\n",

By \"foreigners,\" Mill does not\nmean foreign producers of products subject to duties when sold abroad.\nA case might be made for the view that duties are sometimes shifted\n\"backward\" to the producers of taxed items. It might be argued where\nduties are imposed upon sugar imports, for example, that the price of\nsugar received by foreign sellers would decline relatively to the price in\nthe absence of the tax and that, therefore, they are bearing at least part\nof the burden. Discussions of the burden of import duties have some-\ntimes been conducted along these lines? But Mill's views are quite\ndifferent from these. He would deny that foreign producers might be\nforced to bear even a part of the burden of import duties of sugar-using\ncountries and states positively: *It is the foreign consumer of our ex-\nported commodities who is obliged to pay a higher price for them be-\ncause we maintain duties on foreign goods.\"? If we adhere to Mill's\ntheories, we must say that foreign buyers of U.S. exports are bearing\npart of the burden of U.S. import duties.\n\nMill developed his conclusions concerning the burden and effects of\nimport duties with the concept of reciprocal demand. This technique of\nanalysis was taken over, improved, and made moie definite by the neo-\nclassical school, including Edgeworth, Marshall, and Pigou. These out-\nstanding thinkers in the field greatly refined the reciprocal demand\ntechnique without, however, reaching conclusions concerning the burden\nof import duties differing substantially from those laid down by Mill.\n\n* The author, assistant professor of economics at the University of California, acknowledges\nindebtedness to his colleagues, Professors Howard S.

Compulsory Licensing Legislation\n\n\"The base of the patent systems throughout the world is the principle\nof conferring on the inventor the absolute right of excluding others,\nduring the lifetime of the patent, from in any way practicing the\npatented invention. This right of exclusive exploitation of the invention\nis granted to the inventors for the purpose of encouraging inventive\nactivity and of furthering the development of the inventions, tending,\nhowever, by all means toward the ultimate end of promoting the general\nwelfare; the reward to the inventor is no more than a fair and agreeable\nmethod to attain that final result.\n\nIn industrial countries another dominant consideration is to assure\nthe early disclosure of the invention to the public. Especially the patent\nsystems of the United States and Great Britain are based on the theory\nof getting information, for in order to obtain a valid patent, the inventor\nmust fully disclose the secret. This is a crucial requisite for the benefit\nof society as a whole, since all knowledge divulged by the patent is\nopen to public use when once the patent has expired.

Whenever\nthey want to expand loans, banks have only to sell government securities\nor to allow some of their holdings to run off; to increase excess reserves\nin critical times, they need only to follow a similar course. To the\nTreasury such independence is dangerous because of the size of the\nfloating part of the debt and because of the prospective continuation of\ndeficit financing in view of the \"aftermath\" of war and the possibility of\ndepressions in the future. The debt already in the hands of the banks is\ncostly to the Treasury\u2014the average coupon of bank-held marketable\nsecurities in December, 1945, was about 1.68 per cent\u2014and any meas-\nures designed to lessen this cost by increasing the floating portion of the\ndebt would add to the danger by an increase in the banks' independence.\n\n2.

Pre-War Trends in Economic Thought\n\nEconomics is sometimes regarded with some show of envy by other\nsocial scientists because of its reputation for having a more precise\nanalytical discipline than they have ready to their hands. This is no\ndoubt in a degree true, but the advantage is not at all times very clear\nto economists who are struggling against the weaknesses and imper-\nfections of their discipline and trying out exploratory innovations. So\nfar has the experimental spirit carried during the past three decades\nthat it is hardly correct to say that there exists an agreed discipline of\neconomic analysis. Rather there is a series of more or less inter-related\ndisciplines in a degree complementary, in a degree competitive, with\nsome difference of opinion concerning what is complementary and what\ncompetitive.\n\nSince all sciences except mathematics are compounded of a body of\nobjective phenomena, a body of analytical method wherewith to estab-\nlish or state the relations between phenomena and a statement of estab-\nlished relations, an essential preliminary to analysis is to delimit the\nphenomena or aspects of phenomena which are the subject of analysis.\nIt is perhaps in the supposed existence of an economic criterion or\nbenchmark, even more than for its analytical technique, that economics\nhas been the object of envy. This criterion was historically the principle\nof value\" based upon rational self-interest. Since, however, the curios-\nity of economists has not been limited to aspects of phenomena falling\nwithin that principle, the boundaries of the science remain vague, in\nparticular as they encompass the non-rational areas of behavior and the\nareas of collective action, or as they comprehend relations which are\nnot to be approached through a psychological principle.\n\nA great deal of what is included within the scope of economic litera-\nture does not, in fact, involve very much in the way of theoretical anal-\n\n* This paper was written by request for inclusion in a forthcoming volume dealing with\nsocial and humanistic disciplines, 19391945, soon to be published by the American Council of\nLearned Societies.

While persons who have seen it in draft have, nevertheless, suggested\nthat publication in the Review would be useful to economists who have not been able to follow\nthe wartime literature, I must urge that it cannot serve as a substitute for careful scrutiny\nof the book reviews and the book and periodical lists which have appeared in the Review.\nFor the failure to mention important books, I can only plead inability on short notice to es-\ntablish satisfactory acquaintance with the merits of all books over the whole range of eco-\nnomic publications.\u2014P.T.H.\n"

                    "A Suggestion for Post-War Taxes\n\nI\n\nThe character of the federal tax problem is fairly well understood. In the\nspecific post-war tax proposals which have come to the writer's attention,\nthere is a high degree of agreement, implicit if not expressed, with the fol-\nlowing principles:\n\n1. Federal taxes should be reduced from wartime levels, but should be\nhigh enough to meet all post-war government expenditures.\n\n2. Taxes on corporations and the income derived from them should be\ndrastically revised: (a) so that each shareholder is taxed once but only\nonce on the earnings belonging to his shares; (b) so that income derived\nfrom business corporations is taxed the same as income derived from other\ntypes of business or from other sources; and (c) so that distribution of ea1n-\nings to shareholders is encouraged rather than inhibited but making it pos-\nsible for corporation managements to retain a reasonable proportion of\nearnings when funds are needed for capital expansion.\n\n3. Since the taxes supporting social security benefits are no longer closely\nrelated to those benefits, those taxes should be combined with the regular\ntax system, with extension of social security benefits if this change in taxa-\ntion results in inequitable burdens on some classes in the population.\n\n4. Taxes on capital gains ought to exempt income previously taxed which\nhas never been distributed to the owner, but to tax like other income those\ngains which represent income not previously taxed.\n\n5. Taxes on estates, gifts, and income derived from trusts need revision,\nbetter integration with each other, and better integration with the indi-\nvidual income tax.\n\n6. Most of the numerous excise or sales taxes should be abolished.\n\n7. Some method is needed of averaging personal income taxes over a\nperiod of years, in order that persons with highly irregular incomes from\nyear to year, or receiving in certain years income representing the results of\nwork done over a period of years, will not be taxed un\u00edfairly.\n\n8. The probable level of federal government expenditures, even with the\nutmost economy, is such that the cost cannot possibly be met by progressive\ntaxes on incomes larger than pre-war exemption limits, and some method\n",

The Problem\n\nSavings of individuals have expanded from a total of 48 billion dollars\nat the end of 1939 to 156 billion dollars in January, 1946. On the basis of this\nhuge backlog of liquid assets (bonds, deposits, currency) some economists\nand business analysts have predicated markets for consumer goods. Notable\namong this group is Professor Sumner H. Slichter, who prognosticated post-\nwar markets under the assumptions of whether savings would be ''hot\" or\n\"warm,\" assuming different degrees of price and wage controls.! Despite the\nattention devoted to the holdings of liquid assets by individuals, which will\nobviously influence the national consumption function, insufficient con-\nsideration has been given to the distribution of accumulated savings among\nthe various income groups or to the attitudes of holders of these savings.\nBefore a sound quantitative appraisal can be made of the translation of this\npotential purchasing power into effective demand, information of this charac-\nter is needed. Such factors as liquidity preferences of individuals and the\nmarginal propensity to consume suggest questions which must be con-\nsidered before an hypothesis of post-war markets can be made on the basis\nof the accumulated aggregate savings of individuals.\n\nIt is the purpose of this paper to depict the wartime pattern of expendi-\ntures and savings by income classes, and to examine the significance of this\nempirical evidence as these factors relate to the forecasting of new markets.\n\nIL.

Since V-J Day, however, con-\nsumer expenditures have increased while total income payments were\nslightly declining. This may be attributed to favorable subjective factors!\"\nencouraging spending more out of current earnings rather than from savings.\nThe Proportion of consumer expenditures for durables and services is below\nthe pre-war level, compared with the abnormally large percentage spent on\nconsumer non-durable goods.\n\nShortages of durable goods and homes partly explain the continued in-\ncrease in savings deposits in mutual savings and commercial banks.!* As\nconsumer goods reappear on the market, savings deposits will probably\nadvance at a slower pace or level out, as a larger proportion of current in-\ncome may be spent for goods and less money saved. Accumulation of savings\nare encouraged primarily by a desire for security against future con-\ntingencies, rather than to finance specific purchases of consumer durables.\nHolders of liquid assets may be expected to maintain their savings largely\nintact if they maintain confidence in the integrity and value of the dollar\nand have adequate income to make it unnecessary to use savings for current\nliving expenses. If speculation, encouraged by run-away prices, occurs, how-\never, savings may be diverted to stocks and real estate, culminating in a\ndisastrous deflation. Should this situation arise, the decade of 1929-1939\nwhen savings continued upward despite large-scale unemployment may be\nrepeated. The best assurance for effective demand reflected in purchases of\nconsumer goods focuses largely upon sustained high levels of employment,\nproductivity, and real consumer incomes resting upon economic stability,\nrather than relying upon a demand created out of savings.\n\nThe tremendous backlog of individual holdings of liquid assets are in-\ndubitably potential creators of expanding markets, and will /end to raise the\naggregate income-consumption schedule of the nation. But in the process of\nmaking an appraisal of the influence of savings upon new markets, and the\nextent to which the national consumption function will be influenced, it is\nvital that the pattern of the distribution of savings among families and\nindividuals in various income classes be given adequate recognition.\n\nCuanrEs D.

On balance,\noutlays for current consumption represented a smaller share of income in\n1944 than in 1941 among families in the income groups above $2,000 after\ntaxes. But urban families with incomes under $2,000 required a considerably\nlarger share for essential goods and services in 1944 than in the earlier year.\n\nUrban families and single individuals having incomes over $3,000, com-\nprising 42 per cent of the total consumer units, accounted for 60 per cent of\nthe aggregate consumption expenditures in 1944 (Chart II). In contrast,\nurban families and single individuals with incomes under $2,500, comprising\n45 per cent of all consumer units, made 27 per cent of the aggregate con-\nsumption expenditures. The remainder of consumer units, having incomes\nbetween $2,500 and $3,000, which accounted for 13 per cent of the urban\nfamilies and single individuals, made 13 per cent of the aggregate consump-\ntion expenditures.\n\nThe skewness of savings fer se is clearly depicted in Chart III which\nshows that the high income classes accumulate most of the savings of the\ncountry. In contrast to the appreciable net deficits of 31 per cent of the con-\nsumer units with incomes below $2,000, Chart III reveals that 64 per cent\nof the aggregate annual savings were made by consumer units having money\nincomes of $5,000 and over, comprising 13 per cent of urban families and\nsingle persons of the nation.\n\nThe pilot study of liquid asset holdings in 1945 made by the Bureau of\nAgricultural Economics corresponded to the findings of the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics.5 The BAE study covering both rural and urban areas indicated a\nconcentration of ownership of savings and in each income class there tended\nto be a few cases of large holdings.

The most striking example of this phenomenon is represented by the decreased percentage\nof average total expenditure for food over this period. This is largely attributable to Progress\nin food ?roduction. While the relative proportions spent on certain other categories of con-\nsumption increased, the proportion of money outlay for housing, fuel, and light have remained\nrelatively stable. In contrast to Engej's law which is primarily restricted to varying proportions\nof income spent for various categories of consumption or saved by different income groups at a\nparticular time, the following table (on page 897) indicates the Aistorical development of these\nshifts in relative proportions expended for major groups of consumption or the aggregate\nbudget pattern for wage earner's families over periods of time.\n",

Slichter, who prognosticated post-\nwar markets under the assumptions of whether savings would be ''hot\" or\n\"warm,\" assuming different degrees of price and wage controls.! Despite the\nattention devoted to the holdings of liquid assets by individuals, which will\nobviously influence the national consumption function, insufficient con-\nsideration has been given to the distribution of accumulated savings among\nthe various income groups or to the attitudes of holders of these savings.\nBefore a sound quantitative appraisal can be made of the translation of this\npotential purchasing power into effective demand, information of this charac-\nter is needed. Such factors as liquidity preferences of individuals and the\nmarginal propensity to consume suggest questions which must be con-\nsidered before an hypothesis of post-war markets can be made on the basis\nof the accumulated aggregate savings of individuals.\n\nIt is the purpose of this paper to depict the wartime pattern of expendi-\ntures and savings by income classes, and to examine the significance of this\nempirical evidence as these factors relate to the forecasting of new markets.\n\nIL.

                    "Concept and Teaching of Economics: Comment\n\nIn his criticism of the traditional introductory course in economic prin-\nciples under this title! Dr. Mendershausen confuses two entirely different\nproblems. First, is the content of this course as now given conducive to an\nunderstanding of economic reality? Second, should we begin economic in-\nstruction with economic theory,\"\u2014that is, a system of necessarily abstract\nconcepts\u2014or should we rather arouse the students' interest by painting\nbroad historical-sociological pictures, starting with the \"*origin and signifi-\ncance of the Ghost Dance among the American Indians in the late 19th\ncentury\" and ending up with nothing less than the 'Great Depression and\nthe War.\" That we are actually dealing here with two different issues can\nbe most easily seen in Mendershausen's suggestion that in the later years\nof college study the students should go \"into intermediate, specialized work\nin economics.\" Surely, Mendershausen cannot intend that these later\ncourses in economics should take up the teaching of the \"rationale of a sel\u00edf-\nregulating system of markets (market economy),\" which he so severely\ncondemns as unrealistic in the earlier sections of his article. He must be\nreferring to a different and sufficiently realistic type of economic theory,\nthough possibly not \"pure and systematic\" according to his terminology\n(p. 379); if so, he has failed to demonstrate that it would be impossible to\nteach an introductory course in \"economic principles\" using this type of\nmaterial.\n\nMendershausen's inability to realize this simple truth is rooted in his\npersistent identification of economic theory\" with the theory of ''a self-\nregulating system of markets\" and the '\"'crusade against the interference\nwith market self-regulation\" (p. 379). He would do well to ponder Keynes's\ndictum: \"The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled\nconclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than\na doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking, which helps\nits possessor to draw correct conclusions\"?\n\nWhat Mendershausen does not realize is that any free enterprise system,?\neven if it is not self-regulating and is \"interfered\" with, can be understood\nonly with the help of the conceptual apparatus which has been largely\ndeveloped by the neo-classical theory.

This committee not only estab-\nlished ten subcommittees on the varied phases of the subject with a total\nof seventy-eight members and consultants but also sponsored a lively dis-\ncussion of undergraduate teaching at the 58th annual meeting?\n\nThe most recent attempt to raise the level of teaching took the form of\n2 Conference on the Teaching of Economics at The American University,\nAugust 19-31, 1946. At this conference, fourteen distinguished professors\nof economics discussed objectives and effective methods of teaching for\ntwo weeks with eighteen instructors from all sections of the country and\nfrom Canada. Special features of the meetings included a demonstration of\nvisual methods of presentation, lectures on government sources of informa-\ntion, a book exhibit and several social affairs. The entire fifty-five hours of\nthe discussion was recorded. The conference was organized by the Teaching\nInstitute of Economics at The American University, which is operated\nunder a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. At the same time it\nrepresented an experiment by thesubcommittee of the Association on The\nTraining of Teachers of Economics.\"\n\nEven for the group of leading college teachers, the conference had con-\nsiderable value. Separated as they are, they would not ordinarily consult\nwith each other on teaching problems for more than a few minutes a year\nduring the annual meeting. For the younger teachers, the experience was\nunique. Seldom does an economist have a chance to review the currents of\neconomic thought as they affect teaching with a group of experienced\nteachers who are paying attention to his problems.\n\nNo attempt was made to formulate the wide range of thoughts and sug-\ngestions expressed at the conference into any series of resolutions or findings.\nMajor attention was given to the introductory course, not only because that\ncourse is crucial but also because, illogically, most colleges assign this most\ndifficult job of teaching to their least experienced teachers. A good deal of\nattention was devoted to the sequence of undergraduate work, to the teach-\ning of economic history and to the special needs of business, government\nand agriculture. At every point the questions of teaching technique were\ndiscussed in close relationship to the broad aims and philosophy of the\nsocial sciences and to the real needs of students.\n\n1 The college curriculum in economics has received some recent attention, for example,\nby Horst Mendershausen, R.

In coal mining, output\nper man-shift in 1938 averaged 1.14 long tons, compared with 4.37 long\ntons in the United States. In building construction, labor productivity\nwas probably 60 per cent that in the United States. In agriculture,\npublic utility operation, the distributive trades, and in the performance\nof personal and business services, labor productivity appears also to\nhave been less in Britain than in America, but the difference was, of\ncourse, much less than in manufacturing and mining. Shipbuilding is\nthe only important industrial category in which a labor productivity is\nknown to have been about the same in Britain and America.\n\nThe difference between British and American labor productivity be-\nfore the war was not readily apparent merely from a comparison of\nliving standards because a larger fraction of the population sought\nemployment in the United Kingdom than in the United States and also\nbecause there was proportionally less involuntary unemployment in\nthe United Kingdom.

Rostas, particularly his first\narticle, Industrial Production, Productivity and Distribution in Britain, Germany and the\nUnited States, 1935-37,\" Economic Journal, January 1943. This paper was the subject of dis-\ncussion at a meeting of the Royal Statistical Society, 21 March 1944, the minutes of which are\ngiven in the Society's Journal, Part I, 1944.

While differing\nin detail from country to country, these reform programs have generally\nprovided for the withdrawal of most, if not all, of the outstanding notes\nand for their conversion into new currency. \u00cdn most cases, only a\nmoderate part of the withdrawn currency has been exchanged, the\nremainder being blocked in bank accounts from which withdrawals or\ntransfers may be made only up to specified amounts or for specified\npurposes. Simultaneously, in most countries, the same or similar restric-\ntions have been imposed on all or part of the bank deposits existing at\nthe time of the adoption of these measures. Subsequently the blocked\nbalances resulting from these operations have been partly released and\nadditional portions have been or are about to be absorbed by the issue\nof government securities and by special capital levies and war profit\ntaxes.\n\nThe broad objectives of most of these post-war monetary reform\nschemes have been to exert a restraining influence on the public's ex-\npenditures, to force people to seek employment by making them\ndependent on current income instead of past savings, and to deprive the\npublic of funds with which to purchase in black markets. In some\ncountries, the conversion of currency has been chiefly an instrument for\nthe detection of concealed wealth held in monetary form and of income\ntax evasion during the war period. An incidental purpose of the reform\nmeasures has been to ascertain and cancel the amount of notes held by\nthe enemy and lost or destroyed in the course of the war. Unification of\nthe currency has been another, though never the sole, objective in\ncountries where a multitude of currencies have been introduced during\nthe war.

But it seems unlikely that all these factors would enable the\nUnited States to maintain full employment after the transition period\nwithout a substantial budget deficit. . . . \"\n\nThis is the gist of Mr. Kalecki's article on \"The Maintenance of Full\nEmployment after the Transition Period,\" which appeared recently in the\nofficial organ of the International Labour Office.! More specifically, the\narticle suggests that full employment in the United States in 1950 presumes\na budget deficit of 13 billion dollars and an export surplus of 2 billion dollars?\nor some other combination of deficit spending and export surplus totaling\n15 billion dollars. Although the arguments of the article are not more\noriginal than its conclusions, it deserves attention for three reasons: first,\nbecause it appears under the sponsorship of an influential international\norganization; second, because it is typical of an economic school that was\nfairly influential in Washington until its forecasts were exposed to the test\nof checking with facts; third, because it appeared after this embarrassing\ntest had been completed.\n\nThe reasoning of the article rests on the well-known observation that the\nnet national income may be represented in two ways: either as a sum of\npersonal consumption, public expenditure for goods and services, net private\ninvestment, and export surplus; or as a sum of personal consumption, taxes\navailable for public expenditure for goods and services, and savings. Sub-\ntracting private consumption and taxes from both aggregates, one finds\nthat, apart from minor adjustment factors, savings (S) must equal the sum\nof net private investment (7), export surplus (E), and budget deficit(D).\n\nFrom the tautological formula (S \u20141IJ-E--D) other equations showing\nthe relationship between the same four items may be deduced, all equally\ntautological and none providing any insight into the mysteries of the\nmodern economy.

ADELMAN*\n\n* The author is an economist in the Division of Research and Statistics, Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System.\n\nRecent Activities of Soviet Economists\n\nDuring the years of World War II, Soviet economists, like their colleagues\nin the United States and Great Britain, concentrated the great bulk of their\nenergies upon problems connected with different aspects of the war effort.\nThis activity encompassed not only all aspects of the internal economy of\nthe U.S.S.R., but was also directed at understanding developments in the\neconomies of all major foreign nations, with some particular stress in the last\ntwo years upon efforts being made to secure international cooperation in\nvarious economic fields such as finance, trade, agriculture, labor, etc.!\n\nDuring the past two years, Soviet economists concentrating upon prob-\nlems of the internal development of the U.S.S.R. have been engaged pri-\nmarily in planning the restoration of devastated areas in the Soviet Union\nand charting the future economic development of their country. Much of\nthis work has been done by personnel of Gosplan (the State Planning Com-\nmission) and the Institut Ekonomiki (Institute of Economics of the Acad-\nemy of Science of the U.S.S.R.), as well as by economists attached to various\nother governmental organs. The most important results of this activity were\nembodied in the Fourth Five Year Plan adopted by the Supreme Soviet of\nthe U.S.S.R. in March, 1946.* Considerable research and planning have\napparently also been done on the longer range economic development of the\nU.S.S.R.*\n\nSoviet economists concentrating upon the study of foreign economies and\nof international economic trends have served their country in the military\ngovernments which have been set up for the areas occupied by the Red\nArmy; in the negotiation of trade agreements with Rumania, Poland, Fin-\nland, Argentina, Iceland, Bulgaria, and other countries; as advisers to Mr.\nMolotov in the meetings of the Foreign Ministers of the leading powers\namong the United Nations; and as representatives of or observers for the\nU.S.S.R. at the meetings of various international organizations such as\nU.N.R.R.A.,, F.A.O., the International Bank and Fund, etc.\n"

There would seem to be good reason to advocate\nthat this attention should be reciprocated by American economists who\nmust more and more take cognizance of Soviet policies in the most diverse\nareas of domestic and international economic activity. But before this is\npossible steps will have to be taken to increase the flow of economic mate-\nrials and to increase the number of economists competent to use the data\nin original Russian sources.\n\nCucinmaX\n",

This includes a considerable literature consisting of books, pam-\nphlets, and articles in magazines and newspapers. Little of this is generally\navailable to private American citizens since much of the published output\nof Soviet economists is apparently not sent to the United States, or so few\ncopies are sent that only a few specialists are able to obtain the material.\nThe only source of supply for books is the Four Continents Book Store at\n255 Fifth Avenue, New York City; and this store is prevented by law from\nsending material through the mails. Varying amounts of recent original\nRussian materials are available at the Library of Congress, the New York\nPublic Library, Columbia University, and the American Russian Institute\nin New York City.* Attempts to build up such collections are now being\nmade at Harvard and Syracuse universities. Obviously, for the student who\nis not located in or near Washington or New York, recent Russian materials\nare extremely difficult to obtain.\n\nIn view of the scarcity of the original materials in this country, it seems\nuseful to present a short bibliography of significant recent economic writing\nin the U.S.S.R. Among the major studies written in the U.S.S.R. during\nthe last two years are the following (some of the studies below were only\nin manuscript at the time the most recent information became available):\n\nSovrier EcoNourcs AND EcoNouric TuovcuT\n\n1.

The first\nvolume, which is believed to have been issued in 1945, traces the\ndevelopment from the ninth to the middle of the nineteenth century\nand has five sections:\n\n(a) General character of the development of Russian economic\n\nthought.\n\n(b) Economic thought in pre-feudal and feudal Russia.\n\n* The paucity of Russian economic material for Americans should be contrasted with the\nvery full knowledge of American economic afiairs and writings displayed by Russian authors.\nJudging by the references cited in Soviet writings, Soviet economists have available virtually\nall newspapers, magazines, books, and government publications of any significance published\nin this country. Moreover, a reading knowledge of English is apparently much more frequent\namong Soviet economists than a reading knowledge of Russian among American economists.\n"

Much of\nthis work has been done by personnel of Gosplan (the State Planning Com-\nmission) and the Institut Ekonomiki (Institute of Economics of the Acad-\nemy of Science of the U.S.S.R.), as well as by economists attached to various\nother governmental organs. The most important results of this activity were\nembodied in the Fourth Five Year Plan adopted by the Supreme Soviet of\nthe U.S.S.R. in March, 1946.* Considerable research and planning have\napparently also been done on the longer range economic development of the\nU.S.S.R.*\n\nSoviet economists concentrating upon the study of foreign economies and\nof international economic trends have served their country in the military\ngovernments which have been set up for the areas occupied by the Red\nArmy; in the negotiation of trade agreements with Rumania, Poland, Fin-\nland, Argentina, Iceland, Bulgaria, and other countries; as advisers to Mr.\nMolotov in the meetings of the Foreign Ministers of the leading powers\namong the United Nations; and as representatives of or observers for the\nU.S.S.R. at the meetings of various international organizations such as\nU.N.R.R.A.,, F.A.O., the International Bank and Fund, etc.\n",

The Cohen committee rejected these alternatives, recom-\nmending that shareholders be required to state, on signing a transfer or\ndirection to the company, whether they are beneficial owners or not; that\nif any person is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of one per cent\nor more of the issued capital, he must make a full declaration to the com-\npany. In addition, the Board of Trade would be provided with drastic\npowers to investigate the ownership of shareholders whenever it is con-\nsidered desirable in the public interest.\n\nIn relation to other matters, the committee's proposals are drastic, es-\npecially as to the secretiveness of company accounts and the responsibility\nof directors. It was not generally known, before the inquiry, that the propor-\ntion of private to public companies had been steadily increasing in recent\nyears. The great advantage of the private company, the fact that it need not\nfile its accounts with the Registrar of Companies, has led many public\ncompanies to convert their subsidiaries into private companies. The\nAmendment Committee has suggested that no private company can claim\nexemption from filing accounts if its membership includes a body corporate\n(other than a corporation sole), or if a body corporate is benefcially in-\nterested in its shares. Although this recommendation permits the private\nfamily company to go unhampered, it stops abuses on the part of public\nfirms. In addition, holding companies are to disclose full information about\ntheir subsidiaries by publishing consolidated accounts. On the presentation\nof accounts generally the committee follows the suggestions of the Institute\nof Chartered Accountants, coming out strongly against hidden reserves and\nfor greatly enlarged financial statement data.\n\nOne major weakness of the Companies Act, 1929, was that directors were\nonly liable for untrue statements in a prospectus. The Amendment Com-\nmittee recommends that they should be liable at civil law also for misleading\nstatements and for the omission of material information which may be mis-\nleading. It will also make the expert liable for any untrue or misleading\nreport which he formally allows the directors to include in a prospectus.\nAdvertisements for \"*placings\" are to be put on the same footing as pro-\nspectuses.\n\nIn framing its report, the Company Law Amendment Committee has\navoided making any proposal which would restrict honest business manage-\nment, and it has endeavored to provide every possible impetus to increased\npublicity of financial facts. The balancing of these objectives, each with its\nproper emphasis and with relation to the nation's expanding peacetime\neconomy, transforms what might otherwise have been a dry state paper into\n\u00e0 well-conceived approach to the reform of major deficiencies in prevailing\nCompany Law. The incorporation of the Cohen committee's recommenda-\ntions in British statutory law should be facilitated both by their moderate\ntone and by the gravity of the business, accounting, financial and managerial\nweaknesses they seek to correct.\n"

This\ncommittee, composed of distinguished members of the bar, economists, ac-\ncountants and business men, was appointed by the Board of Trade to con-\nsider and report what major amendments were desirable in the Companies\nAct, 1929, and in particular to review the requirements prescribed in regard\nto the formation and affairs of companies and the safeguards afforded in-\nvestors and the public. Its report, published in June, 1945, has elicited wide\ncomment in both Britain and America as it provides one of the best reviews\nof traditional and contemporary accounting and corporate practice in the\nformer country. In addition, the committee proposes reforms, some con-\nservative, others drastic, for blatantly outmoded or illegitimate business\nprocedures, but it has skillfully avoided \"placing unreasonable fetters upon\nbusiness which is conducted in an efficient and honest manner,\" while\nmaking sure that \"as much information as is reasonably required shall be\navailable to shareholders and the public.'?\n\nThe Labor Government has accepted the recommendations of the Cohen\ncommittee in full and is preparing a bill to give effect to them. Before this\nmeasure is introduced in Parliament, however, companies are urged to\nbring their practices in line with the committee's proposals, a suggestion\nwhich has been followed by a number of prominent firms.\n\nThe Cohen committee expresses satisfaction that the great majority of\nof public and private limited liability companies are managed honestly and\nare of marked benefit to British trade and industry. The fullest practicable\ndisclosure of information concerning the activities of companies, in its\nopinion, will lessen the opportunity for abuse and coincide with an aroused\nSocial consciousness. The suggestions of the Amendment Committee have\nbeen aimed at aiding shareholders to exercise a more effective general con-\ntrol over the management of their companies, although they indicate that\nthis aim will be attained **more by selection of the proper governing body\nof each company than by the provisions of any statute.\"\n\nWhen viewed in its entirety, the Company Law Amendment Report is\nseen to stress that the future system of private enterprise must operate with\ncomplete honesty and with full publicity. When considering all aspects of\nbusiness and accounting practice, including company managements, the\ncommittee has attacked each subject with equal intensity except, perhaps,\nthat of the increasing use of nominees for shareholdings. So widespread, in\nfact, has this procedure become that in 1943 over 600,000 individual hold-\nings of stocks and shares were registered in the name of nominees of joint\nstock banks alone. Drastic action is called for either by the prohibition alto-\ngether of the nominee plan (except for attorneys and trustees) or nominees\nshould be compelled by law to disclose to the companies the names of their\n\n!

The case for non-price rationing in Russia\nis much the same as the case for rationing in wartime in capitalistic coun-\ntries. In both types, the pattern of income is unequal and the rich would,\nin either case, consume unduly at the expense of the poor.\n\nUnder socialism, it is doubtful whether consumers can be taxed by a\nturnover tax levied by the state upon its own agencies. Taxation implies\nthat someone is forced to give up something to the state which he would\nhave retained if the state had not exercised its taxing power. The \"turnover\ntax\" does not do this. A state sales tax upon products sold by state agencies\nisan insistence by the central administration that the accounting practice of\nthe trusts label part of the profits \"tax receipts\" instead of simply \"profits,\"\nand the tax may act as an administrative instruction to change prices of\nproducts. Only the price change can be significant, and it has significance\nas a decision to ration more or less by price and less or more by direct\nmeans. Given the price policy of the government, the \"tax\" is purely\nnominal in character and can scarcely be regarded as being a burden to any-\none.\n\nIf this point of view is correct, the tax should not be regarded as a weapon\nto \"force mobilization of the community's savings.\" If, with increases in tax\nrates, state agencies charge higher prices, the action has the effect of ration-\ning relatively more by price and, in addition, it takes more money out of the\nhands of the public. With less money, people may spend less in the future\nand thereby reduce the work-load of non-monetary rationing devices and\nincrease the relevance of price as a rationing device. Thus, it seems to me\nthat the turnover tax should not be considered as one of the more important\n\naspects of the Soviet financial system.\nTian. Dornenk\n"

                    "1946] COMMUNICATIONS 661\n\nMr. Sumberg's Interpretation of the Soviet Turnover Tax\n\nIn the March, 1946, issue of this Review, Mr. T. A. Sumberg in his article,\n\"Soviet Union's War Budgets\" provides a valuable summary and analysis\nof Russian wartime finance. In speaking of the \"turnover tax,\" Mr. Sum-\nberg states: \"The tax is the main financial instrument by which the Russian\nstate curtails consumption in order to promote capital construction and\nnational defense. Offering no possibility of evasion by the taxpayer-\nconsumer, it is also an efficient weapon for the forced mobilization of the\ncommunity's savings in the interest of rapid industrialization and urbaniza-\ntion.\"! This statement suggests a point of view which, it seems to me, should\nnot be left unchallenged. It is dif\u00fccult to understand how the tax can\noperate to curtail consumption. The allocation of resources in Russia as\nbetween production for war and for civilian purposes has been determined\nby direct rather than by financial means. The over-all plan predetermined\nwhat resources were to be devoted to war needs and what to civilian uses.\nIf by \"consumption,\" is meant \"real\" consumption, it is not clear how the\nturnover tax made any difference in the quantities of civilian goods made\navailable to the general public. Soviet civilians would not have had more\nfood if the tax had not been imposed.\n\nOne may also question whether the tax should be regarded as borne by\nconsumers. In a socialistic state, the price of products sold by the trusts are\nestablished by administrative rule. Whether the tax raises prices depends\nnot upon the tax itself but, rather, upon the accompanying instructions, if\nany, to trust price-fixers as to what price changes are to be made. If no price\nchange is made with the imposition of the tax, the taxis without significance.\nA change would be made in accounting terminology only. Instead of all of\nthe net return of the trusts being called \"profits,\" a part would be called\n\"turnover tax yield\" and the remainder, if any, \"profits.\" Such a procedure\nwould alter labels, not substance.\n\nThe Soviet practice appears to adjust prices in accordance with changes\nin the rates of the turnover tax. Even in this event, the tax itself is also of\nlittle significance; what is important is the decision to charge the public\ndifferent prices. In a setting of diminishing supplies of real things, Soviet\nofficials were forced to decide to what extent to employ price and to what\nextent to employ direct controls to ration the limited supplies among the\nmembers of the public. A decision to ration by price alone would call for\nraising prices under such conditions. The price policy of the government is\nimportant because it determines to what extent monetary mechanics\n(money expenditures and prices) are to be used to ration available supplies to\nthe public. Whatever its price policy, it seems untenable to hold that the\ncivilian population as a whole would be worse off, even if prices were set so\nhigh as to make all non-monetary rationing devices, such as rationing cards,\nselected admittance to special stores, standing-in-line, unnecessary. The\npopulation as a whole would get the same quantities, but a decision to use\nprice alone to ration might, and probably would, have given some people\n\n1 Am. Econ.

The arguments\nof its adherents run as follows: The coinage and regulation of money\nis an exclusive and sovereign prerogative of government; government\nborrowing from commercial banks is not \"genuine borrowing\"; the\ngovernment should not be obliged to pay, in perpetuity, hundreds of\nmillions a year to the banks for the deposit currency which the banks\nsimply manufacture and turn over to the government in exchange for\nits bonds; if a fiscal policy which involves the creation of new money\nis to be pursued, the government, rather than private issuing agencies\n(banks), should enjoy the seigniorage on the new money issues. In\nother words, most exponents of these views relating to present fiscal\npolicy regard government interest payments to the banks as wholly or\npartly unearned and, at least, a partially unnecessary burden on the\ngovernment and the taxpayer. They insist, therefore, that if the banks\nare to be permitted to create the funds which they advance to the gov-\nernment, a new, fiscally less burdensome method of compensating\nthem for manufacturing credit for the government should be instituted.\n\nOne possible and representative method calls for the issuance to the\nbanks of special, non-marketable, non-interest-bearing securities. This\nmethod contemplates that, in return for the monetization of each se-\ncurity of a given denomination, the banks be paid a \"reasonable\"\nservice charge at the time of issuance, but nothing in the way of interest\nthereafter. The criterion of repayment of even the principal of such\nsecurities would be inflation control, not contractual obligation.\n\nAs safeguards against possible inflation, the more subtle proponents\nof this sort of fiscal innovation propose that the monetary authority be\ninvested with plenary powers over reserve requirements, open market\noperations and, in addition, the power to impose special taxes to re-\ntrieve inflationary excesses in the money supply.\n\n'\n* The author is professor of economics at Roanoke College.\n",

            "found": "The integrating principle of economics lies in maximizing satisfac-\ntions by the use of available scarce resources, in man-hours and the\nbounties of nature, as well as in savings resulting in capital. The\nallocation of these resources among the various spheres of enterprise,\nthe combination of varieties of one resource with varieties of another\nresource, the substitution of one resource for another, and the division\nof income between consumption and saving, are central in achieving\nmaximum satisfaction with the resources at hand.\n\nUnder capitalism the guide to the distribution of resources among\nthe channels of economic activity is price, the price of consumer goods\nand the price of the resources, labor, land and capital, in a setting\nof free enterprise and competition. We balance utilities against costs.\nTo use a few simple examples, in competitive equilibrium the fact\nthat price equals minimum average cost implies that the least expendi-\nture of resources is incurred to obtain a utility; the assertion that\nthe inefficient producer drops out of competition means that the\nproducer who uses up more resources than other producers in order\nto get the same result is eliminated; and when a high cost and high\nprice are associated with small purchases of a given commodity, the\nidea is that, because a given utility necessitates a large use of.re-\nSources, it is enjoyed sparingly.\n\nIt is doubtful whether Adam Smith, Ricardo and their early fol-\nlowers, from whom Marx learned much of his economics, put this\nprinciple at the heart of economic analysis. To Smith the central prob-\nlem of political economy was efficient production, to Ricardo the\nexploration of the principles of the distribution of income. The place\nof utility. was not prominent in their minds. Smith goes no farther\nthan to mention that all production is evidently for purposes of con-\nsumption;* Ricardo goes no farther than to state that if goods are to\nbe produced at all they must be useful. To Marx economics is pre-\n&minently a study of class exploitation in a given society in its evolution\nto the next, higher, social order, and the object of the economics of\ncapitalism specifically is the investigation of the principles governing\nthe exploitation of the proletariat, the fatal maladies of the system,\nand its dialectic disintegration into socialism and communism.

            "found": "The perfect labor market usually assumed in discussions of wages tends\ntoward an equilibrium position in which workers of equal ability working\nequally hard at identical jobs under uniform conditions would receive equal\nwage rates. While actual labor markets are obviously far from perfect, one\nis still inclined to believe that some such tendency toward wage equalization\nis operative. |\n\nIt is always somewhat disturbing, therefore, to observe the great variety\nof rates for apparently comparable jobs which prevails in actual labor\nmarkets. The National War Labor Board has during the past several years\ncollected the rates paid by different firms for certain \"key occupations\" in a\nlarge number of industrial areas. Inspection of these data indicates that\nthe highest rate in an area is usually at least 50 per cent and frequently\n100 per cent above the lowest rate for workers classified under the same job\ntitle.\n\n\"These differences in rates are of course not necessarily significant for wage\ntheory. Their significance could be determined only by correcting for all the\nconditions assumed equal in the theoretical problem. First, the workers\nwhose earnings are being compared may not be of equal ability or may not\nbe working equally hard. This could readily account for differences in piece-\nrate earnings, and even under time rates, inter-firm wage differences might\nbe offset by differences in the level of ability or effort required by various\nfirms. Second, jobs called by the same name may not be the same jobs and\nthe workers doing them may not be interchangeable. Terms such as 'ma-\nchinist,\" *welder,\" and even \"common laborer\" are notoriously unreliable\nindicators of job content.\n\nThird, even if one could find two jobs requiring performance of exactly\nthe same operations, these jobs might differ in almost numberless other\nrespects. Among these are the extent of \"fringe\" wage payments\u2014 bonuses,\npaid vacations, paid holidays, pension systems, free medical care, etc.\u2014the\nshift involved and the shift differential if any, the expected regularity of\nwork, the length of the work day and week, the extent to which the worker\nis protected against layoffs by seniority or other rules, the opportunity for\nadvancement, physical conditions of work, the congeniality of fellow-workers\nand supervisors, the quality of personnel management in the company, and\nthe presence or absence of a union. Competition in a perfect labor market\nis supposed to equalize, not money rates of wages, but the total attractiveness\nof the same job in different plants. The conclusions of theory could be tested,\ntherefore, only if it were possible to measure the total attractiveness of a\n\n*'The author is associate professor of economics and associate director of the Labor and\nManagement Center at Yale University.\n"

The Need for a National Full-Employment and\nFull-Production Policy\n\nA number of economic models relating to the national budget\nrecently developed on the basis of pre-war income and expenditure\npatterns have demonstrated that severe depression in the years\nimmediately following the transition period is highly probable in the\nabsence of a national policy to assure full employment. From these\nmodels the economists have concluded that in the post-war period (1)\nnational policy must be directed toward changing the income and\nexpenditure patterns so as to increase private expenditures for con-\nsumption and tangible investment, and (2) the federal government\nmust assume the responsibility of adjusting its own outlays and\nrevenues so as to maintain aggregate expenditures on goods and services\nby both government and the private economy at the level required for\nfull-employment production.\n\nThe logic underlying these models will be indicated in a later section.\nThe conclusions derived from the models may, however, be arrived at\nin a very simple manner. In 1944 and the first half of 1945, the\nAmerican economy produced at an annual rate of about 200 billion\ndollars of finished goods and services for consumption, business invest-\nment and government use. Both the labor force and the output per\nmanhour have been subject to conflicting influences during the war,\nsome of which have tended to raise and others of which have tended\nto lower the gross national product. There is widespread agreement,\nhowever, that when these wartime influences are eliminated, the\nAmerican economy, in the years immediately following the transition\nperiod, will be able to produce the same total volume of goods and\nservices as it did at the peak of the war effort. Our capacity to produce\nin 1950, in other words, will be about 200 billion dollars gross national\nproduct in 1944 prices, and it will steadily increase thereafter as a\nresult of population growth and increases in productivity.^\n\n* The views expressed by Mr. Mosak are his own personal opinion and do not necessarily\nreflect in any way those of the Office of Price Administration.\n\nThe author is indebted to the following persons for their very careful reading of the\nmanuscript and their many helpful suggestions: Henry S.

Psychology and Economics\n\nIn his presidential address at a recent meeting of a psychological\nassociation, Gardner Murphy pointed out that most of the problems\nfacing psychologists today are interdisciplinary problems.'

If the economist borrows his conception of man\nfrom the psychologist, his constructive work may have some chance\nof remaining purely economic in character.

Hicks elaborates a\npartial theory of invention which, though incidental to his theory of\ndistribution, nevertheless embodies the use of concepts which have\nso captured the economist's fancy that the theory of invention has\nachieved a certain fame of its own. Indeed, the terms *labor-saving\"\ninvention, \"induced\" invention, and *autonomous\" invention have be-\ncome stock in trade to most economists, so much so that they are\nfrequently used without questioning the ultimate theory of techno-\nlogical progress upon which they rest. The Hicksian exposition is\nbased in part upon a dichotomy between the induced invention and\nthe autonomous invention; and in part upon a distinction between the\nlabor-saving and the very labor-saving invention. It will be shown\nin the following discussion that the first classification is not all-\ninclusive and, in fact, omits, either through obscurity or error, what\nis a very common type of labor-saving invention. The second classifica-\ntion, while more proper, is mistaken in emphasis.

At the same\ntime there is fairly general agreement that the volume of aggregate\neffective money demand for consumers! durable goods will play a\nstrategic part in this problem. This volume is in turn determined by\nvarious factors, among which two are by far the most important. One\nis the number of consumer units (single persons or families); the other\nis the amount of income which each consumer unit is able and willing\nto spend for these goods. In recent economic literature there has been:\na tendency to assert or to imply that, in the long run, variations\nin aggregate effective demand for consumers! durables are predomi-\nnantly caused by what we may call the quantity factor\u2014the growth\nor decline, or the change in the rate of growth or decline, of the number\nof consuming units\u2014with the income factor playing only a relatively\nminor part.' Quite often this view, combined with the observation that\nwe are living in a period of declining population growth, has led to\npessimistic predictions as to the adequacy of investment outlets in the\nfuture.\n\nTwo questions must be distinguished here.

It has established the fact that most of the sudden\nexpansion lies in the current assets and that the primary source of this ex-\npansion is corporate savings. Such internal expansion has far-reaching eco-\nnomic implications.\n\nThe sample is comprised of corporations licensed to operate in Texas. We\nbelieve, however, that this sample is representative of a major part of the\nentire manufacturing industry. The companies range in size from Sterling\nAluminum Products Incorporated with average assets of $1,953,000 to the\nUnited States Steel Corporation with average assets of $2,032,248,000.? These\ncorporations include the following manufacturing classes: (1) automobiles\nand equipment, (2) building material except lumber, (3) chemicals, (4)\nelectrical machinery, (5) foods, (6) iron and steel, (7) machinery except\n\n!

                    "The Incidence of the Corporation Income Tax: A Rejoinder\n\nMr. Bowen's note raises again the question as to what \"shifting\" a tax\nmeans. Admittedly, the concept of shifting and incidence is ambiguous.\nReasonable clarity requires that all who speak of shifting specify wat is\nshifted were or to whom and by what process. It might be still better to\ndiscard the terminology entirely. In the article to which Mr. Bowen refers I\ncentered attention on the possibility of shifting through higher commodity\n",
                    "1946] COMMUNICATIONS 147\n\ntal to be reduced. This reduction in supply of capital tends to raise the\nmarginal productivity of capital and to lower the marginal productivity of\nlabor and land. In this sense, some part of the tax tends to be shifted, in the\nlong run, to workers and landowners. This shifting, moreover, is not dependent\non any change in the general level of prices.?\n\nAs Mr. Goode suggests (p. 50), this conclusion is subject to qualification.\n\"The tax, through its effects on both investment and saving, may influence the\nlevel of national income. The level of national income, in turn, may affect\nthe return to the factors. Thus, the ultimate effects of the tax may differ\nfrom its immediate effects. Any conclusion as to whether the tax, on balance,\ninfluences income in the direction of expansion or contraction depends upon\nthe character of the fiscal policy which it is assumed would be adopted in the\nabsence of the tax.\n\nThe income effects of the tax, however, do not necessarily alter the conclu-\nsions regarding its effect on the return to capital. Because of the fact that the\ntax results in a relative scarcity of capital, the rate of return to capital would\nbe higher, at any level of income, than would otherwise be expected a\u00a3 zat\nlevel of income. In this formal sense, the tax would be shifted regardless of\nits effect on national income.\n\nIt is true that if the tax were expansionary, the increase in return to capital\nresulting from the increased income would offset, wholly or in part, the direct\neffect of the tax on the return to capital, On the other hand, if the tax were\ndeflationary, as seems more likely, the income effect would accentuate the di-\nrect effect of the tax on the return to capital. Or, if the deflationary effects of\nthe tax were offset by other elements of fiscal policy designed to stabilize\nthe economy, the tax could be said to have no net influence on national income.\nIn that case, its influence on the return to capital would be confined to its\ndirect effects, and at least some degree of shifting would result.\n\nMr. Goode touches on this argument when he states (p. 50) that the cor-\nporate tax would \"limit the capital available to corporations.\" But he passes\nover the point with the conclusion that a restriction in supply of capital would\nnot necessarily produce an increase in the general price level. He ignores any\npossible relation between a reduction in supply of capital and the shifting of\nthe tax via changes in the marginal productivity of capital.\n\nHowanp R. BowEN*\n\n?

It asked that all the wage\nearners of the industry (some 519,000) be given a guarantee of full-time\nweekly wages (with an increase of seventeen cents an hour, as well) for\nthe period of the contract then under negotiation. Almost at once\nseveral other large CIO unions followed suit. Before this time, con-\ncerns here and there had experimented with wage guarantees. Prac-\ntically none of these plans had covered all the workers on the com-\npanies' payrolls or guaranteed a full annual wage.

A letter of\nDecember 1, 1944, from Chairman William H. Davis to President\nRoosevelt puts the recommendation in these words: *That the whole\nquestion of guaranteed wage plans, and the possibility of their future\ndevelopment in American industries as an aid in the stabilization of\nemployment and the regularization of production, should now be com-\nprehensively studied on a national scale.\"\n\n* The author, formerly professor of industrial relations in the Amos Tuck School of Business\n\nAdministration, Dartmouth College, died suddenly on October 16, 1947.

On the one hand, invest-\nment adds to the capital stock and enlarges productive capacity. On the\nother hand, investment is a component of the national income, strategic\nvia the multiplier, and a generator of current employment. These two\naspects of investment have usually been treated separately, since the\none is a long-run matter, the other an immediate fiscal problem. Domar\ncombines the two aspects; and he derives the concept of the \"required\nrate of investment (or income) growth\" for full employment.\n\nIn his first formulation of this analysis, Domar indicated a policy\nconclusion regarding the effect on private investment of a government\nguarantee of national income growth. Briefly his conclusion was that if\nprivate business can be made to expect national income to grow at the\n\"required rate,\" there will be a tendency for private investment to re-\nspond to this expectation in such aggregate volume as to effectuate that\nrate, justifying expectations and leaving to government only the role of\ncreating appropriate expectations.?\n\n\"This conclusion is very similar to one reached by Mr. R.

It is not proposed to attempt a com-\nplete description of the economic effects of various types of exchange\ncontrol, for in general these can be inferred from a sufficiently lucid\nexposition of character and aims. Exchange control is understood gen-\nerally to include any or all of the instruments dealt with below; con-\nsequently more precise definition is unnecessary, and indeed\u2014in view\nof the varieties of meaning both in popular and technical discussions\u2014\nprobably impossible. But to aid in marking off the field in advance, it\nmay be said that exchange control is not generally taken to include the\nfollowing: tariffs, quotas, prohibitions and embargoes, subsidies, state\ntrading and commercial agreements and treaties. It impinges upon these\nat points but does not include them.\n\nIn order to set the whole subject in perspective, we begin with two\nlists, one giving the main instruments and the other the main purposes\nof exchange control. The discussion follows the first outline, with con-\ntinuous cross reference to the second.

Large variations in consumers! pur-\nchasing effects a change in the rate of input at the manufacturer's end of\nthe pipeline.\n\nFor example, a sudden decline in retail sales prices will result in an actual\ninventory loss to a retailer if the new sales price is lower than his cost, or in\na shrinkage of his margin of profit if the new sales price does not decline as\nfar as his costs. (The margin of profit on goods not yet purchased by him\nwill not be affected due to the tendency of wholesale prices to decline sub-\nsequently if they have not done so previously. Knowing the vast pos-\nsibilities of inventory losses, business men are extremely nervous about\ntheir inventories whenever prices show tendencies to weaken. Therefore\nthey strive (1) to keep inventories adequate for deliveries, (2) to increase\nthem quickly if prices show inclinations to rise, and (3) to bring them down\nclose to minimum if prices appear to weaken.\n\nThus manufacturers, most of whom believe (rightly or wrongly) that\ntheir least cost point is at or very near their capacity output,\" determine\ntheir scale of operations on the basis of the volume of average wholesale\npurchases, minor variations in such purchases being absorbed by changes\nin the stock of finished goods carried by manufacturers. Any tendency of\ninventories to rise above normal is viewed with alarm and may become the\nbasis for a curtailment in production schedules. By contrast, difficulty of\nmaintaining inventories above the minimum may lead to an increase in\nproduction. Knowing the sequence of events, a softening of prices at the\nretail level sometimes causes a manufacturer to curtail production without\nwaiting for the decreased demand to affect his inventories. The motive in\nsuch an event is to prevent or forestall an inventory problem rather than to\ncorrect it after it has arisen. Marginal costs are not considered in making\nthese decisions.\n\nWholesalers act on the same principle, striving to keep inventories ade-\nquate to make deliveries, but avoiding excessive inventories except when\nthey wish to speculate on rising prices. The method by which retailers\ngovern their scale of operations has been described. If any of the three be-\ncomes alarmed at a tendency of his inventory to mount, he adjusts his price\nvoluntarily to reduce his inventory and so avoid a forced inventory loss of\ngreater proportions later. The effect of this price reduction is passed forward\nor back along the pipeline in accordance with the principles just outlined.\n\nThe suggestions of a critic of this paper that marginal analysis is the only\ntheory consistent with the fact that output of individual plants fluctuates\nwith moderate price fluctuations in competitive industry is none-sense. It is\ntrue that if one assumes the validity of the marginal theory, a decline in\nprices should lead to a curtailment of output.

Some Implications\n\nThe analysis just made, if correct, raises serious questions concerning the\nvalue of marginal theory as an explanation of how entrepreneurs determine\nthe most profitable scale of output for their enterprises. Theorists of the\nmarginal school complain loudly at their critics! \"lack of proof\" that busi-\nness men solve their problems without resort, consciously or unconsciously,\nto the marginal-type analysis. Their position implies that their graphic\ndemonstrations have proved the practicability of their theories so that the\nburden of proving them inadequate rests upon their opponents. Their\nattitude is summed up in the following question: *\u00abIf entrepreneurs do not\ndetermine the scale of output on the basis of marginal cost concepts, then\nhow do they do it?\"', the implication being that until an alternative theory\nappears the marginal doctrine stands unshaken. The question is a fair one\nbut it does not follow that absence of an adequate explanation froves the\ncorrectness of an existing explanation. Fortunately, however, there is no\nSecret as to how business men actually determine a scale of output for their\nenterprises.\n\nThe pipeline that conveys goods from producer to consumer has reservoirs\nat various points. These reservoirs are the inventories carried by manufac-\nturers, wholesalers and retailers. When prices are stable, manufacturers\nfeed finished goods into the pipeline at the same average rate as consumers\ndraw them out at the other end.

The effect of such advance\nplanning is to shift the optimum relationship in each case further to the\nright and by so doing to greatly shorten or eliminate entirely the stage of\ndiminishing average returns that results when some of the factors reach\ntheir optimum ahead of others.\n\nBut when production is carried on in poorly designed buildings or on\nlocations provided by nature, attention cannot be paid to all of the various\nrelationships involved. Under such circumstances an attempt to increase the\nscale of operations is apt to cause a less than ideal relationship to exist\nquite early among several of the factors involved. The result is that opera-\ntions move quickly into the stage of diminishing average returns.\n",

The addition of an eleventh\nman would either improve or detract from this near-perfect situation. Now\nit is possible that the addition of an eleventh man might improve all three\nof the relationships described above; or it might better two and worsen\none, or it might worsen two and better one, or it might worsen all three.\n\nIn the simple illustration of the paragraph above a unit of input was\ndivided into three sub-factors; (1) relation of men and machines to floor\nspace, (2) relation of men and machines to movement of material, and\n(3) the division of the complete job into subtasks. In an actual case, of\ncourse, what passes as a \"unit of input\" would involve many more than\nthree such relationships. When production is carried on in a large plant with\nvery few men, the addition of one, two, or a few more men probably im-\nproves all of the relationships and so increases output more than propor-\ntionate to the increase in labor applied. But if additional men are continu-\nally added, a time eventually comes when the individual relationships pass\ntheir optimums and begin to exert an influence in the opposite direction.\nAs long as only a few of the relationships work adversely, the result is in-\ncreased output at a decreased rate, 7.e., diminishing average returns. But\nwhen all or a majority of the relationships pass their optimum simultane-\nously, production shifts from a stage of increasing average returns directly\ninto a stage of decreasing total returns without passing through a stage of\ndiminishing average returns.\n\nThis last observation raises two questions: (1) what decides the optimum\npoint for a given relationship and (2) how reasonable is it to expect that the\noptimum of several relationships will coincide? The answer to the first\nquestion is simple. The optimum of a given force is reached when the re-\nlationship of the number of input units applied is adjusted perfectly to the\nforce under consideration. To illustrate, as far as machine location is con-\ncerned, output per variable factor will tend to be greatest when the number\nof men employed is best adjusted to the number of machines that can be\neconomically housed in a plant. This last depends upon the design of the\nbuilding. As far as movement of materials is concerned, output per variable\nfactor will tend to be greatest when the number of men employed is best\nadjusted to the carrying capacity of the conveyor system used. A similar\nrelationship exists between the number of men employed and any other\nfactors which might need to be considered.\n\nIt remains to be ascertained whether or not it is reasonable to expect the\noptimum relationship of men to machines to coincide with the optimum\nrelationship of men to material-flow and to other factors. The answer is\n*tyes,\" if the fixed factor was designed by engineers and \"no,\" if it was sup-\nplied by nature. When production is carried on in quarters designed for the\npurpose, those in control take into consideration a// the relationships in-\nvolved and strive by careful planning to prevent any one of them from\ndecreasing efficiency until operations are close to plant capacity. Thus if\nSpace considerations prevent material being brought to laborers laterally,\n",

Obviously the\nlast unit of output can have only one cost. The truth of the matter is that\nthe MC curve does not rise vertically at the point of capacity output: it\nENDS there. A vertical marginal cost curve exists only on graphs and in\nthe realm of imagination.\n\nThus it would appear that theorists are left with a choice of wo assump-\ntions. They may assume, if !/ey wish, that the efficiency of the variable fac-\ntor is normally greatest long before capacity production is reached, in\nwhich case by their assumptions they will insure the conclusions of their\nanalysis. With equal justification they may assume, what most business\nmen believe to be a fact, that the efficiency of the variable factor is custom-\narily greatest at or near the point of capacity output, in which event\nbusiness men do not determine their scale of operations by reference to\nmarginal cost and revenues at all: they simply produce all that they can\nsell. It is important to discover which of the two assumptions comes nearer\nto coinciding with conditions existing in the world of reality.\n\nIIL Factors Responsible For Output\n\nStatistically speaking, curves of the type shown on Figures 2 and 3 are\ngraphical representations of a mathematical relationship believed to exist\nbetween two variables: input and output. Two implications are involved in\neach such graph. The first is that two, and only two, variables need to be\nconsidered. The second is that changes in input (the independent variable)\nare the causes of changes in output (the dependent variable). Actually a\n\"*unit of input\" is not a single factor exerting a unified force for increased\noutput but is, instead, a combination of forces. The change in output that\nresults from the application of an additional unit of input is a summation\nof the net effect of the component forces included in a unit of input. Some of\nthese forces tend towards increased output and some have an opposite\ntendency. For purposes of analysis, therefore, it is desirable to reduce the\nclassical **unit of input\" to the separate forces that compose it.\n\nThe concept being developed here is made clearer by an illustration. As-\nsume an enterprise with plant and equipment of fixed quantity to be operat-\ning with a labor force of ten men. The manager of such a plant will have\nanalyzed his production problems with great care.

They cannot have the cake of re-\ncovery and at the same time force the reforms down the throats of their\npeoples by an ever-expanding governmental bureaucracy.\n\nEvents are unfolding so swiftly that unless we run thrice as fast, we fall\nbehind. Such platitudes as \"freer trade,\" \"international economic coopera-\ntion\" and \"raising the standard of living of the masses,\" are poor sub-\nstitutes for original and realistic thinking.

Perhaps it is too late to check, let alone reverse, the process of disin-\ntegration of our economy. Of one thing I am certain, that the U.S.S.R. does\nnot have the answer.

Since the major part of total mortgage principal payments on\nowner-occupied homes covered in each of the surveys is made by families\nwhose income is at levels above $2,500, the survey tabulation figures on\nhousing expenditures in the upper-income brackets are less than the actual\nmoney outlay on housing.'

Hostile critics tend to\nportray it as a dictatorship governed by an official bureaucracy: the\nunion here becomes synonymous with its leaders. Economic theorists\nare prone to regard it as a monopolistic seller of labor governed by a\nmaximization principle; the union thus becomes analogous to a business\nfirm marketing a commodity.\n\nNone of these images is sufficiently accurate to provide a suitable\nbasis for an analysis of trade union policy.

Its dealings with\nmember banks can be largely impersonal and can be confined to a brief list\nof assets acceptable to the central bank. This view of the proper role of\nmonetary management requires the use of a few simple credit control de-\nvices of the quantitative type. Selective credit controls have no necessary\npart in such a scheme of things.\n\nThis view is obviously not in harmony with the current policies of the\nFederal Reserve authorities. It is not particularly helpful in pointing the\nway to an escape from the present muddle. However, if it is correct, an ap-\npreciation of it might have prevented the present situation from arising.\nFinally, it suggests that serious attention be given to resolving the problem\nof bank ownership of variable value government securities with the intent\nof developing a situation wherein traditional quantitative control devices\nmay again be utilized.??\n\nThe situation in the United States is now one in which the central bank\ncannot prevent member banks from obtaining additional reserves to sup-\nport deposits generated by new lending. The way to more reserves is open\nbecause of the commitment made to support the prices of government se-\ncurities. Thus if banks desire to expand, they cannot be restrained by central\nbank action.

This must have\ntended to divert funds from alternative uses. Margin control has prob-\nably discouraged purchasing of securities. Consumer credit control has\nprobably discouraged the buying of consumers goods, or at least the bidding\nfor them by certain potential buyers. The flow of funds through the credit\nmarket has unquestionably been modified in some degree.\n\nTo the extent that modification of outlays resulted from the rationing\nfactor represented in selective credit controls, this must have meant a\nsomewhat different set of relative price relationships than would otherwise\nhave existed. For example, during 1946 security prices and consumer goods\nprices were presumably lower than they otherwise would have been. If they\nwere not, then the Federal Reserve authorities did a great deal of work and\nendured much abuse to no purpose.\n\nThe appropriateness of inducing relative price movements by the indirect\nworkings of a system of selective credit controls needs a more adequate de-\nfense than has yet been advanced in any analysis that has come to the at-\ntention of the present writer. The malfunctioning of the economy is not\nlikely to be greatly reduced by this indirect method of influencing price\nrelationships. Selective credit control is at best a very inefficient means of\ncontrolling money outlays, for unless it is carried to the point of prohibiting\nentirely the use of borrowed funds the effect will be only to reduce somewhat\nthe volume of outlay with borrowed funds. Even if absolute prohibition is\nthe decided policy, expenditure from current income and from cash bal-\nances may still be excessive by the criteria of the controllers.\n\nThere are unquestionably occasions on which the machinery of the credit\nmarket functions badly with the result that large amounts of loanable funds\nflow into certain uses which would be better served by smaller amounts.\nThis is an inescapable result of having a free-market money economy in\nwhich borrowing and lending is permitted. Comprehensive credit rationing,\nif wisely administered, could unquestionably remedy that cause of economic\ninstability. There is, however, no reason to regard that sort of activity as\nmonetary management. Until the free-market economy has been demon-\nstrated to be unworkable it would seem to be advisable to hold to a minimum\nof governmental rationing of funds in the credit market. If that is one day\nfound to be required, the machinery for accomplishing it should not be\ncombined with the machinery for regulating the volume of the means of\npayment. Money creation and money lending are now combined because of\nthe accident of historical evolution. A rationalization of the financial ap-\nparatus of society should involve the separation of the functions.\n\nExtensive use of the powers of monetary management in their narrower\nsense of regulating the volume of the means of payment is not inconsistent\n",

Selective credit con-\ntrols are, however, to be continued in use.\n\nTurning to the question of the effects of applying selective credit controls\non the economy, one finds in this type of regulatory device certain implica-\ntions of broad significance. Selective credit controls operate to some degree\nto restrict the total volume of credit transactions. Certain prospective bor-\nrowers are granted less funds than they would like to obtain. Others are\ndenied funds entirely. Unless large loopholes in the regulations exist, alter-\nnative sources of borrowing are not available. This may result in less de-\nposit expansion and hence serve to hold down the rate of monetary expan-\nsion. It may also oblige noncommercial bank lenders to build up their cash\npositions above the desired level, assuming that alternative outlets for in-\nvestment do not exist.\n\nAs a means of controlling bank deposit expansion, selective credit control\nseems to be a cumbersome method. Commercial banks do not have a mo-\nnopoly of any type of lending and therefore other lenders, as well as banks,\nmust be brought within the scope of the controls if banks are to be regulated.\nThis is clearly apparent in the case of consumer credit control which en-\ncompasses a very large number of business establishments. The area of\nmargin control is less extensive, but is still large in terms of the number of\npersons obliged to conform to administrative orders. As monetary control\ndevices, selective credit controls have many obvious drawbacks. They cer-\ntainly cannot accomplish control of the supply of money with the same\ndegree of exactness as the relatively simple reserves-reserve ratio apparatus.\nEqually effective control over the money supply would entail so large a\ndegree of regulatory activity as to raise seriously the question of the desir-\nability of nationalizing the lending function throughout the economy. Ob-\nviously this degree of intervention is unthinkable under present conditions.\nSo long as the area of selective controls is confined to a few types of loans,\nit is unlikely that banks will be restricted in expanding their total earning\nassets. Only if selective controls became general over all areas could there\nbe a general depressing effect on bank lending.\n\nOn the other hand, if monetary management is conceived of as encom-\npassing not only control of the aggregate number of dollars, but also the\noutlays of balance holders, selective credit control can obviously exert\nsome directive force over the type and amount of money outlay, for as was\nnoted earlier, borrowed funds are used in part by spenders. The Reserve\nauthorities have prevented funds from getting into the hands of persons who\nwould have spent them for purposes which have not been regarded as ap-\n",

After 1929, for exam-\nple, bank deposits contracted in part for this reason.!5\n\nAs to consumer credit control, the same two considerations apply. A\nboom in consumer goods purchases may induce booms in other sectors of the\neconomy. Also, since consumers borrow in part directly from banks and in\npart from other lenders, who in turn borrow from banks, a boom in con-\nsumer goods purchases may lodge volatile assets in the banks.\n\nThe volatile assets argument has meaning only if it is assumed that\nbanks obtain more reserves and expand deposits on the upswing and reduce\nreserves and contract deposits on the downswing. If they simply absorb and\nthen disgorge these volatile assets without an overall expansion and con-\ntraction of the money supply, there is little to be concerned about. The con-\ntagion of booms argument is not of great force either, unless it can be shown\nthat economic fluctuations are basically psychological phenomena. In any\nevent, the central bank has strayed somewhat from its purpose when it\nbecomes concerned with such matters. If it is careful to see that these booms\nare not fed with monetary fuel manufactured by itself, it has discharged\nits full responsibility. This view is not tbat of the Reserve Board, which\nseems to subscribe to the position that the central bank should control the\navailability of funds to certain classes of borrowers in order to prevent cer-\ntain types of outlays from becoming \"'excessive.\" The Reserve Board may,\ntherefore, be said to be motivated, in part, by the third consideration dis-\ncussed above. Credit policy is thus interpreted to mean regulation of lending\nitself and not merely regulation of lending in order to accomplish monetary\nmanagement.!6\n\nSelective credit control has taken on new importance in the changed en-\nvironment of the monetary world resulting from the absorption of large\namounts of government securities by the commercial banks and the central\nbank. Control of the reserve position of member banks by the use of open\nmarket operations, the discount rate, and the variable reserve ratio cannot\nbe undertaken if the Reserve authorities are also committed to a policy of\nsupporting the level and pattern of rates on government securities. This\npolicy, embarked on early in the war, has continued down to the present\ntime, and no indication has yet been given that its early abandonment is\ncontemplated.\n\nM Cf.

During the decade of the\n1920's, the Reserve authorities emphasized that funds should be used for\n\"productive\" purposes. The stock market boom severely tested this ration-\ning plan. Only partial success was achieved in keeping funds from flowing\nthrough the securities trading channel of the credit market.!!\n\nLegislative changes in the early 1930's strengthened the powers of the\nReserve authorities respecting the use of credit in stock market speculation.\nMember banks were made subject to severe penalties for undue use of\nfunds in speculation. In short, the Reserve authorities were placed in posi-\ntion to undertake genuinely effective rationing, even to the point of denying\naccommodation to recalcitrant member banks. In connection with the crea-\ntion in 1934 of public control machinery for the securities markets, the Re-\nserve Board was empowered to set margin requirements, so that brokers\nand brokers! customers may now even be rationed out of the credit market\nentirely, as they were during the greater part of 1946. Except for this\nperiod the rationing power has been used merely to limit the amount that\nmight be borrowed by a broker or a broker's customer to a stated percent-\nage of a given asset.?\n\nAlthough the Reserve authorities have long used the eligible paper con-\ncept and moral suasion to control the use of member bank funds, and thus\nto ration funds in the credit market, one should observe that under margin\ncontrol they have been authorized to ration the funds of lenders who, unlike\nmember banks, do not have access to borrowing at the Federal Reserve\nbanks. Although brokers secure their borrowed funds mainly from banks,\nthe way having been closed to *'loans for others,\" the point that the central\nbank is engaged in a rationing action not directly related to monetary man-\nagement should not be overlooked.\n\nAn extension of this principle is embodied in consumer credit control.\nProspective buyers of consumers' goods are restricted as to the amount of\nfunds that they may borrow and as to the period of availability of the funds.\nAgain, this is a rationing action not directly related to monetary manage-\nment.*\n\nTwo possible interpretations may be made of granting power to the cen-\ntral bank to ration funds of lenders who do not have direct access to the\ncentral bank. One is that lenders will, unless checked, make available too\nlarge a block of funds. The other is that, by controlling all lenders, commer\ncial banks will be brought under control with the result that the volume ot\navailable funds will not be swollen by bank credit expansion.\n\nAs to stock market credit, there seems to be general agreement that the\nbehavior of the prices of securities should not be a responsibility of the cen- '\ntral bank. There is, however, some agreement that a speculative fever gen-\n\n1 C, O.

Maintenance of the solvency of banks\nof deposit is an inescapable requirement. Early abandonment of this\nregulatory activity should certainly not be urged. Restricting banks to\nreal bills type of assets has no sound theoretical basis, but a full repudiation\nof banking school doctrines has not yet been achieved. The final strand of\nthe argument that lenders should be constrained from making certain types\nof loans at certain times has not yet reached full theoretical development.\nIt is that aspect of the matter which will be explored here.\n\nSelective credit controls cannot accomplish much in the direction of con-\ntrolling the extent to which banks utilize their reserves. If only a few of the\nlarge number of outlets for bank funds are regulated, banks will expand in\nother directions. If stock market and consumer credit loans are restricted,\nother types of loans as well as investments will be available. The usefulness\nof selective credit controls must be found mainly in other aspects of their\nimpact on economic processes.\n\nAllocation of productive services in the economy is accomplished by\nmoney outlays, the funds for which are derived in part in the credit market.\nInstitutions which make loans therefore occupy a strategic position. Their\nallocations of funds are in part determined by price (money rates), but there\nis a substantial degree of market imperfection in credit transactions. Large\nelements of capital rationing characterize the credit market. Borrowers ob-\ntain funds by negotiating with lenders who grant or deny accommodation\non many considerations in addition to price.\" Commercial banks' lending\nactivities are characterized by rationing practices. Central banks also em-\nploy similar devices, in large part because they are operated by bankers who\napply customary business norms and practices. The central bank must at\ntimes apply effective means of stopping the drain of funds imposed upon it,\nand rationing is unquestionably an effective means. The Bank of England\nfrequently has resorted to rationing, popularly known as \"'the turn of the\nscrew.\" Rationing is a necessary part of the apparatus of controlling the\nmoney supply since control of lending is the means to that end.\n\nThe Federal Reserve authorities have made extensive use of rationing\ntechniques. The Federal Reserve System began operations in a climate of\nopinion which involved substantial adherence to theories of the banking\nSchool. Note issue and rediscounting were tied together for the purpose of\nproviding elasticity, the underlying source of which was to be self-liquidat-\ning trade paper. Paper eligible for rediscount was carefully defined with the\nresult that bank funds were rationed to the commercial loan sector of the\ncredit market. Moreover, the Reserve banks in dealing with member banks\nundertook to distinguish between paper that was \"'eligible\" and that which\nwas ''acceptable.\" Although World War I brought a significant modifica-\ntion of the meaning of eligible paper by allowing paper based on govern-\nment securities to be treated on equal terms with trade paper, the effect was\nmerely to widen the sector into which funds might flow.

                    "The immediate governing factor is the volume of member-bank reserves,\nfor one may regard the variable reserve ratio as primarily a means of con-\ntrolling the volume of excess reserves, since that has been its impact under\nexperience with it to date. There are many aspects in which this control\nmechanism works without great precision, but these must be passed over in\nthe interests of brevity.\n\nThe fact that the central bank is a lender must not be permitted to ob-\nscure the important truth that this activity is incidental to the main pur-\npose of the central bank. By lending more or less it can exert a powerful\ninfluence on the money supply. There are other variables, however, such as\ngold movements and currency movements, which must also be managed or\noffset. Similarly, commercial banks are lenders, and their lending activities\nalso are incidental to the basic purpose of achieving appropriate changes in\nthe money supply. In many respects it is unfortunate that the monetary\napparatus is combined with the capital funds supplying apparatus, but that\nmust not allow confusion to arise as to which is of basic importance. The\nmatter is further complicated by the practice of having the central bank ad-\nminister a substantial body of administrative law. This function has little\nto do with central banking in its essential purpose. Were control of the\nbusiness transactions of banks the significant matter, an agency similar to\nthe banking department of our state governments would suffice. It is not\nthat bank supervision is not of importance in keeping banks solvent and\nseeing that they are efficiently operated; the point is that such matters are\non another plane entirely.\n\nDespite general acceptance of the views set forth above, one finds that a\ngreat deal of attention has been given to the types of loans that central\nbanks and commercial banks may appropriately make. In part this is ex-\nplained by the many business failures that have occurred among institu-\ntions financed in large part by depositor type liabilities. The necessity of\nconfining the assets of such institutions to a type whose value is reasonably\nstable has been recognized with the result that an elaborate apparatus of\npublic control has been created to assure the solvency of banks of deposit.\nIn part, also, concern with bank assets is explainable in terms of the rather\ngeneral public acceptance of the real bills doctrine, the weaknesses of which\nhave now been sufficiently exposed so that no serious thought need be given\nto this set of rules for conducting bank operations.? Finally, concern with\nbank assets is explainable in terms of a view that economic activity may be\ncontrolled by bringing under control the rate of money outlay. Since out-\nlays are made in part with borrowed funds, and since banks are lenders,\ncontrol of the lending activities of banks will allow outlays to be regu-\nlated. These three explanatory factors seem to account for the tendency\n\ncustomer loan transactions or through purchase and sale of open market instruments, such as\ngovernment securities. Although the discussion here runs in terms of lending, the generalargu-\nment applies to purchase and sale of investment securities.\n\n? Adherence to the real bills doctrine neither assures bank solvency nor appropriate behavior\nof the money supply. For a recent synthesis of views, see L. W.

                    "The machinery of central banking has been created, perhaps in part un-\nintentionally, in order to make the volume of the means of payment a man-\nageable variable. Liabilities of banks, either :n the form of bank notes or\ndeposits transferable by check, have become the predominant form of\nmoney in the modern economy. In the absence of a central bank the volume\nof such liabilities may behave in an awkward fashion. The national bank-\ning system demonstrated in repeated panics that a rigid supply of money\nresults in serious difficulties. Some means must be at hand for releasing cash\ninto the economy on occasion. Only in that way can a general movement\nfrom other assets into cash be permitted. Usually a moderate release of cash\nwill serve to satisfy the demand, but under some circumstances very large\namounts are needed. Obviously any holder of free funds could perform this\nfunction.5 But a wider view of central banking than the mere prevention of\npanics has come to be accepted. Varying the volume of the means of pay-\nment is a powerful device for controlling the level of economic activity.\nAlthough there is not general agreement as to the proper occasions or the\nproper criteria for increasing and decreasing the aggregate money supply,\nalmost every one agrees that discretionary management of money should\nbe practiced.*\n\nControl of the aggregate of deposits is possible because commercial bank-\ning institutions are obliged to maintain specified reserves, usually in the\nform of deposits with the central bank, in proportion to deposit liabilities.\nThe Federal Reserve authorities have a number of means of varying the\ntotal amount of reserve balances held by commercial banks and may also\nvary reserve ratios within a specified range. This relatively simple apparatus\npermits substantial if not complete and precise management of the volume\nof dollars in aggregate cash balances. Implementation of monetary control\nentails creating means by which the aggregate deposit liabilities of member\nbanks may be altered. This aspect of the matter brings one face to face with\nthe dual character of banks which operate both as capital suppliers and\nmoney creators. At least as early as Ricardo, this dualism was clearly recog-\nnized.\" Monetary control, therefore, must be implemented through operat-\ning on the lending activities of both the central bank and the commercial\nbanks. If the money supply is to be expanded there must be more lending\nat both levels, and if there is to be contraction, there must be less lending.*\n\n5 Cf. C. O. Hardy, Credit Policies of the Federal Reserve System (Washington, The Brookings\nInstitution, 1932), pp. 30-31. To the extent that idle funds exist in the economy the position of\nthecentral bank is weakened, particularly if balance holders tend to release cash when the cen-\ntral bank is applying a restraining influence or vice versa. Autonomous velocity changes are un-\nquestionably troublesome, for as monetary theory recognizes, money outlays may change\nwithout a change in cash balances.\n\n5 The gold standard case is no exception. Even under it the central bank is supposed to pro-\nvide by management much of the automatic character of this system.\n\n? Ricardo in 1834 gave a very clear statement of the dualism in his \"Plan for the Establish-\nment of a National Bank.\" For a recent appraisal of the significance of this dualism, see L.

One's position as to whether or not consumer credit control and other\nselective credit controls should be exercised by the Federal Reserve authori-\nties depends on what purpose one sees in the existence of the Federal\nReserve System.

Because our visual memory is our\nbest aid in retaining perceptions and impressions an appeal to our eyes is\nfrequently more effective than the spoken word.

He car-\nried on a vigorous campaign to put this reform into effect and founded and\nlargely financed the Stable Money Association to promote its adoption.\n\nHis analysis of price changes led him into the theory of index numbers in\norder better to measure and control such changes, and in 1922 he published\nhis exhaustive book on that subject. In this, he advocated as an \"ideal\" in-\ndex a geometric average of the Paasche and Lespeyres formulae.\n\nIn the meantime Fisher's reformistic activities had found a full flowering.\nBeginning with the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, he labored to improve\nthe health of the public. He helped to induce President Theodore Roosevelt\nto set up the Committee on National Vitality and was largely responsible\nfor its pathbreaking report. He was one of the founders of the Life Exten-\nsion Institute and with its director, E. L. Fisk, wrote a book on hygiene en-\ntitled How to Live. A confirmed opponent of alcohol, on moralistic as well as\nhygienic grounds, he was active in getting the Prohibitory Amendment\nadopted and during the 'twenties was one of its most ardent defenders. His\nzeal in this direction was not always balanced by the scientific precision\nwhich he observed in other matters and his two little books, Prohibition at\nIts Worst and Prohibition Still at Its Worst did not exhibit his talents at their\nbest. Fisher regarded tobacco to be only one degree less evil than alcohol and\ncarried on a series of skirmishes against it which, had they met with encour-\nagement, he might well have turned into a major crusade. But this was not\nall. Believing firmly in the League of Nations, he stumped the country re-\npeatedly in its behalf and as president of the American Association for\nLabor Legislation worked for better factory legislation and for the extension\nof social insurance.\n\nIn the'twenties, Fisher, like so many others, becamesomewhat carried away\nby the rise of production and by the stock market boom. Already wealthy,\nboth by family possession and by his invention of a visible filing index and\nthe successful conduct of the business based upon it, he made large addi-\ntional amounts by speculation. All this caused him to become one of the\nmost optimistic exponents of the doctrine that we were in a new economic\nera and he was, consequently, very slow in reconciling himself to the reality\nof the Great Depression which began in October, 1929.\n\nBut once aware of what was going on, he was indefatigable in urging mon-\netary reforms which he thought would restore prosperity. He advocated the\nuse of stamp scrip, somewhat after the fashion of Gesell, in order to speed\nup the circulation of money and to prevent hoarding and, with Professor\nWarren, helped to persuade Franklin D. Roosevelt to devaluate the gold\ncontent of the dollar in 1933 as a means of raising the internal price level.\n\nIn his early work, Fisher had slighted the role of bank credit, making this\nlargely depend on the stock of money. His attempts at stabilization were,\ntherefore, directed at the money rather than the credit terms of the equa-\ntion of exchange. When, however, in the early 30'sa group at the University\nof Chicago, under the leadership of the late Henry C. Simons, developed a\nplan for a 100 per cent reserve system in which the amount of bank credit\n",

                    "In the death of Irving Fisher, American economics has lost perhaps its\nmost talented and certainly its most versatile member. Born in 1867 of an old\nNew England family, Fisher graduated from Yale in 1888 and then contin-\nued his graduate study at that institution. His early interests were in the\nfield of mathematics and physics and he was one of the cherished students\nof the justly celebrated Willard Gibbs. From 1890 to 1895 he was a member\nof the Yale mathematics faculty and later brought out texts in geometry and\ncalculus. In 1892 he published, as his doctor's thesis, the extraordinarily\nbriliant Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices,\nwhich despite the passage of more than half a century is still as clear and\nprofound an exposition of utility analysis as is anywhere extant.\n\nTransferring his professional attentions to economics, he stimulated his\ncousin Nathaniel Bacon to translate Cournot and prepared a bibliography\nof mathematical economics for this edition. But his life was threatened by\na severe attack of tuberculosis and for three years he struggled for his health\nin Colorado and California. This was in a sense the emotional turning point\nof his career. Prior to this time he had seemed to some of his students cold\nand aloof in manner and somewhat lacking in warm human sympathy. But\nthe facing of death gave to him, as to so many others, greater appreciation\nof the value of human personality and upon his return he flung himself into\nan almost unparallelled combination of acute professional investigation\njoined to an energetic and devoted activity for the public welfare. In quick\nsuccession he published remarkable books on A ffreciation and Interest, The\nNature of Capital and Income and his masterly Rate of Interest. In all of\nthese he combined a mathematical precision of thought and exposition with\na keen analysis of utility theory.\n\nFisher then turned his attention to the general increase in the price level\nwhich had been going on since 1896 and further developed the quantity\ntheory of money as an explanation for this change.

The first statement is that while I must include observations\non the management of the public debt, I cannot and do not speak for the\nSecretary of the Treasury. He speaks for himself. My second statement\nis that I cannot and do not speak for the Federal Reserve System. The\nFederal Reserve System as created by the Congress of the United\nStates is, in fact, a federal system. There is the Board of Governors at\nWashington having broad powers of policy making, supervision, and co-\nordination. There is the Federal Open Market Committee composed of\nthe members of the Board of Governors and representatives of the\nFederal Reserve banks, which has specific authority over the open\nmarket operations of the banks. There are the twelve Federal Reserve\nbanks and their boards of directors, which have been given certain\nstatutory powers and which have certain powers of advice and counsel\ngrowing out of those statutory powers. This is a federal system; it is at\none and the same time national and regional; some powers have been\ngiven to the central agency, some to the constituent parts, some to a\ncombination of the two, and some have been reserved, as usual, to the\npeople, including the Federal Advisory Council. I cannot speak for such\na system; certainly not with regard to the future. I can try to interpret\npolicy once it has been fixed by the appropriate body within the System\nbut, if I go beyond that, I am merely giving my personal views. I can\nonly speak as one individual who participates in the work of the System.\n\nI have undertaken this discussion of money management and credit\ncontrol with some hesitation. I am not unmindful of the fact that there\nwas an election recently, and the voters seemed to express impatience\nwith controls of various kinds which they had borne with varying de-\ngrees of resignation during the war.

This\nprogram does not represent a return to the international exchange and\ntrading practices of the past, however congenial such a program might\nbe to the special interests and policies of the United States. Rather it\nseeks to reconcile the principle of multilateral trade with the trend to-\nward nationalization of production and commerce in the world today.\nThis program is embodied in the International Monetary Fund and in\nthe proposed Charter for an International Trade Organization.\n\nExchange controls have been used in the past both as a means of con-\ntrolling the balance of payments and for the protection of particular\nindustries. Import quotas have likewise been employed for both pur-\nposes. In fact, a comprehensive exchange control system is generally\ncombined with a system of import licensing, and the two methods of\ncontrolling trade are often indistinguishable in practice. Even tariffs,\nexport subsidies and other instruments of commercial policy may be\nemployed for balance-of-payments purposes as well as for influencing\ntrade in a particular direction. It is significant, therefore, that the pro-\nposed Charter for an International Trade Organization provides for\nclose cooperation between the Monetary Fund and the ITO. Under the\nterms of the proposed ITO Charter all matters involving the balance of\npayments of members are to be the subject of consultation with the\n\nFund even though the practice in question falls under the category of\ntrade restrictions rather than exchange restrictions.

                    "Rigid exchange rates were believed productive of unemployment rather\nthan of confidence; the opinion has prevailed in Britain that her difficulties\nin the early 'thirties were largely explainable by adherence to a high rate for\nthe pound sterling when she returned to gold in 1925. Certain politically\nimportant sections of British opinion adopted an even more uncompromis-\ning view: exchange control was believed to offer more scope than a buffer of\nforeign exchange resources would be able to do in achieving the freedom of\ndomestic economic action indispensable to assure full employment. Like all\ncountries unable to acquire scarce currencies in adequate amounts, Britain\nplaces her faith in the hope that stable exchange rates will follow from a\nhigh level of trade and employment.5\n\nAn extreme view on the unimportance of stable exchanges as the basis for\nfull employment has been adopted by Australia, the most outspoken oppo-\nnent of the American position at Bretton Woods. Fearing a recurrence of\nthe situation of the \"thirties, when the depression in industrial countries had\na magnified effect on the economies of nations producing raw materials,\nAustralia wants to know how the former intend to maintain a high level of\nincomes. If employment and incomes abroad are prevented from collapsing,\nraw material producers and agricultural countries will not worry about ex-\nchange rates. If not, any assistance the Fund could give would be inade-\nquate. Another country relying mainly on domestic employment policies is\nSweden. According to recent statements she wishes to continue her prewar\npolicy of price stabilization. A committee of experts appointed by the Riks-\nbank in May, 1943, concluded that employment should be stabilized by\nadhering to the price program that had served so well in the past; there\ncould be no unconditional pegging of exchange rates because of the difficulty\nof reconciling this action with the basic objectives of domestic monetary\npolicy. Through especially close economic relations with the **Nordic bloc\"\nthe effects of insulation would be minimized and, as occasion offered, the\nSwedish economy would be linked more closely with the world economy.\n\nFinally, in the opinion of economists in some nations the major cause of\nunemployment throughout the world in the interwar period was the impact\nof the American depression and economic policies. Irrespective of the justice\nof this view, its acceptance denotes a reluctance to be closely joined with\nAmerica's economic fortunes. It is a problem for some countries to decide\nwhether to rely on the consumers! market in the United States, or to turn\ntheir attention to European and other markets.\n\n5 An important school of thought in the United States emphasizes the role that must be\nplayed by high levels of employment in bringing about exchange stability. Thus Alvin Hansen,\nin America's Role in the World Economy (New York, Norton, 1945), points out that imports are\ngenerally regarded as desirable only where there is full employment. One infers that with full\nemployment, payments balance, and there is no pressure on exchanges. It should be noted that\nthere is no reason to believe that stable exchanges must result from full employment.\n\n5 Tn the opinion of the Australian delegation the purposes of the Fund, which provide cri-\nteria for its management, place too little emphasis on the promotion and maintenance of high\nlevels of employment, and too much emphasis on the promotion of exchange stability and on\nshortening the duration and lessening the degree of disequilibrium in international balances of\npayments.\" Statement by the delegation of Australia concerning Article I of the Articles of\nAgreement of the International Monetary Fund.\n",

Indeed, full employment has become\nthe primary economic objective in a majority of the industrial countries\ntoday. It is this fact that makes the differing conceptions of the best way to\nachieve full employment an important obstacle to international monetary\ncooperation.\n\nThe employment philosophy of the United States is of major importance\nboth because of her predominant position in the international economy and\nin the management of the Fund, and because in the past she has not been\nvery successful in maintaining full employment. Although the original\nTreasury plan placed the emphasis entirely on stability of exchange rates\nand of international trade, the American experts became more and more\nimpressed with the part that the Fund might be able to play in stimulating\nemployment. Considerable publicity was given by Treasury and State De-\npartment spokesmen to Paragraph II of the Purposes of the Fund, which\nemphasizes the role of stable exchange rates in achieving a high rate of\nemployment through high levels of international trade.* It was set forth\nthat, freed from doubts concerning their ability to maintain the parities of\ntheir currencies, and sure of adequate supplies of scarce currencies to tide\nthem over any period of industrial readjustment, countries would be willing\nto accept imports from nations able to send goods abroad after a long con-\nflict. Thus production and employment in the United States, for example,\nwould immediately rise, incomes would remain high, and a portion would\nbe spent on imports from abroad. The fact that American industry would\nbenefit first would not hurt the export industries of other countries, since\nthroughout the world in general large imports of raw materials, machinery,\nand equipment would be needed before industries were ready to export.\n\nThe optimism of the American experts was unfortunately not shared by\nthe representatives of most other nations. Reports from London at the time\nof the Bretton Woods conference indicated that in the opinion of the\nBritish government, any international commitment must be subordinated\nto certain domestic objectives, namely, (1) stable employment, (2) control\nover the internal price level, and (3) an assured position for the United\nKingdom in the sterling bloc. In other words, Britain would insist on re-\ntaining control over the volume of employment and real income at home.\n\n5 Article I (ii) : \"To facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade, and\nto contribute thereby to the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and\nreal income and to the development of the productive resources of all members as primary ob-\njectives of economic policy.\"\n",

Although the problem is fundamentally one of foreign exchange, the\ndesire for austerity is carried so far that at times one might suppose that\nit is being practiced for its own sake. For example, Britain dislikes to accept\nFrench \"luxury\" goods in payment of surplus British exports to France.\nYet Britain has a surplus of francs; and it comes down to an exchange mat-\nter after all, since the British would like, if possible, to convert these francs\ninto currencies usable for the purchase of raw materials and equipment.\nThe alternative (unacceptable to the French) would be the repurchase of\nthese francs with exports of investment goods needed by France for her own\nrehabilitation. The adverse effect on international monetary cooperation of\nthis attitude is obvious. Some countries may be relatively well endowed\nwith the resources best used for the production of non-essentials; if a dis-\nability is placed on imports of this type, these countries are likely to find it\ndifficult or impossible to make the correction of maladjustments for which\nthe Fund is intended to give time and financial resources.\n\nAnother illustration of lack of confidence in the accomplishments of in-\nternational monetary stabilization is the widespread desire for close financial\nand economic relations with particular countries or trading areas. The meth-\nods used by the Russians to create a trading bloc in eastern Europe are\nopposed to the objectives of the Fund. The system of bilateral financial and\ntrade agreements sponsored by Britain throughout western Europe, might\nprove incompatible with a general accord. Other European countries are\nbuilding up similar frameworks, for example, France and the Scandinavian\ncountries. \"These agreements do indeed contain the provision that later ad-\nherence to an international fund is not prejudiced; but the pacts themselves\nprovide for what is in effect a network of bilateral exchange clearing, a\ndevice that throttled international trade during the 'thirties; and in any\ncase, they put the emphasis on exclusive economic blocs. It follows that\nadherence to the Fund would imply that all countries refrain from imposing\nconditions on the disposition of any balances of exchange accruing to them.\nBut the resources of the Fund alone could not be counted upon to remove\nthe desire of countries with unfavorable trade balances to try to insist upon\nexchange clearing. To accomplish this, properly rationed and adequate loans\nwould have to be made from other sources. The enormous dollar exchange\nresources contemplated under the Keynes plan would, indeed, have made\nall countries more willing to sacrifice the immediate benefits of bilateral\nclearing than did the plan ultimately adopted. The American negotiators\nknew, however, that the Keynes plan was politically out of the question in\nthe United States; on the other hand, perhaps something like the same\neffect could be achieved by an extensive system of United States long-term\nloans. Gradually commitments are being made that in the aggregate promise\nto compare ultimately with the volume of dollars provided for under the\nInternational Clearing Union proposal of Lord Keynes.

To the former some of the features of inter-\nnational monetary cooperation as defined in the Articles of Agreement of\nthe Fund do not look attractive. Their position as industrial nations is\nshaky. Not only must they struggle to retain their recently acquired posi-\ntion as exporters of manufactured goods, but they expect to be threatened\neven in their home markets as rehabilitation of Western Europe proceeds.\nThey may be counted upon to fight to retain their position, and in doing so\nare virtually certain to employ some trade practices quite inconsistent with\nthe spirit of the Fund.\n\nA more unfortunate, but rather understandable, aspect of the economic\nnationalism of the newly industrialized countries is the dislike (expressed\nparticularly in Latin America) at being called upon to lend domestic cur-\nrencies through the Fund to their western European competitors. It seems\nfoolish to them to hasten the day when competition from abroad becomes\nmore acute; lending to devastated countries through the Fund would\nshorten the time when the latter would be producing solely for home mar-\nkets. Presumably this is a form of the infant industries argument: since\nthese countries hold the view that the war merely hastened an inevitable\nindustrialization, they draw the conclusion that Europeans cannot expect\nto recover their former share in Latin American markets, and by implication\nthey appear to minimize the importance to themselves of the European\nmarket for their raw materials. Furthermore, they apparently doubt\nEurope's ability to supply them with the heavy machinery and new types\nof industrial products that they will need. Otherwise, they could hardly view\nwith apprehension the revival of Europe's industry. Latin American na-\ntions have shown a disposition to cooperate with the Fund despite this\nobjection. That they do so is attributable in part to an appreciation of other\nadvantages derivable from international monetary cooperation, and in part\nto the probability that in one way or another the United States will assist\nin the rehabilitation of European industry. In other words, the cost, in\nterms of good will, of non-cooperation with the Fund would be excessive.*\n\nThe hesitancy of newly industrialized countries to accept all the objec-\ntives of international monetary cooperation is matched by a similar hesi-\ntancy on the part of the countries, particularly in Europe, whose industry\nhas been worn out or destroyed during the war. Imports of raw materials\n\n* The point of view outlined above has, of course, been urged by opponents of the Fund in\nthe United States. Why, it is asked, provide dollar resources through the Fund and the bank to\npotential competitors who will thereby be enabled earlier to compete with us abroad, and even\nin our home markets? It is difficult to imagine a more defeatist point of view. The United States\nhas ended the wat with nearly every conceivable export advantage. The furnishing of dollars\nthrough long-term loans and through the Fund augments the demand for our goods. Our only\nproblem is to maintain our great lead in industrial efficiency, and it is evident that for years to\ncome the real difficulty will be to find enough competitive goods from abroad to maintain pur-\nchasing power for our own exports. It should be noted that the above refers to industry as a\nwhole; it is not concerned with export dif\u00fcculties facing particular industries, for example,\ncotton.\n"

They\nmay be expected to be particularly interested in the achievement of ex-\nchange stability immediately after a period of unemployment and inter-\nnational cut-throat competition occasioned by competitive exchange depre-\nciation. Again, those nations are likely to be most impressed which suffered\nmost from unstable currencies, while those which think they gained (at\nleast relatively) through world-wide exchange depreciation may favor a repe-\ntition of the same device if the circumstances are later repeated. On the\nother hand, toward the end of the war, when the Bretton Woods plan was\nbroached, many nations were sharply faced with the problem of maintaining\ninternal currency values; stability of exchange rates was, for the time being,\na derivative and secondary matter. It was understood that if currencies were\nstabilized after the war, the likelihood of obtaining large imports of the raw\nmaterials and other goods needed to ward off inflation would be greater.\nOn the other hand, this seemed like a very indirect, and relatively ineffec-\ntive, way of solving the problem of stimulating home production and re-\nlieving domestic inflation. Countries were prone to place more reliance on\ndomestic policies, particularly since some of the most pressing financial diffi-\nculties seemed to have been occasioned by the international economic co-\noperation enforced by the war. All this meant that despite adherence to a\nstabilization proposal, preoccupation with domestic concerns might lead to\nthe fundamental disequilibrium\" that must be accepted by the Fund asa\nvalid reason for allowing a change in the par value of a nation's currency.\n\nAlthough the great majority of nations have acceded to the objectives of\nthe Fund, there is an understandable reluctance to allow control over ex-\nchange rates to pass to an international body. No country would permit\nanother single country to determine the external value of its currency.\nWould it be much more acceptable, in the present state of international re-\nlations, to allow an international executive body to do so? The answer de-\npends on how general is the belief in the disinterestedness of the executive\ndirectors of the Fund. Although the choices of personnel have been such as\nto inspire much confidence in the excellence of the management, of neces-\nsity they have had to reflect concentrations of national and regional power.\nConsequently, the less powerful the nation, the greater is the act of faith to\nbe performed. That this fact was clearly recognized at Bretton Woods is\nevidenced by the struggle between the Latin American and western Euro-\npean nations with respect to the allocation of executive directorships. Each\nbloc perceived that if the other was able to swing the vote of the directorship\non a proposed change in exchange rates, the result might be unfavorable to\nits own position in world trade: each expected to compete in the same mar-\nkets. Again, it is inevitable that smaller nations should fear the power of the\nlarger members of the Fund. Although the actions of the Fund will always\nbe carried out in the light of publicity, decisions will have to be made on\nexchange rate changes, and these decisions are bound to be less favorable\nto some nations than to others. With skillful and disinterested management,\nof course, the possible doubts of smaller nation can be removed.\n\nThe desire for independence with respect to exchange rates is particularly\n",

Considered simply by itself\nas a statement from the President of the United States on the national\neconomy in a critical year, it is a report that merits serious attention; but\nto the eye of a professional economist it appears much more than an isolated\npresidential message. It marks the beginning of a great experiment, the\nsuccess or failure of which might have profound consequences for the\neconomic and possibly even for the political structure of the United States\nand of other nations. Depending for its success on enlightened public con-\nsideration of major economic problems of the nation, the experiment is a\nventure in economic education on a grand scale, and it presupposes a con-\ntinuing distillation of critical knowledge and judgment on economic affairs\nwhich could significantly affect the development of economic science.\n\nAs an initial step in an economic experiment, this Report of the President\nmust be viewed against the background of the Great Depression of the\n1930's and the revolution in economic and political thinking which it en-\ngendered. Forcing action by national governments to remove or to soften\nits destructive effects, the depression brought wide acceptance of the\nview that governments of politically and economically advanced countries\nmust assume an ultimate responsibility for effective operation of the\nnational economy.

However, at least some observers have not believed\nbusiness behavior to correspond very closely to the **marginal\" description,\nand deduction provides at least some evidence in support of such an ob-\nservation. In an economy where common costs are prevalent and joint costs\nnot infrequent,? where variables are numerous and mostly of complicated\nand uncertain nature, and where price decisions are only one type of worry,\nit would certainly be understandable if most business men usually decided\nto abide by accepted prices and/or rules until they were clearly proved\nwrong.\n\nMarginalism (broadly interpreted) as an explanation of price-rule changes\n(and of price movements in those cases where there are no ascertainable\nprice rules) is probably less subject to criticism than marginalism as an ex-\nplanation of the infrequency of change. Even in this respect, however, it\nprobably provides no more than a substantial part of the answer. Business\nmen, for the most part, do not appear to be either as avaricious or as dy-\nnamic or as logical as marginal theory portrays them; probably most of\nthem are too little money-loving, or too lazy, or too irrational seriously\nto attempt the prescribed marginal calculations. And while marginal\ntheory contains, no doubt, /his degree of truth: few business men would\nmake price or other changes if they did not expect greater profits (or smaller\nlosses) to ensue, the more restricted conclusion that the new prices are\nselected because they are expected to equate marginal revenue and marginal\ncost does not necessarily follow.?*\n\n\"The history of cartels probably has some relevance to this question of the\ndegree of validity of marginal analysis. Apparently most cartels have been\nformed to prevent or to minimize /osses;?5 and while profit maximization and\n\ndriver of an automobile has fewer distracting worries; the highway variables are more obvious\nand not nearly so numerous or complicated; frequent highway decisions made and results\nproved probably have led to greater confidence in \"independent\" decisions; and finally, either\ntheautomobile driver does not have an established rule-of-thumb upon which he thinks he can\nrely\u2014or, if he does rely upon such a rule without making a complicated \"snap\" calculation, he\nis not reasoning like a marginalist.\n\n2? For a discussion of the limitations of cost data, see the summarized report of an OPA study\nin M. L. Black, Jr. and Harold B. Eversole, *Cost Accounting in Price Determination,\" Jour.\nof Accountancy, November, 1946; also, Conference on Price Research, Cost Behavior and Price\nPolicy, pp. 282-87. In addition to pointing out the limitation of cost-accounting data, Professor\nBlack and Eversole argue that **OPA experience in thousands of cases clearly shows that proper\ncosting cannot be done by *rule-of-thumb' approximations or by intuition\" (o. cit., p. 371).\n\"This conclusion, of course, is as damaging to a hal\u00ed-way rigorous average-cost theory of pricing\nas to a half-way meaningful marginal theory.\n\n33 Again the lack of cost data, mentioned in footnote 22, may be emphasized. If business\nmen generally wished seriously to attempt the prescribed marginal calculations, it appears\nthat they would be more anxious to have more nearly adequate cost information.\n\n?* A comment made in footnote 13 also applies here. If business men do not consciously ra-\ntionalize, do they unconsciously follow marginal analysis very closely?\n\n?5 Economists who prefer to talk in average-cost terms express the same belief when they\nsay that cartels have usually been formed because price fell, or threatened to fall, below aver-\nage cost.\n",

If marginal theory is to\nbe an adequate, or almost adequate, theory of change, it must account not\nonly for the movements in prices, but also for the Jack of movement at other\ntimes; and, more importantly, it must explain why the price movements\nwhich do take place can frequently be at least immediately accounted for by\nreference to certain rules of thumb, such as *'full cost.\" Finally, when pricing\nrules are abandoned, marginal theory must explain not only the fact but also\nthe extent of alteration.\n\nA brief portrayal of the marginal theory's business man may serve to\nindicate some of the reasons for doubting the theory's adequacy. If business\nmen prevailingly think along marginal lines, they must be in a continuous\nstate of \"alert,\" ready to change prices and/or pricing rules whenever their\nsensitive intuitions (rightly or wrongly) detect a change in demand or sup-\nply conditions (for the relevant time period, whether short or long). Mar-\nginal theory (broadly interpreted) does not postulate continuous change in\nprices, and still less does it postulate continuous departures from established\npricing rules, since \"short-run\" developments may not be expected to alter\nsupply and demand \"curves\" for a relevant longer time period; but margin-\nalism does postulate continuous readiness to change. It is not logically\ncompatible with either an easy-going or complacent attitude out of which a\nbusiness man must be shocked into alertness, or a state of mind so engrossed\nwith non-pricing matters that the business man usually has neither the\nability nor the willingness seriously to consider price or policy changes.\nEspecially, marginal theory is not consistent with that sort of conservatism\nwhich results in clinging to an established practice until events clearly show\nit to be unwise, or, in other words, with that type of cautiousness which\nleads a man to believe that his independent\" calculations probably would\nbe wrong even if he made them and that it is safer to stick by the siaius\nquo or the \"rules.\"?\n\n?? Tnattention to states-of-being appears to be partly responsible for Professor Machlup's\nsuggestion that cartel and oligopolistic use of a \"full cost\" pricing policy can be adequately ex-\nplained in terms of the relationship of average cost to long-run elasticity of demand (ibid.,\npp. 542-44). If a price equal to full cost\" is already quoted, cartel members and oligopolists\nmay well fear, for elasticity-of-demand reasons, to depart from it. Elasticity-of-demand con-\nsiderations do not, however, adequately explain why a price equal to \"full cost\" was selected\nin the first place. Analysis of both cartel and oligopolistic selection of prices leads to the con-\nclusion that only rarely would a \"full cost\" price maximize profits.\n\n7! Professor Machlup argues that the cost and revenue figures of marginal theory are merely\n\"subjective\" guesses and hunches. Concerning the \"subjectivity\" of these estimates, there is\nno dispute. However, if business men believe that their guesses are foorly informed, they will\nbe inclined to play safe and not make changes as long as all goes well.\n\nIn describing a business man's reasoning, Professor Machlup refers to the analogy of an\nautoist who makes a snap judgment to pass, or not to pass, a truck. But the analogy is not an\napt one. There is a greater penalty for the autoist's lack of alertness; usually, at least, the\n",

A perhaps more\nformidable obstacle consists of the business men's statements; the dis-\nclaimers of marginal thinking must be proved to be very largely wrong.\nProbably the most formidable obstacle of all to the seekers of empirical\nevidence of the validity of marginalism, however, is the fact that, quite\napart from business men's statements, marginal theory does not seem to be\neven a nearly adequate explanation of business behavior. Some of the\nreasons for this conclusion are set forth in Section IV of this paper.\n\nProfessor Machlup, in the course of his attack on the antimarginalists,\nfinds some positive support for the validity of marginalism in the move-\nments of price-full cost margins. Evidence of the incompleteness or un-\ntenability of the average-cost thesis can be found, he says, in the fact that\nsuch margins vary among different firms at the same time, for the same firm\nat different times, and among different products of the same firms.\n\nThis, however, is very limited evidence, since about all that it definitely\nindicates is that a simple average-cost theory of pricing is incomplete. 'The\nevidence does not indicate whether firms attempt to maximize profits or are\ncontent with some less ambitious goal such as \"fair\" or \"satisfactory\"\nprofits.

As the\nabove paragraph states, the evidence does not in any way prove that maximum profit rather\nthan \"fair profit\" (over a period of time) is a firm's goal. Therefore, all that is necessary to fit\nthe evidence into an \"average-cost\" explanation is to define average cost as \"total expenses of\nthe firm during the relevant time period, divided by total output\" (with no distinction made\nbetween different types of output), and price as \"*total revenue of the firm during the relevant\ntime period, divided by total output\" (again with no distinction among different types of out-\nput). Employment of the definitions and the derived principle would not be a very instructive\nway of saying that the firm in question was trying to make a \"fair\" profit over a given time\nperiod, however.

Moreover, the approach of the\nempiricists whom he criticized invited, in a way, the adoption of a burden-\nof-proof attitude.'? It is only fair to point out, however, that in a court of\nlaw or a formal debating society the judge or the rules committee would\nnever allow the controversy to take the form in which it has so far been\npresented. For, if business men say that they think in average-cost terms,\nthen, if the burden of proof rests upon anyone at all (and it should not in\neconomic discussion), it rests on the marginalists who do not believe the\nbusiness man, rather than on the economic iconoclasts who (with modifica-\ntions of varying importance) take him at his word. Any economist is logi-\ncally free to be sceptical of the accuracy and/or honesty of the business\nmen's claim; but the fact that conventional economic analysis has been\nbuilt upon the rock of marginalism is not sufficient for more than an opening\nscepticism.^ Empirical evidence must be offered, if the Rules of Order are\nto be obeyed. And, as Professor Machlup points out in his criticism of the\nantimarginal empiricists,5 the evidence must not be subject to interpreta-\ntion in alternative ways. In this case, the evidence must be logically con-\nsistent only with marginal theory.\n\nNow there is no intent to argue here that considerable evidence of margi-\nnal thinking (especially in the broader sense of that term) cannot be found.\nCost Behavior and Price Policy, for instance, refers to numerous examples.!5\nBut securing a sufficiently great body of empirical evidence to establish a\nstrong empirical case for the general validity of marginal theory would\nprobably be an impossible undertaking.\n\nOne obstacle here, of course, would be merely the general difficulty of\nsecuring \"clinching\" empirical evidence of any type; that is, even when\n\n7 [.e,, both Professor Lester's article and the Oxford economists\" paper imply an attitude of\n\"testing\" marginaltheory, rather than two or more alternative theories. (Richard A. Lester, of.\ncit., and R. L. Hall and C. J. Hitch, o5 cit.)\n\n13 Professor Machlup believes that usually they do not consciously rationalize (o5. cit.,\np. 541). This leads to the \"psychological\" question of whether, if business men believe that their\n\"real\" as well as their immediate pricing policy is average-cost-plus-a-percentage, it is likely\nthat their decisions will be exactly, or almost exactly, the same as those which they would make\nif they were fully aware of their motives. Economists attempting to answer such a question, of\ncourse, are *aymen,\" not technicians.\n\nIt might also be added that economists are *Jaymen\" when they tackle the problem of\nrationalization in any form. There is the possibility, for instance, that, for numerous business\nmen, Professor Machlup has described in reverse the rationalization process. As philosophers\nhavelong emphasized, thereis a subtle process through which means tend to become ends. Per-\nhaps, in this sense, business conservatives believe that \"full cost\"' is a profitable pricing policy\nbecause they proclaim allegiance to it, rather than proclaim allegiance to it because they believe\nit a profitable policy.\n\n1 A burden-of-proof defense of marginalism is similar to the position taken by business-cycle\ntheorists who insist that cyclical analysis must begin by explaining why the economy defarted\nfrom a state of equilibrium. Both attitudes rest upon the assumption that a logically constructed\ntheory has an empirical validity because of its sheer logic.\n\n15 Machlup, of. cit., p. 537 ff.\n\n1* Conference on Price Research, Cost Behavior and Price Policy, pp. 267-88.\n",

The wage comparisons are further broken\ndown to cover groups within manufacturing industry as well as others in\nnon-manufacturing. The profits data are grouped only for all corporations\nand for manufacturing corporations. The chief inference is that all corpora-\ntions taken collectively could raise wages 25 per cent and manufacturing\ncorporations 21 per cent and yet maintain their average 1936-39 rate of\nreturn (after taxes) on current net worth, without increasing prices.\n\nThe authors limit their chief recommendation to a \"major general in-\ncrease,\" for which these figures may be guides. The figures, they observe,\n*do not apply exactly to any individual industry,\" and \"the profit and wage\npicture must be considered separately in each wage negotiation.\"\n\nThe wage comparisons are intended mainly to justify a general increase\nwhich the authors believe to be proved fossible at December, 1946 prices.\nTo make the justification, they choose as a base period for wages January,\n1945, when average gross hourly and average weekly earnings of production\nworkers in manufacturing had attained their all-time highs. Choice of this\nbase rests, apparently, on the assertion that even then wages did not make\npossible the attainment of *the American standard of living.\"\n\nBetween January, 1945 and October, 1946, average gross hourly earnings\n\n14 National Wage Policy for 1947 (Washington, Robert R.

These\narguments do not apply in a situation of actual or impending mass unem-\nployment and under-utilization of resources, which is the only normal peace-\ntime situation in which deficit financing is likely to be extensively used.\n\nProfessor Poindexter, for example, finds a justification of government\ninterest payments to the banking system in \"the cumulative real cost of\nvesting in the government command over present as against future goods.\nIn other words, the costs of bank credit creation are essentially the same as\nthose borne by the individual saver-lender.'\"? This may, perhaps, be con-\nceded under conditions of continuing full employment, when government\nexpenditures effectively divert to the government goods and services which\nwould otherwise have been allocated to private users, and force private users\nto postpone a utilization that would otherwise have occurred immediately.\nIf, under such conditions, government expenditures (e.g., for defense, or for\ncapital projects) are not fully covered by taxation, then a good case can be\nmade for requiring the government to borrow at interest, thereby com-\npensating the private parties whose utilization of goods and services has\nbeen delayed.*\n\nBut the situation is entirely different when there is less than full employ-\nment. In such a case the creation of credit for the government's use has no\n\"cumulative real cost\"' because what it vests in the government is not a\n\"command over present as against future goods,\" but rather a command\nover goods /Lat would otherwise not have been produced at all. Deficit financing\nunder conditions of actual or incipient under-employment is socially costless\nbecause it does not take from any private users what they would otherwise\nhave enjoyed. Rather it adds to their currently available output of goods\nand services. In fact, it will probably add to the volume of goods and serv-\nices available for Private purchase, particularly if the deficits are reached\nthrough a reduction in taxes or an increase in transfer payments, rather\n",

As yet,\nhowever, no study of the recent price trends of individual goods included in\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics wholesale index has appeared. Because of\ncurrent wage adjustment and inflation problems, analysis of the 1939\u201446\nperiod is of importance. The present paper briefly presents the results of an\ninvestigation into the prices of manufactured products during those years.\n\nThe manufactured or \"finished\" goods index contained, for 1939, a total\nof 611 separate commodity quotations. We have compared the individual\nprices of these items in 1939 (monthly average for the year) with the prices\nof the identical items in August, 1946.? That month, the latest for which\ndata are available at the time of present writing,? was the first full month\nfollowing the general removal of government price controls.\n\nOf the 611 commodities listed in 1939, a total of 367 are represented\n\"tem-for-item\" in 1946; comparable quotations on the other 244 products\nare not to be had for exactly the same items in the same markets. Those\n244 commodities were, therefore, eliminated in the present study; substitute\nitems, which the B.L.S. legitimately includes in its broader, weighted aver-\nage, were not considered comparable for our more specific purposes.\n\nThus circumscribed, what does analysis of the 367 items show? The range\nof price changes is from a decline of 10 per cent to an increase of 443 per\ncent. Three hundred and thirty-eight goods increased in price, 11 declined,\nand 18 showed no change. Sixty-two prices, or about one-sixth of the total\n\n1 Tn this country, notably by Wesley C. Mitchell and Frederick C. Mills, as well as by mem-\nbers of governmental departments such as Labor and Commerce.\n\n?

It is true, therefore, as Professor Poin-\ndexter maintains (p. 313) that there are costs of bank credit creation, but\nthe fundamental difference of which he fails to take cognizance is that the\ncosts of bank credit creation are social costs borne by the community and\nin these respects involve no conscious or determinate cost to particular\nindividuals or to the banks which created the credit.

Contraction of these deposits, on the other hand, comes about as a\nconsequence of the calling or maturing of loans and discounts, the sale or\nredemption of bank-held bonds, or the conversion of deposits into currency,\nor their use to buy assets from the banks.\n\nRecognizing these fundamental relationsbips, it should be obvious that\nwhen a commercial bank creates a new deposit in favor of a borrower, this\ndeposit does not represent the savings of the borrower. Nor does the ex-\npenditure of such deposits bring about any such metamorphosis. If it be\nassumed that the deposits thus created are spent for goods, it follows that\nthe seller of the goods now holds assets in the form of demand deposits\nrather than inventory. The acquisition of demand deposits is no evidence\nper se that the savings of the owners have expanded by an equal amount, or\nindeed by any fraction thereof. In the above example it may very well have\nbeen true that the goods were sold at a loss, so that the owner's equity in his\nenterprise (one real evidence of savings) actually diminished.\n\nThe further utilization of these deposits by their subsequent owners does\nnot alter the validity of these conclusions, nor is their validity impaired by\nthe fact that the demand deposits may have been created as a consequence\nof the expansion of a bank's investments rather than its loans and dis-\ncounts.*\n\nAny correct appraisal of the credit-creating activities of commercial banks\nshould be premised upon the recognition that only a part of demand de-\nposits represent *'savings\" and that the great bulk of these deposits simply\nreflect the fact that the owners prefer, or find it necessary for one reason or\n\n?

It is\nhis fear that public resistance to the necessary taxes would be greatly aug-\nmented \"were it understood that the government does not have to pay\ninterest on, or (perchance) even the principal of its debts.\"* In evaluating\nthis argument we must remember that taxes used to make payments of\ninterest on principal on the national debt will have considerably less anti-\ninflationary effect than taxes going into a retained budget surplus, and that\nconsequently the piling up of an interest-bearing debt will increase the total\namount of taxes it would be necessary to collect before tax collections began\nto have an appreciable anti-inflationary effect. We must also bear in mind\nthat while the average taxpayer derives no visible current benefit from tax\npayments required to service a public debt, he does have a real and obvious\ninterest in keeping down his own cost of living. If Professor Poindexter's\nobservation that **virtually everybody objects to inflation\"\" is accepted, we\nneed not be defeatist about the possibility of getting needed anti-inflation-\nary taxes, once there is a reasonable degree of public understanding of com-\npensatory fiscal policy. Until such understanding is achieved there is\nprobably little danger that peacetime deficit financing will be carried to\ninflationary lengths, but there is grave danger that the United States may,\nat some time in the future, fail to resist the national, and indeed inter-\nnational, catastrophe of a major deflation through fear of assuming the\ncontinuing burdens which such resistance would be mistakenly supposed to\nentail. The government will fail to make its proper contribution to the all-\nimportant clarification of public thinking in this sphere if it is less than\ncompletely frank as to the reasons for heavy taxation in periods of excessive\nexpenditure.\n\nTo avoid any possible misunderstanding, let me emphasize that this com-\nmunication is not intended as a general defense of functional finance. No\njudgment has been passed on the contention, prominently identified with\nProfessor Hansen, that a large interest-bearing government debt may have\npositive advantages, and no attempt has been made to demonstrate any\nfinal or overall superiority of interest-free deficit financing over other more\northodox approaches in the field of public finance.

Regardless of individual allegations by ex farte groups in the pres-\nent contest over price-wage policies, the fact that 20 per cent of the 367\nitems show price rises of more than 100 per cent since 1939 suggests that\nthe degree of inflation in certain industries is far more marked than any\ngeneral indexes can reveal, and that in others it is far less. The B.L.S.\nweighted index for a// manufactured goods, for example, shows a rise of 54.1\nper cent for the period in question, while the unweighted average of the\nincreases in our 367 comparable items is 53.4 per cent.

For in matters such as these, aggrega-\ntive considerations may be extremely misleading.

                    "The Burden of Import Duties: A Comment\n\nIn a recent article, Earl R. Rolph has shown that under certain circum-\nstances it is possible for import duties to do more damage to exporters than\nto importers.! This is an important point, but the presentation is somewhat\nconfusing. The following comments are intended to clarify the problems\nrather than to challenge this major conclusion.\n\nThe analysis assumes constant total money income and full employment\nin each country, an increase in all import duties at the same time, and\nflexible exchange rates which adjust automatically so as to preserve an\nexact balance of payments without flows of gold or credit. This leads to the\nconclusion that the first effect of the new tariffs is to reduce the number of\ndollars available abroad with which foreigners could pay for our exports. It\nis our exporters who, through a shift in exchange rates, lose income. The\n\n! Earl R. Rolph, *The Burden of Import Duties,\" Am. Econ. Rev., Vol. XXXVI, No. 5\n(Dec., 1946), pp. 788-812.\n",

Regardless of individual allegations by ex farte groups in the pres-\nent contest over price-wage policies, the fact that 20 per cent of the 367\nitems show price rises of more than 100 per cent since 1939 suggests that\nthe degree of inflation in certain industries is far more marked than any\ngeneral indexes can reveal, and that in others it is far less. The B.L.S.\nweighted index for a// manufactured goods, for example, shows a rise of 54.1\nper cent for the period in question, while the unweighted average of the\nincreases in our 367 comparable items is 53.4 per cent. But of these 367\nstrictly comparable commodities, 109 products rose by more than 54.1 per\ncent in price, and 55 of them rose by more than double that amount.\nThese findings thus emphasize what thoughtful students have long\nknown: that to the extent that cyclical strains result from maladjustments\nwithin the economy, careful attention needs to be paid to dispersions in\nprices, and in wage and profit rates. For in matters such as these, aggrega-\ntive considerations may be extremely misleading.

Professor Lester, guarded by a few adverbs, denies it.\nMarginal productivity theorists believe that other variables count too, al-\nthough in certain well-defined situations one or another variable may be\nneutralized.\n\nProfessor Lester tries to show why these other variables are of no impor-\ntance. His favorite point, that conditions of *'declining unit variable costs\nup to 100 per cent capacity\"!* somehow interfere with the operation of the\nmarginal principle, is untenable. Another of his points concerns cases where\n\"product prices and demand elasticities remain unchanged with variations\nin actual or anticipated demand.\"!? We know several cases in the theory of\nimperfect competition in which selling prices remain unchanged in spite of\nchanges in demand. Perhaps Professor Lester thinks of the case of tacitly\nfixed prices under oligopoly in which the sales curve breaks off at the vol-\nume of sales expected at the given price. (Since under the oligopolistic con-\nditions price reductions are regarded as impractical, there is no practical\npossibility of expanding sales.) We all have learned that in such a case the\nmarginal revenue curve exhibits a vertical drop. If there should also be no\npossibility of technical substitution for labor, the marginal productivity\ncurve will, of course, reflect that condition and have the vertical range over\nwhich changes in wage rates (or marginal labor cost) are without any effect\nupon employment in the firm. This is nothing new to the marginalist. Does\nProfessor Lester wish to regard it as the \"'general theory\" of employment in\nthe firm? To me it is a special case.??\n\nOther points brought up by Professor Lester refer to the cost of changing\nthe size of the work force.

I must say that there is nowhere an explicit statement to that\neffect, neither in his earlier article nor in his present communication, and I\nmust beg his pardon if my impression is incorrect. But Professor Lester\nrepeatedly refers to cases\" in which increased wage rates need not result\nin reduced employment and may result or did result in increased employ-\nment.

But he does not hesitate to refer\nto experiences between 1939 and 1941\u2014 defense boom!\u2014to support his\nargument.) If my impression about the chief aim of the attack is correct,\nProfessor Lester could have served his purpose by showing under what\nconditions the presumption would not hold and by proving that such condi-\ntions actually prevail in a number of industries. Instead, he set out to fight\nagainst \"marginal analysis\" in general and to prove i/s shortcomings.\" Yet,\nof his six \"tentative conclusions\" the first four are perfectly consistent with\nmarginal analysis, and the sixth\u2014at least in the cautious way in which it is\nformulated\u2014is not inconsistent with it.

I take it that Professor Lester does not accept the anti-\nmarginalist \"full-cost\" theory of pricing which was advanced by Hall and\nHitch.!5 This theory would suit the purpose of proving insensitiveness of the\nfirm's output to wage increases much worse than marginal analysis; it holds\nthat wage increases as a rule are shifted forward in full to the consumer\u2014\nwhich would reduce output by more than the marginal principle usually\ncalls for.\n\nAccording to marginal productivity theory employment depends on sev-\neral variables: anticipated selling prices and sales quantities with their\npotential variations; technological possibilities; conditions of supply of com-\nplementary and substitutable factors; and conditions of supply of the factor\nin question. Is it perhaps Professor Lester's theory of employment in the\nindividual firm that of the several variables considered by marginal pro-\nductivity theory only one counts, namely, the demand for the product?\nThis interpretation is suggested by the fact that his proposition on the im-\nportance of market demand is reiterated several times in his foregoing note.\nHe varies the formulation of the proposition by the use of the modifiers\n\"primarily,\" \"generally,\" \"simply,\" *'independently.\" Thus, after having\nemphasized the primacy of selling possibilities in the determination of em-\nployment\u2014see the sentence quoted above with Professor Lester's first con-\nclusion\u2014and after minimizing the importance of the principle of maximiz-\ning business profits, he says that '*on the contrary, the volume of output and\nemployment in the individual firm generally varies simply and directly with\n\n35 R.

That certain manufacturing industries operate under\ndecreasing unit variable costs has been assumed in conventional theory.\nProfessor Lester states that *consequently\" output reductions in response\nto wage rate increases are seldom practical.\" This is a non-sequitur, and no\namount of reiteration can make it a correct inference. To be sure, manu-\nfacturing firms may not \"curtail output\" in direct response to wage in-\ncreases; they are more likely to raise selling prices, which in a given market\nsituation will reduce sales\u2014so that it would be the sales volume rather than\nthe wage level that appears as the \"direct\" cause of any output reductions.\n(In this case the reduced sales volume is, of course, not a reduced demand\nin the sense of conventional terminology.)\n\n3. \"In modern manufacturing, a. firm's level of costs per unit of product is\ninfluenced considerably by its scale of output; the reverse, as assumed by con-\nventional marginalism, is not generally true.\"19 **Costs\" may mean either a\nseries of points on a curve or the level of the whole curve. It is not clear\nwhich ''cost\" Professor Lester has in mind when he says that the ''reverse\"\n\u2014that is, output influenced by cost\u2014is not generally true. His statement\nmay mean at least three things. If it is to mean that the volume of output\nproduced by the firm is usually not influenced by the shape of the cost curve,\nit is clearly incorrect, or producers would in good times produce far above\n\"capacity\" and might in slack times curtail output even more than they do.\nIf it is to mean that there are situations in which a change in the level of\nthe cost curve need not result in a change in output, it is a correct statement;\nindeed such situations, far from being inconsistent with marginal analysis,\ncan be most conveniently described by it. If, finally, it is to mean that\nchanges in the cost level will usually be without influence upon output, then\nthe statement is not supported by any evidence and should be considered\nas false until such evidence is furnished.\n\n4. \"For many manufacturing concerns it is not feasible, or would prove too\ncostly, to shift the proportion of productive factors in response to current\nchanges in wages, in the manner suggested by marginal analysis.\"?

Hence, there is absolutely no argument\nabout the fact that \"variations in the total volume of employment in a\nmodern manufacturing plant already constructed are primarily the result\nof actual and anticipated changes in the volume of sales or orders for the\nproducts of the plant.\"'5 Professor Lester makes it appear as if this were his\n\"position\" and as if it were inconsistent with marginal productivity theory.\nIn fact, sales expectations are an integral part of marginal productivity, as I\nexplained patiently in my article.\n\n2.

Even if large logical or empirical errors had been committed by lead-\ning modern economists, Lester could not refute price theory merely by dem-\nonstrating these errors. A theory can be refuted only in its strongest ver-\nsion, and it would be a necessary part of Lester's task to show that correc-\ntion of these blunders would lead to logical inconsistency or empirical con-\ntradiction or deprive the theory of its ability to forecast economic events.\nBut first the blundersin the existing theory should be demonstrated: Lester's\nreformulations have not been so happy as to make this first step redundant.\n\n5. Lester apparently believes that the findings of his empirical studies\nmust be accepted quickly and completely, presumably because they are\n\"facts.\" Unfortunately, the details of his studies are not reported in suffi-\ncient detail to assess their validity or, indeed, even to understand their\nmeaning. Consider an example.\n\nAs a rule, average variable cost falls when output rises, until capacity is\nreached. How were the entrepreneurs who filled in the questionnaire instruc-\nted to segregate variable costs? How was capacity defined? How were the\ndiverse products of a firm to be added to secure an index of output? What\nwere the characteristics of the firms that responded (in comparison with the\nindustries at large): was their scale of operations growing; were they equally\nsubject to competitive pressures; etc.?\n\n6. Some of the findings in Lester's studies are impossible, and some are\nwholly in keeping with the \"marginal\" theory; yet both types are held up\nas refutations of the theory. An example of the impossible is the finding that\nwhen 6 metal-working firms increased output from 70 to 80 per cent of\ncapacity\u2014a 14.3 per cent increase of output\u2014the average decline of aver-\nage variable costs was 15.9 per cent. Hence on average the total cost fell by\n4.9 per cent when output rose 14.3 per cent. We shall not accept this result\neven if Lester obtains it from 6,000 metal-working firms.

In the less frequent case, then, Lester finds the logical structure of\nprice theory defective. Every theorist would welcome demonstrations of\nspecific errors found in the works of leading modern economists. But, in-\nstead, Lester has a penchant for attributing to anonymous ''marginalists\"\ntheories that I have never before encountered in economic literature. I may\nquote an example from his Economics of Labor since this passage is still\nrecommended in his recent writing. One of the nine assumptions underlying\nthe marginal productivity theory, we are told, is\n\n(6) That the employer in an imperfect market will always reduce his price\nto increase his sales, whenever such action may add to his short-run\nprofits. Employers following a price policy based on long-run considerations\nmay not wish to sacrifice future profits in order to maximize present profits,\nespecially when price reductions might antagonize customers or lead to a\nprice war. It is not clear from the theory what production and employment\npolicies an employer is assumed to pursue when there is a difference be-\ntween the policy that would maximize profits in the short run and one that\nwould maximize profits in the long run?\n\nWill Lester please give us the specific reference to just one leading economist\nwho has made this stupid assumption?\n\n3. More often Lester finds fault with the theorists! empirical assumptions.\nEveryone will agree with him that economists have more often made errors\n\u2014of omission as well as commission\u2014in observation than in logical analysis,\nand that incalculable amounts of good empirical work are still needed. But\nour empirical errors have not been so crude as those with which we are\ncharged.\n\nWe may turn again to the Economics of Labor for examples of fictitious\u2014\nand anonymous\u2014empirical errors. Here are three more of Lester's nine as-\nsumptions of the marginal productivity theory:\n\n(7) That the market for labor is a perfect market, so that the employer\nwill not affect the wage rate no matter how much labor he himself hires.\n\n(8) That no element of monopoly has entered into the determination\nof the prices for the other factors of production.\n\n(9) That the employers! demand curves for labor correspond to the mar-\nginal-productivity curves of their workers and that the total demand curve\nfor all labor is the sum of all employers' individual marginal-productivity\ncurves.\n\nA theory that assumes 7 or 8is of restricted applicability. The ninth assump-\ntion is probably meaningless\u2014what can the demand curve for physicists J-\ncharwomen be?\u2014and if meaningful, then internally inconsistent because\nthe firms! demand curves are not independent.

It therefore\nseems more appropriate to explain briefly why economic theorists find\nLester's general position unconvincing rather than to argue particular\npoints on minimum wages. ,\n\n1. Economic theory may refer to the logical relationships between eco-\nnomic magnitudes, or to both the logical relationships and their empirical\ncontent. It is a formal property of a maximum profit position that the\nmarginal cost of a productive service equal its marginal value product, and\nit is an empirical property that the marginal physical product curve have\na negative slope. There is some ambiguity concerning the object of Lester's\nattack, but it seems a fair inference that to him the empirical content of\nprice theory is seriously deficient, while the logical structure is usually, but\nby no means always, valid.

(Are there, after all, *employ-\nment adjustments to wage changes\"? Does then employment vary also on\naccount of other things than demand? If Professor Lester grants all this,\nwhat is left of his case against marginal productivity theory?) Professor\nLester is mistaken in thinking that to take account of such matters is\n\"troublesome to a marginalist.\" No trouble at all. The cost of changing the\nwork force is one of the causes\u2014besides the smaller elasticity of the short-\nrun sales curve and the difficulties of certain types of technical substitution\n\u2014why marginal productivity curves are less elastic in the short run than\nin the long run. (Or, if one prefers to look at change-over costs of this sort\nas part of the conditions of labor supply, they will make the marginal factor\ncost curve less elastic in the short run than in the long run.) The **mental\nruts of the marginalists\"? are equipped to take care of all the economic con-\nsiderations which Professor Lester has mentioned as factors in business de-\ncisions.

                    "Obligations upon the Union under the National Labor Relations Act\n\nThe National Labor Relations act has generally been considered to con-\nfer rights upon the employees, exercised through organization and the\nselection of representatives, and running against the employer. The act\nhas been criticized on the ground that it imposes no obligations upon the\nunion in the interests of its employee-members, whom it is supposed to\nrepresent. Several recent decisions of the National Labor Relations Board\nand of the courts raise the questions whether, in fact, the act cannot be so\nconstrued as to place such obligations, and, if the answer is in the affirma-\ntive, what the extent of those obligations may be.\n\nThe source of any possible compulsions upon the union is to be found in\nSection 9(a), which states that **Representatives designated or selected for\nthe purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of employees in a unit\nappropriate for such purposes, shall be the exclusive representatives of all\nthe employees. . . . \" Until recently the emphasis in this section had been\nlaid upon the word \"'exclusive,\" in an elaboration and defense of the doc-\ntrine of majority representation, both with respect to negotiations for the\ncontract and grievance proceedings. It now appears that considerable weight\nis being accorded the phrase \"representatives of all the employees,\" and\nthat this additional emphasis carries implications perhaps hitherto unfore-\nseen.\n\nIn Hughes Tool Co. v. NLRB, (1945) 147 F. (2d) 69, at 74, the Fifth\nCircuit Court thus took pains to point out that When the Steelworkers\nunion accepted certification as the bargaining representative for the group,\nit accepted a trust. It became bound to represent equally and in good faith\nthe interests of the whole group. It ought not to discriminate in the execu-\ntion of its duties between its own members and employees who belong to\nanother union or to no union. The handling of grievances, as has been\npointed out, is part of the business it has assumed, and must be done with\nimpartiality.\"\n\nIf it thus becomes established that in accepting Board certification as\nexclusive representative for the employees in a unit a union becomes subject\nto the burdens of a trusteeship, it is altogether conceivable that failure to\ndischarge such trusteeship obligations may become grounds for revocation\nof certification.\n\nConsider Matter of Monsieur Henri Wines, 44 NLRB 1310.

The Conference, jointly sponsored by the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics of the Department of Labor and the Division of Statistical\nStandards of the Bureau of the Budget, was planned for technical discussion\nof problems of concepts and measures.\n\nTopics discussed in the five sessions of the Conference included concepts\nand measures of productivity at the job, plant, company, industry, national\nand international levels; scope and limitations of existing productivity\nmeasures; needs for additional measures; and methods of presentation of\nmeasures. Chairmanship of the sessions was alternated between Leon Hend-\nerson, Research Institute of America; Robert Nathan, Robert Nathan As-\nsociates; George W. Taylor, University of Pennsylvania; Isador Lubin,\nAmerican Statistical Association; and Thomas Blaisdell, Department of\nState. Arrangements were in charge of an Executive Committee, with mem-\nbership drawn from labor, management and Government.\n\nHiram Davis of the Wharton School, in discussing general problems of\nconcepts and measurements, was the first of several speakers to advocate the\nuse of several output-input ratios for the measurement of productivity,\nrather than the use of the output-labor input ratio exclusively. Measures of\nat least all other important input factors should be similarly developed, as\nunits of raw material, electric energy, and investment. Although produc-\ntivity, if considered as \"productive efficiency,\" might ideally be measured in\nterms of total output in relation to total input, the translation of diverse\ninput factors into \u00e0 common measure is sufficiently unsatisfactory as to\nlead Dr. Davis to favor a series of ratios relating output to each important\ninput item.\n\nThe measurement of output over a period of time encounters problems\nof change in the quality and character of products. Should value or price,\nman-hours used, or potential service be used as weights in preparing the\noutput measure? It was suggested that *'value added\" weights may be ap-\npropriate, although these may introduce new distortions through inclusion\nof profits. Manufacturing cost weights may prove more desirable. Man-\nhour weights, perhaps appropriate in some plant and industry measures,\n\n35 Under the British wartime exchange control regulations, sterling balances arising from\ncurrent transactions with the United States have been placed in so-called American accounts\"\nwhich have been freely transferable into dollars.

Background of the Recent Cement Decision\n\nSixty-eight years ago three steel mills in New Jersey and eastern\nPennsylvania, the only considerable producers of steel bars in the\nUnited States at that time outside of Pittsburgh, stopped quoting the\nprice of steel bars f.o.b. mill and began quoting only delivered prices\nidentical at every destination with those of the Carnegie plant in\nPittsburgh. This followed the example of the German steel cartel\nfounded in the \"70's. Thus began the so-called \"natural evolution\" of\nthe basing point practice in the United States.\n\nIn the next twenty years this practice was extended to all branches\nof the steel industry and to the cement industry which was already\nconnected with steel by various bonds of ownership. Then the practice\nwas gradually extended to the sale of many standardized heavy basic\nproducts, including most building materials, and became the chief\ninstrument by which American cartels have exercised a control over\nprices.\n\nFor forty years this pricing practice largely escaped notice, and,\nwhen it was glimpsed, its real nature was misrepresented by the in-\ndustries and misunderstood by the public, the courts, the Congress,\nand the executive agencies. This was notably so in the dissolution suit\nagainst the United States Steel Corporation which ended in 1920 with\nthe vindication of the Corporation, and also in the Cement Manu-\nfacturers' Protective Association case concluded in confusion and\nfailure in 1925.\n\nMeantime, however, the practice had been dragged out into the\nopen and its real nature partially disclosed by the complaint against\nthe U. S. Steel Corporation in 1920 by the Federal Trade Commission\non the petition of numerous manufacturers in the Chicago region who\nhad to pay Pittsburgh-Plus prices for the basic steel which they used\nin fabricating agricultural implements and other finished products. The\nCommission's order to cease and desist, issued in 1924, was mockingly\naccepted by the Corporation, and was negligently left unenforced, but\nit marked the beginning of a quarter century of open and intense legal\nand economic discussion, concluding with the decision of the Supreme\nCourt April 26, 1948 in the case against the Cement Institute and\n\n* The author is professor emeritus of political economy at Princeton University.\n"

It is his thesis\n\nthat the burden of import duties always rests upon a certain economic segment\nof the country levying the import duties and not upon foreigners, and second\nthat this segment is nof the consumers of taxed imports. It is, on the contrary,\nthose who own resources, both human and non-human, in the export industries\nand those who own resources competitive with resources located in export\nindustries. These people bear the tax in the form of a reduction in their money\nincomes in a fashion analogous to a partial proportional income tax (with\nno exemptions) collected at the source. They must sacrifice money income\nequal to the yield of the tax to the Treasury (p. 790).\n\nThis unequivocal statement (the stresses are the author's) contradicts\ncertain apparently universally accepted ideas, and deserves careful\nexamination.\n\nProfessor Rolph does not deny that import duties may result in (a)\na shift in terms of trade to the advantage of the country levying the\ntax (P) and to the disadvantage of the exporting country (E), and/or\n(b) lower income for foreign exporters, and/or (c) a higher domestic\nprice of imported products. He does, however, deny emphatically\nthat even in these cases E's consumers, E's exporters, or P's consumers,\nrespectively, may properly be said to be paying the tax. These changes,\nhe states, are only incidental effects, secondary consequences of the\nlevy, and do not represent its incidence.

His argument, as it\noriginally appeared, was based on a misunderstanding of the currently used\nconcept of net national product. He wrote (pp. 101-102):\n\n\"The *net\" national product is usually defined as the gross product less *'de-\npreciation\"\u2014depreciation being usually confined to plant and machinery. But\ndepreciation is merely one form of consumption: and if we subtract one part of\nconsumption (depreciation of industrial fixed capital), why not subtract\ndepreciation of consumers capital, of houses, automobiles, etc.? And is there any\nlogical difference between consumption which is spread out over a life-period\nof a commodity (depreciation) and the consumption of one-use goods such as\nfuel and foodstuf\u00eds? It would seem, therefore, that any attempt to define a net\nproduct by subtracting \"depreciation\" from a gross product will land us\nlogically in a definition which makes the net product equal to the gross product\nless all consumption\u2014which is to make the net product equal to accumulation,\nin which case a stationary society, however rich, would have no net product!\n\nThus Mr. Boulding argues that while the concept of gross national prod-\nuct is meaningful, the attempt to subtract out certain commodities used up\n\n?

                    "the second policy will actually give more consumers goods depends on one's\nestimate of the effectiveness of government investment.\n\nA similar problem is raised by the problem of profits. We want to en-\ncourage people to invest in order that the standard of living can be in-\ncreased. In war, again, there is little problem. If special obsolescence rates\nare permitted, the net profit rate (after taxes) can be kept very low (unless\nwe want to allow higher profits to produce more saving). Intra-marginal\nrents are a problem, but they can be handled by price control plus sub-\nsidies to the marginal firms. The stimulus of patriotism is perhaps adequate.\n\nBut again, in peacetime the case is different. Risks today are exceedingly\nhigh. The steel industry, for example, is afraid (and with some Prima. facie\nreason) of the consequences to itself of *back log\" saturation. Is a rate of\nreturn of ten or twelve per cent under such circumstances (and with tremen-\ndous marginal construction costs) adequate to induce the great increase in\noutput we desperately need? If we encourage an uncritical ethical jealousy\nof profit, can we blame the private economy for not functioning??\n\nFinally there is the interest rate. We want to encourage people to save as\nmuch as possible. Certainly low interest rates do not help there. We also\nwant to encourage investment. We have just said that risky new investment\nis severely hampered by present policies. Even so, there is an attempt to invest\nmore than our present relatively limited rate of voluntary saving. Supposing\nthat we do all we can to discourage consumption, the probabilities are that\nthe secular need for current new investment would still be greater than the\nsaving flow. Only if we deliberately attempt to discourage investment in-\ncentives would the case be different. Up to now our discouragement of new\ninvestment has not affected the rate of planned investment quite that much.\n\nUnder such circumstances, as Colin Clarke points out in his Economics of\n1960, capital scarcity confronts us with two main approaches toward stabili-\nzation. We can (a) ration capital \u2014i.e., plan the flow of net new investment,\nor (b) raise the interest rate. The third (and more likely) possibility is of\ncourse to permit continuing inflation.\n\nThere is one point which must still be treated. Some will say that we have\nno guarantee that the more well-to-do will save if taxes on the upper-income\nbrackets are reduced. The case of the unfortunate family mentioned in\nFortune who were barely \"getting along\" on $25,000 a year is frequently\nbrought up to me.\n\nFor myself I confess to a certain skepticism as to how typical a case this\nis, but let that pass. Professor Slichter has furnished the answer. Let us give\ntax exemptions on saved income. It is not necessary at present to distinguish\nbetween saving and hoarding, for even hoards help to reduce the pressure on\nprices.\n\n?In view of the number of sweeping statements now made regarding \"huge\" profits,\nit may be worthwhile to offer some figures drawn from the Economic Report of the Presi-\ndent for January 1948. In 1929, profits before taxes were 96 of gross national product, 1196\nof national income. In 1947 they were 1246 and 1396. This shows some relative gain. But\nin 1929 profits after taxes were 896 of gross national product or 976 of national income.\nToday they are 776 and 896. Thus the net relative profit share has actually declined,\n",

I have said that it is possible to get some intellectuals to admit\nthe need for taxing consumption\u2014which is tantamount to saying taxing the\nless well-to-do. But when one speaks of lowering taxes on the upper-income\nbrackets in order to get more saving and more investment, then, indeed,\ncontroversy begins. The clearest and most honest statement of the problem\nthat I have heard was made by a young economist who said that he would\n*rather have inflation than do anything to allow income distribution to move\ntoward its former (more unequal) pattern.\" In other words, what was to him\na moral standard was more important than the economic one.\n\nLet us, however, think a bit. For the man who is an avowed socialist,\nthere is no problem. Govermment will tax consumption, and government\ninvestment in plant for the production of consumers! goods will raise (it is\nsaid) the standard of living. The fact that such a policy will create an ever-\ngrowing field of government industry beside the \"private\" one is no objection.\nIndeed it is an advantage. My questions are aimed more at those who claim\nto \"believe\" in \"capitalism,\" and who profess to wish to help the condition\nof the poor, but who refuse to allow inequality of income and private capital\naccumulation on the ground that it is \"unethical.\" Their policy can only\nmean one of two things (a) the poor will not get the increased living stand-\nards they wish\u2014or get them very slowly, or (b) the economy will gradually\nbe socialized.

The basic\npeacetime task, it seems to me, is raising the standard of living, or if we are to\nbe at war, getting the needed war equipment; or, if it were possible, doing both.\nThe implied difference in emphasis is not a minor one. For peacetime policy\nit means the difference between taking \"welfare\" as our major guide or merely\nprice-level stabilization. The latter can be managed, officially anyhow, largely\nby controls, but the former is more complicated. If we merely take preventing\ninflation (price rise?) as our sole criterion then one can agree with Dr. Harris\nand Mr. Lerner that investment has been running \"far too high.\" But if\nraising the standard of living, or rearmament, is to be our prime goal, then\nwe are well justified in asking how, if investment is not to run high, the\nbasic problem is ever to be met? I submit therefore that our task is, indeed,\nto prevent inflation, but to prevent it in such a way as to permit a high rate\nof investment.\n\nHere is the rub. Mr. Lerner states the issue with admirable honesty and\nclarity: The more important part of the solution lies . . . in reducing the\nrate or flow of spending.

All I am trying to say is that depression may (sometimes) come because the pro-\npensity to consume is too high and/or the interest rate too low so that the capital projects\nundertaken cannot be completed for lack of adequate real saving. Alternatively, even when\nmonetary demand is very high, cost-price relationships may be such as not to furnish\nadequate incentive. These two cases cannot easily be handled by the usual Keynesian\nmodel, but this does not mean that it, in turn, will not also have its periods of applic\u00e1bility.\nFinally, there is a possibility of crisis in the investment industries due to varying rate of\nacceleration, even when general demand is still rising.

Anyone who reads the symposium on inflation\nof ten leading economists in the Review of Economics and Statistics for\nFebruary 1948 cannot fail to be impressed with its thoroughness, its scope,\nand its fair-mindedness. Vet because of the very meticulousness with which\nan attempt is made to cover the whole field, resulting impressions are some-\nwhat blurred. There is, in particular, one vital question the impact of which\nis obscured and which is left largely to implication. I refer to the relation\nbetween inflation and the distribution, or rather redistribution, of wealth.\nHere is a point at which all the most important ideological and social currents\nof the modern world meet in fateful flow.\n\nThe ten participants are in notable agreement on the immediate facts.\nAIl concede that we are, for the present, in a capital-hungry world. The\nmemory of secular stagnation troubles Dr. Boulding somewhat, but the\nother contributors say very little on the subject. While the writer does not\nwish to beg a vital question, space is lacking in this brief communication for\nan extended factual argument. We shall here assume (with, however, the tacit\nsupport, as it seems to me, of most of the participants) that this state of capital\nhunger is likely to endure\u2014long enough, indeed, for us to begin to treat the\nsecular problem as inflation rather than the reverse. If more definite statement\nis demanded, I should say about 25 years. Basis for such an outlook is found\nin the following considerations: (1) a straight line /ong run trend in consump-\ntion paralleling output, if anything proportionately higher in future; (2) im-\nmense increase in public demand for government-provided welfare services\nrequiring a great deal of capital; (3) general determination of backward\ncountries to industrialize as quickly as possible and probable willingness of\nAmericans to help finance the process. These alone, I believe, could account for\nlong run upward pressure. Add to them the threat of war, and the prospect of\nsecular upward price trends seems overwhelming.\n\nSuch a point of view does not deny the possibility of short-run depression.\nBut any such stoppages (as Dr. Mills! essay rather clearly shows) are more\nlikely to be the product of cost-price maladjustment; or *over\"-investment ;\nor may even conceivably be of an \"Austrian\" character\u2014that is the type of\ndisturbance analyzed by Lionel Robbins, Hayek, and more recently by J.

Actually, what Mr. Boulding\ndefined in the above quotation is the concept of net national investment,\nand it should occasion no surprise to learn that a stationary society had no\nnet national investment.\n\nContrary to the belief expressed in the quotation, there is a logical reason to\nsubtract depreciation on plant and machinery only from gross national\nproduct in order to obtain net national product. The currently used definition\nof net national product flows directly from the notion of a gross national\nproduct. In order to obtain it, one subtracts depreciation on capital equip-\nment from gross national product because part of the existing equipment is\nused up in the process of production. Hence, it is subtracted out to avoid\ndouble counting, ;.e., counting once the consumer goods produced, and then\nagain counting the capital equipment used up in producing the consumer\ngoods. Depreciation on consumer durables is not subtracted out because con-\nsumer durables are treated, as a matter of convenience in computing the\nstatistic, as being consumed in the same period in which they are produced,\ni.e. they are already net. Consumer non-durables are not subtracted out, of\ncourse, because they are one of the elements we desire to measure. If gross\nnational product is meaningful, by the same token net national product is\nalso meaningful.\n\nIn the note below, Mr. Boulding maintains his objection to the net national\nproduct on the grounds that some depreciation of capital is a function of time\nbut not of the quantity produced. Here, he believes that time-depreciation\nshould not be subtracted out to arrive at net national product. However,\ngranting that some depreciation is independent of the quantity of goods\nproduced but is dependent on a time interval, Mr. Boulding should agree to\nsubtracting the time-depreciation which occurred over the period in which\nnational product was being measured.\n\nI therefore believe that Mr. Boulding's attempt to define a most significant\nconcept of net national product as \"excess of gross product over its 'fixed\ncost'\u2014i.e., over the consumption which would take place at zero output\"\nis not meaningful because it neglects the fact that the national product is\nmeasured over a time interval during which time-depreciation occurs. Mr.\nBoulding's second concept of national surplus as *the excess of the gross\nproduct over that consumption which is necessarily involved in its produc-\ntion\" is not helpful because the terms in the definition are not defined. This\nlatter concept would be measurable, and hence meaningful, only if we could\nfirst decide what plane of living would be necessary for the purpose of\nproduction.\n\nThe usually cited deficiency in the net national product figure as pub-\nlished by the Department of Commerce is the lack of good statistics on\ndepreciation. I do not, however, detect a conceptual error in arriving at this\nfigure once gross national product is given, and I have tried to show that the\ntwo suggestions made by Mr. Boulding were not conceptual improvements.\n\nMownzor Bunk*\n\n* The author is an instructor in economics at American University.\n",

His argument, as it\noriginally appeared, was based on a misunderstanding of the currently used\nconcept of net national product. He wrote (pp. 101-102):\n\n\"The *net\" national product is usually defined as the gross product less *'de-\npreciation\"\u2014depreciation being usually confined to plant and machinery. But\ndepreciation is merely one form of consumption: and if we subtract one part of\nconsumption (depreciation of industrial fixed capital), why not subtract\ndepreciation of consumers capital, of houses, automobiles, etc.? And is there any\nlogical difference between consumption which is spread out over a life-period\nof a commodity (depreciation) and the consumption of one-use goods such as\nfuel and foodstuf\u00eds? It would seem, therefore, that any attempt to define a net\nproduct by subtracting \"depreciation\" from a gross product will land us\nlogically in a definition which makes the net product equal to the gross product\nless all consumption\u2014which is to make the net product equal to accumulation,\nin which case a stationary society, however rich, would have no net product!\n\nThus Mr. Boulding argues that while the concept of gross national prod-\nuct is meaningful, the attempt to subtract out certain commodities used up\n\n?

Another significant concept might be described as the \"national\nsurplus\"\u2014i\u00ed.e., the excess of the gross product over that consumption which\nis necessarily involved in its production. The proportion of its resources\nwhich a nation could devote to a total war effort, for instance, would be\na measure of the ^national surplus.\" This, however, is very far from the\n*net national product\" of the Department of Commerce.\n\nK.

The increase in unit cost that arises from overtime work is due to\nthe change in the average cost of the variable factor and not to changes in\nthe efficiency of the input factor.\n\nWhen the least cost point is *at or near capacity,\" a manager will naturally\nprefer to operate at capacity but he may be prevented from doing so by the\nrate at which goods are flowing through the channels of distribution to con-\nsumers. To illustrate, assume that seven laborers in a small plant can produce\n700 products per hour but that ten laborers in this plant can produce 1200\nproducts per hour. If labor is paid 84 cents an hour, average cost will be 84\ncents when seven laborers are employed and 70 cents when ten laborers are\nemployed. If the current demand (at the price printed in catalogs) is for\n28,000 products a week, a manager would prefer to operate the plant at its\ncapacity rate for 23 hours and 20 minutes a week, but since his laborers will\nobject to such a short work-week he will find it more practical to lay off three\nmen and to work the remaining seven men 40 hours a week.\n\nIf demand temporarily exceeds 48,000 products a week, a manager will\nresort to overtime not because marginal revenue exceeds marginal costs but\nbecause his backlog of orders makes overtime necessary. If a manager expects\ndemand to continue to exceed 48,000 products a week, he will operate his plant\nat capacity overtime until an addition to the plant can be constructed, after\nwhich he will again operate in accordance to the principles laid down in the\npreceding paragraph. In making such decisions, businessmen do not construct\nmarginal revenue and marginal cost curves nor do they operate at a scale of\noperation that such curves would indicate if they were drawn.\n\nIn passing, Mr. Haines accuses me of misstating Bowman and Bach in\nmy Figure 2. My article was not an attack upon Bowman and Bach. Rather,\nin the early part of my paper I asserted that the graphs found in most text-\nbooks are based upon *an assumption that the plant in which production\noccurs is designed in such a way as to cause the variable factor to be used\nmost efficiently when output is relatively small.\" For purposes of illustration,\nI took a curve from a textbook which happened to be Bowman and Bach's\nEconomic Analysis. 'To make certain that there would be no misunderstand-\ning, I took pains to state that the \"solid line\" of Figure 2 was taken from a\n\"widely used and well-known textbook\" (as a matter of fact the dotted line\nwas also taken from the same source). I added the \"capacity line\" at the\npoint where Bowman and Bach's marginal product curve became zero. This\nwas done, not to misstate them (although I believe that they would agree\nthat a plant has reached its capacity output when its marginal product is\nzero), but merely to facilitate comparison with a different type of average\nand marginal product curve, i.e., the curves shown in Figure 3. Obviously, I\ndid not succeed in misstating Bowman and Bach, if that was my object, for\nMr. Haines was able to deduce correctly what I had done.\n\n*A dollar an hour for eight hours plus three dollars for two additional hours is the\nequivalent of paying $1.10 per hour for ten hours.\n",

He also charges me with failing to\nindicate clearly which definition of capacity I had in mind. A re-reading of\nmy paper suggests that I am guilty of neglect in this matter. To remedy my\nneglect, he catalogs three possible definitions of capacity and then very\ncharitably assumes that I probably had in mind the most sensible of the\nthree. On this assumption he proceeds to demolish my theory. Unfortunately,\nhowever, his inventory omits a fourth definition which is the only one that\nis entirely acceptable.\n\nCapacity must be distinguished from maximum output. Mr. Haines's de-\nfinition fails to do this. Maximum output is a concept having two dimensions,\ntime and a rate of production. Capacity is only one of the numerous possible\nrates of production\u2014it happens to be the maximum rate. Capacity, by itself,\nis a timeless concept. Thus it would be appropriate to say that a plant was\nproducing at capacity at a given moment even though its output for that day\nmight well be less than its output for the preceding day.\"\n\nIt is difficult to deal with a timeless-rate of production, yet if capacity is\nstated as the maximum output for a period of time (such as a day, a week,\nor a month), variations in ordinary time periods lend vagueness to the con-\ncept. An eight-hour day is not the same as a ten-hour day; no week has\nexactly the same number of working days in it as every other week, and so\non. But all such obstacles are circumvented when the rate of production is\nplaced on an hourly basis for (after the warming-up hour) one hour is\nidentical with every other hour. Thus capacity should be defined as the\nmaximum hourly output possible under normal circumstances. So defined,\nbeyond-capacity output becomes impossible.\n\nAn average variable cost curve indicates the unit cost of producing goods\nat all scales of operation from the minimum rate practical to the maximum\nrate possible. The actual scale of operation shifts from one point on this\ncurve to another by adding or subtracting input units. The curve assumes\nthe cost of the input factors to remain constant. The sAape of an average\ncost curve is determined by the efficiency of each added (or subtracted) input\nunit. The shape is not affected by the time element. The altitude of an\naverage cost curve is determined by the cost of the input factor and is affected\nby the time element. When a plant is operated the customary number of\nhours each day, it will pay the market rate of wages. If it operates ten hours\ninstead of eight, it may have to pay time-and-a-half for the extra two hours.\nThis is the equivalent of a ten per cent rise in the hourly rate of pay and will\ncause the average cost curve to shift to a higher level without altering its\n\n\"This would be true, for example, if the output for Saturday (a four-hour day) was\ncompared to the output for Friday (an eight-hour day) when the plant was operating\nat capacity-rate on Saturday and at 65 per cent of capacity-rate on Friday.\n",

It is not likely that businessmen\nmake decisions as to prices and output on the basis of mathematical meas-\nures of the slopes of cost and revenue curves.*\n\nMr. Bishop also points out that MR \u2014 MC is not a necessary condition for\nprofit maximization and suggests that \"profit is maximized at a certain output\nwhen MR \u00bb MC at immediately lower outputs and when MR \u00ab MC at\nimmediately higher outputs.\" Admittedly this is the more precise statement\nof the rule, particularly when discontinuous curves are assumed. However,\nwhen continuous curves are assumed, both rules lead to an identical solution.\n\nMr. Bishop disagrees with my statement that the MC curve ends at\nabsolute capacity. As pointed out above, when continuous curves are used,\nmarginal cost is identical with the additional cost of one more product. If\nproduction is at absolute capacity, one more product is impossible. There\ncan be no \"cost\" of an impossible product. Mr. Bishop suggests that the\nmarginal curve be drawn vertical at absolute capacity for \"purely heuristic\"\nreasons. Webster's dictionary defines \"heuristic\" as pertaining to methods\nof demonstration that are persuasive rather than compellingly logical.*\n\nMr. Bishop also feels that my statement that cost reaches its minimum\n*at or near capacity\" is a devastating admission for if it is once admitted\nthat a variable unit cost reaches its minimum short of capacity and then\nrises, marginal cost exceeds variable unit cost over the range where the latter\nis rising and profit maximization by the conventional intersection of MR\nand MC is possible. But he goes on in the next paragraph to admit that if\nthe variable unit cost at capacity only slightly exceeds the least cost point,\nthe conventional intersection of MC and MR occurs only by virtue of the\nfact that the MC curve rises vertically at capacity to infinity. In other words,\nhe believes that in such cases entrepreneurs choose to operate at capacity be-\ncause the cost of a non-producible product (one beyond capacity) is in-\nfinitely higher than the revenue that would be obtained from the sale of\nsuch a non-existent product. 'The proposition refutes itself.\n\n* The limits to the use of arithmetic and geometry in economic analysis should be dictated\nby the nature of the economic data and not by the mathematical technic of the economist.\nFor a discussion of some of these limitations the reader is referred to W.

                    "Reply to Mr. Bishop\n\nTo begin with, Mr. Bishop objects to my saying that marginal cost is the\n\"cost of an additional unit of output.\" He prefers to define marginal cost as\n\"the slope of the total cost curve\" or as *'the rate at which total cost changes\nfor infinitely small changes of output in either direction.\" I see no objections\nto Mr. Bishop's definition providing certain limitations in its application are\nrecognized. Mathematically an \"infinitely small change in output\" could indi-\ncate a change of a fraction of a product whereas practical considerations\nwould oppose having an \"infinitely small change in output\" refer to any\nquantity less than one product. Thus when a continuous curve is assumed,\nmarginal cost is the cost of one product even though it also happens to be a\nmathematical measure of the slope of the total cost curve.? This raises the\nquestion of which of the two definitions offers the more useful tool for\nanalysis. The purpose of price and equilibrium theory should be to explain\nhow businessmen set prices and determine outputs under various assumed\nconditions. It is within the realm of possibility that a businessman might\n\n* If production cannot be expanded one product at a time, then the concept of average\nmarginal cost should be substituted for marginal cost.\n",
                    "as economists are prone to assume, \"but is, instead, a combination of forces.\nConsequently the change in total output that results from the application of\nan additional unit of input factor is a summation of the net effect of the com-\nponent forces included in the input \"unit.\" As pointed out, some of these forces\ntend toward increased output and some have an opposite tendency. From\nwhich it follows logically that *when production is carried on in quarters\ndesigned for the purpose, those in control will take into consideration all of\nthe relationships involved and strive by careful planning to prevent any one of\nthe component forces from decreasing efficiency until operations are close to\ncapacity.\"\n\nMr. Bishop and Mr. Haines do not find fault with this thesis but they\nare alarmed at its implications for marginal analysis. For example, if modern\nengineers can make the least cost point fall at capacity output, then marginal\ncost curves will lie below average cost curves at all points of operation short\nof capacity. As a consequence, marginal cost curves will no longer intersect\nmarginal revenue curves (1) when average revenue curves are horizontal\nor (2) when average revenue curves are high and almost horizontal. Under\neither of these conditions, business managers would simply produce as much\ngoods as the current market would absorb without reference to marginal\ncost and marginal revenue. The case for marginal analysis would still be\nsaved, however, if it could be proved that marginal cost curves rise verti-\ncally at capacity or that beyond-capacity production is possible. In a nut-\nShell this is what Messrs. Bishop and Haines argue in their recent com-\nmunication, although they also bring up a number of other points which must\nbe considered.\n",

                    "Comment on Mr. Burk's Note\n\nMr. Burk has detected a definite error in my article, and I am grateful\nfor the opportunity to correct it. It is quite true that the net national product\nconcept is an attempt to avoid \"double counting\" in the computation of\nnational income. Just as we should not count both the wheat and the flour\nmade from it in the national product, so it is argued we should not count\nboth the consumption of the flour mill and the flour. Where production\nconsists of asset transformation, clearly the \"net\" output consists of as-\nsets produced less their \"cost\" in the sense of assets used up in making\nthem.\n\nThere is, however, still some difficulty in the *net national product\"\nconcept. Depreciation may be in large part a \"fixed cost.\" That is to say, the\nflour mill may depreciate whether it is used or not: in that way it differs\nfrom the wheat, which still remains as an asset whether it happens to be\nmade into flour or not. That is to say, there is some consumption which is\na \"variable cost\"\u2014or \"user cost,\" to use Keynes' term\u2014which would not\nhave taken place had there not been production, and some which is a \"fixed\ncost,\" which would take place whether there was production or not. It is\nclear that the fixed cost (depreciation) is not a ''cost of production\" but\nmerely a *cost of existence.\" It is the gross product, therefore, which is the\nbest measure of output. This can be seen clearly if we reflect that at a zero\nlevel of employment, the gross product will be zero but the net product will\nbe negative. Assuming constant efficiency of labor, gross product will rise\nproportionately with employment: net product will not. In this sense the\nmost significant concept of net product is the excess of gross product over\nits *fixed cost\"\u2014i.e., over the consumption which would take place at zero\noutput. Another significant concept might be described as the \"national\nsurplus\"\u2014i\u00ed.e., the excess of the gross product over that consumption which\nis necessarily involved in its production. The proportion of its resources\nwhich a nation could devote to a total war effort, for instance, would be\na measure of the ^national surplus.\" This, however, is very far from the\n*net national product\" of the Department of Commerce.\n\nK.

                    "Capacity Production and the Least Cost Point\n\nIn a recent issue of the Review Professor Eiteman attempts to demonstrate\nthat the marginal analysis method for determining the actual point of pro-\nduction of a firm is not in accord with the facts. While I would heartily\nendorse any advance in the direction of bringing economic theory into closer\nharmony with economic practice, I believe that this attempt has been abor-\ntive.\n\nProfessor Eiteman's basic contention is that in the case where engineers\ndesign a plant, they design it in such a way that the most efficient point of\nproduction (the lowest point on the average variable cost curve) is at capacity\noutput; that marginal cost is therefore equal to average cost at capacity;\nand that if the marginal-revenue curve is above the marginal-cost curve at\nthis point, it is impossible for the firm to produce to the point where marginal\nrevenue and marginal cost are equal, for they cannot ever be equal under\nthese conditions. Therefore business men \"simply produce all they can sell\"\n(p. 914)?\n\nProfessor Eiteman further implies that marginal revenue must lie above\nmarginal cost at capacity *uniess demand is extremely inelastic\" (p. 913).\n\"This is not necessarily the case.?

Conclusion\n\nI shall try to summarize the major propositions which I have stressed in\nthe course of criticizing Eiteman's paper (and I designate by Roman numerals\nin parentheses the section of my paper where each of these propositions is\ndiscussed):\n\n1. The rigorous definition of a marginal magnitude\u2014and the only defini-\ntion which relates to unique outputs, rather than to intervals of output\nchange\u2014is a derivative or slope: marginal cost (revenue) is the slope of\nthe total-cost (-revenue) curve, plotted against output (II).\n\n2. When there is a discontinuity in the slope (a sharp break or a termina-\ntion) of a total curve, this implies a (finite or infinite) discontinuity in the\nmarginal curve\u2014and hence an indeterminacy of the marginal magnitude (II).\n\n?' This conclusion may be demonstrated. Let output \u2014 x; total cost \u2014 C; and total fixed\ncost \u2014 F. Variable unit cost is some function of output, f(x) ; and its slope is f'(x).\nThen CF xf(x);\n\ndC\nand marginal cost is de \u2014 f(x) 4- xf'(x).\nX\n\nWhen variable unit cost it at its minimum, f'(x) \u2014 0; and marginal cost equals variable\nunit cost. Beyond that point, the slope of the \"rounded\" variable-unit-cost curve increases\ncontinuously from zero to infinity. Then, as\n\ndc\nf'(x) 2 o\u00bb, \u2014 \u2014 o.\ndx\n",
                    "zinal cost is\n",
                    "Furthermore, even if variable unit cost at absolute capacity is only very\nslightly above its minimum value near capacity, marginal cost may well be\nindefinitely high\u2014or literally *infinite\"\u2014at the capacity output. The reason\nfor this is that marginal cost, equal to the slope of the total-cost curve, is\nalso related to the slope of the variable-unit-cost curve. Then, if the slope of\nthat curve approaches infinity at absolute capacity, so will marginal cost.?!\n\nThis result is implied even by an almost imperceptible **rounding\" of the\nunit-cost curves in the neighborhood of capacity, provided only that the\nrounding is complete and does not leave any vestige of the \"sharp corners\" at\nv and \u00a3. For example, suppose that variable unit cost describes a rising quarter-\ncircle between its minimum and its end-point at absolute capacity. The radius\nof this circle may be indefinitely small, with the minimum of variable unit\ncost as close to capacity as anyone likes; but marginal cost will still be\ninfinite at capacity, despite the fact that all the other cost magnitudes are\nfinite.\n\nUnder such conditions, a profit maximum will always imply that MR \u2014\nMC. Of course, no one insists on a scrupulously precise maximizing of profit\nin an uncertain world; so the cost accountant and his employer will be fully\npardoned if they speak of producing a *capacity output\" whenever marginal\ncost, as in this case, is rapidly rising. My main point, however, is that when\nEiteman allowed for a possible rounding of the unit-cost curves \"near\"\ncapacity, he should have realized that the u-shaped cost curves, in principle,\ncome back into their own.\n",

Then, if profit should prove to be maximized\nat the output where this discontinuity occurs, we shall once again have nothing\nbut the marginal inequalities to assure us of the profit maximum.\n\nV. Minimum Unit Costs \"Near\" Capacity\n\nSo far I have taken Eiteman's hypothesis about the shape of the typical\nmanufacturing firm's costs at face value. I have done so, not because these\ncost curves strike me as plausible, but because I have been primarily con-\ncerned to show that his adverse reflections on marginalism are ill conceived\neven if his view of typical cost patterns should be accepted in its most rigid\nform.!* Nor shall I attempt to detail my misgivings about the empirical as-\npects of Eiteman's paper,!? but I should like to comment on the implications\nof relaxing his cost hypothesis in one particular.\n\nMy comment concerns the appropriateness of the assumption that the\nminimum points of the unit-cost curves occur at absolute capacity. Eiteman\nhimself wavers on this question; for more than once (e.g., p. 914) he speaks\nof unit costs reaching their minimum *'at or near\" capacity.? On the other\nhand, Eiteman does not seem to realize that this is a devastating admission\nwith respect to his own misgivings about the marginal analysis of equilibrium\n\"near\" capacity.\n\nThe point is that if variable unit cost reaches its minimum short of capacity\nand then rises, marginal cost exceeds variable unit cost over the range where\nthe latter is rising. Hence, under either pure or impure competition, a profit\nmaximum anywhere in this range implies a conventional intersection of MR\nand MC.\n\n?* Having thus essayed to defend marginal analysis against Eiteman's criticisms, I do not\nmean to imply that I consider that theory invulnerable to attack, Rather, my own opinion\nis that it is decidedly open to valid and damaging criticism, but not on the narrow grounds\ncited by Eiteman and Lester.\n\n? For a detailed criticism of Eiteman's empirical argument I defer to Professor Haines\u2014\nwhose paper, also published in this issue, I have been privileged to read in a preliminary\nversion. Similarly, I have not attempted to discuss another topic treated by Haines, namely\nthe \"inventory\" aspect of Eiteman's own theory of output determination.\n\n?'This concession seems entirely appropriate to me; for even if a key piece of equip-\nment\u2014such as a machine or a melting furnace\u2014is most economically used under condi-\ntions of continuous, round-the-clock operation, there is still likely to be leeway for increas-\ning its output if the firm is willing to incur higher-than-normal expenses\u2014\u00edor example,\nby taking all possible precautions to minimize the intervals when almost any piece of\nequipment is unavoidably idle, whether for overhauling or repair.\n\nConsider also the revealing comment of one of the business men questioned by Lester.\nBy way of explaining why his variable unit costs were not a minimum at (undefined)\ncapacity, the man said (Shortcomings of Marginal Analysis . . . , p. 68): \"Theoretical\n10096 is likely to produce too many strains.\" On the several occasions when I have\nasked a plant manager or a cost accountant similar questions, I have invariably received\nthis kind of answer\u2014as soon as I made clear that I was not asking about \"rated capacity\"\nor some other such conventional index which can be exceeded in practice.\n",

Quite the contrary, if de-\nmand for the output of a firm should be inelastic throughout, marginal revenue\nis uniformly negative. Then, under any cost conditions whatever (excluding\nonly negative marginal costs), profit would steadily increase as output is\ncurtailed toward zero. This is so because marginal revenue would lie uni-\nformly below marginal cost. The profit-maximizing output, being positive but\nindefinitely small, cannot be otherwise specified; yet this is the one case which\nEiteman considers marginal analysis able to handle! It is also a totally un-\nrealistic case.\n\nOn the other hand, when demand is relatively elastic\u2014but not too elastic\u2014\nit is obviously possible for average revenue to lie above variable unit cost at\nthe same output where marginal revenue is intersecting marginal cost from\nabove. Then we have a perfectly conventional, textbook instance of a profit-\nmaximizing output where MR \u2014 MC.'*\n\nby a drastic, temporary reduction of output, to be followed by an adjustment of output to\nwhat can be sold at the going price?

Thus\nEiteman's statement about output determination does not conflict with marginal theory;\nhe merely leaves out the explanation of price, without which no theory of output can be\ncomplete.\n\n? Lest anyone think that Lester's statement quoted in my footnote 13 was meant to refer\nto pure competition because of his reference to unbranded products, I shall also quote\nfrom his immediately subsequent sentence, which shows that his theory of output determina-\ntion is very like Eiteman's\u2014and similarly rules out pure competition. Says Lester (*Mar-\nginalism, Minimum Wages, and Labor Markets,\" pp. 138-39) : *. . . the volume of output\nand employment in the individual firm generally varies simply and directly with the volume\nof present and prospective demand for products of the plant.\"\n\nT The excess of price or average revenue (AR) over MR is related to the (negative)\nelasticity of demand, E, by various well-known formulas\u2014cf. Joan Robinson, Te Eco-\nnomics of Imperfect Competition (London, 1936), p. 36:\n\nAR\n\nFor example, where E \u2014 \u20142, AR is twice MR ; and when E \u2014 \u2014 4/3, AR is four times MR.\nThus, when MR \u2014 MC at any output in my diagram, price will exceed variable unit cost\nprovided demand is not too elastic (.e., provided the value of E is not too far below \u20141,\nalgebraically).\n",

With price equal to v, there is a two-point indeterminacy of output: it is a matter of\nindifference to the firm to produce either zero output or capacity output. Losses equal total\nfixed cost either way.\n\nNotice that, with price between 7 and v, there is a local profit maximum at some posi-\ntive output short of capacity, where price \u2014 MR \u2014 MC and where MC cuts MR from\nbelow; but the zero output is preferred because the loss there (equal to total fixed cost) is\nless than the loss at any positive output. Of course, the zero output also qualifies as a\nlocal profit maximum, because MR\u00ab MC for any small positive output.\n\n\"The case of price equal to (m is interesting as a curiosity. The horizontal marginal-revenue\nline is then tangent to the marginal-cost curve; and profit is neither a minimum nor a\nmaximum, but merely stationary, at the tangency output. Both above and below this\noutput, MR\u00abC MC; so profit is bigger at lower outputs and smaller at higher outputs, even\nthough it is stationary where MR \u2014 MC.\n\n\"'The preceding context of this remark is that \"business men do not determine their\nscale of operations by reference to marginal cost and revenues at all: they simply produce\nall that they can sell.\" This statement is hardly a satisfactory alternative to the marginalist\ntheory of output determination, even under the conditions of impure competition to which\nit obviously refers.

Declining Costs\n\nEiteman believes that, if costs exhibit the pattern he stipulates, it is (p.\n913) \"physically impossible for an enterprise to determine a scale of opera-\ntions by equating marginal cost and marginal revenues unless demand is\nextremely inelastic.\" This statement is partly based on his misconceptions\nabout the marginal analysis of a profit maximum at capacity, as already dis-\ncussed; but it is also based on the alleged difficulty of explaining, by means\nof the marginal criteria, the determination of a profit-maximizing output short\nof capacity.!?\n\n?' My colleague, Paul Samuelson, tells me that his practice is to explain to his students\nthat it is *as if\" marginal cost continued vertically upward from such a point as v. On\nthe other hand, the average and total cost curves\u2014which are not \"slope\" concepts\u2014\nshould not be so drawn, since they are defined as the cost minima at various outputs.\n\n\" Professor Machlup's brief discussion of discontinuities in marginal curves implies sub-\nstantial agreement with my interpretation, except that he wavers as to whether or not a\ndiscontinuity implies indeterminacy of the marginal magnitude\u2014Fritz Machlup, Marginal\nAnalysis and Empirical Research,\" Am. Econ. Rev., Vol. XXXVI, No. 4, Pt. 1 (Sept.,\n1946), p. 533. On the one hand, Machlup talks about the \"vertical portion\" of the marginal\ncurve\u2014which does imply indeterminacy; but in the same paragraph he also implies that\nthe marginal value is uniquely equal to its lower limit.\n\n? Professor Lester shares Eiteman's view that declining costs pose peculiar difficulties\nfor the marginalist explanation of less-than-capacity outputs. The most concise statement\nby Lester on this point appears in his *Marginalism, Minimum Wages, and Labor Markets,\"\nAm. Econ. Rev., Vol. XXXVII, No. 1 (Mar., 1947), pp. 135-48. With respect to declining\nvariable unit costs, he says (p. 138): *If business men think that their unit variable costs\n(to say nothing of their overhead costs per unit) change in that fashion, I submit that it\nis extremely difficult to explain both the wide variations of output that occur in the scale\nof plant operations and the size of the average deviation from 100 per cent plant capacity\nthat occurs over say a decade (especially in plants producing articles not carrying the\nproducer's brand names) on the assumption that business men adjust their rate of opera-\ntions according to the principle of maximizing money profits by equating *marginal net\n",

Hence there is a\npossible justification for drawing the proposed vertical branch of MC indefinite-\nly upward, to emphasize that this indeterminacy has a lower limit at v and no\nupper limit. In addition, there is the pragmatic and purely heuristic justifica-\ntion that this does indeed produce the reassuring intersection which Eiteman,\nrather perversely, wishes to avoid.\"\n\nActually, however, there is no need to insist on this essentially trivial matter\nof draftsmanship. Whether or not we choose to draw vertical marginal-cost\ncurves, the fact remains that MC is indeterminate at any capacity output like\nthat in the diagram. Also, as long as we remember that the heart of the\nprofit-maximizing analysis concerns the Znequalities of MR and MC at lesser\nand greater outputs, there is no need to worry about whether a unique MR\nis equal or unequal to an indeterminate MC at the output we seek.

Actually, true fixed cost is incurred\neven at zero output.\n\n* Tt should not be thought, however, that it is inappropriate to assume output and money\nmagnitudes to be continuous variables, even when the product is physically indivisible.\nActually, *output\" in a cost-revenue diagram is really a rate of output per unit of time.\nThus, if a small firm produces one piano every two weeks, its rate of output per week\nis half a piano.\n\n*I am not suggesting that we must all start using the rigorous definitions in our ele-\nmentary classes; but even for elementary pedagogy one practical suggestion is in order.\nIn tables of cost and revenue data, where the marginal magnitudes are given the discrete\ndefinitions, the marginal figures should be placed between the rows of the other figures to\nemphasize the contrast that the marginal values, unlike the total and average ones, refer\nto differences between successive levels of output rather than to unique /evels of output.\n\n* Marginal cost may be subject to finite discontinuities, for example, because of the pay-\nment of overtime premiums, or because of the need to use equipment of inferior efficiency\nin order to exceed a certain output.\n\nA similar indeterminacy of marginal revenue occurs whenever there is a sharp break in\nthe slope of the demand curve\u2014and hence in the slope of the total-revenue function.\nExamples include the demand for the firm's product in several types of imperfectly com-\npetitive situations, notably the one involving the \"kinked\" oligopolistic demand curve\u2014cf.\nR.

                    "II. The Limited Significance of the Marginal Equality\n\nOne of Eiteman's criticisms of marginalism is that, if marginal revenue\nintersects the vertical line of full capacity above point v in the diagram,\nmarginal revenue does not equal\u2014but exceeds\u2014marginal cost at the profit-\nmaximizing capacity output. Hence, he complains, marginal analysis falls\ndown in this case because there is no intersection of MR and MC. The pen-\nchant of many economists for continuing marginal cost as a vertical line\nupwards from point v he dismisses (pp. 913-14) as *an attempt to save face\nby a play on words.\"\n\nWhile Eiteman's interpretation may seem a quibble\u2014if only because he is\nnot attacking the substance of marginalism\u2014he has indeed raised a point\nwhich, as a matter of exposition, does cause difficulty for the literal-minded\nwho consider the criterion of MR \u2014 MC as somehow of importance for its\nown sake. Actually, of course, the famed marginal equality is never more\nthan an implication of a profit maximum; but, what is more to the point, the\nmaximizing of profit does imply an equality of MR and MC only under cer-\ntain favorable conditions, when both the marginal magnitudes are continuous\nfunctions in the vicinity of their intersection. In other words, MR \u2014 MC\nis not a necessary condition for a profit maximum.*\n\nWhen either of the marginal magnitudes is subject to a discontinuity, it is\nindeterminate at the output where this discontinuity occurs. Such is the case\nwith marginal cost at capacity output in the diagram. Then, if MR lies above\npoint v, it is not uniquely equal to the indeterminate MC. This is not to say,\nhowever\u2014as Eiteman would have it\u2014that MR unambiguously exceeds MC.\nIf anything, marginal cost is simultaneously greater than, equal to, and less\nthan marginal revenue.\n\nThe root of Eiteman's difficulty is that he uses a definition of marginal cost\nwhich is out of place in a discussion which presumes to be rigorous. To him,\nmarginal cost is the cost of \"the last unit.\" Hence, he holds that marginal\n\nFor the rest, Eiteman's misgivings about marginal analysis concern two separable ele-\nments, both of which are incorporated in my diagram: (a) the \"sharp corners\" at v and t,\nmade by the junctions of the unit-cost curves with the vertical capacity line; and (b) the\nuniformly negative slope of variable unit cost at all outputs short of capacity.\n\nThe theoretical questions he has raised would also be involved to some extent under\nsomewhat weaker assumptions\u2014-e.g., declining total unit cost, with no such restriction on\nvariable unit cost. I mention this possibility mainly with reference to the cost hypothesis\nembodied in the cost accountant's usual *breakeven chart.\" Such charts ordinarily imply\nconstant marginal cost, at least over the accustomed ranges of output; and they imply\neither constant or declining variable unit cost, depending on whether or not marginal cost\nhas a falling phase over the range of very low outputs.\n\nWith either Eiteman's costs or those of the cost accountants, it is a separate question\nwhether there are \"sharp corners\" at absolute capacity. I discuss this matter last of all, in\nSection V.\n\n* Nor is it, of course, a sufficient condition\u2014since the equality of MR and MC may also\nindicate a profit minimum, or a stationary value which is neither a maximum nor a\nminimum. Further, if more than one local profit maximum exists, we must still find the\nmaximum maximorum\u2014if any\u2014simply by comparing the profits implied by the various\nlocal maxima.\n",

In reply to Lester's questionnaire, the executives of 33 firms reported that their\nvariable unit costs decline as their operations increase from 70 per cent to 100 per cent of\ncapacity, while only 3 firms reported rising variable unit costs anywhere in this range. On\nthe other hand, Lester did not raise the question of the behavior of costs at and beyond\ncapacity; and, indeed, he did not stop to define the concept of \"capacity.\"\n\nAs Stigler has already indicated, some of Lester's respondents rather overdid their enthusi-\nasm for declining costs; for their answers implied zegative marginal costs, i.e., declining\ntotal costs\u2014G. J. Stigler, Professor Lester and the Marginalists,\" Am. Econ. Rev., Vol.\nXXXVII, No. 1 (Mar., 1947), p. 156. Stigler, however, did not indicate how pervasive was\nthis anomalous result. It is implied by no less than ten of the twenty averages given in the\nupper third of Lester's Table II (p. 69). For example, there is a 12.5 per cent change of\noutput between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of capacity\u2014with the upper figure used as\nthe base. This means that if variable unit cost is 12.5 per cent lower at 80 per cent than\nat 70 per cent of capacity, the arc elasticity of the variable-unit-cost curve is unity; and\ntotal cost is the same at the two levels of output. Actually, *6 metal-working firms\"\nsaid they had an average decline of 15.9 per cent in variable unit cost between these output\nlevels, and the similar figure for \"6 others\" was 13.9 per cent. Similarly, when output\nincreases from 95 per cent to 100 per cent of capacity, the maximum credible decline of\nunit variable cost is 5 per cent; but \"7 cotton-clothing firms\" showed a 5.6 per cent\ndecline, 14 furniture firms\" a 6.4 per cent decline, and the average decline for all 33 firms\nwas 5.5 per cent.\n\n?* While I think I have faithfully represented Eiteman's assumptions about typical costs,\nit should not be thought that all the theoretical questions with which we are both concerned\nnecessarily depend on precisely this cost pattern. For example, the assumption that the\nslope of variable unit cost approaches zero at capacity is hardly an essential one; and I\nhave included this very special feature only because it is clearly implied by the marginal-\naverage relationship of Eiteman's own Figure 3. Naturally, if that slope remains negative\nand does not approach zero, marginal cost will intersect the vertical line of full capacity\nbelow point v.\n",

And, if one does not resort to crude extrapolation, how else can\nfuture matrices be forecast from the present matrix? Either one must consider\nthese relevant coefficients\u2014and thereby possibly reach conclusions different\nfrom Professor Frisch's, or else he must plead a lack of data, and thereby\nadmit the limited operational significance of his analysis and the impossibility\nof making economically meaningful forecasts. An answer to this dilemma is\nnot apparent in Professor Frisch's paper.\n\nOne can establish certain *import-export coefficients\" from the existing\nstructure of any one matrix. These may take the form of a ratio of country\nA's exports to country B to the total exports of country A, or a ratio of the\nimports by country A from country B to the total exports of country A. The\nprimary problem, however, is to forecast changes in these coefficients. To do\nthis one must know not only the numerical values of the previously men-\ntioned variables, but also their general interdependence and dynamical rela-\ntionships. For, since \"coupling\" is a common feature in the international\neconomy, it is not possible to allow one sector of the system to vary and\nstill keep the other sectors constant without making contradictory assump-\ntions. In many cases a country may not be important to the whole world\neconomy, but the converse situation is rare. Under conditions of multilateral-\nism, it may be quite generally true that country A imports a considerable\nshare of country B's exports, but that A exports its major share elsewhere\nthan to B. Then we must consider the influence of A on B and the influence\nof the other countries on A.\n\nNaturally, as in most economic problems, one cannot consider all the vari-\nables. Yet the operational significance of the trade matrix depends upon the\npossibility of isolating and considering at least the most important and rele-\nvant variables. If these cannot be isolated and measured exactly, then it is\ninadmissible to advocate policy upon the basis of an analysis which presup-\nposes such definite measurement.\n\nFurthermore, it should be recognized that the skewness of the matrix may\nbe symptomatic of different kinds of disequilibria. The disequilibrium may be\nof a cyclical or non-cyclical character and, under the latter, either a price\ndisequilibrium or a structural disequilibrium.? Even though the payment effect\nmay be present in all these cases, it is apparent that discriminatory import\nrestrictions would not be the best type of policy in each case. To contend that\nnon-proportional import restrictions should be adopted whenever a skewness\nappears, is to deny the validity of arguments which stress internal recovery\nprograms for cyclical disequilibrium, devaluation for price disequilibrium,\nand certain internal measures for structural disequilibrium.\n\nIt may also be noted that the existence of a skewness in the matrix does\n",

The Inflation in France: A Summary of Its Causes and Significance\n\nAt the time this article is being written, more than three and a half\nyears have elapsed since the liberation of Paris from the grip of the\nGermans. Over this period, France has been engaged in a desperate\nstruggle to revive her economy, which four years of enemy occupa-\ntion had sapped of its strength. While considerable progress has been\nmade in many sectors, the disappointing fact remains that over-all pro-\nduction has scarcely reached the 1938 level, which in itself was a de-\npressed year, consumption is far below prewar standards, and the\nreconstruction and modernization of the economy are only in their\ninitial stages.\n\nWhy has not economic recovery been more rapid in France? To this\nquestion there is no simple answer: a complex group of factors has\ncontributed to the slow pace of development. The problems have been\ndifficult: starting anew with a greatly weakened economy to meet the\ntasks not only of mere survival but of reconstruction and rehabilitation,\nthe French were confronted with raw material shortages (especially\ncoal), labor shortages, obsolescent equipment, exhausted land, insuffi-\ncient foreign exchange resources, and political instability. These prob-\nlems were inherited from the war and occupation, and in some cases\nwere part and parcel of a general world situation; the solution obvi-\nously would take time and would depend not only upon national efforts\nbut also upon world developments.\n\nOne of the primary factors which has been responsible for the\nabsence of a greater rate of economic recovery in France is the\nmonetary instability which has plagued the country since its liberation.\nAt the time Paris was delivered from the Germans (August, 1944),\ngeneral wholesale prices were about 2.7 times the average of 1938, and\nretail prices in Paris were 2.95 times the average of 1938. By the end\nof the year 1947, the level of prices, both wholesale and retail, had in-\ncreased to approximately four and a half times the level prevailing in\nAugust, 1944. By the end of 1947, therefore, prices were, according\nto official indexes, between thirteen and fifteen times higher than in\n\n* The author is associate professor of economics at Miami University.\n* Bulletin de la Statistique G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la France, April-May, 1945, p. 115.\n"

Next, the price is raised\nto P5; and price control goes around and around until the price is equated to\nAC at E.\n\nThis case resembles the price-output relations under the *cobweb theorem,\"\nbut the conditions naturally are different. The situation is not one of pure\ncompetition, regulatory anticipations of sales rather than actual production\nplans are based on past prices, production of public utility service is not man-\naged by fixed \"periods\" as in the case of agricultural commodities, and the\nprice of public utility service is controlled by average (reasonable) costs in-\nstead of an \"available\" supply.? Yet the past-sales rule, the assumption\n(which is stated in the first part of this section) of a persisting regulatory\nequation of average cost and price, and an intersection of the demand and\naverage cost curves where the latter is increasing can create a condition, as\nshown in Figure 4, that is not wholly unlike the price-supply relationships\nin the cobweb case. And the cobweb analysis gives guidance on an expected\nprice movement away from or toward the E point of Figure 4.!* A case of\ndivergent price fluctuation, based on an increasing instead of a U-shaped cost\ncurve, occurs when the cost curve is more elastic than the demand curve. And\na case of a convergent price fluctuation occurs when, as in Figure 4, the\nupward-sloping cost curve is less elastic than the demand curve. Such direct\nconvergence toward E is disturbed in Figure 4 because a U-shaped cost curve\nexists\u2014because prices may be equated alternately to increasing and decreasing\nsections of the cost curve. An equation of P and AC is certain within the\nincreasing-cost limits of Figure 4, and is possible (even assured if enough\nattempts are made) within the full range of cost behavior.\n\nEven though the analysis of this section is not based on actual demand\nand cost data, it still shows some likely consequences of the past-sales rule.\nStep-by-step movement toward AR \u2014 AC, the primary point of Figures 1\nand 2, seems quite demonstrable in general as long as the demand is not\nperfectly inelastic and the average costs are not constant. A gradual move-\nment toward reasonable earnings doubtless starts farther down than P, of\nFigure 1; such an initial price and such an extraordinary amount of excessive\nearnings are used to give a clear view of the movement. Perhaps the case of\na deficient return, which is illustrated in Figure 2, is not considered common\nbecause the traditional regulatory emphasis is on excessive returns. Yet in-\ncreases in raw material prices, wages, and construction costs may make de-\nficient earnings a more frequent experience in public utility industries. At any\nrate the reasoning about an upward price adjustment, controlled by the old-\nsales assumption, is no more than a reversal of the case for a downward ad-\njustment.

Unfortunately the AR curve is not only below the AC\ncurve at OQ;, but also the cost curve does not show that the firm has enough\nplant capacity to produce this quantity. Indeed, the absolute limit of plant\ncapacity, which is probably well beyond the point where the firm wishes to\noperate, seems to be about OQ;. Thus, by disregarding demand elasticity the\nregulators put the company in a position where either more plant must be\nbuilt, stand-by plant brought into use, service rationed, or prices increased.!?\nThis case suggests that the rule can have some uneconomic effects on the use\nof public utility resources.\n\nA disparity between consumer demand and plant capacity may occur for\nsome but not all buyer classes. It can be related to price structures, and be\na matter of differences in demand elasticities. The commission reduces the\nprices in all service classifications, including those for which close substitutes\nare available. And if the prices of the near substitutes do not change at all,\nthen the commission and company encounter sharp increases in sales. This\nhappens when the established price relation between substitutes is broken,\nbuyers notice the price difference, and a shift to the low-priced service begins.\nSuch a change is significant where the cross-elasticity of demand is high. For\nexample, a considerable reduction of industrial gas rates, making gas as\ncheap or even cheaper than coal for many kinds of heating, is certain to reveal\na considerable cross elasticity of demand. And there are other similar situations,\nsuch as the choice between gas and electricity for water heating, between the\nlong-lines service of the Bell System and Western Union service, and between\ngas, coal, and fuel oil for space heating.\n\nLet us suppose that, as in many cases, the rates are reduced in all service\nclassifications by the same percentage. For some classes, the ones with in-\nelastic or only slightly elastic demand, the consumption increases moderately ;\nbut the other types of service, having high rates of substitution (immediate\nor eventual) with other commodities, can expand a great deal. Expecting\neither a small increase or no increase at all in sales as a price decrease is\nordered, the commission starts an extraordinary change that can press on or\nbeyond the sensible limits of plant capacity.'* On the other hand, a general in-\ncrease in prices is followed by a significant reduction in sales to the buyers who\nhave an elastic demand. Such responses to price changes are most likely to\noccur, of course, when the prices of substitutes do not change in proportion to\npublic utility rates. Prices of fuel and coal do not vary directly with gas\nprices; in fact, prices of oil and coal increased during the past decade while\nthe space-heating and industrial prices for gas remained quite stable. Nor\ndo gas and electric prices, or telegraph and telephone rates move closely\n\n? And neglect of probable demand increases, which is not discussed directly in this\npaper, can have similar effects,\n\n^ Because the buyer response to such price decreases can be spread over a few years\nor even a decade when sizable investments must be made in consumption equipment such\nas furnaces and industrial machinery, the commission, having changes in membership and\nlacking understanding of much economic behavior, does not realize that the large sales and\nthe shortage of plant capacity are traceable to its pricing policy.

For\nsome public utility services the response to ordinary price changes is very\nlow even if a long time is allowed for buyer reactions. These responses are\nlikely to be so low that an assumption of perfectly inelastic demand is a de-\nfensible working rule for administrators. These services have no near sub-\nstitutes, and consumers are well habituated to their use. As I explain\nelsewhere,'^ a high inelasticity of demand seems to be evident for domestic\nlighting with electricity, cooking use of gas, most domestic uses of water, a\nconsiderable part of local telephone service. And the demand for street light-\ning, most commercial lighting, and most established uses of electric and gas\nappliances seems to be quite inelastic\u2014even perfectly inelastic for considerable\nprice ranges in some situations.\n\nFor other uses, consumers recognize the existence of alternatives, but they\ndo not respond immediately to price changes. Reaction to price changes and\ngradual movement toward a given demand elasticity take time\u2014as much as\na decade or more for some services. This category of eventual response con-\ntains industrial buyers of electricity and gas who may increase their con-\nsumption at lower prices or are likely to turn away from higher prices if\nthey have time to make the adjustments, space-heating buyers of gas who\nare aware of their alternative choices of coal and fuel oil, users of toll lines\nand telegraph service who can shift between long-distance calls and telegrams\nas the price differentials change, and so on.\" To justify a working rule of\nperfectly inelastic demand when a considerable buyer response is expected\neventually, a commission must be ready and willing to investigate frequently\nso that the revenue effects of past price changes are not neglected for long\nperiods of time. Commissions must stand ready to raise or lower prices as\neach new relation of demand and cost seems to justify a change. Such frequent\nand regular investigations, unfortunately, are not common among the com-\nmissions.\n\nThe real explanation for the past-sales rule is not found, however, in the\nbehavior of demand elasticities.

And while the Federal Communications Commission preferred a more\n\"scientific\" analysis of the price-output relation, the company's anticipations\nwere accepted.5\n\nExperience is the main criterion in public utility regulation. Avoiding meas-\nurements of probable demand changes or elasticities of demand, commissioners\nuse the revenue data that already are parts of company histories. Putting\nthe problem in this simple manner, a commission needs to do no more than\nchoose a base period for the revenue calculations. As Table I shows, the\nregulators choose a variety of base-revenue periods. The last full calendar\nyear is the favorite, the current year and the second preceding year receive\nabout equal attention, and the remainder of the choices are scattered among\na miscellany of bases such as the third or fourth preceding year or even the\nsales of one month of the current year.*\n\nRepresented more often in the ninety decisions than any other commission,\nthe Federal Power Commission always relied on some sort of past experience.\nOtherwise the FPC, like commissions in general, showed some variations of\nbehavior. At first this commission, which did not become a price regulator\nuntil 1935, did not clarify its choices of revenue bases. Later it began to use\na \"test\" year that was the first,\" second, or third year? preceding the decisions.\nThe commission made only brief explanations of these choices, saying that\nthe \"latest calendar year . . . is the most reliable guide for the future,\" that\nthe \"latest full year for which there is complete data . . . furnished the best\navailable guide for fixing rates,\" that the costs and revenue of the third pre-\nceding year were representative\" of relationships in the \"immediate future,\"\nthat the choice was a \"conservative (average! year\" or simply \"fair and\nreasonable.\" No discussion of the choices appeared; nor was the variation\nbetween the first, second, and third preceding years explained\u2014or even recog-\nnized. Only one point was clear about the Power Commission's behavior:\nno attention was paid to the revenue effects of price decisions.\n\nSumming up the available evidence, we see that public utility regulation\nfocuses on cost conditions and neglects demand behavior. Commissions often\nmake references to demand changes, but seldom take account of them as\n\n5'The FCC remembered some contrary observations: when wage changes were considered\nduring the preceding year, the officers of Western Union testified that increases in rates\nwere certain to reduce total revenue.

I do not state that the cessation of business capital formation *prob-\nably resulted from a cessation of saving.\" Instead, I first suggest it as a possi-\nble cause to be explored and then proceed to demonstrate, in section 2 (p. 25),\nthat there was no cessation nor even a radical diminution in individual savings;\nI also show that more than half of the great business dissaving in these eight\nyears, 1931 to 1938, appears to have been made up in the three years, 1939\nto 1941.\n\n3. I do not argue that \"there must be money saving in order that there be\nreal saving.\" Instead, my argument is exclusively in \"real\" terms (see my\nnote 10). Mr. Carter says, *Real saving is identical with net capital forma-\ntion.\" In the aggregate, yes; at the several levels, no. (This is clearly shown\nby my Table VI.) The whole point is that the source and channeling of real\nsavings changed, so that there was no net business real capital formation for\nthe whole period.\n\nPossibly these misunderstandings were not general. But I do not want Mr.\nCarter's remarks on *under-utilization\" to pass uncontested, as I have\nthe impression that this little \"alibi\" is a currently popular one in many\nquarters.\n\nThat there was a period during the early 'thirties when there was under-\nutilization of all resources, capital and labor alike, no one doubts. But Mr.\nCarter's own figures show that, by 1936, his rate of utilization of capital had\nreturned to the level which he states was normal from 1923 to 1929, and that,\nby the early 1940's, it had become higher than ever before. How does he\nreconcile these figures with the supposition that there was under-utilization,\nif he is considering the period I considered\u2014that is, 1930 to 1943 or even\n1945?\n\nHowever, Mr. Carter's figures are not really to the point. The thesis of\nunder-utilization, in connection with the flow of goods to consumers or even\nthe net national product, can only be conceived to apply to the real capital\nused in producing such product. That confines it to business real capital.\nMoreover, the concept is only applicable to business real capital in the form\nof plant (improvements) and equipment. Professor Kuznet gives us estimates\nof these items for 1919 and 1939, and a fair basis for a guess as to 1929.!\n\n\"The figure for business plant and equipment as of Jan. 1, 1919, is the sum of lines\n1, 2, 3, 4a and 18 in Table IV 7, National Product since 1869, Simon Kuznets (New York,\nNat. Bur. of Econ. Research, 1946), The estimate for Jan. 1, 1939, is the sum of these\nitems plus additions for the years 1919 to 1938, inclusive, shown in lines 1, 2, 3 and 14\nof Tables IV, 89 (ibid.). The guess as to the same items for Jan. 1, 1929 is made as follows:\nThe increase in aggregate improvements and equipment which occurred from Jan. 1, 1919\nto Jan. 1, 1939 is shown by deducting line 10, col. 5, from line 12, col. 5 in Table IV 11.\nThe increase from Jan. 1, 1919 to Jan. 1, 1929, derived by deducting line 10, col. 5 from\nline 11, col. 5, same table, is about 85 per cent of this amount, Applying this percentage\nto the difference between 98.495 and 118.452, the foregoing items of business improvements\nand equipment only, gives 115.458 for Jan. 1, 1929. This may understate the 1929 figures.\nIf so, the index of utilization was then lower than 1/1.51 or 1/1.33, and the increase in\nthe index from 1929 to 1939 was greater than shown below.\n",

Indeed,\nProfessor Slichter claimed that cutting tax rates during the inflation\nin 1948 would be harmless if accompanied by his proposal.\n\nThe plan is to permit the taxpayer to exclude his saving, or some\nfraction thereof, from his taxable income. Saving would be a *deduc-\ntion,\" like charitable contributions or medical expenses. From the in-\ndividual taxpayer's viewpoint, the plan is equivalent to replacing part\nor all of the income tax by a tax on his consumption expenditures.?\n\n1$.

Introduction\n\nEconomists concerned with international trade problems have been\ndivided as to the advisability of the use of discrimination in the admin-\nistration of quantitative restrictions! in the present period, a period in\nwhich the structure of trade is disrupted, partly because of the destruc-\ntion which accompanied World War II and partly reflecting tendencies\nwhich had their roots in earlier periods. The discussions of discrimina-\ntion which took place at the London, Geneva, and Havana meetings of\nthe International Trade Organization apparently reflected this division\nof opinion.* The hostility of many economists toward discrimination un-\ndoubtedly stems from experiences of the 1930's when it was used by\nGermany, for example, to exploit the nations in its economic sphere. In\naddition, American economists can hardly fail to be influenced in their\nthinking by the fact that at present U. S. commercial interests consti-\ntute one of the principal targets of discrimination. On the other hand,\nmany economists, particularly those from Western Europe, feel that the\noutlawing of discrimination would lower the level of, and benefits from,\ntrade unnecessarily for many years to come.\n\nThe Havana Charter reflects a compromise between these views\u2014\nwhat might be considered a grudging sanction of the use of discrimina-\ntion by those nations having balance of payments difficulties.

More and\nmore countries, however, are achieving stabilization regardless of\nwhether they have been suffering from the \"open\" or the *repressed\"\nvariety of inflation and also regardless of the kinds and the degree of\ncontrol under which their economies have been functioning.\n\nIncentives to invest have been particularly strong in all war devas-\ntated countries not only because of the large backlogs of consumer de-\nmand and the need for re-equipment in capital goods, but because\nrelatively small amounts of investment (repairs of houses, railroads,\nreplacement of damaged or outworn machinery) were sure to yield an\nexceptionally quick and high return. Once this abnormal demand for in-\nvestment comes to an end, a rather severe readjustment may be ex-\npected. This type of readjustment did take place in 1947-48 in Italy\nwhere the completion of the most urgent repairs coincided with restric-\ntionist monetary policies which killed the speculative, inflation-induced\ntype of investment. The other marked instance of a postwar recession\nis Belgium where war destruction had not been important and where\nthe government followed a policy of giving primary attention to the\nfilling of consumers! needs.\n\nSpotty evidence of slackening consumer buying has been available\nin most Western European countries over the past months.

I wish to speak of issues, not of\npersonalities. No one need begrudge Mr. Gordon his little exercise in sel\u00edf-\nexpression, at least no one about to indulge in the same sport.

However, it is weightier matters that I really wish to notice.\n\nMr. Gordon starts off by still insisting that the Ward volume is *on balance\na good book,\" in opposition to Graham's characterization as *subtly dangerous\nand subversive.\" I shall not argue that it is not a **good book.\" There are many\nways in which a book may be good, and several of these goodnesses are en-\ntirely consistent with being dangerous, and subversive of the values on which\n",

In other words, the peak in money supply\nrelative to trend comes first, then the peak in prices, and lastly the\npeak of the business cycle.

A number of books have\nbeen published (particularly by the former Institute of World Economy and World\nPolitics), and hardly a journal issue comes out without at least one article devoted\nto economic conditions and economic thinking in the United States. A study of these\nwritings offers the American economist the unique pleasure of seeing himself\nand his environment in a peculiar mirror, thouch the images, to put it mildly, may\noften cause surprise; it also gives him valuable information both for the under-\nstanding of the Soviet Union and for the understanding of himself.\n\n\"The article translated here appeared in the Tuly-August (No. 4) 1947 issue of the\nSoviet journal Planned Economy (Planovoye Khozyaystvo), which is published\nbi-monthly by the State Planning Commission (Gosplan). It was selected for trans-\nlation because of its interest: in a rather short space, the author covers some of\nthe most important ideas discussed in Western economic literature in the works of\nSchumpeter, Hansen, Keynes, Ezekiel and others. The interpretation of these\nideas by a Soviet economist is most instructive. But I hope the reader will avoid\nthe error so often made by Soviet economists in regard to our own literature, that\nis, of treating this article as \u00a3Ae official pronouncement on the subjects covered.\nThough the range of economic opinion in the Soviet Union is much more narrow\nthan in the United States, differences as witnessed by sharp debates (such as the\nVarga discussion) do exist. Mr. Ayzenshtadt's essay is not unrepresentative, though\npossibly it is more imaginative than the average. Vet I earnestly hope that the\nreader will abstain from generalizing too readily about Soviet economic literature\non the basis of this one paper. Translations of Soviet economic works are beginning\nto appear; perhaps this article will be followed by others. There will be plenty of\ntime for generalizations.\n\nA few remarks about Soviet economic periodicals may help to set this paper in its\nproper perspective. The so-called professional journals in this country are essen-\ntially written by economists for economists. The Soviet economic periodicals, on the\nother hand, concentrate not so much on the development of economic science as\nsuch, but rather on the interpretation, with a definite political objective, of eco-\nnomic and statistical information for a more general audience. In his interpretation\nof economic facts and ideas, the Soviet economist is not supposed to treat his ma-\nterial with impartiality and objectivity; the latter word has acquired an invective\nmeaning in the Soviet Union. His r\u00f3le is that of an intellectual crusader, actively\nengaged in the building of socialism at home and in combating its opponents (\"un-\nveiling\" is the favorite term) abroad.

                    "Final Comment\n\nMy difference with Professor Friedman is not based upon the belief that\nall fiscal and monetary policy should be discretionary, that \"authority\" is to\nbe preferred over \"rule\" in every instance. Indeed it would be as impossible\nto establish a monetary and fiscal system completely devoid of \"rules\" as to\nprovide ironclad guarantees against any future discretionary action. I feel\nrather that some discretionary action will be required, particularly in view of\nprice rigidities and volatile expectations. Friedman, in his rejoinder, considers\nthe central feature of his proposal to be the fact that *it dispenses as much as\npossible with discretionary action and relies almost (my italics) solely on\nautomatic reactions.\" Thus both of us apparently believe that discretionary\naction will have a significant r\u00f3le to play, in spite of the virtues of a logical\nfiscal and monetary system. .\n\nThe supplementary discretionary policies called for by the failure of the\neconomy automatically to right itself are several. Friedman himself (pp.\n253-54) describes deflationary conditions which monetary inflation would\ncorrect, while the contribution which may be expected from a discretionary\ngovernment investment program has been the subject of extensive literature\nover the last decade and a half. It is possible that Friedman and I would dis-\nagree on what particular action would be appropriate to given circumstances\nbut his suggestion in the rejoinder, *that to be successful the authority must\ntake action largely counter to that being taken by the rest of the community,\"\nleads me to believe that even on this we would not be far apart.\n\nFriedman and I agree that price rigidities and lags complicate counter\ncycle policies, but disagree with respect to their significance. I hold that\nwhenever price rigidities defeat automatic adjustments, whether these adjust-\nments be those resulting from Friedman's proposal or those that are now\ninherent in the system, discretionary action can provide some contribution to\nfuller employment. That lags will reduce the effciency of either automatic\nor discretionary action is quite clear, but Friedman's belief that his proposal\nminimizes lags is not convincing. Surely the change in variables that brings his\n\"'correctives\" into operation could be relied upon as a guide for policy.\n\nIn my earlier reply to Friedman's article I failed to comment on his cor-\nrectives (1) and (3) because they already operate in our system, and al-\nthough I appraise their strength somewhat less than some economists, I wel-\n",

He points out that its creation also answered the need for\nopening credit accounts to businessmen without permitting them to repay\nthese advances by a currency which had lost a great deal of its purchasing\npower between the time of the loan and the time of repayment.\n\nI was quite aware of this use of the tax-peng\u00f3, but some of my sources\nindicated that its creation was entirely empirical and had not originally had\nthis purpose. I therefore acknowledge Professor Varga's interpretation.\n\nAs to the figures which I mentioned in connection with the depreciation\nof the peng\u00f3, I calculated them exactly on the basis of the data which were\navailable to me. Professor Varga explains that the depreciated peng\u00f3 of 1938\nwas equal to 2.29 forint and not to 2.07 forint, the figure which I used.\nAgain, I defer to his views.

But it should\nbe an informed choice, a choice by an electorate that understands the alterna-\ntives, and is not misled by rosy delusions that we can get \"plenty,\" now,\nmerely by redistribution.\n\nOnly one technical point needs mentioning. Dr. Ackley seems to feel that\nunder azy circumstances raising the market rate of interest will \"reduce\ninvestment.\" This is a widespread misconception of Keynesian theory. In-\nflationary \"forced saving\" is, of course, one way\u2014possibly the characteristi-\ncally socialist way (vide Russia)\u2014of getting capital formation. But I assume\nwe are agreed that this method is bad. Accordingly, we desire only invest-\nment without inflation. Now ex ante investment in excess of ex ante saving\nwil tend to produce inflation. Raising the rate to an equilibrium figure,\nunder such circumstances, will not reduce the amount of realized noninfla-\ntionary investment. It will only cut off the margin of attempted investment\n\"causing\" the inflation! If we want more investment, without more inflation,\nthen we want to increase the rate of ex ante saving\u2014which is the point I\nstarted off with. The appropriate interest rate then would be the one rationing\nthe increased flow without inflation.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to remind my readers that my communica-\ntion referred to the secular problem. Dr. Ackley quotes my \"Future of\nKeynesian Economics.\"* I stand by that article in full. If serious depression\nbegins, deficit finance and public works should, in my opinion, be integral\nparts of an effective program. This, however, does not a\u00edfect secular policy.\nIf private saving-investment would be needed again soon (and they will\nbe if we adopt intelligent policy), we would be very foolish to liquidate the\ninducement to save for the sake of a short-run crisis.\n\nDavr\u00bb McConp WnicHT\n",

                    "Inflation and Equality: Rejoinder\n\nProfessor Ackley impliedly concedes the basic factual assumption of my\npaper: the marginal propensity to save of the well-to-do is greater than that\nof the lower-income groups. He also (end of his sixth paragraph) spells out\ncorrectly my fundamental contention and concedes its logical validity. I did\nmean that the flow of net private investment ought to be (secularly) higher,\nand I do feel that the present aggregate net private (secular) inducement\nto invest, still more particularly that for risk-taking new ventures, under our\npresent tax-wage-price control outlook, is only adequate where the (propor-\ntional) secular level of consumption is very high\u2014too high.\n\nBlaming the inflation on \"excessive investment\" alone seems to me true,\neven formally, only as tautology. The real stimulus can come from the\nconsumption side. We might put the matter as follows: the people have\nbecome accustomed to demanding a certain rate of increase of real income.\nPrice control and restriction of investment might, for a time, halt inflationary\nprice rise. But real income might not be rising sufficiently. Therefore, there\nmight be demands for \"fourth-Cround\" money wages increases, etc., which\ncould start the inflation going again. Sometimes eliminating all saving-invest-\nment might not suffice to meet the demand for present consumption.\n\nSince Dr. Ackley concedes my basic point, the real question becomes, as\nhe says, one of values.! For brevity's sake I must discuss his main point only.\nDo not Dr. Ackley's doubts as to whether there is a \"welfare case\" for a\nhigher rate of investment imply a sort of \"iron law of consumer satisfaction\"?\nOf course he does not commit himself to such a position, but would not the\nlogic lead to some such statement as \"all income levels are about equally\nsatisfying (or unsatisfying). Progress is a delusion.\"\n\nNow, if the public agreed, there would be no more to be said. But I believe\nin (1) democracy and (2) our duty as economists to help the people toward\nan informed choice. I say to the lower-income groups, *Vou want a rapidly\nrising standard of living. To get it more capital is needed, to get more\ncapital we need more investment. Some moderation in your demands for\nequality today will give you more goods tomorrow\u2014without inflation\"?\n\nIt is important to realize that Dr. Ackley does z0\u00a3 dispute the correctness\nof this argument under the circumstances assumed. What seems tentatively\nsuggested is some such reply as this: No, no, people of America, you will\nbe just as unhappy no matter what your national income is. Equal distribu-\ntion will give us enough' goods. Forget about growth.\"\n\nI see nothing mysterious about the way to settle this argument\u2014demo-\ncratically. Leave it to the people through their representatives to make the\n\n! For detailed statement of my values see Democracy and Progress (New York, 1948),\nespecially the chapter on redistribution. Dr. Ackley is not correct in saying I argue for\n\"inequality\" I argue for as much equality of opportunity as we can get. Perhaps it\nmight be best to say I argue for a balance of equalities, none of which can be wholly\nrealized.\n\n? Regarding the cycle, I have also shown, in Economics of Disturbance (New York,\n1947), that there is a more or less insoluble conflict between demands for Prompt satisfac-\ntion and demands for perfect stability.\n",

The\nabsence of these assumed conditions, which were never fully realized,\nhas made it necessary to consider states of international disequilibrium\nwith respect to which corrective price adjustments are either prevented\nfrom taking place or would prove to be inadequate if they did take\nplace.\n\nAny attempt to classify disequilibrium as to types is dangerous\nbecause in any given disequilibrium situation more than one causal\nfactor is almost invariably present. It may, however, be useful for pur-\nposes of analysis to differentiate between three types of disequilibrium\nsituations: (1) those arising from disparities between internal and ex-\nternal prices and costs; (2) those arising from relative changes in the\nlevels of national income at home and abroad; and (3) structural dis-\nequilibrium resulting from shifts in demand and supply conditions in\ninternationally traded commodities or from changes in the invisible\nitems in the balance of payments, which have not been brought about\nby changes in the relative levels of prices or incomes at home and\nabroad.\n\nIt will readily be admitted that any concrete situation may con-\ntain elements of more than one type of disequilibrium. Changes in\nrelative levels of income in different countries are accompanied by\nrelative price movements, while shifts in the structure of production\nand trade affect both prices and incomes. It is also difficult to determine\nwhich factors are causal in any given disequilibrium situation, in the\nsense that an appropriate adjustment of these factors would effect a\ncure. It may, for example, be found that relative movements in in-\nternal prices and costs have taken place but the removal of the dis-\nparities may have little effect on the trade balance because of the nature\nof demand and supply elasticities.

On the aggregate level saving, defined as\nthe difference between personal income and consumer expenditures,\nwas usually expressed by one magnitude, either in billion dollars or in\nper cents of income. It was assumed that the most important variable\ndetermining both the amounts saved and the proportions of income\nsaved is the given income level. Numerous investigations confirmed\nthat years of high personal income were characterized by high saving\nand years of low income by low saving, occasionally even by net dis-\nsaving. According to the most recent estimates of the Commerce De-\npartment, consumer expenditures exceeded disposable personal income\nonly during the deepest depression, namely in 1932, 1933, and 1934.\n\nSimilar considerations were applied when the analysis was made on\nthe level of individual families. The results of expenditure surveys were\npresented in one continuum. Amounts saved were ranked from the\nlargest saver to the smallest saver, then to the \"zero saver\" (whose\nexpenditures equalled his income), then to the smallest dissaver, and\nfinally to the largest dissaver. It was sometimes assumed that the large\nsavers were, on the whole, the high-income people, and the dissavers,\nthe low-income people. The dissavers were considered the unfortunate\npeople who were unable to make ends meet and therefore were com-\npelled to reduce their assets (to consume part of their wealth) or to\nmortgage their future by borrowing. Not only aggregate and average\nsavings were assumed to increase with income, but it was also thought\nthat the higher the income, the larger will be the proportion of the\nsavers and the smaller the proportion of the dissavers.\n\nAre these assumptions generally valid or do we know of any excep-\ntions? More specifically: Is it always true that when income increases,\naverage rates of saving also increase and the proportions of dissavers\ndecrease?

In the case of open-market pur-\nchases, the increase in M, equals the total amount of money expended for\nthe purchase of the bonds; the increase in M, equals the increased value\nof assets (both of those bought and those not bought by the government)\ncaused by the open-market operations.

Union leaders, company officials,\nworkers in clothing plants, auto plants, print shops, workers in government,\nlawyers, university professors, students\u2014all looked upon him with respect and\nadmiration\u2014and many with deep affection. In the field of industrial relations\nMillis will probably go down in history as the person, of his time, with the\ngreatest number of friends and fewest enemies.\n",

He and his wife shared\nan interest in education, and sponsored one of the most fruitful of the\nexperiments that helped to break the education of the young out of the\nmolds of nineteenth-century custom. He joyed in the companionship of his\nchildren. In their New York home and at Huckleberry Rocks, in Vermont,\nthere was a healthy, wholesome family atmosphere. The children were partners\nof the parents in the life of the Mitchell household. At Huckleberry Rocks,\ntoo, there was a workshop to warm the heart of one who respected the arts\nof woodworking. Here Mitchell could indulge to the full his love of fine\ncraftsmanship.

Thus, though the workers in\neach sector are not at all displeased with how they are getting on\nthemselves, they are quite likely to disapprove of the manner in which\nthose in all the others go about their tasks, or even to deny that these\nother tasks are worth bothering about at all.

With this\ndebt amounting to more than $250 billion and comprising about 60\nper cent of all outstanding debt in the country, the foremost objective\nof our monetary policy has come to be *the maintenance of an orderly\nmarket in government securities\" and the prevention, or at least a\nlimitation, of the rise of yields on these securities, especially on the\nlong-term issues. Though the rise of this new objective has been the\nsubject of widespread discussion, the writer believes that its full im-\nplications are not generally appreciated. The purpose of this article,\ntherefore, is to trace the rise of this policy objective and to raise some\nquestions concerning its consequences.\n\nThe Evolution of the Policy before Pearl Harbor\n\nPrior to 1937 Federal Reserve purchases and sales of government\nsecurities were primarily for the purpose of influencing the volume of\nmember bank reserves and of member bank borrowings at the Reserve\nBanks. These were, of course, designed to affect interest rates, includ-\ning yields on governments, but the effects were expected to result mainly\nfrom changes in the ability and willingness of banks to lend and pur-\nchase securities. But in 1937, apparently for the first time as a major\npolicy objective, the Federal Reserve bought long-term governments\nfor the purpose of limiting their price decline. After reaching high\nlevels in late 1936, the prices of long-term governments and high-grade\ncorporate bonds began to fall early in 1937. This decline did not extend\nto Treasury bills and notes. The Reserve System thereupon initiated\nwhat it called its \"flexible portfolio policy,\" purchasing more than\n$200 million of the longer-term bonds and reducing its holdings of the\nshorter-term notes and bills by about $150 millions. The decline of\ngovernment bond prices was stopped and reversed.'

The glucose cases\ndealt with the first issue and explicitly reserved the second. The cement\ncase was argued mainly on the second issue.\n\nIn the issue of the non-base mill, the writer has reservations as to the\nlegal reasoning used to deal with it in the glucose cases, but agrees\nwith the probable economic result, assuming that reasonable latitude\nis afforded for differences between different mill or base prices, and\nfor competitive freight absorption. As to freight absorption, he dissents\n(as will appear) from the legal reasoning on which Mr. Justice Black\nchose to rest his interpretation of the Robinson-Patman Act in the\ncement case, and sees objections to the resulting situation. These in-\nclude not only serious uncertainty as to what the law requires, but\ninherent dif\u00fcculty of clarifying it in a way that would avoid dangers\nof unduly rigid interpretation and enforcement, bringing unforeseen\nconsequences, and likely to entail costs out of proportion to probable\nbenefits. Objections apply also to law-making power exercised by the\nFederal Trade Commission, without proper accountability for the\nrisky legal and economic doctrines it is free to employ.\n\n* The author's past connections with the basing point question (now all terminated)\ninclude participation in the NRA study of iron and steel basing point pricing. Subse-\nquently, he was engaged with Professor A. R. Burns to make an impartial report on the\npricing system in cement, final completion of which was forestalled by the Federal\nTrade Commission's complaint against the cement industry, after which he consulted\n\nwith counsel for the Cement Institute. He is aware of no present obstacles to his speak-\ning with complete freedom, as an unattached individual.\n\n'The reader should note that I speak of \"phantom freight\" only with reference to\nthat charged by a non-base mill at points that are nearer to it, freightwise, than they\nare to the base that governs the delivered price. \"Freight absorption,\" as here used,\nrefers to a base mill, reaching out to sell in areas where the delivered price is governed\nby another base; and the first mill must accept a mill net less than its own base\nprice in order to sell there. So used, the terms have unambiguous meaning. As some-\ntimes used, the distinction becomes clouded, because base prices at different bases may\nor may not be equal, and a non-base mill may or may not be regarded as the limiting\ncase of a base mill with a base price so high as to be inoperative.\n"

On the other hand, Leontief rather more candidly writes in\ngeneral appraisal of Keynes: 'He seemed to press, however, for reconstruction\nof the whole foundation in order to mend a leaky roof\" (p. 242).\n\nFurthermore, even so far as concerns the impulse to new ideas, one has to\nconsider the contributions made by Keynes! contemporaries, pre-eminently\nD.

The five experts (John\nMaurice Clark and Arthur Smithies of the United States, Nicholas Kaldor\nof England, Pierre Uri of France, and E.

The fact that the\neconomic weather has once more turned about does not detract from the\nscientific merits of the report.\n\nThe resolute procedure of the authors naturally has imposed limitations\nand simplifications, all the more so because they were working under great\npressure of time.

The second is the unemployment arising from\nnormal labor turnover, seasonal conditions, declines in particular industries,\nand technological changes, in so far as such unemployment cannot be reduced\nby a high level of effective demand.

                    "Secretary Acheson and Economic Cooperation Administrator Hoffman have\nsuggested that producers who may suffer from increased imports, caused by\nfurther reductions in the American tariff, might be compensated in some way\nby the government. The suggestion was incidental to their effective presenta-\ntion of the case for larger imports. But, in itself, it raises questions\u2014eco-\nnomic, ethical, political, and administrative\u2014that merit critical examination.\n\nAs a matter of economics, the proposal has much to commend it. If assur-\nance of compensation for possible losses would serve, in fact, to quiet opposi-\ntion to economic reform, it should justify itself by facilitating adaptation to\nchanges in the conditions of supply and demand, improving the allocation of\nresources, and raising planes of living. The cost of such a program should\nbe far less than that of protecting investors and workers by freezing the pat-\ntern of production and checking the shift of resources into occupations where\nthey could be more effectively employed.\n\nThe principle of compensating those who may incidentally be harmed by\naction taken in the general interest appeals, likewise, to the sense of justice.\nBut it should be noted that this principle has rarely been applied in practice.\nVarious payments have been made to veterans on the ground that time spent\nin military service has impaired their relative position in civilian life. But\nthis would appear to be the only case that is analogous. The government did\nnot compensate the slave owners when it abolished slavery or the owners of\nbreweries and distilleries when it imposed prohibition. Nor has it undertaken\nto indemnify the owners of previously unregulated enterprises when it has\ninstituted new controls.\n\nWorkers and investors in a free economy are constantly suffering losses of\nemployment and income as a result of economic change. The textile industry\nmigrates from New England to the south; coal loses its market to fuel oil,\nand ice to the mechanical refrigerator; railroads lose business to trucks,\nnatural fibers to synthetics, lumber to metals, and metals to plastics; real in-\ncome is shifted, in wholesale quantities, between debtors and creditors when-\never the general level of prices rises or falls. In none of these cases is com-\npensation offered or proposed.\n\nCompared with the adjustments that are continually being necessitated\nby public policy and by economic change, those that would be involved in any\nlikely reduction of the American tariff should be relatively insignificant. It\nmay be asked, therefore, why this one case of adjustment should be singled\nout for preferred treatment, particularly since it has never been suggested\nthat consumers of imported goods or producers of goods for export should be\nindemnified when the tariff is raised.\n",

But the U.N. plan would start with the fixing of investment targets by\nthe lending countries themselves. Those countries would be asked to make\nthe necessary legislative and institutional arrangements to enable them to\nstabilize the total flow of lending at the planned level.\n\nOne may note a progression in principle from the Marshall Plan to the\nproposal of the U.N. experts and now to the plan suggested by Clark. In\nthe Marshall Plan, the citizens of the United States, through Congress, de-\ncided on substantial capital exports to Europe. The decisions, however, were\nmade for one year at a time; each year our ability to contribute and Europe's\nneed of further contributions were to be reviewed. Under the U.N. experts?\nproposal, a capital-exporting country would determine (and announce) a pro-\nposed level of capital exports for several years in advance. This would have\nobvious advantages in giving other countries a basis on which to plan, but it\nwould also be open to objections, including the objection that it would\ngreatly reduce other countries! incentives to take those steps which might\notherwise be needed to attract funds.

In\nthe Marshall Plan, the citizens of the United States, through Congress, de-\ncided on substantial capital exports to Europe.

What\nthe underscored *as such\" is supposed to mean I do not know, but I do know\nthat, even assuming Marx was sloppy in his usage, anyone who cannot bear in\nmind the definitions involved in his model should at least refrain from discuss-\ning it in print.\n\nDomar goes on to assert that Marx's scheme implies \"that fixed capital does\nnot exist.\" Again, I must dissent. Fixed capital does not enter into the re-\nproduction scheme, but it exists and Marx specifically discussed it in con-\nnection with his presentation of the scheme.? It is true that for purposes of\nsimplifying the exposition, I assumed no fixed capital in my book T7e\nTheory of Capitalist Development; and it is also true that I did not\ngo into the problem of varying turnover times.

As illustra-\ntive evidence, Professor Bach draws upon certain disagreements that have\narisen between the Board of Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents\n(particularly the president of the New York Bank) over the past decade.\nAlthough his analysis has no doubt benefited from his experience as a member\nof the staff of the Board of Governors from 1941 to 1944, Professor Bach\nhas based his discussion on the public statements of the Board and the Bank\npresidents. The record he cites does not support his conclusions nor provide\na basis for his recommendation that the Reserve Banks should be denied\nvoting participation in future Federal Reserve policy formation.?\n\n* The Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy Formation,\" Am.

Professor Bach indicates that his paper represents primarily\na brief summary of one part of a larger study which he prepared in 1948 for the Hoover Com-\nmission.\n\nProfessor Bach recommends (p. 1190) that the Federal Open Market Committee be\nabolished and that responsibility for all policy formation be vested in the Board of Governors,\nlargely because Monetary policy must be national and public in character; it has no room\nfor regionalism or for special interests.\"\n",

The plausibility of this case is neither more nor less than the\nplausibility of the initial values Mr. Patinkin has chosen.\n\nIn a personal letter Mr. Patinkin has pointed out an error in my analysis.\nIf the P\" curve be given (for example) an ogive shape in both the N.E. and\nthe S.W. quadrant, while the U line be of such shape that it intersects the\nP' curve once stably in each of those quadrants, perpetual oscillation may\noccur, of an amplitude depending on where the points of tangency occur.\nThis possibility\u2014which I had denied\u2014I find especially interesting since it\nrepresents an \"anticipation cycle\" distantly akin to the acceleration cycles\ndiscovered by Professors Samuelson and Metzler.\n\nA final point seems worth emphasizing.

                    "hypotheses, as Mr. Klein carefully indicates. His reference to a Cobb-Douglas\nproduction function suggests that he is referring to wage variability with\nconstant prices, as does his formulation of the labor supply equation (4).\nMy formulation considered variation in all prices, including wage rates, and\nconsidered only the implications of the assumed correlation between con-\nsumption and the real value of money assets at any level of income, and\nthe anticipation effect on investment (and consumption, too, unless we\nclassify postponable consumption as investment for this purpose) of the\nrate of change of prices. Whether wage rates would be in fixed proportion\nto other prices throughout the process, or might vary in relation to other\nprices with variation in the level of employment, is a question which was\nomitted in my paper and which would, of course, have to be considered in a\nfuller treatment.\n\nMr. Klein raises several questions about the origin of my unemployment\nfunction; the crucial one is the question of how the height of the savings\nfunction may depend on the absolute price level. This relationship is rather\nextensively explored by Mr. Patinkin in his original article.?\n\nTurning to Mr. Patinkin's paper, I find myself in agreement with his main\npoint; new variables or higher order derivatives can lead to instability. What\nI find interesting is that they can lead either to instability or to stability.\n\nI did not mean, on page 913, to assume that the price level effect would\nultimately dominate the anticipation effect, as Mr. Patinkin suggests in his\nfootnote 1, but only to suggest what would be found crucial in the analysis\nto follow. As remarked above, both possibilities\u2014of stability and of in-\nstability\u2014 were indicated in my paper; my diagrams corresponded to the\nstable case in order that they might illustrate the possibility I had found\ninteresting and in order that the result might be determinate.\n\n'fhe interesting possibility described in Mr. Patinkin's final paragraph, I\nfind perfectly valid. Although he has injected a large enough anticipation\neffect to make the functions unstable in the neighborhood of the north-east\nintersection, he has started off the process from a situation in which there\nis initially a large /evel effect; alternatively, we may say that he has given\nthe large anticipation effect a relatively small initial rate of price decline\nto work on. As long as he pivots his U line about the point of intersection,\nthe flatter he makes the line the farther to the left of zero does it intersect\nthe horizontal axis. Dividing the initial rate of price decline by the slope of\nthe U function gives us the effect of anticipation, and by his construction he\nhas made this value less than the distance from X; to the value of U(P1,0).\nHe has thus rigged the curves and starting points so that the expansionary\neffect of the low price level outweighs the depressing effect obtained by com-\npounding a large anticipation coefficient with a relatively small initial rate\nof price decline. If he begins to the right of the intersection he describes, he\nis on the opposite side of an unstable intersection and U rises (outward, to\nthe right) instead. Thus his result is only one of those things that may happen\nwhen initial values are far away from a stable intersection, or when there is\n\n*Don Patinkin, *Price Flexibility and Full Employment,\" 4m.

The anticipation effect makes $ negative,\nso that &,a, is positive; this product must then be less than -- 1 for stability.\nWriting this condition as \u20142; \u00ab 1/\u2014 6, makes it clear that, as I indicated\non page 917, the slope of the U function must be greater than that of the\nP\" function at the intersection in order that the equations be stable and the\ncourse of the moving intersection be relevant to analysis.\n\nMr. Klein's system, however, since it does not discriminate between stable\nand unstable solutions, shows steady divergence along the moving intersection\nof the two functions when \u00ab,& exceeds --1; when c\u00e0, exceeds --1, how-\never, the two functions are dynamically incompatible, and the path traced\nby the variables does not correspond to that moving intersection.\n\nBecause his system ignores the stability question, and assumes the satis-\nfaction of the two relationships, Mr. Klein can state that he does not alleviate\nunemployment by first aggravating it (first new paragraph after his equation\n9). The reason for his system's failure to show the aggravation is, of course,\nthat his system of analysis only picks up the process a\u00edter the aggravation\nhas occurred; the aggravation occurs while the unemployment function is\nunsatisied, and Mr. Klein's system only shows what happens when it is\nsatisfied.\n\nRegarding the nature of the two functions, Mr. Klein's equation (5) and\nmy U -\u2014 U(P,P/) function, they seem to be derived from totally different\n",

A rereading of the original article will reveal that the entire attack\nwhich Mr. Kreps feels I have unjustly made on the Reserve Bank presidents\nconsists of the one mild text sentence he quotes first, plus a footnote, which\nhe also quotes in three parts without indication of its footnote status.\nSince I neither made nor intend an attack on the integrity of the Reserve\nBank presidents, and since I have properly been asked to hold this note\nto a page or two, there is no point in attempting a detailed reexamination of\nthe public statements of President Allen Sproul and Governor Marriner\nEccles, selections from which Mr. Kreps primarily cites. Instead, it may be\nmost helpful to state briefly what seem to me to be the main issues involved in\nReserve Bank participation in national monetary policy-making, and to place\nthese issues, and Mr. Kreps' comments, in their over-all setting. I hope that\nthis may also throw some light on the confusion that appears to exist in the\ncontradictory conclusions reached by Mr. Kreps and myself.\n\n1. The original article suggests three major reasons why, on the basis of\nmy study, it would appear desirable to unify responsibility and power for Fed-\neral Reserve monetary policy-making in a single, smaller Board of Governors\u2014\nin contrast to the present unrealistically divided and elaborate statutory\nallocation of power and responsibility between the Board of Governors and\nOpen Market, Committee. One reason is that here, as in other regulatory com-\nmissions, there seems to be no reason why the regulated \"industry\" should\nhave a direct vote in choosing the regulating commissioners. Another is that\nmajor participation in governmental monetary-fiscal policy-making for the\nFederal Reserve can, realistically, come only with a very small policy-making\nBoard, or single head, for the System.

                    "proposal of the Board of Governors. This proposal, as noted above, had its\ngenesis in studies carried on in 1940 at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew Vork.? The same administrative impracticability which marred the\nScheme in 1940 as a device for reducing excess reserves to manageable\nproportions still ruled it out, in the minds of many, when it was later offered\nby the Board of Governors as a method of restraining inflation.\n\nYet Professor Bach attributes President Sproul's opposition to concern\nover private bank earnings and maintenance of \"normal money market pro-\ncedures,\" while at the same time awarding to Chairman Eccles and other\nproponents of the measure an accolade for a higher evaluation of the public\nadvantage. Professor Bach states that the Board sought additional reserve\nrequirement powers in order to take \"active steps\" against inflation, while\nPresident Sproul *doubted the need for further action in the credit field.\"\n\"This is a misstatement. The doubts which President Sproul expressed con-\ncerned, not the need for further action, but the need for legislation conferring\nadditional credit control powers on the Federal Reserve System beyond those\nalready possessed.\" There is no evidence that concern for the maintenance\nof private bank earnings was an important factor in the determination of\nPresident Sproul's views on legislation concerning either primary or secondary\nreserve requirements. Nor was he influenced merely by a fear of disrupting\n\"normal money market procedures\"? His opposition to special reserve\nrequirements, and his argument that *. . . constantly seeking their imposition\ndoes run a risk of seriously interfering with our present program,\"'? were\nclearly based on the belief that increases in reserve requirements were not\nthen, and by their very nature could not be, a satisfactory substitute for a\npositive open market policy in controlling the availability of credit.'*\n\n\"The Federal Reserve Bank of New Vork, however, did not publicly endorse these\nstudies. They were directed by Dr. Lawrence H. Seltzer. See his articles, \"The Problem of Our\nExcessive Banking Reserves,\" Jour. Am. Statistical Assoc., Vol. 35 (1940), pp. 24-36; and\n\"The Changed Environment of Monetary-Banking Policy,\" Am. Econ. Rev., Vol. XXXVI,\nNo. 2 (May, 1946), pp. 65-79.\n\n\"The reasons for President Sproul's doubts are clearly evident in his testimony before the\nJoint Congressional Committee on the Economic Report in 1948. They were in essence (a) a\nstrong conviction that the System had not yet utilized its existing powers (i.e., for restrain-\ning credit availability through open market operations and rising rates of interest) to control\ninflation with maximum effectiveness, and should do so before seeking additional powers\n(Credit Policies, Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Economic Report, 80th Con-\ngress, 2nd Sess. [Washingtcn, U. S. Government Printing Office, 1948], p. 93) ; and (b) a\nconclusion that the additional powers sought could not achieve an effective control over the\nmonetary factors contributing to inflation, but would in fact merely divert attention from\nthe fundamental need for a general tightening of credit availabilities (ibid., pp. 96-97).\n\n\" President Sproul did state that imposition of large additional reserve requirements\u2014\neither primary or special\u2014could not help but be upsetting to the securities market, as\ndeficient banks adjusted their position to meet the new requirements\" (idem.). But will\nProfessor Bach deny that this is true, or that it should quite properly have been considered\nin reaching a conclusion on the wisdom of the proposed action?\n\n\" Credit Policies, p. 96.\n\n\"This is a view which President Sproul has often expressed.

Certainly any\nskepticism over revival of the security-reserve proposal in wartime, if that\nwas ever seriously suggested, could not be identified, ?rima facie, with a\nlack of appreciation for the public interest. It is not necessarily contrary to\nthe public interest to oppose a scheme (however well intended) on the\ngrounds that it is unworkable.\n\nNor does the public record substantiate Professor Bach's second example,\nwith respect to postwar \"Board proposals to tighten up sharply on interest\nrates.\" The Board's 1945 Annual Report stated explicitly that The Board\ndoes not favor a higher level of interest rates than the Government is now\npaying. If we follow Professor Bach in taking the views of President\nSproul of the New York Bank as representative of the Reserve Bank presi-\ndents, and use the views of Chairman Eccles to represent those of the Board,\nthen the positions seem to be just the reverse of those described by Professor\nBach. As late as October 24, 1946, Chairman Eccles was opposing *an in-\ncrease in interest rates at this time,\"? while on December 6, 1946, Mr. Sproul\nbroke a long silence to make his first controversial public address of the\npostwar period, declaring that **. . . we should look forward to restoring some\nflexibility to the interest rate structure.\" Furthermore, at the peak of the\npostwar inflation, on August 3, 1948, Governor Eccles was still stating that\na rise in the short-term rate was minor in so far as its monetary effect was\nconcerned.' On the same day, however, President Sproul asserted that an\nincrease in short rates would be desirable because, by narrowing the spread\nbetween short- and long-term rates, it would induce the banks to stay in\nshort-term government securities and would introduce and maintain a\nsalutary element of doubt and uncertainty as to the future course of rates.*\nIt appears, therefore, that, contrary to Professor Bach's statement, 0 one\nproposed to raise rates siarply, and that the idea of pursuing an effective\npolicy of restraint involving moderate increases in short rates originated with\nReserve Bank presidents, and was originally advocated by them (notably by\nPresident Sproul) in the face of outright Board opposition.?\n\nProfessor Bach's third \"example\" relates to the postwar special reserve\n\n'!

                    "Specifically, with respect to the controversy over the kind of credit policy\nappropriate to restrain war and postwar inflation, Professor Bach states:\n\n'The presidents, often led by the president of the New York Bank, have often\nbeen more inclined to favor cautious, mild policies that would be less disruptive\nto the normal courses of banking and the money markets than have the Board\nmembers.\n\n. it is only natural that the Reserve Bank presidents, whose daily work\nthrows them in intimate contact with the commercial banks of their districts,\nshould sense and appreciate fully the problems faced by the bankers. The Board\nmembers, on the other hand, are further removed from the private banking\ncommunity and are apt to evaluate higher the possible \"public\" advantage\n(for instance, checking inflation) even at the cost of reducing private bank\nearnings or disrupting normal money market procedures (pp. 1176-77).\n\nIn support of his argument, Professor Bach adduces three instances when\nReserve Bank presidents lost sight of the public interest because of a\n*natural\" concern over the local impact of the measures under consideration:\n\n. at various points during the war when the possibility of raising reserve\nrequirements was considered; following the war when Board proposals to\ntighten up sharply on interest rates were under discussion; and when the\nBoard recently proposed that additional special statutory reserve requirements\n.. . be imposed on member banks to check loan expansion . . . (p. 1177).\n\nHe amplifies the third of these examples (the special reserve plan) by\ncontrasting the testimony of President Sproul, of the New York Reserve\nBank, and Board Chairman Eccles, before the Joint Congressional Committee\non the Economic Report in 1947-48. On that occasion, according to Professor\nBach:\n\nThe Board sought added reserve requirement powers to take active steps\nagainst inflation through checking bank credit expansion, while Mr. Sproul\ndoubted the need for further action in the credit field and specifically opposed\nthe vigorous, \"clumsy\" method of raising bank reserve requirements if any\naction were to be taken, favoring instead a more tentative, less \"disruptive\"\napproach (p. 1177).\n\nExamination of these three *examples\" yields no support for the inference\nwhich Professor Bach has drawn from them. As to the first, there is no pub-\nlished indication that increases in customary reserve requirements were con-\nsidered at any time while this country was at war.? There are, moreover, no\napparent reasons why primary reserve requirements should have been in-\ncreased during that period. Perhaps Professor Bach meant to suggest some-\nthing different, such as an impounding of bank-held government securities\ninto a new type of \"reserve\" with the object of limiting the banks' earnings\non their government portfolios. If so, that type of device had already been\nworked out in exploratory studies at the New York Bank in 1940, in con-\nnection with the problem of absorbing excess reserves. It had been generally\n\n\"The Board of Governors decreased reserve requirements for central reserve city banks\nin 1942, and made reference in its 1942, 1943, and 1944 Annual Reports to the expansion\nof Reserve Bank credit necessary to keep member banks adequately supplied with reserves.\n",

With special reference to the\nUnited States in 1945-48, profits more than kept pace with wages and there\nwas no redistribution of income in favor of labor, to be blamed for any part of\nthe inflation. More generally, we should distinguish between consumption as\nan aggregate and consumption of the essentials which are covered by price\nindexes and general thinking on price levels. If the rich consume champagne\nand the poor, potatoes with marginal propensities approximately equal, a shift\nin income from rich to poor will not affect total consumption. It will, how-\never, increase the demand and price of potatoes while reducing the demand\nand price of champagne. The man in the street and the statistician in his\noffice will both, I venture to resuggest, conclude with some reason that \"prices\nhave gone up.\"\n\n4. Professor Morton argues with cogency that union monopolies are less to\nbe feared than other types. Working through the strike, they exercise their\npowers only at the cost of the temporary loss of nearly all their members'\nincomes. On the other side, however, he does not mention unions! greater\nrelative capacitv to employ violence in support of their economic demands.\nThe **Coal and Iron Police\" and the *Chowder-Head Cohens\" will never be\nmissed from the American labor scene, but what of the union ^Action\nSquad?\" This was Henry Simons' point in singling out the unions for special\nconsideration as \"Syndicalists,\" and Professor Morton's case suffers from\nfailure to answer it directly.\n\n5. Professor Morton's main thesis makes compensatory fiscal policy rather\nthan pressure economics the villain of the piece. As he states, When the\nEmployment Act of 1946 was under consideration, it was suggested that\ncompensatory policies should be followed only in so far as they were con-\nsistent with a stable cost of living, but no such provision was included in the\nact.\" Certainly such a limitation on compensatory fiscal policy, if enforceable\npolitically, would have the effect of checking permanent inflation. In the face\nof \"Lewis! Law,\" however, the only kind of full employment it could provide\non a permanent basis would be the \"disguised unemployment\" of a down-\ngraded /umpen-proletariat debarred from the fruits of restrictive unionism.\nWhether such a policy could persuade or compel Mr. Lewis (or Mr. Fairless,\nor Mr. Kline) to repeal their respective Imperial Ordinances without sub-\nstantial assistance from the Anti-Trust Division is the point on which I\nreserve the privilege of pessimism exceeding Professor Morton's.\n\nM.

With special reference to the\nUnited States in 1945-48, profits more than kept pace with wages and there\nwas no redistribution of income in favor of labor, to be blamed for any part of\nthe inflation. More generally, we should distinguish between consumption as\nan aggregate and consumption of the essentials which are covered by price\nindexes and general thinking on price levels. If the rich consume champagne\nand the poor, potatoes with marginal propensities approximately equal, a shift\nin income from rich to poor will not affect total consumption. It will, how-\never, increase the demand and price of potatoes while reducing the demand\nand price of champagne. The man in the street and the statistician in his\noffice will both, I venture to resuggest, conclude with some reason that \"prices\nhave gone up.\"\n\n4. Professor Morton argues with cogency that union monopolies are less to\nbe feared than other types. Working through the strike, they exercise their\npowers only at the cost of the temporary loss of nearly all their members'\nincomes. On the other side, however, he does not mention unions! greater\nrelative capacitv to employ violence in support of their economic demands.\nThe **Coal and Iron Police\" and the *Chowder-Head Cohens\" will never be\nmissed from the American labor scene, but what of the union ^Action\nSquad?\" This was Henry Simons' point in singling out the unions for special\nconsideration as \"Syndicalists,\" and Professor Morton's case suffers from\nfailure to answer it directly.\n\n5. Professor Morton's main thesis makes compensatory fiscal policy rather\nthan pressure economics the villain of the piece. As he states, When the\nEmployment Act of 1946 was under consideration, it was suggested that\ncompensatory policies should be followed only in so far as they were con-\nsistent with a stable cost of living, but no such provision was included in the\nact.\" Certainly such a limitation on compensatory fiscal policy, if enforceable\npolitically, would have the effect of checking permanent inflation. In the face\nof \"Lewis! Law,\" however, the only kind of full employment it could provide\non a permanent basis would be the \"disguised unemployment\" of a down-\ngraded /umpen-proletariat debarred from the fruits of restrictive unionism.\nWhether such a policy could persuade or compel Mr. Lewis (or Mr. Fairless,\nor Mr. Kline) to repeal their respective Imperial Ordinances without sub-\nstantial assistance from the Anti-Trust Division is the point on which I\nreserve the privilege of pessimism exceeding Professor Morton's.\n\nM.

It suggests that the dis-\nequilibrium could be remedied through increased purchases by the\nUnited States without any, cr any substantial, action by foreign coun-\ntries.\n\nBut no matter how one feels about the particular appellation, the\nfact remains that at present incomes and exchange rates, and with\npresent tastes and technologies, the demand by foreigners for U.S.\ndollars exceeds the supply. Current discussions of this *'excess\" seem\nto imply two interpretations: it may be that foreign countries, particu-\nlarly those who have suffered greatly from the war, wish to reach their\nprewar standard of living. Or it may be that foreign countries wish\n(subconsciously or consciously) to maintain about the same ratio in\ntheir standard of living to that of the United States as existed before\nthe war. The first goal has probably been achieved, with the major\nexceptions of Germany and Italy, in the nations of Northern and West-\nern Europe. The second seems implicit in much of the discussion which\nstresses the enormous increase in the productivity of the American\neconomy compared to European achievements.\n\nThese two \"definitions\" of the dollar shortage may sound cynical,\nbut they are not meant as such. They may account for the persistence\nwith which European nations attempt to live and invest beyond their\nmeans\u2014for this is what the dollar shortage amounts to\u2014as well as the\nsympathy with which their desire to do so has met in the United States.'\n\n* The author, associate professor of economics at the University of Michigan, expresses\nthanks for suggestions from Professors R. A. Musgrave and P. A. Samuelson, who read an\nearlier draft of this paper.\n\n! Cf., ior example: \"Tbe transitional stage is to see the rehabilitation of Europe's pro-\nductive power, the overtaking of the arrears of growth not merely of the war years, but\nof the preceding nine years, during which development was interrupted by depression\nand political insecurity. The task of the transitional years 1946-51 must be conceived, not\nas that of restoring Europe to what it was in 1929, but as that of accomplishing in six\nyears all the progress and change appropriate to the long interval of twenty-two years.\"\nR. G. Hawtrey, Western. European. Union\u2014Implications for the United Kingdom (Royal\nInstitute of International Affairs, 1049), p. 66. Mr. Hawtrey has not, of course, linked this\n\nparticular passage with a definition of the dollar shortage.

According to the Ricardian view, which later became the\naccepted view among the great majority of English economists, relative\nprices within a single country are determined largely by costs of pro-\nduction.

In short,\ncost of production governs relative prices while demand governs the\nallocation of labor and capital in the production of different commodi-\nties. With respect to trade between countries, Ricardo argued that his\nsimple cost-of-production theory of relative prices was not applicable.\nSince labor and capital do not move freely from one country to another,\nthere is no necessary tendency for the profits on capital to be the same\nin all countries. In other words, substantial differences can exist between\nwages and profits in one country and wages and profits elsewhere with-\nout bringing about a migration of labor and capital between countries.\nFor this reason it is not meaningful, according to Ricardo, to say that\nrelative prices in international trade are governed, as in domestic trade,\nby relative costs of production.\"\n\nAlthough Ricardo was aware that a cost-of-production theory was\ninadequate to explain prices in international trade, he was always\nsomewhat vague as to how international prices or the terms of trade\n\n* The author is professor of economics at the University of Chicago.\n* Everyman's ed., p. 81.\n* David Ricardo, of. cit., pp. 82-83.\n"

                    "Publication in January, 1950 of a report by the Subcommittee on Mone-\ntary, Credit, and Fiscal Policies of the Joint Committee on the Economic\nReport was an event of major importance in the development of monetary\npolicy. The work of the so-called Douglas Committee is an outstanding\nachievement. It made a rapid and yet thorough survey of the facts and\nopinions on the subject and an extremely intelligent appraisal of them, and\noffered clear-cut, unambiguous recommendations. This report may be con-\nsidered as a public judgment rendered on the controversy between the fiscal\nand the monetary authorities. Whether the full Committee accepts the re-\nport or not and whether Congress takes any action to carry out the Sub-\ncommittee's recommendations, the fact that such a report has been made may\nexert a useful influence on the attitudes of the Treasury and the Federal\nReserve authorities on matters in which their major responsibilities appear\nto conflict.\n\nAn element that adds strength to the report is that its membership included\nrepresentatives both of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, Re-\npublicans as well as Democrats. The Senate members were Paul H. Douglas\n(D., IIl.) chairman, distinguished economist and former president of the Amer-\nican Economic Association, and Ralph E. Flanders (R., Vt.); the House\nmembers were Wright Patman (D., Texas), Jesse P. Wolcott (R., Mich.),\nand Frank Buchanan (D., Pa.).\n\n\"The first sentence of the report shows the Subcommittee's general view of\nthe channels through which the government can best exert its influence for\neconomic stability. The sentence reads: *We recommend not only that ap-\npropriate, vigorous, and coordinated monetary, credit, and fiscal policies be\nemployed to promote the purposes of the Employment Act, but also that such\npolicies constitute the Government's primary and principal method of pro-\nmoting those purposes.\" \"This sentence indicates that the Committee believes\nthat the government's part in moderating the business cycle should be princi-\npally through its influence on national income and the volume of money rather\nthan through the use of direct controls over prices, wages, materials, and\nother phases of economic life. The Committee favors the more impersonal\nand democratic approach through the money flow over more dictatorial ap-\nproaches through direct intervention in the economic behavior of individuals.\n\nMore specifically, the Committee takes the stand on fiscal policy that it\nshould contribute to economic stability and should not be dominated by\nfaith in the curative effects of an annually balanced budget.

The basic ranking is in terms\nof the percentages of economists choosing each subject who also chose Sub-\nfield 1a, Economic Theory. The final column of Table III represents a trans-\nformation of these percentages to a percentage relative, base equal 100, in\nwhich the comparison is to the distribution of choices among all reporting\neconomists, This measure will be called an index of association. The value\nof such an index is that it permits an estimate, from data given in Tables\nI and II, of the degree of association for any pair of subfields or general fields\n(except the x-subfields within their own general fields) if the number of joint\nchoices is known. A complete listing of the type illustrated by Table III\nis thus not necessary when interest centers on one or a few comparisons.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows: Among the total of 3,560 economists, 977, or\n27.37 per cent, checked Subfield 1a. Among the 368 economists who checked\nSubfield 1b, History of Theory, 268, or 72.83 per cent, checked Subfield 1a.\nThe number of economists in 1b who also selected 1a is therefore 266 per\ncent of what it would have been if the distribution of choices among the 1b's\nhad been in the same proportion as for all reporting economists.

                    "Rejoinder\n\nIt is true that Marx's reproduction scheme as suc/t consists of flows, pro-\nvided one bears in mind, in spite of Marx's very sloppy usage, that \"constant\ncapital\" means capital consumption, i.e., depreciation plus used-up materials,\nand *'variable capital\" indicates the total wage bill. The output (in the Marx-\nian sense) of the producer and consumer goods industries is divided into\ncapital consumption, wages and surplus value, and equality between the\ndemand for and supply of consumer and producer goods, respectively, is either\ntaken for granted or made the condition of static equilibrium. AIl this may\nhave been a great achievement ninety years ago, but hardly so today.\n\nAs soon as this apparatus is applied to the theory of value and profit, so\nbasic in Marxian doctrine, difficulties appear. Surplus value remains a flow,\nbut constant and variable capital are transformed into stocks. This implies\nnot only that the production period is equal to the period of the turnover\nof these stocks, but that the rates of turnover of constant and of variable\ncapital are identical as well, i.e., that fixed capital does not exist. As Tsuru\nputs it in Dr. Sweezy's own book, Marx's reproduction scheme implies *. . . for\none thing, that no fixed capital exists; and, for another, that what is not\nconsumed is immediately invested; and thirdly, that capitalists in the first\nbranch [producer goods] do not invest in the second branch [consumer goods]\nand vice versa.\" Marx's attempt to solve the turnover problem (see, for in-\nstance, Capital, Vol. III, Chap. 4) was hardly satisfactory, but Sweezy did\nnot even try (pp. 67-68). The assumed absence of fixed capital in a capitalist\nSociety is rather queer; it may or may not be analytically harmless. But how\ndoes Sweezy know without a proof?\n\nTo oppose Sweezy's character witnesses, we could bring in Lange, Lerner\nand others, but what would we achieve? The best, simplest and only proof\n",

Far from being the w/timo ratio of this line of\nanalysis, the Marxian scheme still constitutes one of the few propositions con-\ncerning which there seems to exist a tolerable agreement among the majority\nof business cycle theorists.*\n\nOf course, Domar is entitled to his opinion, but economists should be\naware that in comparing the Marxian reproduction schemes to a stone ax he is\nexpressing a view which seems to be both original and private.\n\nPavr M.

I have in mind the famous\nMarxian schemes of capital reproduction.?\n",
                    "Domar is simply wrong about the stocks and flows. No stocks enter into\nthe Marxian reproduction schemes; all the items are flows. Of course, it is\nsometimes assumed that stocks on hand at the beginning of a production\nperiod are exactly used up and replenished during the period, so that there\nis a numerical equivalence between stocks and flows. But such an assumption\nis in no way necessary and has nothing to do with the logic of the schemes.\nIt is true that each item in the schemes has a multiple meaning: variable\ncapital is at once capitalists' payrolls, workers incomes and a part of the\noutput of Department II (producing consumer goods); constant capital is\ncapitalists' outlay on materials and equipment, part of capitalists' gross re-\nceipts, and the total output of Department I (producing means of produc-\ntion). But in each case, we are dealing with flows; no logical monstrosities\nare involved.\n\nQuite apart from Domar's misunderstanding of the Marxian reproduction\nschemes, the above-quoted statement struck me as surprising, to say the\nleast. I thought that non-Marxian economists were pretty well agreed that,\nregardless of their opinion of the Marxian system as a whole, the reproduc-\ntion schemes at any rate are extremely useful theoretical instruments. Thus\nthe late Professor Schumpeter wrote of Marx's contributions that improved\nour theory of the structure of physical capital\" and added, \"The schemata\nwhich he devised in that field, though not irreproachable, have again proved\nserviceable in recent work that looks quite Marxian in places.\"? And Pro-\nfessor Leontief is even more explicit:\n",

Professor Evsey Domar makes\nthe following statement:\n\nAs an analytical tool, Varga still uses Marx's celebrated division of total out-\nput into categories I (producer goods) and II (consumer goods). This\ninstrument, in which variable capital (a stock) equals payrolls (a flow), and\nconstant capital (a stock) is supposed to represent both depreciation and gross\ninvestment (both flows), is a logical monstrosity, to put it mildly. At best it\ncan be applied to only the simplest problems, which can be solved just as well\nwithout it. Still, if. Varga, like other Marxists, insists on using this stone ax,\nit is his business . . . (p. 140).\n",

However, the coefficient of pene-\ntration is presented as the coefficient of the ability of firm j to penetrate the\nmarket of firm i (and vice versa since asymmetry is shunned), so it would\nseem more realistic to treat the coefficient of penetration in these circum-\nstances as finite (and small).\n\nWith respect to pure monopoly, this category *.. . may be defined as the\nmarket structure of an industry in which competition is totally absent. Firm\nj is a pure monopolist if the cross-elasticity of demand for its product . . .\nbecomes zero\" (p. 892, italics supplied). If competition is \"totally absent,\"\nthen there will be zo opportunity to match supply units with shifting demand\nunits. While we may write the coefficient of penetration equal to zero (as Pa-\npandreou does), it seems better to treat it as nonexistent. When we conceive a\none firm industry, the coefficient of insulation becomes the reciprocal of the\ncoefficient of penetration, and if the latter is zero, the former is, of course,\ninfinite. That is, the ability of the pure monopolist to resist penetration into\nhis market is infinitely great. This we must grant, but it is infinitely great be-\ncause \u00a3/ere is no one to possess the ability to penetrate. It is more congruous\nto the concept \"social science\" to view the coefficient of insulation as nonexist-\nent rather than infinity.\n\n2. Some supplementary material may round out the exposition. The cross-\nelasticity of demand can be stated in terms of the price-quantity relationships\nbetween two firms, or between a firm and the balance of the industry. Papan-\ndreou chooses the former for the five limiting cases, and this is given in\ncolumn 2 of Table I. The cross-elasticity of demand with reference to a firm\nand the balance of the industry is given in column 3. There is another measure\nnot mentioned in the paper (this is not stated in criticism), namely, the elas-\nticity of substitution which compares a relative change in the ratio of products\nheld to a relative change in the marginal rate of substitution, being infinite\nwhen the products in question are perfect substitutes, finite if substitution is\nimperfect, and zero if no substitution is feasible. This is shown in column 4.\nFinally, in columns 5 and 6 we have the new coefficients of penetration and\ninsulation; the only significant change that appears from the original is that\nthe coefficient of penetration for atomistic heteropoly is presented as finite\nrather than zero.\n\nIn Table I an attempt has been made to increase the significance of the\nterm \"finite\" by indicating the ordinal relationships. The exception is E,\nwhere no flat statement is possible, although we may hazard the guess that the\ncoefficient is more likely to be larger in the case of atomistic heteropoly as\ncompared to circular heteropoly.?\n\n* Columns 2 and 5 show the relationship between two firms; columns 3 and 6 show the\nrelationship between a firm and all the other firms of the industry. It would be possible\nto add two more columns: one to show the penetration relationship between a firm and\nall other firms of the industry, the other to show the insulation relationship when \u00f3ne\nfirm lowers its price. No matter how difficult it might be to discover the general expres-\n\nsion for these two additional columns, we could still give the answer of zero or finite or\ninfinite, which is all that is necessary for Table I.\n",

The\ncross-elasticity coefficient depicts the readiness of demand units to shift from\none seller to another; the new coefficient (the coefficient of penetration) takes\ninto account the capacity of the firm to match these demand units with sup-\nply units.\n\nSymbolically, the cross-elasticity of demand for the product of firm i in\nterms of the price of the product of firm j is:\n\nbj $\nNop; \u2014 \"X fibi bj, Py\")\nQi op;\nwhere q; \u2014 fi (i, Dj, Py\u00bb) is the demand function for the product of firm\ni, b; and qi stand for the price and volume demanded of the product of firm\ni, p; for the price of the product of firm, j, and Py for the price of all the\nother firms in the industry.\n\nThe coefficient of penetration of firm j into the market of firm i is a func-\ntion of the cross-elasticity of demand and symbolically is written:\n\nRap; -\u2014 KjNqp;\nthe conclusions being skillfully and soundly developed that K is an increasing\nfunction of the elasticity of the output-outlay function and a decreasing func-\ntion of the price elasticity of demand.\n\nFinally, the coefficient of insulation is derived to measure the degree of non-\nresponsiveness of the actual volume of sales of firm j to price cuts initiated by\nits competitors. It is formulated by summing the penetration coefficients of JV'\nfirms in order to obtain the over-all coefficient of penetration and then taking\nthe reciprocal, for obviously, the ability of any firm to resist penetration is the\nreciprocal of its competitors' ability to penetrate.

One important\nanalytic question that always intrudes itself into such discussions is\nthe deflationary effect of a particular tax structure as compared with\nits alternatives. Many taxes have been reappraised in the light of the\nmodern theory of income determination, but there remain certain gaps\nin the analysis of consumption taxes.* At least partly, they result from\nthe failure to take fully into account the effects on consumer spending\nof the higher price level induced by the tax. This paper attempts to\nremedy these defects in the present analysis.\n\n'The accepted doctrine is that a given volume of revenue raised by\nconsumption taxes will reduce the level of aggregate real consumer\nexpenditures more than will an equal revenue raised through income\ntaxes.\n\nUnderlying this view are four simplifying propositions. (1) The con-\nsumption tax is fully shifted in higher prices to consumers, whereas\nthe burden of the income tax remains on the income recipient. (2) A\ngiven volume of tax dollars taken from a household with a givez pretax\nincome will reduce real consumer spending (.e., consumption expendi-\ntures net of the consumption tax) by some specified amount, regardless\nof whether the dollars are raised by income or consumption taxes.

Burns, outlining the program of the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, went so far as to say:\n\nFor some time we have planned a volume that would sum up and interpret\nthe massive information developed in our studies of production, employment,\nand productivity. The most important problem to be faced in that final volume\nis the setback to economic progress in the 'thirties: whether that decade defines\na new trend of stagnation or a passing historical episode.*\n\nHarrod, in the preface of his recent book, stated that:\n\n\"The idea which underlies these lectures is that sooner or later we shall be faced\nonce more with the problem of stagnation, and that it is to this problem that\neconomists should devote their main attention.?\n\nTerborgh, and Swanson and Schmidt, have recently considered it worth while\nto write books refuting the thesis, while Fellner, Wright, and Keirstead\ndevote considerable space to the subject. Recent writings of Domar, Sweezy,\nFlorin, the Council of Economic Advisers, and others show a resurgence of\ninterest in problems of economic growth, of which the stagnation thesis is a\npart. It seems desirable, therefore, that the concept of secular stagnation\nshould be clarified, so that future discussion of it will be as fruitful as possi-\nble.\n\nOne of the chief aims of my chapter in the Essays in Honor of Alvin H.\nHansen was to provide a precise definition of secular stagnation; and to\nmake the concept more clear, I illustrated it with a diagram. Judging from\nJ. M. Clark's review of the Hansen essays,? my efforts in this direction have\nnot met with complete success. If so distinguished an economist as Profes-\nsor Clark could so completely misunderstand what I said, it seems likely\nthat other readers will be similarly misled.\n\nIt may be useful, therefore, to amplify my diagrammatic definition of\nstagnation.\n\n*' The author is Ritchie Professor of Economic Research at the University of Mel-\nbourne.\n\n!Arthur F.

                    "during a highly inflationary period adds to the general inflation unless other\ndemand is controlled and withdrawn elsewhere. But this still left the point,\nwhich my testimony treated of fully, that both economic and social considera-\ntions during 1948 required the expansion of certain types of resource use,\nand therefore made the restriction of other types even more imperative, through\na rounded and comprehensive program. Professor Ellis might quite legitimately\nhave disagreed with the particular reapportionment of resource use in accord\nwith economic or social priority which I proposed in 1948, or argued that the\nmethods which I advocated to bring it about were impractical or undesirable.\nBut this would provide no justification for a criticism which distorted my mean-\ning when it was so easily ascertainable.\n\n4. Further, my testimony with respect to housing was fully understandable\nonly in the framework of my general discussion of the economic situation per-\ntaining in August 1948. My argument was that the inflationary situation was\ndangerous because it was creating relationships within the pattern of produc-\ntion, prices and incomes which could not be sustained and which conse-\nquently threatened a substantial downturn in employment and production.\nConcentrating upon this problem of relationships, I concluded that stabilization\nat high levels could not be accomplished solely or safely through the traditional\nmeasures for curtailing the money supply, restricting credit, lifting taxes, or\nseeking to reduce the general rate or pressure of fundamental economic activity.\nI pointed out that these measures needed to be complemented by more dis-\ncriminating efforts to promote more workable relationships. This in turn re-\nquired, for example, that some incomes be maintained or even advanced, while\nothers were reduced; that some production be increased, while other produc-\ntion was restrained; that some programs of overwhelming importance to\ndomestic welfare or international security be maintained or even expanded,\nwhile other programs competing for the same resources be correspondingly\ncontracted, etc. I also went to great lengths to distinguish between short-range\nand long-range needs, while stressing that some proposals were of such vital\nlong-range significance that they should not be delayed even though they com-\nplicated the immediate situation. (See particularly pages 311, 339, 348-\n350 of my testimony.) There may be many economists who would disagree in\nsome respects with my not entirely traditional analysis of the 1948 type of\ninflation and how to deal with it. But there are too many eminent economists\nwho do agree basically with my analysis (some past presidents of the As-\nsociation wrote approvingly of it) for a few words of it to be torn out of context\nand then the whole of my economics\" dismissed as *befuddlement or dissimu-\nlation.\" Name calling and nothing more is not enough.\n\n5. Professor Ellis' assimilation of the foregoing views to the idea that in-\ncreased taxation of corporate profits in August 1948 would have been inflation-\nary is indeed befuddlement. My testimony, in fact, argued for very Itig/ taxes in\n1948 on the ground that they would be entirely consistent with a high enough\nlevel of business investment and would serve as a damper upon inflation.\nSubsidies or tax preferences to speed up the production of a critically needed\ncommodity in short supply might be justified even in a generally inflationary\nsituation, and in fact were resorted to during the war, when accompanied by\n",

However, the specific hous-\ning policy recommendations in my testimony, namely, that the long-range\nhousing program should have been enacted promptly in 1948 despite the then\ncurrent inflation, was precisely the same housing policy which the :wAole Coun-\ncil and the President repeatedly embodied in reports during the same infla-\ntionary period. (See reports issued in January 1948, July 1948, and January\n1949.) Presumably, therefore, Professor Ellis objects not to the 5olicy conclu-\nsions which I reached in my testimony, but rather to the line of analysis and.\nreasoning which I used to support these conclusions. For if his basic disagree-\nment was with the policy advanced by the whole Council and the President,\nthen his singling out of me for invidious criticism could rest only on personal\nbias.\n\n3. Turning now to this issue, Professor Ellis' criticism of my line of analysis\nand reasoning is based upon twenty-odd words which he quotes utterly out of\nthe context of my testimony. I said in part the following:\n\nThe point has been made that the Taft-Ellender-Wagner housing bill is incon-\nsistent with an anti-inflation program because it would add to demand.\n\nThis point is not well founded. If there is a shortage of housing, and if this is\ncontributing to excessive housing costs in the same way that a shortage of food\nwould contribute to excessive food casts, then the production of more housing\nis anti-inflationary in the same sense that the production of more food would\nbe anti-inflationary. It may well be that, for a time, we cannot divert much more\nlabor aid materials to the total production of housing in view of other competing\nnational needs. But let us make sure that they are competing national needs, and\nnot competing mon-essentials. And even then, there would still remain the\nquestion of the composition of the housing that is being produced. It would\nstill be sound and desirable to produce relatively more low-rent housing for\nveterans and others of modest means, and relatively less high-priced housing\nfor families who can get along very nicely for a while with what they already\nhave. The Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill is designed basically for this purpose, al-\nthough this is not true of the \"title VI\" provisions contained in the bill. Thus,\nunder present circumstances, talk about damping down the demand for housing\nis undiscriminating and mistaken until one breaks the demand down into various\ntypes. Some types of housing should be expanded, other types should be con-\ntracted. (p. 348. Italics supplied.)\n\nCertainly, the foregoing quotation leaves no room for Professor Ellis' state-\nment that I did not recognize, or did not honestly reveal, that when resources\nwere being strained by inflation we could not allocate more of our resources\nto one purpose without subtracting more from another. I said just this, not\nonly generally, but also with specific reference to housing, as is indicated by the\nlast sentence of the quotation. I am prepared to admit that the foregoing\nquotation in its compact form, while sufficient to show how misleading was\nProfessor Ellis! selection of one sentence from it, did not embrace all of the\nqualifications which anyone could obtain from hearing or reading my testi-\nmony in its entirety. Even a casual reading would reveal my clear recognition\nthat, while an increase of supply exerts a downward influence on prices in the\nlong run, additional drawing upon resources for housing (or anything else)\n",

                    "Housing and Inflation: Reply to Professor Ellis\n\nIn The Review of Economics and Statistics for August 1949, Professor\nHoward S. Ellis wrote an article about the January 1949 Economic Report of\nthe President and the January 1949 Annual Economic Review by the Council\nof Economic Advisers, in which he said at page 175:\n\nFurthermore, the present Report seems to be more honest than its predecessors.\nThus it candidly says that \"the fight against inflation prevents us from under-\ntaking these welfare and development programs with the speed and on a scale\nthat would otherwise be desirable\" (p. 8). Honesty of this sort is apt to be better\nlong-run policy than Keyserling's testimony, which can scarcely escape the\ncharge of either befuddlement or disssimulation, to the effect that the produc-\ntion of more housing is anti-inflationary in the same sense that the production\nof more food would be anti-inflationary.\" This casuistry is easily recognized as\nthe same argument as that by which the National Association of Manufacturers\nsought to prove that increased taxation of corporate profits would be inflationary:\ninvestment in plant would be reduced, production would be smaller, prices would\nbe higher. It is gratifying that the economics of Mr. Keyserling does not find its\nway into the 1949 Report. (Italics mine. Professor Ellis refers to my testimony\nof August 4, 1948 at pages 308-360 of the printed hearings of the Senate Com-\nmittee on Banking and Currency entitled *Control of Inflation,\" 80th Congress,\n2nd session.)1\n\nThere are several points about Professor Ellis! statement which call for com-\nment.\n\n1. Professor Ellis! appraisal uses the term \"report\" interchangeably to refer\nto the January 1949 Economic Report of the President and the January 1949\nAnnual Economic Review by the Council of Economic Advisers. Thus it is\nnot always clear as to which of the two documents he is talking about, although\nit is sometimes made clear by page references. In any event, I signed one\nof these documents along with my two colleagues on the Council and joined with\nthem in \"assisting and advising\" the President in the preparation of the other\nunder the terms of the Employment Act of 1946. Therefore, I cannot fairly be\ndisassociated from the report the honesty\" of which Professor Ellis so highly\napproves. I wholly subscribe to the passages which he picks out for special\ncommendation; and if they did not represent a job of *teamwork,\" I might even\nask Professor Ellis how he can know that I did not actually draft or initiate\n(as well as subscribe to) the parts which he most applauds. I submit that is a\n\"heads I win, tails you lose\" attitude for Professor Ellis to pick out portions\nof reports I signed or helped prepare which he likes and say that they are no\u00a3\nmy \"economics,\" but to pick out portions of testimony I have given which he\ndislikes and say that they are my \"economics.\" Further, conscientious study of\nmy testimony would reveal its basic accord with the reports which Professor\nEllis praises.\n\n2. Professor Ellis selects the subject of housing to support his alleged con-\n\n* A striking illustration of Professor Ellis' careless treatment of my views is that he\ndoes not even cite what testimony he is talking about (I also testified in February, 1949),\nand therefore the reader of his article could not refer to my testimony and judge whether\nit was correctly portrayed.\n",
