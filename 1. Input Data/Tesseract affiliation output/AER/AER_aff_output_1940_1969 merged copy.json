                "War Financing and the Distribution of Income*\n\nIt is commonly asserted that one advantage of borrowing over taxation in\nthe present juncture is that taxes enacted now will distribute the burden less\nequitably than would later peacetime taxes collected to pay off the bonds.?\nThis assertion does not seem to me at all to reach the real issues involved. It\nhas little relevance for the distribution of the current war burden, and it\nseems as likely as not to be incorrect in viewing the distribution of income by\nclasses over time.\n\nIt is surely well established by now, though unfortunately not yet recog-\nnized by some of our congressional leaders, that the burden of the present war\neffort cannot be sloughed off by this generation onto later ones, by borrowing\nor otherwise, Thus the argument that future peacetime taxes may be more\nequitably allocated than present ones is largely irrelevant for discussion of an\nequitable distribution of the current war burden, even assuming that future\ntaxes actually can be more equitably distributed (which is far from certain).\nIn considering the allocation of the burden of war financing, the real com-\nparison must be between the distribution of the tax burden now and the bond\nburden now (including the price inflation which will probably come with bor-\nrowing), rather than between present and future taxes. And if it is true that\nthe very low income groups lose especially from inflation\u2014and there is con-\nsiderable truth in the statement\u2014then even the fact that the rich buy the\nbonds does not necessarily mean a more equitable distribution of the present\nburden through borrowing, since borrowing from the rich is especially likely\nto draw on otherwise \"idle\" funds and speed price inflation.\n\nThe question of the relationship of war financing and income distribution\nover time (as distinct from the distribution of the war burden) is a much more\nsubtle one than has been generally recognized. It is by no means clear that\nthe low income groups are better off if we borrow now than if we tax, even\nthough future taxes are. assumed to be more progressive than present ones\n\n! am indebted to Dr. R.

                "money and the substitutes for money (bills of exchange, barter and primitive\nproduction) as media of exchange.\"* If it were not that money has a rate of\ninterest of its own (basic rate), accumulation would continue without inter-\nruption and the rate of return on real capital would fall and soon become\nzero.!?\n\nGesell did not contend that the introduction of stamped money would cause\ninterest on loans to disappear immediately.? His explanation of this is facili-\ntated by the distinction between loan interest and basic interest. Loan interest\nis used in the ordinary sense, referring to the amount of money paid by bor-\nrowers to the lenders of liquid funds. According to Gesell, the loan rate must\nalways equal the rate of return on real capital assets, whether the loan be\nmade in conventional money or stamped money. Loans contracted in stamped\nmoney will bear (loan) interest as long as the demand for loan capital exceeds\nthe supply at a zero loan rate.'* A zero loan rate must await the day when\nunimpeded accumulation causes capital assets to lose their scarcity value.\n\nIn saying that basic interest would disappear with the introduction of\nstamped money, Gesell means that the consequences which flow from the use\nof conventional money would be eliminated and processes set in motion which\nin time would reduce the loan rate and the real rate to zero. When this has\ncome about, interest income will disappear, and rentier capitalism will be at\nan end.\n\nIn this respect Gesell's ideas on long-run social reform are closely analogous\nto Keynes's *euthanasia of the rentier.\"*5 'The secular decline in the marginal\nefficiency of capital is another expression for Gesell's long-term reduction in\nthe rate of return on real capital. Keynes tells us he believes that, within a\nperiod of a generation or two, unchecked accumulation would make capital\nassets so abundant that they would cease to yield a return in excess of their\ncost.^ Both Keynes and Gesell maintain that pure interest can be made to\ndisappear without socializing the instruments of production. In the new so-\nciety individuals would still be free to accumulate, but their wealth would\nnot grow automatically through interest accruals. Nevertheless, skilled risk\ntakers would be free to venture their capital in new and uncertain enterprises,\nand if successful, would get a return in excess of their original investments.\nThus the advantages of individual initiative and enterprise would be retained,\nwhile nonfunctional income and other undesirable features of the capitalist\nsystem would disappear.\n\nThe immediately significant difference arising from the substitution of\nstamped money for conventional forms is that all resources would be con-\ntinuously employed. Basic interest would not exist as a barrier frustrating new\ncapital formation. The *natural\" forces of competitive production would\nadjust to a level of output at which resources would be fully employed. This\n\n?! Natural Economic Order, p. 263.\n\n?

                "350 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW [JUNE\n\nconnection Gesell's position is similar to that of Gottfried Feder, who in 1923\nwas appointed by Hitler as the final judge of all doctrinal questions of the\nNational Socialist Party. In Hitler's famous list of twenty-five points, one of\nthe two points in bold-faced print calls for the *Brechung der Zinsknecht-\nschaft,\" i.e., for the abolition of *interest slavery.\" Although this anti-finance\ncapital outlook is significant, care must be taken not to identify the liberal,\nhumanitarian premises of Gesell's program with the fundamentally different\ntotalitarian premises of the Nazi party.\n\nIn order to explain how unemployment, crises and unearned income could\nbe remedied, Gesell employs a threefold classification of interest rates: the\nbasic rate (a theoretical rate), the rate of return to real capital (an estimated\nrate), and the loan rate (a contractual rate). Basic interest is described as a\npurely monetary phenomenon which has nothing to do with time-preference,\nwaiting, or the so-called *productivity\" of capital. It does not represent any-\nthing which exists in the real world, or at least there are no direct outward\nmanifestations of its existence. Gesell says, for example, \"Basic interest has\nup to the present escaped observation because it was concealed behind its\noffspring, ordinary interest upon loan-money. . . . Basic interest is a unique\nphenomenon which must be considered by itself; it is a fundamental economic\nconception.\"5 Attempts to apply the test of correspondence between the con-\ncept \"basic interest\" and the object signified by it are certain to yield nega-\ntive results because there is no signification of object. The concept has mean-\ning, but there is no question of its (immediate) truth or falsity. There can be\nno appeal to facts on this level of analysis.\n\nGesell attempts to clarify *basic interest\" by contrasting it with the *rate\nof return on real capital,\" i.e., with the hire price paid to the owners of assets\nother than money. In comparing this rate with the basic rate, he hastens to\nadd: *We ought to cease designating two such fundamentally different things\nby the same word, interest\"? This is the reference of Keynes's statement that\nGesell distinguishes clearly between the rate of interest and the marginal\nefficiency of capital.!?\n\nThis same distinction between basic interest and interest on real capital is\nalso used to contrast the declining rate of return on real capital assets with\nthe constant rate of return on money. In this way Gesell points out that it is\nthe money rate of interest which checks accumulation and impedes production.\nThe accumulation of capital assets in no way reduces the independently de-\ntermined money rate of interest. On the other hand, the accumulation of\ncapital assets does lower the rate of return on real capital. When the latter\nfalls below the basic (money) rate, accumulation ceases because it is now\nmore profitable to hold money than to invest. This forces those who need\nmoney as a medium of exchange to pay the (now) higher basic rate. This basic\nrate, according to Gesell, corresponds to the \"difference of efficiency between\n\n* Gottfried Feder, Hitler's Official Programme (London: Allen and Unwin, 1934), p. 40.\n\n* Natural Economic Order, pp. 265-66.

                "affairs. His first publication, Die Reformation im Muenzwesen als Bruecke\nzum. Sozialem Staat? contained the kernel of his ideas on monetary policy.\nBetween 1891 and 1898, Gesell published five other works on monetary\npolicy, but nothing specifically on monetary or general economic theory.\nThese were the formative years of his career.\n\nWhen Gesell returned to Europe in 1900 to reside in Switzerland and\nGermany, his practical reform proposals had already been worked out and\npublished in all their essentials. The formulation of his theory came later. In\n1911 he published Die neue Lehre vom Geld und Zins, which formed the\ntheoretical basis for his system of social reform.*\n\nA more detailed discussion is needed to indicate the logical, as distinguished\nfrom the chronological, relation of Gesell's program to his economic theory:\nfirst, because it has been the source of more misinterpretation of his position,\nand second, because of the somewhat more complicated nature of the prob-\nlem. Keynes, for example, has reversed the relation between Gesell's theory\nand program. In discussing Gesell's theory of interest, Keynes says Gesell\n*carried his theory far enough to lead him . . . to the famous prescription of\n*stamped' money.'* Keynes conveys the impression that Gesell arrived at his\npractical suggestion in spite of a *great defect\" in his theory, whereas it would\nbe more accurate to say that Gesell's theory is not, in some important respects,\nan adequate explanation of his practical suggestion. His theory is a refine-\nment of his insight that money should be forced to circulate by means of a\nperiodic tax which would offset the preference of wealth owners for *hoard-\ning\" money rather than spending it for some form of consumable or produc-\ntive wealth.\n\nGesell's contention that interest is a payment to prevent the *hoarding\" of\nmoney classes his interest theory with the \"exploitation\" doctrines of other\nsocialists. He regards the share of total social income represented by interest\nas a deduction from the income created by laborers, including industrial capi-\ntalists. His theory of interest is not, however, the same as the exploitation\ntheory of Marx. Gesell's position is both anti-classical and anti-Marxian. Al-\nthough he avowed himself a socialist and professed to be attacking capitalism\nas a whole, his anti-capitalistic position must be interpreted in terms of his\ndefinition of capitalism as \"the interest exploiting system.\"* In this particular\n",

                "Silvio Gesell's Monetary Theory of Social Reform\n\nIn spite of the attention which has been given to the writings of Silvio\nGesell, the stamped money reformer, the unifying basis of his work has, I\nthink, been neither clearly stated nor satisfactorily elaborated. The relation\nbetween the theoretical and practical aspects of his analysis has been either\nignored, misunderstood or distorted.\n\nGesell's objective as a social reformer was to attack rentier capitalism and\nto substitute in its place an interest-free society. To fortify his reform posi-\ntion Gesell developed a system of economic theory in which he tried to demon-\nstrate that the nonutilization of resources and the presence of nonfunctional\nincome are the inevitable accompaniments of prevailing financial institutions.\nThe most important single phase of his theory as a whole is his theory of\ninterest. In its critical aspect this theory represents an attempt to show that,\nin a system of conventional money, interest income is a payment to prevent\nthe hoarding of money. In its positive aspect the theory is an attempt to\nshow that the introduction of stamped money would eliminate \"basic interest\"\nand thus pave the way to an interest-free economy, The purpose of this note\nis to show that Gesell's theory in general and his theory of basic interest in\nparticular represent an argument for his stamped money proposal. This may\nbest be shown by indicating that the practical insight which led Gesell to\npropose a tax on money was chronologically as well as logically prior to his\ntheoretical system.\n\nThat the practical aspect of Gesell's thought was chronologically prior is\nnot difficult to demonstrate. In 1886, at the age of twenty-four, Gesell mi-\ngrated from Europe to the Argentine to engage in foreign trade and small-\nscale manu\u00edacturing. There he witnessed one of the most speculative episodes\nin the history of modern capitalist development. The great boom from 1885\nto 1890 preceded a long and severe depression which lasted for the duration\nof Gesell's stay in the South American republic. The frustration of industrial\nactivity produced a strong current of resentment against the speculating\nfinanciers, brokers, stock jobbers and mortgagees. As one whose interests\nwere directly affected, and as one whose indignation was aroused by this\nfinancial debauchery, Gesell participated actively in the opposition to the\ngroup interests which appeared to be responsible for the chaotic state of\n\n!

No pronouncement by American economists has ever at-\ntracted the public attention that this received. It seems desirable, while\nmemories are reasonably accurate and some of the correspondence relating\nthereto is still available, to give a brief history of this protest. Since my friend,\nProfessor Clair Wilcox of Swarthmore, who was the leading spirit in the\nmatter, declines to tell the story, I take the liberty of doing so.\n\nWith the sharp division of economic opinion in recent years on so many\nissues of public policy, it is hard today to realize the almost unanimous op-\nposition of economists, in the spring of 1930, to the tariff bill then pending\nin Congress. Economic faculties that within a few years were to be split\nwide open on monetary policy, deficit finance, and the problem of big busi-\nness, were practically at one in their belief that the Hawley-Smoot bill was an\niniquitous piece of legislation. What later developed into a statement backed\nby over 1,250 economists originated in a very modest way out of the desire\nof Wilcox and some of his associates at Swarthmore to voice their protest. At\nthe suggestion of Wilcox, Professor Paul Douglas of the University of Chicago,\nwho was then temporarily at Swarthmore, drafted a statement in March that,\nwith some changes in phraseology, was the one given to the press five weeks\nlater. It was decided to ask an economist at each of various eastern uni-\nversities to sponsor the statement, and then to send it to a member of the\neconomics faculty at each American college, with the request that he solicit\nsignatures from his colleagues. Professors E. M. Patterson of Pennsylvania,\nFrank D. Graham of Princeton, Henry Seager of Columbia, Irving Fisher of\nYale, and F. W. Taussig of Harvard, were asked to join Wilcox and Douglas\nin sponsoring the statement. This they all agreed to do. As a result of the\ncomments of these men a few changes were made in the text, and at the sug-\ngestion of Fisher a paragraph was added pointing out the significance of\ntariff policy in connection with America's creditor position.\n\nFisher also made the suggestion that the entire membership of the American\n",
