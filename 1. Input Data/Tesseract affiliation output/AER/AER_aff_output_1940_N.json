This type of economic organization has been called forth\nby the doctrine of total war. Besides the traditional use of the military proper, total war\nembraces two new weapons: psychological and economic warfare. In the economics of the\nmilitary state there is no distinct line of demarcation which separates war from peace.\nWar is no longer regarded as a passing stage of abnormality to be replaced in short by\nnormal conditions of peace; and war economics is no longer a special branch of public\nfinance but penetrates the whole of economic science.\n\nIn the economics of the military state, there is no unused capacity, industrial or other-\nwise, since all resources are placed in the service of war preparation and war. The profit\nmotive is retained, but is subject to important modifications. Private initiative, inasmuch\nas it is recognized and allowed to emerge, is vested with the function of serving the\neconomics of the military state. Depletion of the stock of accumulated wealth, as a source\nof current consumption, is co\u00f3rdinated with current production, the other source. The\ntraditional concept of normalcy with its excess of national income produced over national\nincome consumed is abandoned.\n\nEvolution of War Economics in Recent German Literature\n\nThe intensive occupation with the economic aspects of war preparation\nand warfare which started in Germany with the advent of the Hitler\nregime has resulted in a stupendous volume of literary output in the course\nof the years. Research institutes and university chairs for the investigation\nand propagation of war economics were established by the authorities, who\nalso assumed financial responsibility for the printing and publishing of\nnumerous treatises and monographs on war economics. All this is re-\nmarkably different from the situation in 1914 when Werner Sombart spoke\nof the economists as follows: \"W'e had nothing to give that could have\nbeen of direct service to the great cause. Nothing has become more clear\nin our minds than this: our co\u00f3peration was not needed in any respect.\"\nCorrespondingly it is said now that \"economic science cannot be acquitted\nof the grave guilt of insufficient preparation for the [first] World War.\"?\n\n\"Though attempts have been made to appraise nazi economic policies\nas the result and outcome of German economic development within the\nimmediate and more remote past, it does not seem possible to regard\n\n!NV.

                    "THE TWO FEDERAL REVENUE ACTS OF 1940!\n\nTwo revenue acts have been passed by Congress this year. The first, approved June 25,\nwas a series of amendments hastily thrown together in what was then thought to be the\nclosing days of the congressional session. This Act (1) reduced the amounts of personal\nexemptions, (2) increased by about 10 per cent individual and corporation income taxes,\n(3) increased surtax rates in the middle brackets and (4) increased most excises.\n\nThe Second Revenue act of 1940, applicable to corporations only, has three important\nfeatures: (1) it levies a special tax on the excess profits of corporations; (2) it suspends\nduring the life of the excess profits tax the Vinson-Trammell act designed to limit profits\nfrom naval, airplane and other defense contracts; and (3) it permits accelerated (five-year)\namortization of the cost of certain facilities necessary for national defense. The Act also\nprovides for those in military and naval services a new system of life insurance and credit\non annuities under the Railroad Retirement acts. An amendment is made to the Social\nSecurity act for employers who had not received credit for contributions to state funds\nbecause they were late.\n\n\"The first Act is expected to augment revenues by $729,000,000 for the fiscal year 1941,\nand by about $1,000,000,000 in a full year of operation. The second is expected to increase\nrevenues still further by about $500,000,000 in the calendar year 1941, and by $900,000,000\nto $1,000,000,000 when the defense program becomes fully operative.\n\nThe Fiscal Situation\n\nNo year since the World War has seen such changes in the federal fiscal\npicture as 1940. In January the President estimated that the deficit for the\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1941, would be $2,876,000,000. His estimate\nfor national defense expenditure for 1941 was about $1,940,000,000. This\nsum was only a fraction of the amount soon deemed necessary as he saw\nthe German army overrun country after country in Western Europe. A\nrevised estimate in June was for $3,250,000,000 defense expenditures; in\nAugust for $5,000,000,000. Total expenditures for 1941 were estimated in\nAugust at $12,000,000,000 in contrast to $8,000,000,000 in January. These\namounts do not tell the full story. Congress was asked to appropriate in-\ncreasingly huge sums for defense, not all of which could be expended in\nthe current fiscal year. Exclusive of the cost of enforcing the acts for com-\npulsory military training and putting the National Guard into active mili-\ntary service, Congress had appropriated over $14,000,000,000 for defense\npurposes by August 5, 1940.\n\nEven in May before the situation in Europe became so bad, and while\ndefense appropriations were comparatively small, Secretary Morgenthau\nbecame concerned over the $45 billion debt limit. At that time the work-\ning balance was $1,3500,000,000, a sum the Secretary thought unwise to re-\nduce. Although the President had suggested additional tax revenues ot\n$460,000,000 in his January message, Congress ignored the request, and\n\n'Preceding federal revenue acts passed since the adoption of the Sixteenth (Income\nTax) amendment to the Constitution have been discussed in earlier volumes of the\nAmerican. Economic Review. Volume and page references are given in the Review of\nSeptember, 1938 (vol. 28, p. 447). For the 1939 Act see the Review of December, 1939\n(vol. 29, p. 695). Further analyses may be found in the authors' Federal Income Tax\n(1940).\n",

This situation arises where excess capacity coincides with inability of\nproducers to control production and prices. The experience of the cotton textile industry\nsupports the view that cutthroat competition tends in time to correct itself. (The excess ca-\npacity which developed in this industry around 1923 was substantially eliminated by 1937.\nUnder certain conditions, however, it is quite possible for cutthroat competition to continue\nindefinitely.

                    "I\n\nEconomists have long maintained that free competition tends to promote\neconomic efficiency. Business-men, however, have remained singularly un-\nconvinced. In trade journals and at manufacturers conventions competition\nis termed \"ruinous,\" \"unethical,\" \"cutthroat,\" \"destructive.\" The control\nof competition through patents, tariffs, mergers, trade associations and in-\nformal agreements has been a major objective of business policy.\n\nThe competitive practices condemned by business-men are of two quite\nseparate types, which should be clearly distinguished. Cutthroat competition\nsometimes refers to false advertising, adulteration of goods, commercial\nbribery, defamation of competitors, and similar fraudulent practices. It\nwould be generally agreed that such practices are undesirable, and they\ntherefore raise no major question of public policy.\n\nSecond, and perhaps more commonly, cutthroat competition refers to\nacts which tend directly or indirectly to lower the existing price structure.\nIt can scarcely be argued, however, that price reductions are always un-\njustified. A price cut which reflects a reduction in raw material costs or an\nimprovement in manufacturing technique is clearly reasonable. Under what\nconditions, then, does price cutting become cutthroat?\n\nMost of those who denounce price cutting are rather vague on this point.\nEmphasis on the zofivation of producers is reflected in such terms as\n\"chiseler,\" \"unfair,\" \"unethical.\" In other cases certain /ecbziques of price\nreduction, such as secret rebates or fictitious advertising allowances, are\ncondemned. Neither of these criteria, however, provides a satisfactory\nbasis for distinguishing cutthroat competition from competition in general.\nIt does not matter very much what a price concession is called\u2014 \"rebate,\"\n\"allowance,\" \"discount,\" or plain \"cut.\" The important thing is that prices\nhave been reduced. And they are probably reduced in most cases because\nsome producers hope thereby to increase their short-run profits or bolster\n\n\u00bb\u00bb ot\n\n! For a. more complete list of such practices, see Leverett S. Lyon and others, TAe Na-\ntional Recovery Administration, Brookings Institution, Washington, 1935, especially chap-\nters 22, 26, and 27.\n\n? Most goods are sold at a wide variety of prices, which are not necessarily changed\nsimultaneously or proportionately. It is therefore more correct to speak of the price struc-\nture being undermined than of the price being cut. The conventional term \"price cutting\"\nis used below, however, for reasons of convenience.\n",

                    "SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF SAVINGS DEPOSITS\n\nIn this paper various characteristics of savings deposits are studied in order to clarify\nthe functions of these deposits. (1) In the late 1920's many deposits were withdrawn for\nthe purchase of stocks and other investments. During the 1930's, as a rule, deposits were\nnot used for current spending on consumption to the extent commonly supposed. In one\ndepressed area, however, spending and unemployment were the main reasons for with-\ndrawal. (2) The activity of savings deposits is marked by sharp seasonal fluctuations, but\nthe annual rate of turnover is more stable than that for demand deposits. Medium-sized\nbalances ($400-800) are the most active. (3) The data indicate that over 40 per cent of\naccounts are closed before becoming a year old. Older and larger accounts, however, make\nup a large part of total deposits. (4) These data emphasize the need for a time period in the\ndefinition of savings, since many deposits are used for non-current spending. The use of\nsavings deposits as investments, however, seems to be increasing.\n\nIn this paper certain characteristics of the deposits in the mutual savings\nbanks of New York State are considered. The purpose of the investigation\nis to acquire a clearer notion of the nature of savings deposits. The prin-\ncipal characteristics considered are the uses of saved funds, and the activity\nand age of accounts. For the most part, data concerning these questions\nare not obtainable for all banks, but it happens that internal studies made\nby a few of the banks in the state are pertinent to this inquiry, and are be-\nlieved to be representative of other banks. These studies have been supple-\nmented by statistics published in the 4zzal Reports of the Superintendent\nof Banks and by discussions with savings-bank officers.\n",

                    "A. Uses of Savings Deposits\n\nIt is virtually impossible to determine accurately the reasons for savings-\nbank withdrawals. This is so because deposits usually are withdrawn in\ncash, which cannot be traced. Sometimes, however, withdrawals take the\nform of checks drawn by the savings banks on depository commercial banks,\nespecially when the amounts are large, and the endorsements on these\nchecks provide clues to the uses of the money. Several individual banks\nmade studies of these endorsements covering short periods of the late\n1920's in order to discover to what extent deposits were being used for\nstock purchases. These studies showed quite conclusively that savings de-\nposits were attracted in large amounts to the stock market or to invest-\nment in mortgage certificates and other securities.\n\nOne bank, for example, discovered that in January, 1929, 24 per cent of\nthe withdrawals by check were used to purchase stocks and bonds, while\n40 per cent went into real estate or mortgages. In March, 40 per cent went\nfor stocks and bonds and 37 per cent for real estate or mortgages.* When\ncompared to stock-market movements, the rise and fall of withdrawals\n\n! These data were collected by the Savings Banks Association of the State of New York.\nAlthough these figures come from only one (large) bank, several others found similar\nresults and savings-bank officials believe them to be typical in the metropolitan area.\n",

                    "A RE\u00c9XAMINATION OF THE CLASSICAL THEORY\nOF INFLATION\n\nAn adequate analysis of the classical theory of inflation cannot afford to neglect the\nfollowing points: (a) The structure of economic society, more particularly of industrial\nproduction, was not fully integrated by the turn of the eighteenth century. (b) The general\neconomic theory formulated at that time concentrated on the problem of production in ac-\ncordance with the concrete major problem of its time. (c) The \"received doctrine\" con-\ncerning money had been formulated under mercantile conditions based on a manufactural\nand not an industrial mode of production. (d) The general circumstances occasioned by\nthe jerkingly proceeding industrial expansion, enhanced by the specific conditions of the\nAnglo-French wars, resulted in an apparently general rise of prices.\n\nAs to the functional value of a theory developed on this basis and proposed to be ap-\nplied to the solution of modern monetary problems, we have to recognize that: (a) The\nanalysis of this rise of prices was carried on with the help of a scientific method which did\nnot and could not include a concept of qualitative change. Quite the contrary, \"received\ndoctrine\" as well as the outward appearance of the economic process seemed to suggest a\nmerely quantitative expansion without any fundamental qualitative change in the structure\nof production. (b) The result of such an attitude toward the phenomenon of rising prices\nwas to conceive of them as deviations from an otherwise static condition. (c) Such theoretical\nposition did not prove fatal for 1bat time for the reason that the actual though temporary\neconomic conditions tended to obscure the imminent structural change indicated in the rise of\nprices.\n\n\"The classical theory of inflation expressed thus the phenomenal coincidence of a specific\nhistorical period. It has to be understood as a \"special case\" in doctrine formation created\nby and applicable to a special historical situation only.\n\nBy the end of the eighteenth century the industrial type of producing\ncommodities had become prevalent, bringing in its wake a development of\nregular interrelationships between the various producers and consumers.\nAdam Smith, in his discussion of the division of labor, has given an\nadequate picture of that society.\n\n\"There is little doubt that the theory of money would have retained its\nposition of secondary importance in the general economic theory of that\nperiod if it had not been for the occurrence of particularly striking events\nwhich forced the political and economic strategists to concern themselves\nparticularly with disentangling the apparently highly important flux of\nmoney. One extraordinary event was the French Revolution, which to the\nEnglish merchants produced an economic-political threat of first im-\nportance. There was a definite connection between the Revolution in France\nand the conditions in England. In the treatises on money, concerned with\nthe doctrines elaborated in this period, it has always been emphasized that\nthe military expenditures during this time were of an ex/raordinary nature.\nThere is a curious neglect of the difficulties which arose out of the structural\ntransformation which took place in England quite irrespective of the foreign\nwars. It is of course perfectly true that one cannot distinguish clearly\nand in absolute terms between \"indigenous\" development and \"influences\nfrom the outside.\" It amounts to a tautology, today, to say that the causes\n\nof the French Revolution and the reasons for its being disliked by the\n",

                    "COMMERCIAL POLICY AS REFLECTED IN TREATIES\nFROM 1931 TO 1939\n\nGreat changes have largely transformed world trade during the years from the onslaught\nof the world depression to the outbreak of the present war in Europe. Nowhere are these\nchanges so clearly reflected as in the treaties of commerce which have been negotiated\nduring the past eight years. Since these treaties are the legal embodiment of one aspect of\neconomic foreign policy, they represent a complex structure of contractual obligations\nwherein various national interests in the sphere of economic life find expression. For an\naccurate analysis of recent commercial policy, an examination of the tendencies, established\npractices, and methods exhibited in the binding agreements entered into by nations is\nessential. Here the use of the most-favored-nation clause, quotas, exchange controls, barter\nagreements, tariffs, bilateralism, and other devices of trade policy, the frequency of their\nappearance, and their content and scope, can be studied with a view to determining more\nprecisely the nature of the above-mentioned changes.\n\nI\n\nThe subsequent data are based upon a study of over 510 bilateral con-\nventions, treaties, and exchanges of notes between states for the period\n1931-1939. This group is broken down by means of the accompanying\ntable into various cross-classifications, by topics and kinds of provisions,\nand certain conclusions will be drawn from the number of treaties in each\ncategory. Provisions which are characteristic of the new trend in commercial\npolicy will be examined in detail, and further general conclusions as to\nthe effect of the new regime upon international trade relations will be indi-\ncated.\n\nEven though this group is not exhaustive, it represents approximately\ntwice as many negotiations of a similar nature as are recorded for the\nwhole era from 1919 to 1930. One effect of the unsettled economic rela-\ntions of the last decade has been to necessitate many and frequent agree-\nments on trade and commerce. Of the 510 agreements, 137 were modifica-\ntions of existing treaties. These modifications were not only changes within\nthe broad pattern of agreements already in force; they also entailed altera-\ntions of a more fundamental nature.\n\nAs can be seen from Table I, when the total is broken down into com-\nponent figures representing the several types of provisions found in this\ngroup of treaties, as well as the geographic distribution of agreements con-\ntaining these provisions, some noteworthy facts emerge. But a caveat should\nbe entered at once against interpreting the table too literally. Aside from\nthe qualifications set forth in the explanation which accompanies the table,\nand which must be considered in any interpretations drawn therefrom, the\ndata summarized should be interpreted as providing evidence on the char-\nacter and content of recent commercial-treaty policies. To be most useful,\nthe calculations presented here should be set over against treaty practice\n\n\"This figure constitutes probably one-half of all such negotiations during these years\n\n(until Sept., 1939). The particular accords cited are the most important and hence they\nare believed to be satisfactorily representative.\n",

                    "The test for the effectiveness of the National Labor Relations act is to be sought\nin the degree to which it achieves its specific purpose of helping to abolish disputes over\nlabor's right to organize and bargain collectively, a question coinciding only partially\nwith that regarding industrial peace at large.\n\nTo gauge this development numerically the following methods are used: The degree\nto which labor in its struggle against \"unfair labor practices\" is resorting to the NLRB\nrather than to strikes is measured through the ratio of \"pure\" complaint cases (that is\nthose in which strikes were not also resorted to) and \"organization strikes in disputes\nunder the Board's jurisdiction,\" while the degree to which labor uses the Board merely in\naddition to strikes rather than in the place of strikes is measured through the ratio of\n\"strike-complaint cases\" to pure complaint cases. The trend of the employers compliance\nwith the Act is inferred from the yearly total number of disputes over \"unfair labor prac-\ntices.\" The number of organization strikes in disputes under the Board's jurisdiction in\ncomparison to those not under the Board's jurisdiction is used as additional indicator\nof the effectiveness of the Act.\n\nThese several indices are calculated as nearly as the published records allow, and\ngraphically represented.\n\nThe picture of the development so obtained is regarded as promising. Labor is coming\nto settle disputes over \"unfair labor practices\" increasingly through the NLRB rather\nthan through strikes; the ratio of strike-complaint to pure complaint cases is beginning to\ndiminish, and organization strikes in disputes under the Board's jurisdiction are diminish-\ning faster than those not under the Board's jurisdiction. Most of all, the total number\nof disputes over the outlawed unfair labor practices has noticeably declined since the last\nyear, following a strong increase during the first three years of the operation of the\nNational Labor Relations act.\n\nPurpose of tbe Labor Relations act.\u2014In view of the flood of criticism\nof the National Labor Relations act and its administration by the NLRB, it\nis of great importance to possess reliable indices for gauging the effective-\nness of the Act in achieving the purpose for which it was designed. This\npurpose was to enforce labor's right to organize and bargain collectively,\na purpose apparently conceived in the idea that independent organizations\nof workers and employers bargaining with each other on equal terms con-\nstitute the industrial set-up best suited to a democracy with an, as yet, com-\nparatively liberalistic economic system.\"\n\nOf course, it was hoped that such \"functioning trade unionism\" will\neventually also mean more peaceful industrial relations, with strikes and\nlockouts largely replaced by organized negotiations aided by mediation and\narbitration. Indeed, the Labor Relations act expresses the conviction that\nsuch will be the results of established collective bargaining:\n\nExperience has proved that protection by law of the right to organize and to\nbargain collectively safeguards commerce from injury, impairment or interrup-\ntion, and promotes the flow of commerce by removing certain recognized sources\n\n' Totalitarian states, on the other hand, have found governmentally controlled common\norganizations of workers and employers better suited to their political and economic sys-\ntems. The fact that trade unionism in the United States has come to be made govern-\nmentally enforceable might perhaps raise the question in one's mind as to the continued\n\"liberalistic\" character of this institution.\n",

Data obtained indicate\ndistribution of individual property holdings, not wealth distribution. Since (1) nominal\nestates are not probated, (2) some more than nominal estates wholly or partly escape\nprobate, and (3) not all probated estates are inventoried, data presented actually con-\nstitute a sample of the distribution of probated estates derived from those inventoried.\nProperty distribution among all adults dying is not shown, since the exact number and the\naverage value of nominal estates cannot be ascertained. The pattern of distribution is\nsimilar to that found in other studies. San Francisco shows a higher concentration of\nproperty than Alameda County. The two counties, separately and combined, display a\nhigher concentration of property in 1935 than in 1907.\n\nThis study of property distribution, based on probate data, is con-\nfined to the wholly urban county of San Francisco and the essentially\nurban county of Alameda in California. The bulk of the population of the\ntwo counties is concentrated in a metropolitan area consisting of the city\nof San Francisco, and a number of lesser cities across San Francisco Bay,\nincuding Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda, Piedmont, and Emeryville. Total\npopulation of the two counties was approximately 600,000 in 1907 and\n1,300,000 in 1935. These were the earliest and latest years in which rea-\nsonably adequate probate data could be obtained.'\n\nIn the tables below, estates of males and females were not separated as\nwas done in King's early study,? since such a separation seemed of doubtful\nvalue. To an increasing extent women as well as men have estates, and it\nseemed likely that this would be especially true of urban communities. The\nages 21 and over were selected instead of 25 and over as in King's study\ncited above, because of the greater inclusiveness.?\n\nA probate study of this kind shows distribution of individual rather than\nfamily estates. Only that part of the total family estate which is legally the\nproperty of the deceased is subject to probate. Moreover, even this individual\ndistribution is shown only incompletely, since estates of nominal size are\nnot probated, and since all or part of the individual estate of the deceased\nmay not be subject to probate, because of the manner in which it is held.*\nFinally, even the statistics of estates actually probated are incomplete, be-\ncause some estates probated are not inventoried. Thus the data obtained\nfor purposes of finding the property distribution represent fundamentally\nmerely a large sample of those estates of persons dying which were actually\nprobated.\n\n?

                    "Offset Checks: Further Reply\n\nIn his first discussion! of our article \"A Neglected Component of the Money\nSupply\" published in the Review in September, 1939, Mr. Villard contended\nthat we were defining deposit balances in an unusual manner. In his second dis-\ncussion appearing on another page of this issue he attempts to make the point\nthat we are using the concept \"velocity\" in an unusual manner. The authors feel\nthat a brief restatement of their analysis of the intra-account clearing process\nmay serve as the best answer to Mr. Villard.\n\nAnyone familiar with the activity that occurs in the bank account of a going\nbusiness concern is aware of the fact that a sizeable portion of the daily debits\ncharged to the account is matched at the time of bank posting by simultaneous\ncredit entries. In a recent investigation the authors sampled the accounts of\nbusiness firms in one of the leading banks in Ohio.? The daily debit and credit\ndata over a 27-month period in 15 commercial firms' accounts showed that 55\nper cent of the checks drawn during the period were offset at the times of bank\npostings by simultaneous credit entries. The percentage was 65 in a sample of\n14 industrial firms' accounts over the same period. The question then arose, \"Can\nthese offset checks be fairly regarded as representing transfers of deposit bal-\nances ?\"\n\nIf a deposit balance is defined as the net credit balance existing at any time\nin the account of a bank customer, it follows that credit entries to a bank account\nwhich are simultaneously matched by debit entries at the time of bank posting\nnever have the chance to appear as net credit balances and, therefore, cannot\nbe regarded as deposit balances. The fact remains, however, that the holder of\nthe account has drawn checks in payment of his obligations. Against what have\nthe checks been. drawn? Not against deposit balazces as defined above, but\n\nlarger \"offset checks\" will be relative to Dice and Schaffner velocity, other things equal.\nFor the economy as a whole \"offset checks\" equal all debits (or credits) and velocity is\nzero. See note 4 above.\n\n*If it were found that checks were completely \"offset\" in a given account, it could\nbe argued that this fact had demonstrated that the balance in question was not being held\nfor transaction purposes (although even this conclusion would not follow if banks were\nrequiring minimum balances). But complete \"offsetting\" of checks means simply that\nthe balance involved does not vary from posting to posting, and the mere existence of a\nbalance which does not fluctuate raises the question of why such a balance is being held,\nquite apart from elaborate computations regarding \"offset checks.\"\n\n* H.

Villard, \"A Note on Offset Checks as a Component of the Money Supply,\" this\nReview, Dec., 1939, pp. 798-799.\n\n* The authors are indebted to the Bureau of Business Research of Ohio State University\nfor aid in this investigation.\n",

S.\n388 (1938). The interpretation is found in an article in the December, 1939,\nissue of the Review.\n\nProfessor Mayer's comment indicates on its face misunderstanding of the\ninterpretation he challenges. After quoting from the article to the effect\nthat \"if the reasoning in this case (Pacific Gas and Electric) is consistently fol-\nlowed, there will be few, if any, occasions on which a rate order based upon\nhistorical cost will be distributed by the Supreme Court,\" Mr. Mayer proceeds to\nstate that \"if, in the future, complaining public utilities plead the confiscation\nissue directly, the cozrts will find nothing in the Pacific Gas and Electric decision\nto preclude their accepting and weighing reproduction cost evidence although\nthat evidence may have been rejected by the Commission. Consequently, it is\nentirely possible that many rate orders based on historical cost may be disturbed\nby the cozrts without doing violence to this decision.\"\n\nIt is quite apparent that the sentences quoted from our article deal exclusively\nwith the attitude of the Supreme Court toward historical cost. There is no sug-\ngestion in this quotation or in the whole article that the decision of the Supreme\nCourt precludes trial courts from \"accepting and weighing reproduction cost,\"\nwhen confiscation is the issue.\n\nIf the decision precluded the consideration of reproduction cost by trial courts\nthe statement that \"there will be few, if any, occasions on which a rate order\nbased upon historical cost will be disturbed by the Supreme Court\" would be\nmeaningless. If such courts were compelled by the Supreme Court to follow\nhistorical cost alone, then the Supreme Court would never disturb a rate order\nbecause it was based on such cost.\n\nThe interpretation suggested in our article can perhaps be best illustrated by\nsupposing that a trial court in a case where confiscation is the issue sustains a\nCommission order made on the basis of historical cost such as the order involved\nin the Pacific Gas and Electric case, and further that the court refuses to give\n",

                    "The Possibility of a Positively Sloped Demand Curve\nfor Labor\n\nIn a recent article! Mr. Sidney C. Sufrin examines the possibility of an increase\nin output and employment for a monopolistic firm resulting from a rise in wage\nrates, assuming no change in the demand curve for the product. Mr. Sufrin's\nconclusions are based upon the examination of a hypothetical case but it is neces-\nsary to determine the exact conditions under which the above situation is possible\nbefore valid conclusions of sufficient generality can be drawn. The possibility of\na positively sloped short-run demand curve for labor in periods of deep depression\nhas also been suggested by Mr. R. F. Harrod.? But as will be shown, the case\nof a positively sloped demand curve for labor need not be limited to those situa-\ntions where plants are operating in a stage of decreasing cost.\n\nAssuming the demand curve for labor to a firm selling in an imperfect market\nto be given by the product of marginal physical productivity and marginal\nrevenue, corresponding to each number of laborers employed, there are three\nconceivable situations for which this curve may be positively sloped. The most\nobvious case would be one in which both the marginal physica productivity\ncurve and the marginal revenue curve were positively sloped. Such a situation is\nprobably not likely, however. A second possibility would be one in which the mar-\nginal physical productivity curve is positively sloped and the marginal curve is\nnegatively sloped, provided of course that the demand for the product is not inelas-\ntic. This case will hold true within certain limits defined below. A rising marginal\nphysical productivity curve might occur when a plant is operating far below\noptimum capacity so that each additional worker employed together with the\nappropriate amounts of raw materials would yield increasingly larger increments\nto the total product. An example of this situation might be a case where the\nemployment of additional laborers would permit the use of machines which had\npreviously stood idle in the plant, and make possible economies of greater division\nof labor and technical efficiency to the extent that larger increments would be\nadded to the total product with each additional man employed. Production in a\nregion of increasing marginal physical productivity could occur only when firms\nare selling in imperfect markets, however. But in periods of low demand,\n\n* \"Monopolies and Labor Regulation,\" 744m. Ecoz. Rev., XXIX, Sept., 1939, pp. 551-552.\n\n*R. F. Harrod, \"Pigou's Theory of Unemployment,\" Ecoz. Jour., March, 1934, p. 27.\n\n*Increasing marginal physical returns would in general be accompanied by falling\nmarginal costs. If firms selling in a purely competitive market were operating in a stage\nof decreasing marginal costs, any firm could profitably expand its output at the prevailing\nprice since the demand for the product is perfectly elastic to the individual firm. Equilibrium\nfor the short-run will only be reached when the firms are all producing at a stage of rising\nmarginal cost and when marginal cost is equated to price for each firm. Hence a rising\nmarginal physical productivity curve for a firm selling in a purely competitive market is\nimpossible.\n",

                    "FUNDAMENTAL DEFICIENCIES OF THE AMERICAN\nPATENT LAW\n\nThe patent law is basic to the patent system. By analyzing the former we may explain the\nweaknesses of the latter.\n\nThe law makes certain rather obvious \"economic\" assumptions which are inapplicable to\nthe modern economy. But the most important\u2014and most fallacious\u2014assumption is its in-\ndividualistic conception of the process of invention. In fact, invention is a group process, the\nindividual contributions being relatively minor. In modern industrial research this is par-\nticularly so.\n\nA grant of separate proprietary rights over each inventive contribution thus imposes bar-\nriers to further innovation and reduction to practice of the whole. The economic system has\nhad to remove these barriers. But this has involved the creation of large patent pools, with\nconsequent dangers of injustice, and monopoly.\n\nIn addition, the confusion entailed by the application of the single patent to modern tech-\nnology has offered to the powerful legal methods of unfair competition. The result is often\ninjustice, perpetual legal monopoly over whole industries, and the danger, at least, of tech-\nnological retardation.\n\nThe patent law is not the same thing as the patent system. Our legal\nmethod of fostering technological advance is an ancient structure, almost\nthe same, basically and in detail, as it was three hundred years ago. But\nthe economic institutions which have grown up around this venerable\nlegal framework have so radically changed that it is difficult to believe\nthat the same law could possibly apply in the manner originally intended to\nthe new situation. In fact it does not. Economic change, motivated by the\ndynamic quest for profit, can use law, modify it, or ignore it. The resultant\nsystem may be more or less socially beneficent, more or less effective in ac-\ncomplishing its original purpose; in any event it will be different from that\noriginally contemplated by the unchanged legal prescriptions.\n\nThis paper does not attempt thoroughly to describe or evaluate the op-\neration of the patent 5j5/em. Its major interest is rather in the theory of the\npatent /aw. Law is society's means of conscious control. Because it is basic\nin the sense that economic institutions must develop within or about it, we\nmust understand the law before we can understand and evaluate the eco-\nnomic adaptations and the resultant synthesis. Insight into the problems\nof our present patent system may therefore be gained through analysis and\nevaluation of the preconceptions and rationale of the patent law, particu-\nlarly in the light of the major economic changes which have occurred since\nits conception.\n",

                    "PRODUCTIVITY, WAGE RATES, AND EMPLOYMENT\n\nOur economic system has demonstrated greater ability to produce goods than to\ndistribute the buying power to consume them. Spurgeon Bell's recent book attributes this\nshortcoming to the way productivity gains are distributed, with the implication that too\nmuch have been diverted to higher wage rates, and too little to lower prices. Re\u00e9xamination\nof his data reveals that the evidence is conflicting. Events, industry by industry, show that\nwage costs per unit shift closely with productivity, but that capital charges do not. While\nunit charges to consumers vary somewhat with productivity, and while output at times\nvaries with prices, the connection between productivity and prices is very dim. Productivity\ngains went largely to profits in the 1920's, and to consumers and wage rates in the 1930's.\nThese facts neither support nor contradict Bell's conclusions. They do suggest the need\nfor deeper theoretical investigation of the problem of the proper dynamic balance between\nproductivity, prices, profits, and wages, in the light of their repercussions on the distri-\nbution of income and on expenditure, savings, and investment, if full employment is to\nbe maintained,\n\nOne of the outstanding characteristics of our present economic system\nis that sharp increases in industrial production do not carry with them a\nvolume of expenditure sufficient to provide markets for the increased pro-\nduction. Four times in the past twelve years, in 1928-29, 1935, 1936-57,\nand late 1939, industrial production has spurted sharply upward, only to\nfall back as sales failed to keep pace with production. Whether this phe-\nnomenon be explained in terms of the failure of the propensity to invest\nto keep pace with the propensity to save, or whether it be explained in\nterms of the disappearance of the automatic readjustments of competitive\nmarkets as a result of monopolistic competition, the result is the same: our\neconomic system cannot find ways to move into consumption the goods\nwhich our technical productive apparatus stands ready to turn out in such\nabundance. While Russia suffers because her socialist economy cannot pro-\nduce the goods her population clamors to buy, we suffer because our cap-\nitalist institutions fail to generate the buying power to move into consump-\ntion the goods we can so readily produce. \u00c1s a consequence, millions of\nmen are unemployed.\n\nFacing this situation, any study which attempts to clarify the facts con-\ncerning the key elements in the problem must be given careful attention.\nThe latest Brookings publication, Productivity, Wages, and National In-\ncome, is such an attempt.' In the words of its jacket, \"it indicates how the\ngains from increasing productivity are distributed among the groups par-\nticipating in production and the consuming public; and the effects of the\nexisting distribution upon employment and national income.\"\n\nThis article does not attempt to review the book, in the sense of presenting\na careful appraisal of its workmanship with respect to statistical technique,\nobjectivity of presentation, conclusions reached, and their value to students\nand the profession. Questions which might be raised with respect to the\nsignificance of the index numbers used, or of their reliability when changing\n\n! By Spurgeon Bell, Brookings Institution, 1940.\n",

It might, however, affect some\ninstitutions adversely. Such a reduction was impossible so long as banks acted competitively.\nNow, however, that they can act in concert, it would be profitable to reduce the rate.\n\nShould the banks in any state reduce the rate to zero before similar action is taken by\nothers, there would be a net gain in income to the community taking action first. Under\nmonopolistic conditions the term interest applied to the deposit rate is really a misnomer.\nThe function of this payment is to place a restraint upon competition for investment.\nThough the banks pay the entire cost of this restraint, all other investors receive the\nbenefit in higher yields. In continuing to pay interest on deposits, the banks are, therefore,\nnot acting to maximize profits. The deposit rate could also be used as an instrument of\nmonetary policy to affect interest rates, investment, prices and output.\n\nWhy do banks pay interest on deposits?* What determines the rate; and\nwhat would happen if interest payments were reduced to zero? These three\nquestions have both practical and theoretical significance. During the last\nfew years the deposit rate has been continually revised downward, and it\nis now suggested that it can be reduced to zero. Administrative facilities\nnow make possible such a reduction by concerted action on a national scale,\nor by state and county banking associations in different geographical areas.?\nWhat would happen to bank earnings and assets if a zero rate were put\ninto effect? This is a problem in interest theory which, aside from a few\nremarks by Knut Wicksell, Ludwig Von Mises, and J. M. Keynes, has\nhardly been explored at all.\n\nThe following propositions will be advanced below:\n\nI. The conventional competitive theory of the deposit rate is inadequate and\ninconclusive.\n\nII. In a competitive banking system, interest must be paid by individual banks\nto attract reserves. The rate is a function of the loss-ratio and the loan\nrate of interest. The height of the deposit rate varies with the profitability\nof bank operations and an equilibrium rate of zero is theoretically possible.\n\nIII. In an oligopolistic situation such as the Big Five of England, the deposit\nrate would have a tendency in the short period to rise above the competitive\n\n' Since the payment of interest on interbank deposits has been prohibited, this discussion\nis concerned solely with customers' deposits.\n\n* Concerted and uniform action on the deposit rate was made possible in the United\nStates by Sec. 11 (b) of the Banking act of 1933 amending Sec, 19 of the Federal Reserve\nact; Sec. 324 of the Banking act of 1935, and Sec. 101 amending Sec. 12B of the F.R. act.\nThese confer powers upon the Federal Reserve and the F.D.LC. to fix the deposit rate.\nPrior to 1933 this rate was determined primarily by competition and clearing house regula-\ntions. For these and a history of the deposit rate see Part II of Commercial Banking Reform\nin tbe United States by Leonard L. Watkins, University of Michigan, 1938. On recent\nlegislation, see Watkins, chapter 6. State action is dependent upon statute. In Wisconsin,\nSection 220.04(6) of the statutes empowers the Banking Commission to issue orders with\nrespect to the deposit rate. No law, however, is necessary to permit county associations to\nmake voluntary agreements. These agreements have in fact been made in several counties\nfixing a deposit rate less than the maximum prescribed by either the state or federal au-\nthorities, and so far their legality has not been questioned, These agreements may not be\nenforceable at law as between the banks but such enforceability does not appear to be\nnecessary.\n"

                    "REINVESTMENT AND THE RATE OF INTEREST\n\nThe classical theory of investment, as exemplified in the work of Keynes, considers\nthat, ceteris paribus, a fall in the rate of interest brings about an increase in total invest-\nment. This may be true for net investment but it is not obvious for reinvestment. Unless\nit is true for both net investment and reinvestment, there does not exist an unequivocal\nguide for policy. \u00c0 change in the rate of interest operates on reinvestment by bringing\nnearer or postponing the abandonment and premature abandonment of existing capital.\nAn increase in the interest rate tends to increase in general the abandonment of existing\ncapital and also the premature abandonment of those capital goods which are to be re-\nplaced by goods of intermediate durability. But though the decision to abandon is hastened\nby the increase in the interest rate, this does not automatically swell the flow of reinvest-\nment. It may or may not. This, however, introduces a range of indeterminacy in the effect\nof a change in the interest rate on the flow of total investment which calls for further\nstudy.\n\n1l. It is the purpose of this paper to examine briefly the problem of the\nrelationship between the flow of reinvestment and the rate of interest.\nApparently it is tacitly assumed that reinvestment responds to a change in\nthe rate of interest in the same way as net investment, or at least does not\nbehave in such a way as to offset the effect of such a change on net invest-\nment.! Now, the classical position on the relationship between the rate of\ninvestment and the rate of interest may be expressed in the words\nof Keynes: \". . . if there is an increased investment in any given type of\ncapital during any period of time, the marginal efficiency of that type of capi-\ntal will diminish as the investment in it is increased . . . the rate of invest-\nment will be pushed to the point on the investment demand-schedule\nwhere the marginal efficiency of capital in general is equal to the market\nrate of interest.\"? This implies that a rise (or fall) in the rate of interest,\ncel. par., will decrease (or increase) the rate of investment; and in an\neconomy which is consuming its capital, this change in the interest rate will\nincrease (or decrease) the rate of capital consumption. But the rate of\ninvestment may be taken either gros; or nel, 7.e., with or without the rate\nof reinvestment.? The rate of reinvestment can be further subdivided into\ntwo rates, viz., the rate of reinvestment which arises from replacing exist-\ning machines with new ones of the same kind, and that which arises from\ntransferring over to new machines of a different kind. The former kind of\n",

In fact, he has a tendency to make the volume\nof net investment depend upon the volume of reinvestment, e.g., pp. 100-104.\n\n? [bid., pp. 136-137.\n\n? To distinguish between the two, it is necessary to define what is meant by \"maintain-\ning capital intact.\" This is very difficult to do in real terms, while in monetary terms, net\ninvestment may be defined unambiguously on an ex-post basis, following Keynes, as the\ndifference between Income and Consumption, op. cit., p. 62, or, following Ohlin, as the\ndifference between gross investment and disinvested capital, Pemmimgpoliti\u00a3, offentliga\narbeten, etc., Stockholm, 1934, pp. 8-9.\n",

Mexico's share in our imports, since\nthe expropriations of March, 1938, has fallen drastically as a result of the boycott of\nMexican oil by American companies. The selection in this manner of a base period during\nwhich special conditions were unfavorable to imports from Mexico is contrary to the\nprinciple insisted upon by the United States in the negotiation of trade agreements with\nforeign countries. This action weakens the bargaining position of the United States and\njeopardizes the principle of equal treatment embodied in the trade agreements program.\n\nBilateralism in international trade has put a severe strain on the \"most-\nfavored-nation\" policy, once accepted in principle by all great trading na-\ntions. Today the United States is almost alone in its practice of a commercial\npolicy aimed at extending the application of the principle to all phases of\ntrade regulation. Other countries hold that the most-favored-nation prin-\nciple is limited to tariff treatment, and does not apply to the newer direct\ncontrols. But we insist that equality of treatment must be extended to quotas\nand exchange controls also, otherwise the new devices will nullify equal\ntreatment in tariff rates. Consequently we have insisted that our exporters\nreceive a share in all foreign import quotas proportional to tbeir sbare in\ntbe imports for a previous \"representative period.\" 'This formula as incor-\nporated in the Hull trade agreements refers to customs quotas, which limit\nimports at special tariff rates, as well as to quotas which establish an abso-\nlute limit to imports.\n\nUsually it is the United States which insists upon the principle in order\nto get a \"fair\" share in someone else's quota, but there are several instances\nin which we ourselves have established customs quotas in connection with\ntariff reductions niade in trade agreements. The most recent case is the\ncustoms quota on fuel oil and crude petroleum established in the Vene-\nzuelan agreement. The import tax on these products has been halved for\nan amount not exceeding 5 per cent of the total crude petroleum processed\nin United States refineries during the previous year.\n\nImports in excess of this customs quota will have to pay the original tax.\nA subsequent proclamation by the President has assigned shares in the\nquota to our principal suppliers. Mexico, up to the time of the oil expro-\npriations the source of from 10 to 15 per cent of our oi] imports, has\nreceived a very small share, and the question arises, have we allocated the\noil quotas according to the formula we have demanded of others, or are\nwe scrapping our principle in order to discipline Mexico? The answer is\nimportant for the future of a commercial policy based on the most-favored-\nnation clause.\n\nSpecifically, have we discriminated against Mexico by the choice of a\nbase period which can in no way be said to be normal or representative?\nOn the basis of imports for the first ten months of 1939, Venezuela was\n",

                    "The analysis of Mr. Mikesell appears formally correct in its setting but ir-\nrelevant to my argument, since he has chosen to investigate a situation so com-\npletely different from mine. The more fundamental differences are obvious:\nwhereas my model: was an economy with imperfect factor and commodity\nmarkets and operating at less than full employment, he treats of perfect compe-\ntition, full employment, and homogeneous production functions. He also assumes\nthe precise and continuous operation of marginal productivity remuneration in its\nstrictest physical version, a condition patently at variance with the hypothesis\nof my paper. But the extent of other differences I am unable to determine from\nhis exposition. My attention was directed toward the results of minimum wage\nlegislation on the entire system, but Mr. Mikesell deals with product price, the\nproduction function, and other aspects of firm equilibrium. The best interpreta-\ntion which can be given is that\u2014if his argument 7; intended to explain general\neffects\u2014he refers to some symbolic or summary firm, a sort of weighted average\nfirm. Yet if this firm is to represent the whole economy, surely its appropriateness\nis vitiated by the other conditions he has posited. The first of these is that\nall prime costs are labor costs. This is a difficult premise for a macro-economic\nanalysis; it ignores, for example, user costs in the short period. But he further\nassumes, apparently, that there is but one wage-rate: that all units of the factor\nlabor get the same remuneration. Here lies an inexorable dilemma. If he does\n10t make this assumption, then an increase in the low wage-rate will not bring\nabout an equi-proportionate rise in prime costs (even if all prime costs are \"labor\"\nCosts) , and his argument collapses. If he Zoes make this assumption, however, he\nis not discussing a minimum wage situation at all but a generalized wage advance!\n\nIt is difficult to leave this note without the opinion that here stands an example\nof that \"reasoning based upon inapplicable premises\" which Mr. Hagen, my\nsecond commentator, deplores. I concur that the premises are inappropriate; but\nwhether they are inapplicable or not, they were not the premises of the article\nmy critic seeks to attack.\n\nWith the comments of Mr. Hagen, on the other hand, I am in general agree-\nment.

                    "TOWARD A CONCEPT OF WORKABLE COMPETITION\n\nThe paper of which this is an enlarged and revised version was read at a joint Round\nTable of the American Economic Association and the Econometric Society, during the\nmeetings at Philadelphia, December, 1939.\n\nWhere one of the conditions of perfect competition is absent, the presence of others\nmay lead to greater rather than less imperfection. Long-run curves of individual demand\nand cost are flatter than commonly represented, and the imperfections of competition corre-\nspondingly less. Industry subject to fluctuating demand requires prices in excess of short-\nrun marginal cost. Favorable conditions appear to include a sloping individual demand\ncurve, and some uncertainty whether a reduction of price will be promptly met.\n\nWith standardized products, a chaotic market tends toward ruinous competition. Pure\noligopoly is seldom found; the important case being that of openly-quoted prices with\nvarying amounts of deviations on actual sales. Standard products with sloping individual\ndemand curves are also possible.\n\nWhile extreme quality differentials approach monopoly, more moderate ones may be\nworkably competitive, especially with further growth of closer substitutes and better\nknowledge of qualities on the part of buyers.\n\nIL. Introduction\n\nTheories of imperfect and \"monopolistic\" competition have for some\ntime been current, in an unformulated state, in the field of economic policy;\nand important beginnings have been made at formulation by economic theo-\nrists. \u00c1s a necessary step in this last development, the conception of \"perfect\ncompetition\" has itself for the first time received really specific definition\nand elaboration. With this has come the realization that \"perfect competi-\ntion\" does not and cannot exist and has presumably never existed, for\nreasons quite apart from any inescapable tendency toward collusion, such\nas Adam Smith noted in his familiar remark on the gettings-together of\nmembers of a trade. What we have left is an unreal or ideal standard\nwhich may serve as a starting point of analysis and a norm with which to\ncompare actual competitive conditions. It has also served as a standard\nby which to judge them.\n\nI am not quarreling with proper use of this standard as an ideal. How-\never, it has seemed at times to lead to undesirable results, in that it does not\nafford reliable guidance to the factors which are favorable to the closest\navailable working approximation to that ideal, under actual conditions.\nWith this problem the present paper is concerned.\n\nThe theory of the subject has defined for us the results of various forms\nof imperfect competition\u2014some of the results being still debatable.

The introductory chapter discusses busi-\nness situations as they are apprehended by the business-man; distinguishes\ngroups of external factors that affect economic change; lists the statistical\nseries that may be used advantageously in continuous observation of the busi-\nness conjuncture; and ends with the expected conclusion that empirical link-\ning of factors and symptoms, as reflected in time series and other data, is\ninsufficient for the understanding of economic change, since observation of\nactual economic processes cannot distinguish between interwoven causes and\neffects. To make causal analyses a theoretical apparatus is indispensable.\n\n'This theoretical apparatus is presented in chapters 2 through 4. Chap-\nter 2 deals with equilibrium and the theoretical norm, 7.e., with the sta-\ntionary economy. Chapter 3 presents the entrepreneur, the innovation, and\nthe banking system\u2014the triple alliance that contributes a strategic impetus\nto economic evolution. Chapter 4 comprises the crux of Professor Schumpe-\nter's theory of business cycles, indicating how the behavior of entrepreneurs\nprovides the primary model for use in the study of business cycles; how this\nprimary model is complicated by consideration of secondary factors (errors,\npropagation through the credit system, etc.), and of the various types of\ncycles to which the primary and secondary factors give rise. These three\nchapters are to a large extent a summary of Professor Schumpeter's earlier\nwritings on the nature of a stationary economy and the theory of economic\nchange. But in chapter 2 comments on imperfect competition take account\nof recent developments in the field; and in chapter 4 business-cycle theory\nis expanded and extended materially beyond the somewhat bare statement\nof it in Professor Schumpeter's earlier writings.\n\nChapter 5 in Volume I discusses the bearing of the theoretical model\nupon the measurement of cycles in time series. Chapters 8 through 13 in\nVolume II deal with the behavior of various economic quantities in Great\nBritain, the United States, and Germany, for the pre-war period as repre-\nsented by annual data. The successive chapters discuss the general price\nlevel, physical quantities (total) and employment, prices and quantities\nof individual commodities, expenditures and wages, the rate of interest,\nthe central credit market and the stock exchange. These chapters may be\ntermed statistical, although this does not mean that they present a de-\ntailed statistical analysis of cycles in the various aspects of the economic\nsystem.

                    "INTEREST RATES FOR HOME FINANCING\n\nPrior to the present decade, the deficiencies of the financial system gave rise to un-\neconomical lending terms and to excessive rates of interest on home loans. The pronounced\nand continued upward sweep of the secular trend during the twenties deferred the inevitable\nconsequences, but the ensuing crisis brought the shortcomings into sharp focus. The\nrepercussions were national in scope and set into action various measures of reform to\ngive relief to home owners. This paper presents a summary of the activities of the Federal\nHome Loan Bank System, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, the Federal Savings and\nLoan System, and the Federal Housing Administration. The influence of these agencies on\ninterest rates is discussed, followed by an analysis of the justification of the existing rate\nlevel. It is shown that present rates are no longer the result of free market activity but\nare governed primarily by the rate established on FHA insured loans. There is now some\nquestion of the adequacy of rates to cover the attending costs of home-financing institutions.\n",

                    "One of the most striking phenomena of the trade depression of the past\ndecade is the trend of interest rates. It is difficult for many to accept the\nrealities of the existing level, and hence it is often characterized as \"arti-\nficial,\" \"temporary,\" \"unsound,\" etc. For the most part, this attitude is the\nresult of an emphasis upon historical perspective rather than concentration\nupon the unusual conditions which have prevailed in recent years. It is\ncommonly assumed that, with the correction of the existing abnormalities,\ninterest rates will inevitably be adjusted. However, the uncertainties of the\nassumption cast doubt upon any early realization of the deduction made.\nNot only is this true because of the unknown duration of these so-called\nabnormalities, but, in addition, various controls which have been developed\nwill likely continue to function over a much longer period.\n\nThe prevailing level of interest rates may also be questioned when related\nto the underlying forces of the demand for, and the supply of, capital. Many\ninfluences affecting these primary determinants of the cost of money en-\ncourage the conclusion that the present low level of interest rates is not\njustified in the light of economic conditions. Risks which are so comprehen-\nsive as to cause concern for the safety of the entire economy would seem\nto point in the direction of a rate sufficiently high to afford compensating\nprotection for those who supply the capital. In the face of these abnormal\nrisks, the rates of interest seem to be entirely inadequate.\n\nAs to the demand for capital, it is much more difficult to evaluate\nits vitality and persistency. There is much evidence of its potentiality where\nthere is reasonable availability of funds at what is considered to be an\nattractive rate, accompanied by favorable terms of loan repayment. Evi-\ndence of possible demand is found in the development of various govern-\nmental lending agencies such as the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, the\nReconstruction Finance Corporation, various agricultural lending groups,\nnot to mention the indirect facilities provided by the Federal Housing\nAdministration. Private lending institutions fail to display any great en-\nthusiasm for accommodation of the borrowers financed through these\n",

(See Supplement, March, 1940, p. 219.)\n\nThe theory of comparative cost has lately been replaced by more modern theories of\ninternational trade. This paper considers the relations between these different theories.\nHaberlers opportunity cost analysis emphasizes continuity with and similarity to the\nolder doctrine by taking as data the scales of relative prices established by the pricing\nprocess. Ohlin's general equilibrium theory is simply a more general and explicit formula-\ntion of the opportunity-cost doctrine. Though Ohlin, like Haberler, demonstrates that\nmutually beneficial trade is possible only where relative price scales differ, he is less\nconcerned with this result than with its underlying basis: the relative supplies of the\nproductive agents. Elaboration of this ultimate scarcity aspect of international trade is\nwhat distinguishes this theory and gives it superior explanatory value. For dealing with\nwelfare problems, the abbreviated opportunity-cost version is handier. Both modern\nformulations differ from the classical in that they assume a multiple, the latter a single-\nfactor world.\n",

                    "One of the leading objections to the classical theory of comparative cost\nhas been that it takes as its point of departure the long discarded labor-\ncost theory of value. Adoption of this theoretical base put modern sponsors\nof the doctrine of comparative cost in the anomalous position of accepting,\nfor those parts of their analysis concerned with a closed economy, the\nthoroughly modern theory of general equilibrium, while atavistically re-\nverting, for any discussion of international relations, to the rejected\nRicardian value principles. Recent years, however, have witnessed a thor-\noughgoing reformulation of the theory of international trade which unites\nit in a consistent fashion with the main corpus of equilibrium theory.\n\n\"The modern restatement of the principles of international trade has been\nchiefly associated with the names of Professors Ohlin and Haberler. These\nwtiters have provided us with two alternative approaches to an analysis of\ninternational trade, that of the former being explicitly formulated as an\nextension of the general theory of equilibrium,! that of the latter being\nexpressed in terms of opportunity cost? In a recent paper,? Professor\nHaberler indicated, rather briefly, some of the main relationships between\nhis approach and that of Professor Ohlin, as well as the line of connection\nwhich links his own theory with that of Ricardo. Except for these remarks,\nand occasional references in recent literature, I know of no discussion of\nthese matters. For this reason, and because the relationship of the oppor-\ntunity cost version of international trade theory to the general equilibrium\ntheory, on the one hand, and to the doctrine of comparative cost, on the\nother hand, is perhaps less apparent than it should be, it may not be amiss\nto devote a few pages to the task of clarifying these interconnections.\n\n' Bertil Ohlin, Igterregional and.

                    "UNION WAGE AND HOUR POLICIES AND EMPLOYMENT\n\nPaper presented at a Round Table Conference of the American Economic Association,\nDecember 28, 1939. (See Supplement, March, 1940, p. 227.)\n\nIn manufacturing industries and in bituminous coal mining, wage rates since 1933\nhave been greatly increased and hours of work have been substantially reduced. Proponents\nof these changes have insisted that such wage and hour policies would increase total pur-\nchasing power and increase employment. The evidence presented below does not sub-\nstantiate these claims. In fact, employment in bituminous coal mining was lower in 1937\nthan in 1929 when production was not so great, and employment in 87 manufacturing\nindustries was slightly lower in 1939 than in 1929 when production was about the same.\nIn bituminous coal mining and in manufacturing industries money payrolls were about\n10 per cent below those of 1929, although, owing to a decline in the cost of living, real\npayrolls were higher than in 1929.\n\nA more detailed study of bituminous coal mining shows the changes in per capita in-\ncome, employee productivity, mechanization, costs, and sales income that were associated\nwith increases in wage rates and decreases in hours that were introduced beginning in 1934.\n\nThere is no one wage and hour policy to which all unions subscribe.\nGenerally speaking, unions like most employers sell their product at the\nbest price and under the best conditions that they can obtain. What price\nthey can command depends on many factors. In the short run if the in-\ndustry is a profitable one, as for example petroleum refining and automobile\nmanufacturing, and if the union has substantial bargaining power and its\nleadership is able and aggressive, relatively high wages and short hours\nof work may be attained. On the other hand, if the industry is faced with\nruinous competition and overdevelopment, as for example in cotton and\ncertain other textile industries, particularly if the scope of union organization\nis not industry-wide, the workers will have to content themselves with\nrelatively ow annual earnings and with relatively long hours.\n\nOther factors which affect wage and hour levels are (1) the character\nof the demand for the product, that is, whether the demand is elastic or\ninelastic, (2) the proportion that labor costs constitute of the total cost\nof production, (3) the economic organization and financial structure of\nthe industry, (4) competition from substitute products, (5) general busi-\nness conditions, and (6) the relation of capacity to demand. Because of the\noperation of these factors, wage and hour levels and policies vary by regions,\nmarkets, industries, and often establishments.\n\nIn a number of industries, unions, like employers in numerous instances,\nhave successfully maintained the price of their product during periods of\ndrastic deflation. In the anthracite industry, for example, the union has not\ntaken a single wage reduction since the Award of the Anthracite Strike\nCommission of 1903 and in the building and construction industry it is not\nuncommon for organized crafts to retain their nominal wage rates during\nperiods of depression. In other industries, unions, like employers on numer-\n",

                    "OBJECTIONS TO THE 100 PER CENT RESERVE PLAN\n\nCertain objections to 100 per cent reserves are commonly overlooked. In case of bank\ncredit, the real lenders are the depositors including, notably, the recipients of checks.\nIt is these whose convenience waiting is combined and co\u00f3rdinated by the banks and made\navailable to borrowers who pay for free banking service to depositors. The 100 per cent\nreserve scheme would make this free service impossible unless subsidized and might con-\nceivably bring disappearance of deposit banking. Subsidization objected to; perpetual\ngovernment debt as means to idea of 100 per cent objected to. Why precisely 100 per cent?\nA sacred number? Possible resulting growth of new type of financial institution through\nwhich we could still get deflation. Why henceforth deprive depositors of possibility of\nfree banking service?\n\nA number of economists who favor a managed currency, with the idea of\npromoting stabilization of the general level of prices, have accepted\u2014a little\ntoo uncritically, I think\u2014the idea of 100 per cent reserves. Objections\nwhich I cannot but believe have some importance, seem to have been gen-\nerally overlooked.\n\nOne of the principal features of commercial banking, as we know it\ntoday, is free service to depositors, whereby business can be carried on by\ncheck and the clerical work of transferring credits from the makers of\nchecks to the depositors of checks is done without fee\u2014though the depres-\nsion has brought in, to some extent, the service charge. It is because the\nbanks have been able to \"lend more than they have,\" because, in short,\nthey have not been compelled to maintain a 100 per cent reserve, that they\nhave been able to render this service to depositors without charge.\n\nOf course the banks do not really lend more than they have, except as\nintermediaries or agents for the real lenders. What the banks do is to\nbring borrowers and lenders together. And the lenders are the bank de-\npositors. Let us suppose the banks to lend, in the aggregate, several times\nas much money as they have on hand. The borrowing accomplishes nothing\nfor those who receive the deposits until they use their newly acquired credit\nfor the purchase of goods, by writing checks on this credit. When they\nhave done this, they no longer have claims on the lending banks. But the\nrecipients of their checks have these claims. Clearly, the banks could not\nthus lend more than they have on hand and have the lending mean any-\nthing, if the recipients of the checks drawn on this credit were, every one\nof them, to insist at once upon taking the money out of the banks. I/ ir\nIhe recipients of tbe checks, therefore, wbo are really the lenders. They\nhave given up tangible goods or services and are waiting for payment. For\nthe checks they have received are but claims on the banks. And the recipients\nof these checks are still but claimants on the banks after the checks have\nbeen turned in, until they have actually drawn out the money owed to them\nor until they have, in their turn, made purchases and passed to others\nthe claims they hold on the banks. These others then become the claimants\non the banks. If all the borrowers of all the banks failed to repay, is it not\n",

                    "RAILROAD COSTS IN RELATION TO THE VOLUME OF TRAFFIC\n\n\"The fact that for the railroads, as for any enterprise, the cost of production is affected\nby the volume of product merits some further consideration. This is true particularly with\nrespect to the relative variability of the several items of cost. When the four main divisions\nof expense for the Class I railroads are compared with the variations in traffic volume\nover the period from 1922 to 1938, it is found that the items which vary most closely\nwith traffic are actually those which have commonly been presented as comprising the\nlargest \"constant\" components (and conversely).\n\nThis failure of the facts to support the common pronouncements results from the im-\nplicit assumption of standards which are essentially rigid. This assumption, and the pro-\nnouncements based upon it, do not hold for periods longer than approximately a month.\nWhen considered over a longer period the variable element in all operating costs stands\nout as the dominant characteristic. This has some significance in connection with the\ndoctrine of increasing returns; for the extent to which costs are variable directly affects\nthe increase in returns, as the volume of traffic increases.\n\nThe point has been made frequently that fixed or constant costs absorb\nan abnormally large portion of the income of a railroad. The term \"con-\nstant costs,\" as used here, refers to those elements in the expenses of a\nrailroad which are essentially independent of, or not functionally related\nto, the volume of business handled. This constant characteristic has been\npointed out particularly with respect to maintenance expenditures, and\ngeneral expenses. Ripley has said \". . . only about two-thirds of the total\nexpenditures of a railroad are applied to operation, the remaining third\nbeing devoted to capital account. Moreover, of these two-thirds of the\ntotal applied to operating outlay, only about one-half responds to azy\nchange in the tonnage, the other half being constant up to a certain\npoint.\"* What this point is Ripley does not say. He admits that the state-\nment implies a given standard of service, and maintenance, as well as a\ngiven stage of technological development, but apparently does not consider\nit necessary to develop the point. That the \"constant costs\" grow with\nthe growth of traffic over a period of years, however, is implicit in his con-\ntention that they remain about two-thirds of the total.\n\nThe use of the term \"constant\" in referring to any costs is dangerous\nbecause it suggests an invariability which does not exist, even for relatively\nshort periods. Moreover, no costs are altogether independent of the volume\nof business. Given a certain volume of business, on the average, for a\nperiod of time, then certain expenditures will be made whether that volume\nof business is moving at the moment or not. But in any business the cost\nof production is affected by variations in the volume of product; and this\nis true for a// costs when the variations are large, or extended over a con-\nsiderable period of time. Railroads are not essentially different from other\nenterprises in this respect.\n\nThe difference in variability among the several elements of cost is\nessentially relative. The relation of costs to the volume of traffic may be\neither direct or indirect. This more accurately states the difference between\n\n!W. Z. Ripley, Railroads, Rates and.

Such\ncourses have lost contact with their major objective\u2014the application of economic theory\u2014\nand have become adjuncts of the school of commerce rather than the social science of eco-\nnomics. Public Finance and Labor Problems are unfortunate cases in point. Courses and\ntextbooks in specialized fields must go beyond mere descriptive, technical material and\nbuild upon the foundation of economic principles used as a kit of tools designed for the\nstudy of the operation of the economy as a whole. The lack of unity charge should be\naddressed to the specialist in applied fields rather than to economic theory. Any study\nof a phase of the operation of an economy as a whole can be illuminated by the use of\neconomic principles, but systematic theory can never unify technical, structural, adminis-\ntrative studies of business\u2014a r\u00f3le for which it was never intended.\n\nHas Economic Theory Lost Its R\u00f3le of a Unifying Agent?\nIn 1919, Professor Walton H. Hamilton wrote:\n\nThe task of a general body of theory in any subject is to give unity to its\ninvestigation. At present economics is badly in need of such a unifying agent.\nIts sprawling frontiers reach from value theory across money, taxation, and\ntransportation to salesmanship, insurance and advertising. Each of these subjects\nhas its own personnel. Those who seek truth in these remote fields of inquiry\nknow little and care less for value theory. . .. As a result economics today tends\nto break up into a large number of overlapping but unrelated inquiries and to\nlose the unity which in times past has been its source of strength.!\n\nProfessor Wesley C. Mitchell voiced the same lament in 1925 asserting\nas an example that economic theory \"plays a small r\u00f3le in our work as\nspecialists in public finance. . . .\"? Professor Willard E. Atkins continued\nthe lament in 1935 stating:\n\nPart of the unrest has been indicated by the drift of teachers into business fields\nand into schools of commerce. From outside positions they have thrown back\nat the traditional economists the charge that their teachings are unreal?\n\nI quite agree with these writers that economic theory should be a\nunifying agent which specialists in the fields located on the periphery of\neconomics could ignore only at the risk of placing in peril their reputa-\ntion as specialists.

                    "TREATMENT OF CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS IN THE\nTEACHING OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\nPaper presented at a Round Table Conference of the American Economic Association,\nDecember 27, 1939.\n\nThe teacher of political economy cannot be \"neutral\" in controversial questions, \"giving\nall sides\" and letting it go at that. Such questions are not isolated, but fit into a pattern\nof development which will be different for different teachers. The teacher is not so much\nan advocate of views as he is a reporter on observations. The honest teacher makes himself\nthe ally of history as he understands it; believing that after all economics is an art rather\nthan a science, he necessarily makes room for deliberate social purpose. The usefulness of\nquantitative methods should not blind us to the essentially qualitative character of the\nsubject. Every great teacher of political economy had a thesis. Those who refused to take\na position added little to thought or action, and are forgotten, \"Indoctrination\" does not\nimply neglect to explore and to refute. It means simply scrupulous inspection plus earnest\nrecommendation.\n\nIn political economy, over a period, principle derives from practice, and\nnot the other way round. Sanction follows social convenience. Evolution in\ndoing compels evolution in doctrine. This does not mean that local and\ntemporary and partisan interest can immediately alter received rules. And\nwhere there is a wider and more permanent change of advantage, there is\nstill the celebrated lag which makes for gradual warping rather than sudden\nabandonment of old theorems. It is commonplace that a minority equipped\nwith control of the social means of production may for long keep law and\nmorals on its side. But in the economist's beloved \"long run\" we learn by\nliving, and do not live by learning.\n\nThis is lesson number 1 in the teaching of political economy. Unless one\nrecognizes that in economic life there is no absolute, and that trends in\nthought follow trends in performance, he is not attempting to study social\nbehavior but is trying to define a theology. Writings reduced to something\nlike system the elaborate opportunism which went by the name of mercantil-\nism. After these coercive public policies had been eaten into by private\ninitiative, the Jaissez faire philosophy was seized upon eagerly because it\njustifed what was already familiar conduct. And now that individualist\nenterprise has grown out of all anticipated proportions, and thus taken on,\ninevitably, the collectivist character, the propriety of public control is again\nurged. This is historical development, with the unexpected becoming, after\na time, orthodox.\n\nThere have been variants, of course, within the larger cycle. Consider the\ndissent from classical doctrine inspired by American geographical and eco-\nnomic conditions at the beginning of the last century. Here was a country\nnot of decreasing but of increasing returns, in which accessions to popula-\ntion meant not resort to poorer natural resources but to richer, with the con-\nsequence of a larger product for each worker. Instead of growing economic\nstringency, as in old countries, there was progressive liberation. In place of\nattention to the division of labor, association of labor was the need. The\n",

Socialist economists take\nthe opposite view that society best serves its own interests by regulating the\neconomic activities of individuals.

He, however, confines this qualification to\ncases of non-perfect (as he calls it) competition, of the non-tangency sort. On\npage 476, he says:\n\n\"In the analysis of perfect competition, the maximization of profits by entre-\npreneurs is a situation that must exist ex defimitione. First, we are accustomed\nto defining normal profit as the transfer cost' of entrepreneurship; i.e. the\namount which is necessary to keep the firm in operation. Second, we exclude\nsuper-normal profits from the case of perfect competition. Therefore, entre-\npreneurs under perfect competition 7245/? maximize profits or disappear alto-\ngether. The same analysis applies to the \"tangency case\" of monopolistic com-\npetition.\"\n\nNot at all. It is normal profit that must exist ex defimitione in a perfectly\ncompetitive situation\u2014and normal profit is a purely subjective matter. It is that\nprofit which just induces the entrepreneur to stay in the business. In monetary\nterms, it could be zero or even negative, though either of these is unlikely as a\ncontinuing phenomenon. It might very well be positive but less than what the\nentrepreneur might earn in some other line of activity, or even in the same line\nof activity, if he so wished. And the same reasons might deter an entrepreneur\nfrom maximizing his money profits under perfect, as under non-perfect, competi-\ntion. That is, he might produce beyond the point at which his money profits are\na maximum, counting the \"prestige\" attaching to the management of a large\nbusiness, for example, as sufficient or more than sufficient to compensate him\nfor the profits that he gives up. Or, he might sell at a lower price\u2014although\nfeeling that he might sell all he wished at a higher price\u2014for philanthropic\nreasons, for example. Or he might pay wages higher than the market, for ethical\nreasons or for \"the feeling of righteous self-satisfaction that goes with it.\"\n\n\"That profits are a maximum in perfectly competitive markets is true in current\nliterature, only by assumption. We do exclude supernormal profits from the case\nof perfect competition, but only because we assume that normal pros are maxi-\nmum profits. Incidentally, of course, the types of monopoly equilibrium, described\nby Mrs. Robinson, for example, are true only by assumption. We conclude that\nthe individual entrepreneur will produce that output at which marginal revenue\nequals marginal cost, only because we assume that he will attempt to maximize his\nnet money profit. Actually, to assume that an individual's net money profit will be\na maximum is to assume that he will equate marginal revenue and marginal\ncost. Any other assumption concerning the objective of business-men will lead to\na different equilibrium position. In the absence of knowledge concerning the ob-\njectives of business-men, it is impossible to determine that equilibrium position.\nWe must say, as the older economists used to say, that the individual entrepreneur\nwill attempt to maximize his net advantage (whatever that may be).

                    "Reply by Mr. Higgins\nI realize from Professor Lynch's note that I used the term \"profits\" somewhat\nambiguously. In the passage that he quotes, the \"profits\" that must be maximized\n\n?Jtalics his.\n",
                    "he points out that the assumption that individual producers will attempt to\nmaximize their profits is only one of many assumptions that might be made in\nthe analysis of any particular case. He, however, confines this qualification to\ncases of non-perfect (as he calls it) competition, of the non-tangency sort. On\npage 476, he says:\n\n\"In the analysis of perfect competition, the maximization of profits by entre-\npreneurs is a situation that must exist ex defimitione. First, we are accustomed\nto defining normal profit as the transfer cost' of entrepreneurship; i.e. the\namount which is necessary to keep the firm in operation. Second, we exclude\nsuper-normal profits from the case of perfect competition. Therefore, entre-\npreneurs under perfect competition 7245/? maximize profits or disappear alto-\ngether. The same analysis applies to the \"tangency case\" of monopolistic com-\npetition.\"\n\nNot at all. It is normal profit that must exist ex defimitione in a perfectly\ncompetitive situation\u2014and normal profit is a purely subjective matter. It is that\nprofit which just induces the entrepreneur to stay in the business. In monetary\nterms, it could be zero or even negative, though either of these is unlikely as a\ncontinuing phenomenon. It might very well be positive but less than what the\nentrepreneur might earn in some other line of activity, or even in the same line\nof activity, if he so wished. And the same reasons might deter an entrepreneur\nfrom maximizing his money profits under perfect, as under non-perfect, competi-\ntion. That is, he might produce beyond the point at which his money profits are\na maximum, counting the \"prestige\" attaching to the management of a large\nbusiness, for example, as sufficient or more than sufficient to compensate him\nfor the profits that he gives up. Or, he might sell at a lower price\u2014although\nfeeling that he might sell all he wished at a higher price\u2014for philanthropic\nreasons, for example. Or he might pay wages higher than the market, for ethical\nreasons or for \"the feeling of righteous self-satisfaction that goes with it.\"\n\n\"That profits are a maximum in perfectly competitive markets is true in current\nliterature, only by assumption. We do exclude supernormal profits from the case\nof perfect competition, but only because we assume that normal pros are maxi-\nmum profits. Incidentally, of course, the types of monopoly equilibrium, described\nby Mrs. Robinson, for example, are true only by assumption. We conclude that\nthe individual entrepreneur will produce that output at which marginal revenue\nequals marginal cost, only because we assume that he will attempt to maximize his\nnet money profit. Actually, to assume that an individual's net money profit will be\na maximum is to assume that he will equate marginal revenue and marginal\ncost. Any other assumption concerning the objective of business-men will lead to\na different equilibrium position. In the absence of knowledge concerning the ob-\njectives of business-men, it is impossible to determine that equilibrium position.\nWe must say, as the older economists used to say, that the individual entrepreneur\nwill attempt to maximize his net advantage (whatever that may be). Truly,\nempirical research is needed, as Mr. Higgins suggests.\n\nEDWARD S. LYNCH\n\nIowa State College\n"

The issue of confisca-\ntion was not involved.? If, in the future, complaining public utilities plead the\n",
                    "procedural point of view, evidence of cost of reproduction may be considered\nas having received adequate weight if it is carefully examined, even though\nthe evidence is found to be without force. But it does not follow that evidence\nof cost of reproduction would be given sufficient weight in a confiscation case if\nit were merely carefully examined. Here the courts look to the actual results in\ndollars and cents, and it might very well be that a commission's refusal to give\nactual weight to cost of reproduction would result in rates unfairly low in the\neyes of the court. The force of the O'Fallon decision, in fact, is that the cost\nof reproduction must receive weight in the final result, provided, of course, that\nthe evidence is substantial.*\n\nHad the issue in the Pacific Gas and Electric case been one of adequacy of\nrates, the decision of the Court might have been different. So much seems to\nbe implied by the following words: \"Respondent was entitled to contest the\nvalue thus placed upon its properties, or any part of them, to insist that the\nvalue taken as the rate base was too low, and that in consequence the prescribed\nrates were confiscatory. That was the issue upon which the court below should\nhave passed.\"\n\nWhile it may be true that a majority of the Supreme Court does favor historical\ncost, it can hardly be said that the Pacific Gas and Electric case establishes this\nfact. There is yet no reason to conclude that the Court has necessarily departed\nfrom its position in the Los Angeles Gas case, where it said: \"And mindful of\nits distinctive function in the enforcement of constitutional rights, the Court\nhas refused to be bound by any artificial rule or formula which changed condi-\ntions might upset.\"5 It appears that \"fair value\" is still a matter of judgment\nsubject to judicial review.\n\n\"P .

                    "Comment on the Pacific Gas and Electric Case'\n\nIn the December, 1939, issue of the Review there appeared an article which\nconsidered, along with other matters, the significance of the recent decision of the\nSupreme Court of the United States in the Pacific Gas and Electric case? The\nauthors summarize their conclusion in the following words: \"It may be inferred\nthat a majority of the Supreme Court now looks with favor upon the use of\nhistorical cost as the rate-base. No other conclusion is possible in view of the\nfact that the California Commission in this latest case expressly declared its\nadherence to historical cost and that it flatly refused to give any consideration to\nreproduction cost. . . . It seems rather clear that if the reasoning in this case is\nconsistently followed, there will be few, if any, occasions on which a rate order\nbased upon historical cost will be disturbed by the Supreme Court.\"? Since this\ncondusion might be taken to mean that the Supreme Court is at last ready to\nplace its stamp of approval upon the use of historical or original cost in confisca-\ntion cases, the discussion of this important decision should be carried a step\nfurther.\n\nThe question before the Court was not one of confiscation, but of procedure.\n\"As the District Court did not deal with the issue of confiscation and the\nevidence is not before us, we are concerned only with the question of procedural\ndue process, that is, whether the Commission in its procedure, as distinguished\nfrom the effect of its order upon respondent's property rights, failed to satisfy the\nrequirements of the Federal Constitution.\" And the particular procedural point\nin dispute related to the method by which the California Commission arrived at\nits result. The Commission had considered evidence as to cost of reproduction,\nbut in fixing the rate base it had given weight and effect solely to historical cost.\nThe precise issue was whether the refusal of the Commission to give weight to the\ncost of reproduction constituted a denial of procedural due process of law.\n\nThe Court held that the procedure of the Commission did not deny the com-\npany due process. It found that the Commission had duly weighed the evidence\nas to reproduction cost, and had cast it aside as unsatisfactory; but that it had\nnevertheless based its valuation upon ample evidence. \"The Commission was\nentitled to weigh the evidence introduced, whether relating to reproduction cost\nor to other matters. The Commission was entitled to determine the probative\nforce of respondent's estimate. That the Commission did so is apparent from\nboth its statement to that effect and the reasons it gives for considering these\nestimates to be without positive value. . . . Nor did the ruling with respect to the\nweight of evidence as to reproduction cost leave the Commission without\nevidence of the value of respondent's property. We have frequently held that\nhistorical cost is admissible evidence of value. . . . In the instant case we cannot\nsay that the Commission in taking historical cost as the rate base was making a\nfinding without evidence and therefore arbitrary.\"\n\nIn other words, this decision only reiterates a well established principle of pro-\ncedure\u2014namely, that it is essential to examine and give appropriate weight to all\npertinent evidence of value, so that a decision will not be arbitrary.

                    "THE SHORT VIEW AND THE LONG IN ECONOMIC POLICY\n\nPresidential Address Delivered at the Fifty-second Annual Meeting of the American\nEconomic Association, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, December 27, 1939\n\nOnce upon a time an academic economic theorist, by some freak of fate\nnot likely to be often repeated, got himself slightly entangled in the machin-\nety of formulation of government economic policy. What I plan to tell you\ntonight reflects largely, though not I hope too explicitly, what the process\nof policy-formulation did to his academic theorizing, and what his theoriz-\ning failed to do to the process of policy-formulation.\n\nAs an active participant in the policy-making process, the academic\ntheorist suffers from a number of handicaps more or less peculiar to him-\nself. For purposes of teaching, or of acceptable writing for his restricted\naudience of fellow-theorists, his conclusions are of little importance; and\nwhat matters above all is the rigor and elegance of his manner of reaching\nthem. For policy, on the other hand, conclusions are vital, and often are\nall that is vital. For the purposes of academic theorizing, the premises\nthe theorist starts from may without serious penalty be arbitrarily selected,\nnarrowly restricted in range, and purely hypothetical in nature. But the\nselection of premises controls the conclusions reached, and for policy-\ndetermination it is therefore vital that all the important variables be\ncovered by the analysis, and that the conclusions be not affected by the use\nof premises which are irrevelant for their purposes or less realistic than\nit is possible with the aid of available information to make them. To vio-\nlate these rules in policy-making is to be guilty of the grossest irresponsi-\nbility. If he is not to be wholly in the way of the policy-maker, therefore,\nthe theorist must emerge from his ivory tower, \u2014which is almost as hard\nas to return to it.\n\nThe theorist's habitual methods of analysis are such as to lead to \"right\"\nor \"wrong\" answers to manufactured problems, the premises and the\ncriteria of rightness being so chosen as to make this not only possible but\nnecessary. For the policy-maker, however, the problems are for the most\npart not of his own devising, but are presented to him by outside forces,\nin vague and ill-defined fashion, and what he asks of his advisers con-\n\nsists as much of help in determining what the problems are as of help\nin finding solutions for them. The theorist here is likely to find himself\nuninformed and unskilled.\n",

                    "ACHILLES' HEELS IN MONETARY STANDARDS\n\nThe international gold standard fell in an epidemic of Midas' disease but it was at-\ntacked through its own Achilles heel. The attempt to maintain a fixed price for any com-\nmodity which may rise, but not fall, in money value, is, in the long run, all but hopeless.\nImportant paper currencies were stronger than the gold currencies so long as they were\nkept flexible in gold value but they became at least as vulnerable as any gold currency\nwhen a relative fixity of exchange rates was sought and, still more, when a rise in their\ngold value was precluded and a fall regarded with equanimity or deliberately designed. A\nflexible exchange value of a currency, within a not very narrow zone around the \"point of\nequilibrium,\" is essential to forestal] the success of bear speculators and defeat of the\nexchange policy. The vulnerability of a currency to speculative attacks is coeval with other\nweaknesses in any currencies yet adopted. A money with a goods, rather than a gold, reserve\noffers the greatest promise not only of invulnerability but also benefaction.\n\nThe international gold standard has now, for some years, been moribund,\nif not dead. It is true that the United States, in somewhat unconvincing\nfashion, still proclaims its adhesion and allegiance to the royal metal. So\nfar, however, as money is concerned, it is in no better state than China used\nto be when it had a metallic monetary standard (silver), of equal virtue\nwith gold, maintained in isolation from the rest of the world.\n\nFor many decades the allegedly outstanding advantage of the gold stand-\nard was its international character. One or the other (or both) of the great\ninternational currencies, the pound sterling and the dollar, was always\nsynonymous with gold, and adherence to gold therefore meant stable ex-\nchange rates against at least one of these important currencies. With the\ngeneral abandonment of gold standards, the advantage of automatically\nstable exchange rates is now lost except, possibly, for the dollar as against\nthe Belgian franc.' In purchasing power, gold has not, over a lengthy pe-\nriod, been more stable than silver, and it has not been as stable as a well-\nmanaged paper currency. The maintenance of a gold standard which is no\nlonger used in the bulk of international transactions therefore involves\ngold-standard countries, in equa] degree with silver or paper-using nations,\nin the uncertainties of exchange, and, in possibly greater degree, in the un-\ncertainties of price levels. No authentic gold currency, nor any potential\nbloc of such currencies, is likely to take the former or present place of\neither the pound or the dollar in international transactions, so that, while\npresent conditions continue, the dollar or any similar near-gold currency is\nsubject to all the exchange vicissitudes which affect its neighbors. Gold has,\nmoreover, rather less potential stability in real value than of yore. There\nnow seems little reason, therefore, for giving gold a place, of rig^t, in our\nmonetary system.\n\nThe international gold standard fell in an epidemic of Midas' disease\n\n! Exchange rates are, of course, a two-sided matter and no stability of any one cur-\nrency, in gold value or anything similar, will now, of itself, provide stability in the rate\nof exchange against other currencies. The Belgian currency, however, is, rather uncertainly,\ntied to gold; and the dollar-belga rate is substantially stable.\n",

                    "MONOPOLY ELEMENTS IN RENT\n\nThe concept of land ownership as a monopoly is old, but it reappears in new and\naltered form in Professor Edward Chamberlin's theory that urban rent is a purely\nmonopoly income, while agricultural rent is purely competitive. This theory, based on a\nconfusion of the markets for re/a/] goods and agricultural products, on the one hand,\nand the markets for retail sites and farm lands, on the other, seems definitely invalid.\nThe markets for both retail sites and farm lands are imperfectly competitive; and the\nrent, in both cases, is an imperfectly competitive return.\n\nLand ownership has often been referred to as a monopoly. Adam Smith's\nwell known dictum that \"the rent of land . . . is naturally a monopoly\nprice\" was followed, in some cases with modifications, by Malthus, Senior,\nJ. S. Mill, Henry George, and by a few recent economists. This doctrine\nhas not hitherto met general acceptance, but Professor Chamberlin has\nrecently given it new prestige in his TPeory of Monopolistic Competition\nin which he has formulated the novel theory, that while agricultural rent\nis a purely competitive return, urban rent is a \"pure monopoly return.\"\n\nProfessor Chamberlin finds many differences between agricultural land\nand urban land, and between agricultural rent and urban rent. He contends\nthat a business site confers no advantages analogous to superior fertility in\nagricultural rent; that one site \"is capable of Producing as large a quantity\nof retailing services as another\u2014there are no differences in fertility and no\nscarcity whatever of the best land in this respect\"; that marginal and sub-\nmarginal land anywhere\u2014 practically free land\u2014is as \"fertile for selling\nputposes\" as the best shopping site in New York City. Urban rent, which\nis entirely location rent, is quite different even from location rent of farm\nland; for the location rent of farm land is due to differences in the cost of\ntransportation to the market, but the urban land \"carries its market with it.\"\nThe market for agricultural products is purely competitive, allowance being\nmade for differences in transportation costs; there are many buyers and\nsellers, as required for pure competition, and any seller can dispose of an\nindefinitely large amount of product at the prevailing price. \"The retail\nmarket, on the other hand, contains monopoly elements, for the factor of\nconvenience differentiates the product spatially.\" Since buyers do not move\nabout with entire freedom, the owner of any particularly convenient site,\naccording to Professor Chamberlin, has a monopoly of the use of the site,\nand receives a monopoly rent. His site affords a market which is, to a degree,\ndistinct from the whole; and the amount of product he can dispose of at\nthe prevailing price is not indefinitely large\u2014as in pure competition.\n\nIt is not difficult to agree with much of Professor Chamberlin's argument.\nIt is quite true that the advantages afforded by good business sites are dif-\nferent in some respects from those afforded by good land; that low-rent sites\n\n\"Third ed., pp. 112, 113, and Appendix D. Professor Chamberlin considers only the\nrent of agricultural land and of urban land devoted to retailing.\n",

The Report of the Committee on National Debt and\nTaxation (1927), the Economics of Taxation. (1924) by Harry Gunnison Brown, and\nFirst Principles of Public Finance (1936) translation, by de Viti de Marco, are among the\nnoteworthy exceptions. \u00c0merican writers in public finance generally have emphasized the\ndescriptive aspects of particular death duties.\n\nNo less than four different conclusions of death duty incidence may be distinguished.\nThese vary from the view that death duties are without burden, provided that substantially\nthe whole of the estate is taken by such taxation, to conclusions that the incidence of death\ntaxes is on the predecessor, the successor, or jointly, and in indeterminate proportions upon\nboth the predecessor and the successor.\n\nThe view of incidence which it is believed may be most strongly supported is that the\nburden of death duties, including taxes directed to the estate as a whole as well as the\ndistributive shares, is upon the predecessors. Incidence from this point of view is inter-\npreted with reference to the immediate burden of such taxation, and is distinguished from\nthe subsequent economic and other effects which result therefrom.\n\nAlthough of ancient origin! and of major fiscal importance in the\nmodern economy, there has been rather limited consideration, on the\nwhole, of the problems of death-duty incidence and economic effects.?\nAn important exception is found, however, in the investigation of the\nCommittee on National Debt and Taxation, which directed no small part\nof its attention toward these aspects of the British estate, legacy, and suc-\ncession taxes. Customary discussions, particularly in American fiscal lit-\nerature, have established emphasis on the descriptive features of operative\nestate and inheritance taxes. While the usefulness of this approach is not\nto be minimized, it is contended that the importance of death duty inci-\ndence, with its economic repercussions, justifies more than the casual treat-\nment, apparently, so far accorded.\n\nIn the discussion of the incidence of death duties it will be assumed\nthat taxes imposed on or measured by the value of an estate subsequent\n\n!See Max West, The Inheritance Tax (New York, Columbia Univ.

                    "DIVISION OF THE TAX BURDEN AMONG INCOME GROUPS\nIN THE UNITED STATES IN 1936\n\nRecent statistical studies of the tax payments of members of different income groups\n(Twentieth Century Fund) and of the numbers of persons in those groups (National Re-\nsources Committee) now make possible calculations of the actual distribution of the tax\nburden in the United States with a fair degree of accuracy. Allowance must be made for\nvarious possibilities in the shifting of indirect taxes and for differences in the tax systems of\ndifferent states. That fortunate few (1.4 per cent) whose incomes exceeded $7,500 paid\none-third of the nation's taxes. An analysis by taxing divisions shows the median income for\ndividing the tax burden equally above and below was $2,600 for the nation as a whole,\n$2,000 for state and local taxes (Illinois), and $15,000 for federal taxes. The lower income\ngroups paid a higher percentage of the tax burden than the percentage of the national\nincome which they received,\n\nThe questions of who pays our taxes and who should pay them are peren-\nnial. Economists have long discussed the question of tax shifting to explain\nwhy certain taxes are or are not a burden upon the immediate payers thereof.\nThe reasoning has been largely a priori and only in the past few years have\nstatistical investigations been made. To correlate one of those studies with\nrecent findings on income distribution and draw further conclusions is the\npurpose of this paper.\n\nIn Facing tbe Tax Problem and Studies in Current Tax Problems the\nTwentieth Century Fund (hereafter: TCF) has published the results of an\nextensive investigation into the tax burden of ten \"typical\" representative\nfamilies of different income classes.* Separate calculations were made under\nfive different shifting hypotheses. Federal, state, and local taxes as of 1936\nwere analyzed to determine their probable incidence on the families selected.\nAs a result of extensive computations, Professor Newcomer and her asso-\nciates under the Fund derived conclusions regarding the total tax burden\nper family. The findings were expressed both in terms of dollars and as\npercentages of total incomes that would have been received had no taxes\nbeen shifted.\n\nValuable as this study is, it does not afford an answer to the question,\n\"What percentage of the total tax burden of the country is borne by the\npeople of different income classes considered as groups?\" Wealthy people\noften allege that they are paying most of the cost of government. Occasion-\nally they change their tune and try to arouse popular disapproval of gov-\nernment spending by claiming that all taxes are shifted to ultimate con-\nsumers and that therefore the poor, being the most numerous, shoulder\nthe tax burden of the country.\n\nLegislators are also interested in this question. It is not enough for them\nto know the TCF estimate that the man with a $1,000 income pays ap-\nproximately 10 per cent of his income in direct and hidden taxes and that\nthe $5,000 man pays 20 per cent. They should also know how much of the\n\n! New York, 1937.\n",

                    "CONCENTRATION OF JOINT-STOCK ENTERPRISE\nIN ITALY\n\nIn terms of absolute and relative proprietorship, joint-stock company enterprise appears\nto have become increasingly important in the Italian economy since 1914. More significant\nis a marked concentration of corporate wealth. In 1922 the 100 largest non-financial\ncorporations owned less than a third of all non-financial corporate assets; by 1936 the\n100 largest firms owned almost half of such assets. The trend toward concentration has\nbeen even more pronounced in the field of banking. It is to be noted, however, that\npolitica] centralization of economic controls in recent years has come to overshadow the\nsignificance of authority resting on formal ownership.\n\nIn one of his leading speeches on the Fascist Corporate State, Premier\nBenito Mussolini undertook to give his listeners \"a broad outline of the\nhistory of capitalism during the past century.\"* This required a definition:\nCapitalism . .. is a specific mode of production, a system of industrial produc-\ntion. Capitalism in its most highly developed form is a mode of mass\n\nproduction for mass consumption, financed in mass through the national and\ninternational issue of joint-stock capital.\n\n\"The touchstone of \"advanced capitalism,\" then, is large-scale industrial\nand financial joint-stock enterprise. In the course of his address, the Duce\nasked: \"Is Italy a capitalistic country?\" and replied:\n\nIf by capitalism is meant that complex of usages, customs, technical progress\nnow common to all countries, we can say that Italy too is a capitalistic country.\nBut if we go more deeply into the matter and examine the situation from a\nstatistical standpoint . . . we then secure data that enable us to say that Italy is\nnot a capitalistic nation in the current sense of the word.\n\nHe cited statistics on the economic structure of the Italian population, in-\ndicating a zmerical predominance of agricultural and small industrial\nenterprises. \"You see at once from this survey how varied and complex is\nthe Italian economy, and why it cannot be identified with any one type;\nespecially so as the 523,000 manufacturers are almost all at the head of\nsmall or medium-sized concerns.\" That is, in Mussolini's opinion Italy is\nnot \"capitalistic\" because small-scale (and presumably non-corporate)\nenterprise is numerically outstanding in its business-industrial system.\n\nUnfortunately, the paucity of data on national wealth and income\u2014\nand, furthermore, on the employment and production of corporate and\nnon-corporate enterprises\u2014makes it difficult to throw a direct and com-\npletely revealing light on the significance of joint-stock companies in the\nItalian economy.? The available information, however, indicates that large-\nscale corporate enterprise is by no means unimportant. Certainly, in\n\n!Speech to the National Council of Corporations, November 14, 1933. See Benito\nMussolini, Tbe Corporate State, Florence, 1936, pp. 11, 18-19.\n\n\"The terms \"corporate\" and \"corporation\" are herein used as equivalent to \"joint-\n\nstock\" and \"joint-stock company,\" not in their current Italian usage with reference to\ncertain fascist institutions.\n",

                    "THE RELATION OF AMERICAN FOREIGN-TRADE POLICY\nTO NEW DEAL DOMESTIC POLICY\n\nPaper presented at a Round Table Conference of the American Economic Association,\nDecember 27, 1939.\n\nThe comparison of American foreign-trade policy and New Deal domestic policy is\nonly superficially a question of economic policy in the narrow sense. Economists tend to\napproach these problems as if they were questions of trade barriers in the international\nfield and of price rigidity and monopolistic tendencies in the domestic field. Essentially\nautarchic tendencies in foreign trade and monopolistic tendencies in domestic markets are\npolitical responses to a shift in the social framework of the market. Traditional economics\ntends to assume the constancy of this social framework, and then proceeds to a refinement\nof its analysis within the postulated constancy. Present problems arise because the frame-\nwork of custom, values and law is shifting. Economics has become increasingly exact in its\nformulations, and at the same time increasingly irrelevant to the social process it claims to\nstudy. The essential problems today are: Is the social framework still a constant? and if\nnot, what difference does it make in the discussion of relevant policy? Until these questions\nare explicitly faced, divergent policies in international] and domestic markets will be argued\nwith heat but without light, because the traditional postulate of the economist\u2014the con-\nstancy of the social framework\u2014eliminates the area in which the real problems arise.\n\nA discussion of the relation of. American foreign-trade policy to New\nDeal domestic policy must be based upon a clear understanding of the\nnature of the two policies which are in comparison.\n\nThere is little difficulty in a statement of our present foreign-trade\npolicy.' Essentially it is designed to broaden trade by a process of negotia-\ntion of trade agreements with other countries to reduce trade barriers. The\nobjectives are both economic and political. No discussion of the economic\nobjectives is required before an audience of professional economists\u2014there\nis no proposal in the field of economic policy for which so nearly unani-\nmous support can be found in the profession. The political objective\u2014\nthe development of an atmosphere in international relations in which\npeaceful intercourse between nations becomes somewhat more probable\nor possible\u2014is open to more serious doubt. Few will question the objective\nitself; but qualified students of international relations might well wonder\nwhether an expansion of international economic intercourse which was not\naccompanied by a strengthening of the international political and juridical\nframework in which the trade relations will develop, might not rather\neasily promote a variety of international contact that might lead to inter-\nnational conflict, if no provisions were made at the same time for mech-\nanisms and institutions of adjustment which would render such conflict\nharmless from the standpoint of the preservation of peace. Mr. Raymond\nMoley defined \"the twin objectives of the New Deal\" as \"the application\nof intelligence and goodwill to the solution of our domestic problems, and\nthe avoidance of foreign entanglements.\"?

            "found": "'This paper is concerned with the economic effects, upon the economy as a whole, of\nestablishing a uniform minimum wage. The system under consideration is a closed economy\noperating at less than full employment and with imperfections both in the factor markets\nand in the commodity markets. Under these conditions, a minimum wage is likely to in-\ncrease the economy's propensity to consume. Whether the total volume of employment will,\non balance, be maintained, diminished, or increased depends upon whether the increase in\neffective demand flowing from the heightened propensity to consume equals the decrease in\neffective demand caused by factors whose influence is adverse. It seems probable that the\nestablishment of a moderate minimum wage would create more consequences favorable to\nthe maintenance of the level of employment than unfavorable. Though price advances may\nresult, the real income of the persons covered by the legislation will be raised. Whether\nthe real incomes of other members of society will be altered is difficult to foretell, the result\ndepending upon the extent of the price changes and upon whether or not the level of\nemployment is maintained.\n\nMost books and articles dealing with the subject of minimum wages are\ndescriptive or argumentative works concerned chiefly with some specific\nlegislative act. In addition to works of these types there are several in\nwhich some attempt is made to give a theoretical explanation, of more or\nless general applicability, of the economic effects of minimum wages.\n\"There is neither space nor necessity for detailed criticism of this literature,\nand it will suffice to indicate the reasons for believing that further study\nof the subject is necessary:\n\n(1) Until very recent years, almost all theoretical discussions of wages\nand employment have been founded, consciously or otherwise, upon as-\nsumed conditions of perfect competition and full employment. The use of\nthis hypothesis is entirely valid, provided its implications are thoroughly\nunderstood and the limitations they impose squarely faced. But failure to\ndistinguish clearly between this analytical model and the real world has\ntoo often led writers to content themselves with making casual statements\nabout the effect of minimum wages upon \"cost\" and equally uncompre-\nhensive declarations about the consequences of changes in cost.?

                    "Aside from discussions over technical aspects of theory, economists as social scientists\nhave always been concerned with public questions of their day. Although the wages fund\nis mainly of historical interest in economic theory, it has generally been supposed that it\nrepresented a subject on which professional economists made a contribution to public\nopinion of mid-nineteenth century England. Study of the views of a great variety of\nindividuals as presented in reports of a British Royal Commission in 1867-68 indicates\nthat the discouraging conclusions of economists on the success or justice of trade-union\naction to raise wages were not widely known. Individuals and groups to whose interest\nsuch professional opinion would have been favorable were not familiar with it. John\nStuart Mill, a prominent public figure at the time and a wages-fund theorist, has been\nthought to have relaxed the severity of his conclusions in later years, but examination\nshows that he did not give up the basic concept of the theory.\n\nIt is tradition that during the middle years of the nineteenth century the\ntheoretical views of economists were popularly applied by the British\npublic to the efforts of trade unions to raise wages. The generally ac-\ncepted wage theory at the time was that known today as the \"wages fund.\"\nWages were supposed to have been paid from a fund of capital in the\nhands of the capitalist-employer. For a given period of time, a year for\nexample, the size of this fund was fixed. It was a corollary of this proposi-\ntion which was applied to oppose trade-union action dealing with wages.\nIf one group of workers increased its share by pressure of a strike, some\nother group of workers somewhere would have to take less; only a certain\ntotal amount was available for wage-carners. In the history of the de-\nvelopment of economic theory it has been represented that this theoretical\nargument of the ranking economists was used by the general public or\n\"informed middle-class opinion\"! to demonstrate the futility or inequity of\nstrike action over wages. The theoretical views of economists were sup-\nposed to have given this lead to popular thought. Examination of evidence\navailable shows that these theoretical arguments of economists were not\nwidely known to the general public, and were practically unknown to\ngroups with an immediate interest in a wages economy.\n\nRicardian economics is the basis for the wages-fund theory, but John\nStuart Mill is considered to have given it the most concise and generally\naccepted expression in his Principles of Political Economy, first published\nin 1848. His much-heralded \"recantation\" of the theory in 1869 is con-\nsidered to mark its d\u00e9nouement. Cairnes's reassertion of the doctrine and\nits implications for trade-union activities in 1874 is looked upon as a dying\ngasp. It was during the middle years of the century, corresponding to the\nperiod of Mill's pre\u00e9minence as an economist, that the general public is\nsupposed to have been most interested in the economists' theoretical views\non wages. By a study of the writings of economic theorists of the period\n\n! Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Industrial Democracy, London, 1897, pp. 615 ff.\n",

Checks deposited for credit to an account ordinarily require\nfrom one to several days before the amounts involved become collected balances.\nThis is well understood by all business-men with whom I am familiar, and the\nbanks in this part of the country at least seem to make frequent analyses of ac-\ncounts in order to assure themselves that checks are not being drawn against\nuncollected balances.\n\nIt occurs to me that the authors of the article in question would have avoided\nwhat appears to be a serious error in their deductions if they had known more\nabout the credits to the business firm's bank account which is shown in connection\nwith their article. I suggest that those credits, especially some of those involving\neven amounts and fairly substantial sums, may represent deposits of the proceeds\nof borrowed funds or cash obtained from some other source. In any event, I am\nquite sure that few banks today will permit substantial drafts against uncollected\nbalances.\n\nIf my knowledge of the existing situation is correct, the so-called \"neglected\ncomponent\" must be quite negligible in total amount, and therefore it should\nperhaps remain a \"neglected component\" in so far as students of monetary\ntheory are concerned.\n\nE.

                    "Mill on Machinery\n\nIt is commonly thought that John Stuart Mill had serious doubts about the\nsocial benefits of machinery because of the oft-quoted passage in his Principles\nof Political Economy: \"Hitherto (1848) it is questionable if all the mechanical\ninventions yet made have lightened the day's toil of any human being.'\"*\n\nCiting and apparently commending this statement, Karl Marx goes on to say\nthat the capitalistic application of machinery is not for the benefit of the laborer,\nbut merely to lengthen the portion of his time which he gives without an equiva-\nlent, to the capitalist and, therefore, it is but \"a means for producing surplus\nvalue.\"? Many other illustrations could be given of similar misunderstanding of\n\n* Book IV, ch. vi, sec. 2.\n* Capital, vol. i, part i, ch. xv, sec. 1.\n",
