These have the effect of shifting the emphasis\nfrom more food to more of the right kinds of food. 'They imply that the\nmalnutrition which causes ill health is due to poor balance in diets as\nwell as to insufficient food.\n\nThese dual aspects of the problem, food and nutrition, suggest the\nbifurcated origin of the international food movement. On the one hand,\nit has sprung from an interest in adequate food for the poorer mem-\nbers of society, in making democracy mean at least enough to eat. On\nthe other, it is an outgrowth of the recent discoveries of the \"newer\nknowledge of nutrition.\"\n\n'The use of the term *movement\" in this connection is carefully con-\nsidered. There was initiated at a given point in time and place a defi-\nnite action toward better human feeding; and that action grew and\nexpanded into what took place at Hot Springs. What the confines of\nthis movement will be in the next several decades depends very much\nupon the course of world history. In due time, whatever happens, such\ngains as are achieved will spread out over society and the movement as\nsuch will fade out.\n\nThe time and place of initiation of that part of the movement that\nsprang from the newer knowledge of nutrition are the League of Na-\ntions, in the early 1930's. The Health Organization of the League had\nbeen working for some time on nutrition as a factor in health, and the\nInternational Labor Office had approached it from the standpoint of the\nwelfare of labor. But these efforts were of interest to scientists only\nuntil High Commissioner S. M. Bruce of Australia came forward at the\n1935 League of Nations Assembly with his proposal for the *marriage of\nhealth and agriculture,\" and the setting up of a *mixed committee,\"\ndrawn from agriculture as well as from labor and authorities on health,\nto consider the possibilities of a program that would relieve agriculture\nby disposing of its excess output at the same time that it would get\nmore food into the mouths of the world's underfed millions.\n\nThe Mixed Committee on Nutrition that followed comprised repre-\nsentatives of the two groups in the League that had been working on\nnutrition and of the International Institute of Agriculture (Rome),\nand a group of students of nutrition and food supply drawn from dif-\nferent countries. Its report, published in 1937, undertook first to state\nmore or less quantitatively the nature and extent of malnutrition in\ndifferent parts of the world. For example, it concluded that three-\n\n1 See. Nutrition and Public Health, League of Nations, Geneva, 1935.

Conference on Food and Agriculture which met\nat Hot Springs, Virginia, last May, comprising delegations from 45\ncountries, had a dual task; first, to point the way to increased agricul-\ntural production in the post-war world in order to provide nutritionally\nmore adequate diets for the people of every country, and second, to\nstart pruning, paring and weeding the jungle growth of restrictions that\nhave grown up to hamper the course of international trade in food-\nstuffs. It was hoped that the conference would set in motion the evolu-\ntion of a constructive international program for the production and\ndistribution of larger and more nutritious food supplies.\n\nFollowing as it did upon the work of the League of Nations Com-\nmittee on Nutrition, the Conference had little difficulty in putting a\nstrong case for expanding food production throughout the world:\n*\"There has never been enough food for the health of all people. . . .\nProduction of food must be greatly expanded. . . .\" It resolved that\n*the governments and authorities here represented immediately under-\ntake the task of increasing the food resources and improving the diets\nof their people.\" In asking for the creation of an international body\nto develop its program, the Conference assigned to it a composite\nr\u00f3le: to deal with nutrition, agricultural production and distribution.\n\nIf the governments of the United Nations were to act upon these\nresolutions in the same spirit in which they were adopted we might\nwitness a revolutionary reorientation of governmental policies dealing\nwith agriculture. In the recent past these have been aimed at increas-\ning prices in the interests of producers rather than at providing cheap\nand nutritious meals for the undernourished elements in the popula-\ntion.

But in most of these discus-\nsions the problem of international trade relationships between socialist\nstates and the analysis of the consequences of international exchange\nof goods and services and the movement of capital in a world com-\nposed of socialist planned economies has been neglected. Yet in view\nof the fact that socialism is essentially international in character, an\nanalysis of these relationships is clearly necessary.\n\nThe early socialist writers said little about this problem. This was due\npartly to their concept of a world revolution which would establish\nsocialism all over the world, thus ruling out international exchange in\nthe narrow sense, and partly due to the dislike of socialist writers of\npresenting a detailed analysis of economic relationships which would\nexist after the victory of socialism. Marx had outlined the general law\nof historical development from capitalism to socialism, but since it was\nimpossible to say exactly at which stage of capitalistic development\nthe actual transition to socialism would come, the specific pattern of\neconomic relationships under socialism was unpredictable and depended\non the particular historical conditions of this development. The early\nSocialist writers gave therefore only the barest outline of economic\nrelationships under socialism and expressed the belief that the diffi-\nculties, maladjustments, and frictions of the capitalist mode of produc-\ntion and distribution would be solved if the system of production\nfor profit were replaced by a system of production for use.\"\n\n* Mr. Hoselitz is research assistant for the Social Science Research Committee at the\nUniversity of Chicago and at the same time part-time research assistant at the Institute\nof International Studies at Yale University.\n\n1A statement by Karl Kautsky may serve as an example: \"In a socialist society it is\nnot profit but the wants of the members of society which constitute the incentive to\nproduce. Kind and size of production are determined by wants, and production increases\nonly in the degree as the wants of the members of society increase. . . .

Said Mr. Batt:\n\nThere will be greater confusion of demand when the war is over.\n\nAt the present time, we are confronted with only a limited number of purchasers of raw\nmaterials and there is limited shipping capacity to carry what is available. When the war\nends, there will be a scramble by all nations for available supplies in order to restore their\neconomies to a peacetime basis as speedily as possible.\n\nExperience after the first World War has shown that such a scramble can result in\ncomplete demoralization of supply, price, and other factors in a peace-time economy. It is\nimpossible to see how such a situation can be met unless through some form of combined\nmachinery. Existence of the Combined Raw Materials Board might contribute substantially\nto the solution of this important postwar problem.\"\n\nIt will be noted that continuation of the Combined Raw Materials Board\nand others of the Combined Boards into the transition period at the end of\nthe war, while it would be in line with Professor Taussig's general position in\nfavor of gradual de-control, would differ from his proposal in several im-\nportant respects. The most important relates to the representation on the\ncontrol authority. At present, only the United States and the United King-\ndom are directly represented on the Combined Boards (except that Canada\nhas been given a place on the Combined Production and Resources Board).\nAllotment by the Combined Boards, unless their membership should be ex-\npanded, would not meet Taussig's desire for a broadly international arrange-\nment. His plan contemplated representation of consuming as well as supply-\ning countries on the central board of control and allotment which he pro-\nposed. Under this central board he wished to have committees on different\ncommodities, and on these committees representation would vary in accord-\nance with the commodity positions of the different countries.\n\nWashington, D.C.

This time, previous experience is being cited. The view appears\nto have gained wide acceptance that it was a mistake to abolish the wartime\ncontrols so suddenly after the last war. The result was a scramble for short\nsupplies, which brought sharp increases in prices and led to wasteful at-\ntempts by producers, handlers, and users to hold large inventories in anticipa-\ntion of further price rises. This, of course, further intensified the general short-\nage.

It was one of the principal topics of early post-war\nconferences on international economic questions. The first meeting of the\nInternational Labour Organization (November, 1919) and the first meeting\nof the International Chamber of Commerce (June, 1920) debated raw mate-\nrial allotment.

Under the pres-\nsure of holders of stocks, the richer States have gradually come to abandon, or at least to\nlimit, the policy of restrictions and of export duties. . . .

After peace over one-half of the whole export\nof food supplies of the world will come from the United States and for the buyers of\nthese supplies to sit in majority in dictation to us as to prices and distribution is wholly\ninconceivable.

Such a European relief commission\nwould \"above all\" prevent *the extension of the functions and life of Inter-\nAllied Food and Maritime Councils either now or after peace.\" Secretary of\nState Lansing, in transmitting Hoover's message, added that the Department\nof State entirely approved the policy thus set forth.

Conditions are\ndifferent, however, for different commodities. The essential point is the\nestablishment now of a general policy of international allotment, on terms\nfair for all the world, allies, neutrals and enemies.\n\nPresident Wilson replied to Dr, Taussig that he had \"at once arranged, in\norder that the matter might have the most serious consideration, to have\nMessrs. Hoover, Garfield, McCormick, and Baruch draw up a memorandum\ncovering the points\" which Taussig had raised. I have been unable to trace\nany such memorandum, but Mr. Hoover, one of the officials to whom Presi-\ndent Wilson referred Taussig's suggestion, had already written to the President\n\"arguing strongly against the proposal which had come from some quarters\nfor international control of world distribution after the war.\"*\n\nA week after the date of Professor Taussig's letter (October 30, 1918)\nMr. J. P. Cotton, a London representative of the United States Food Admin-\nistration, telegraphed a summary of discussions which had been held in Lon-\ndon by representatives of the various economic agencies of the Allied govern-\n\n?* R.

There should be a central Board of Control and\nAllotment. At the head of that board should be a person of distinction,\nand, at the same time, one in whose impartial spirit there is general con-\nfidence. There should be on the board representation of allies, neutrals,\nand the present belligerents.

Agriculture has placed itself at a disadvantage in\nits dealings with the industrial section of the economy by assuming an addi-\ntional responsibility. Even though agricultural workers have moved into in-\ndustrial production during periods of expansion (when they were needed\nmost on the farm), these same workers have returned to the land when they\nwere discharged by industry during the periods of economic contraction and\ndepression (when they were needed least on the farm).\n\nThat this responsibility in agriculture was and is based on a family rather\nthan a legal relationship does not remove the fact that the responsibility has\ntended to maintain the real income produced and the employment of the\nfactors of production in agriculture when other sections of the economy were\ndeclining. As long as agriculture was the dominant section of the economy\nand thereby provided the major portion of the real income of the economy,\nthis responsibility tended to mitigate the worst results of an industrial con-\ntraction.

Nevertheless, the\nfact that the farmer has made a living while he assumed an additional respon-\nsibility under the worst possible circumstances\u2014alone\u2014should indicate that\nenterprises in general could prosper if the responsibility was universally\nadopted to increase the flexibility of the economy and thereby maintain pro-\nduction and employment in the entire economy.\n\n"

By such adjustment enterprises contribute to idleness through-\nout the entire economy. The first step in the present enterprise action forces\nsome productive elements to become idle; the further influence of this idle-\nness is more idleness.\n\nIf the ability of the enterprise to reach profitableness by a direct and im-\nmediate discharge of employees is removed the enterprise is forced to use\nother methods. If the enterprise shifts its own production there is an obvious\nbenefit to the economy. 1f a shift in production is not possible the enterprise\nis forced to mark time until other enterprises that are moving in the direction\nof increased profit by expansion can take up the slack of the contracting\nenterprise and so maintain the activity of the economy.\n\nDuring the period of *marking time,\" the changes that helped some enter-\nprises will have time to react without the cumulative obstruction of the in-\nfluences that would arise out of a decrease in employment and production by\nthose enterprises not so favorably situated. During this same period, the\nadversely influenced enterprises will be taking some action to maximize profits\nor minimize losses. If they strive to reduce other costs they are contributing\nin some manner to increased efficiency since the enterprise can save very little\nby not using the productive forces which they are paying, and as the enter-\nprise must continue the purchase of some raw materials for labor to use.\n\nLikewise any action the enterprise takes toward increased income will be\nbeneficial as it will depend on the best use, not disuse, of the existing produc-\ntive facilities. In many cases an enterprise striving to get the most revenue\nout of an overexpanded production, without piling up a tremendous amount\nof inventory, will lower prices. Lower prices will have a further influence by\nenabling present customers to shift some of their expenditures and thereby\ntend to increase the ability of other enterprises to take listed employees. In\nother words, under the proposal the enterprises in difficulty will, in many\ncases, take action toward increased profitableness that will be direct or in-\ndirect influences to a redistribution of effort in the economy. In no case, will\nthe enterprises in difficulty take action that will force direct idleness on some\nproductive labor.\n\nThis tendency to use and pay for the productive forces of the economy\nobviously is a direct force exerted toward the maintenance of the real income\nproduced and consumed by the economy, and a material aid in the orderly\nredistribution of productive effort. At the same time, individual enterprise is\nnot hampered in its decisions and initiative any more than the obligations\nassumed under long-term financing are considered hampering. The proposal is\nmerely a set of rules designed to recognize by legal contract the implications\nin a situation that exists in fact\u2014workers do not have the ability to shift their\nservices immediately.\n\nThe type of responsibility suggested by the proposal has a strong prece-\ndent in the American economy. Most agriculture is carried on by farms that\nare both family and enterprise units, and as such, they have never considered\nfamily workers to be economic forces that are subject to discard at the whim\n"

Part of the presently\nexisting flexibility of the enterprise to make a profit would be removed, and\nto that extent the hazards of business would be increased, However, a good\npart of the need for flexibility would also be removed. Changes in cost and\ndemand would continue to occur, and would continue to influence some enter-\nprises to greater profit and others to loss. Such loss influences that did occur,\nhowever, would be frozen in the enterprises directly influenced until the shifts\nin productive forces demanded by changes and evidenced by the cost and\ndemand picture had been accomplished.\n\nIn other words, every entrepreneur would have to worry about his relative\ncompetitive position, but he could cease to worry about the large swings in the\nprosperity of the entire economy. The decreased flexibility of the individual\nenterprise would contribute to the flexibility of the entire economy and leave\nthe entrepreneur vulnerable to his own mistakes, but it would protect him\nfrom the major indirect influences of the mistakes of others.\n\nThe interest of the economy is in the flexibility for profit making of the\nbusiness enterprise only in so far as actions toward profit contribute to the\nwants of the people in the economy.

Rather the size of the gap is determined sometimes by '**banks,\nsometimes by foreigners, sometimes by the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, sometimes by the federal Treasury, and sometimes by busi-\nness corporations\" (p. 611).\n\nWith a directness that would delight the most old-fashioned quantity theor-\nist, Warburton identifies the \"real\" inflationary gap with the \"expansion of\ncash balances in the hands of individuals and business enterprises\" (p. 607).\nIn order to determine the pressure on prices arising from this gap for past or\nfuture periods, he would relate the increase in cash balances to the actual or\nexpected rate of change in production. This, in effect, means that consumer\nexpenditures are determined primarily by holdings of one kind of asset,\nnamely, cash, over which, Warburton says, individuals have little control. It\nneglects other kinds of assets and discounts the paramount influence of in-\ncome.\n\nWith this concept of the gap it is perfectly correct to say that the gap can\nnever be closed by a price rise. Nor can it be closed by increased production.\n\n*! *Measuring the Inflationary Gap,\" Am. Econ.

There was\ngeneral agreement, however, that mechanization after the war would be\nrapid, but this process was viewed not so much as a reaction to high wage\nlevels, but rather as the result of the accumulation during the war period of\na backlog of knowledge and experience in technological advance.\n\nIn many companies, technical research is proceeding at a rapid rate in the\nlaboratory, but new techniques are not being applied because of the disin-\nclination to interrupt the routine of production at a time when speed is so\nessential.

Some employers reported that they are giving up\nattempting to reward efficiency, because if they raise the pay of a good man,\nthe union then demands that this increase also be extended to others in the\nshop who may be less efficient, but who are performing the same work.\n\nTwo other factors have contributed to the spread of the general increase.\nFirst, the rise in the cost of living during the period under study naturally\ngave an impetus to this type of adjustment as the only fair means of dealing\nwith a condition affecting all employees alike. Secondly the gradual adoption\nby industry at large of the technique of scientific management with its job\nevaluation plans, time studies, and other intricacies has tended to introduce\na certain rigidity into the wage structure. The general uniform wage increase\nthen becomes the only means of adjusting wage levels without disturbing\nthe wage relationship of one job to another.\n\n2. Closely related to this first trend\u2014in that it, too, is a consequence of\nunion organization\u2014is the predominance of the \"cents per hour\" wage in-\ncrease. Wage increases in mass production industries, beginning with the April,\n1941, increase in the steel industry, have tended to be in terms of cents per\nhour, rather than in percentages. On the whole, investigation suggests that\nmanagement prefers the percentage increase while unions prefer adjustments\nin cents per hour. A number of employers reported that they disliked the\nlatter form of wage change because it raised the lower paid employee more\nthan in proportion to higher paid personnel and therefore further diminished\nthe differential between the skilled and unskilled.\n\nIn the steel industry, union leaders justified this narrowing process on\nthe grounds that the industry had developed an unwarranted spread between\nthe lowest and highest rate. But the steel executives maintained that this range\nwas consistent with the skills involved; that with a machinist's rate double a\nlaborer's rate there was an incentive for the latter to work himself up, but\nthat with the union narrowing this differential, the incentive to advance will\nbe seriously impaired. Other employers, however, considered the cents per\nhour increase more equitable in times of rising costs of living, since it gives\na larger percentage increase in income to those very groups of wage earners\nwho feel most severely the rise in living costs. Industrial unions are staunch\nchampions of this position; since they draw their membership primarily from\nthe ranks of the unskilled and semi-skilled it is natural that they should\nchampion that form of wage increase which does most to improve the eco-\nnomic position of their principal constituency.\n\n3. A third significant wage trend\u2014likewise a by-product, in part, of indus-\ntry's reaction to unionism\u2014is the spread of leader-follower relationships in\nindustrial wage policies.

                    "try even if this means higher than average earnings in the company having\nthe bonus plan, because it believes that management would not pay the\nbonus unless it paid for itself. Hence, employees in these companies reason\nthat they must be working harder or more efficiently than \"the other fellow\"\nand therefore deserve higher earnings.\n\nAs a consequence, up to the present, incentive plans have not proved a\nsuccessful means of stemming the rise in the base rate. Labor has been\nunwilling to accept incentive earnings as a substitute for increases in base\npay, because it has been confident of its ability to secure the latter. Now, how-\never, the War Labor Board's firm stand against unwarranted increases in\nbase rates, coupled with its authorization of increased earnings based upon\nincentive pay where such pay is in fact accompanied by increased production,\nmay compel a change in labor's attitude. Labor's traditional aversion to\nincentive plans, based upon a fear (often justified) that management would\nreduce base rates once production increased, need not prove a stumbling\nblock today, for labor's bargaining position under present conditions is so\nstrong that few companies could reduce rates even ii they wanted to. Both\nthe need for increased production and the demands of labor for some form\nof increase in remuneration make it likely that incentive wage plans will\nachieve increased popularity during the duration of the war boom.\n\nIn 1941, a substitute for wage rate increases more acceptable to labor than\nincentive pay was overtime pay. While many companies have adopted this\nmeasure, they realize that labor will not easily relinquish its high earnings\nafter the war, and that therefore substitution of overtime pay may be only a\ntemporary expedient. The final reckoning will come after the armistice when\nlabor may well demand increases in base rates to compensate it for the loss\nof overtime pay.\n\nStudy of wage increases in industrial concerns during the latter half of\n1941 revealed the development of several significant trends in wage policies\nwhich are likely to exert an important influence upon our post-war economy.\n\n1. Evident even to the casual observer was the emergence of the general\nuniform wage increase as the dominant form of wage adjustment in both\nlarge and small companies. General wage increases extending in equal amounts\nto all employees have long been common in large concerns, because they lend\nthemselves well to large establishments, create fewer economic grievances, and\ndo not disrupt job valuations. Until recently, however, wage increases in small\ncompanies were typically not of this kind, but rather varied with the indi-\nvidual according to his length of service, efficiency of production, loyalty,\netc. In the last few years, however, smaller companies have also tended to\nadopt the policy of granting blanket increases of a given percentage or cents\nper hour to all employees in the firm.\n\nEmployers, when questioned, admitted that this is bad policy, that it gives\nthe individual worker little satisfaction, and does not conduce to efficiency;\nyet despite the objections against it, this form of wage change is becoming\nthe dominant form in industry. The principal cause for its spread is union\npressure. Unions favor uniform general wage increases because they conform\nto the union program of \"getting something for everybody\" and because\n",

Inclusion in government contracts of\ncost-plus or flexible wage rate provisions made it possible for them to pay\nhigh wage rates without detriment to profits and thus considerably simplified\ntheir wage problem.? Other companies less favorably situated embarked,\nhowever, upon a \"middle of the road\" policy, granting wage increases with\none eye on labor turnover and the other eye on the future.\n\nConcerns which during this period were able to pursue successfully a wage\npolicy of moderation despite the growing scarcity of labor included companies\nin small communities at some distance from industrial centers; companies\nwith a record of steady employment? which were able to hold employees by\nreminding them of the temporary nature of defense jobs; and companies with\nfriendly employer-employee relations, sickness, health, and other employee\nbenefits. While factual evidence based upon more recent investigation of\nthese same companies is not available, it seems evident that the number of\ncompanies capable of maintaining a wage policy of moderation has suffered\ncontinual diminution. For one thing, war orders are more generally distributed\nthroughout industry today than was true in 1941 and labor has been quick\nto demand its share of the profits accruing from such production. Companies\nstill engaged in nonessential production find that benefits of employer benevo-\nlence\u2014to be reaped at some future date in the event of sickness or old age\n\u2014cannot compare with the jingle of hard cash as a means of retaining the\nloyalty of a working force depleted by the draft and the attraction of high\nwage war industries.\n\nBonus incentive plans have been seized upon by some companies as an\napparently ideal solution to the wage problem. Such plans would seem to\nafford a means of satisfying labor's demands for higher earnings during the\nboom, and at the same time of keeping costs and prices down, since the\nincreased output they elicit pays for the increased disbursements to labor.\nFurthermore, since bonuses automatically disappear when output is curtailed\nand profits decline, such plans would not burden post-war industry with high\nlabor costs.\n\nInvestigation reveals, however, that in 1941 bonus payments were not\nacceptable to labor as a substitute for wage increases. In a number of com-\npanies having bonus plans, unions insisted that regular hourly base rates be\nkept on a par with the rest of the community or with other firms in the indus-\ntry. Employers suggested two reasons for this attitude:\n\n1. Labor wants to raise base rates as high as possible during the boom so\nthat its earnings after the war will continue at a high level, even if some\nreduction in rates is made. Labor is looking ahead and realizes that, while\nbonuses will automatically disappear when production is curtailed, high base\nrates may stick.\n\n2. Labor insists that base rates be on a par with the community or indus-\n\n?^However, a number of employers with large defense contracts, while compelled to\nmake substantial wage incteases to attract and hold personnel, expressed concern regarding\nthe level of wage rates which would remain when the war boom was spent.\n\n*'There is a definite inverse relation between the average length of service of employees\nin a concern and its labor turnover.\n"

The amendment provided that where the\nappeal concerned a question of reasonableness of rates\n\n*It shall be the duty of the court to consider the entire record of the proceedings before\nthe Commission, including the testimony, and, on its own independent judgment, to\ndetermine whether or not the findings made and the valuations and rates fixed by the\nCommission, reasonable and proper. If the court shall determine that the findings or the\nvaluation are unreasonable, or the rates fixed are unreasonably high, it shall remit the\ncase to the Commission with directions to reform the findings, valuations and rates in\naccordance with the court's opinion.\"\n\n'The second paragraph quoted above seems to set forth the act of 1931,\nP.

Prior to the act, as a result of the opinion of the United States Supreme\nCourt in Ben Avon Borough v. Ohio Valley Water Company, 253 U.

The amendment provided that where the\nappeal concerned a question of reasonableness of rates\n\n*It shall be the duty of the court to consider the entire record of the proceedings before\nthe Commission, including the testimony, and, on its own independent judgment, to\ndetermine whether or not the findings made and the valuations and rates fixed by the\nCommission, reasonable and proper. If the court shall determine that the findings or the\nvaluation are unreasonable, or the rates fixed are unreasonably high, it shall remit the\ncase to the Commission with directions to reform the findings, valuations and rates in\naccordance with the court's opinion.\"\n\n'The second paragraph quoted above seems to set forth the act of 1931,\nP. L. 530, In fact, however, it is an excerpt from the act and omits the follow-\ning which immediately precedes the quotation:\n\nAt the hearing of the appeal, the said court [Superior Court] shall, upon record certified\nto it by the Commission determine whether or not the order appealed from is reasonable\nand in conformity with law: Provided, however, that in every appeal taken, including\nthose already taken and undetermined, involving a question of the reasonableness of rates,\nwhether such appeal shall have been taken by a complainant or by a public service company,\nit shall be the duty of the court. . .*\n\nand so on, as above.\n\nNow the real significance of the law was that it expressly authorized the\nSuperior Court to exercise its independent judgment upon appeal by the\ncomplainant in a rate case, that is, by the patron or customer of a public\nutility.

As a\nresult some outstanding and highly respected economists have resigned and\nothers are going to follow.\n\nThe Congressional amendment poses a question to economists: What is\nwrong with us? Why is it desired and how is it possible to arouse the public\nagainst professors? Why is one professional group to be excluded from, an-\nother preferred for, the holding of certain governmental positions?\n\nThe ostensible reason for penalizing professors is that they, as a group,\nare incapable of fulfilling their administrative functions properly because they\nlack business experience. Formulating economic policies in any federal war\nagency requires two specific kinds of experiences: practical knowledge of the\ntechnical problems of production, marketing, and pricing of factors or\nproducts in the prospective industries and a clear understanding of the\nprinciples of a war economy. Practical business men are more likely to know\nabout trade problems, whereas professional economists are more apt in eco-\nnomic analysis. The new type of war administrator required for the direction\nof the developing war economy, versed in both practical and theoretical arts,\ndid not exist; he had to be trained in his job through trial and error.\n\nBoth business men and professional economists tried themselves; members\nof both groups failed and were weeded out, No statistics of the turnover and\nits causes are available but from the facts that have become public we can\ninfer that the obvious failures were more common among business men. The\ncontention of the Congressional amendment that managers of private enter-\nprises are the only effective public administrators is thus in conflict with the\npersonnel history of the federal war agencies.\n\nIf it had been the intention of Representative Dirksen to improve the\nadministration of war agencies, one of three possible directives could have\nbeen given to the administration. First, to require a preliminary training\nperiod of all division heads prior to their appointment. Second, to promote\npolicy formulating officials from the ranks of the existing personnel of war\nagencies. Third, to stipulate that the two leading administrators of a division\nshould be a business man and an economist who must be in agreement on main\npolicies.

In Section I, several\nalternatives to subsidies are explored, since they may be preferable to a\nsubsidy program in particular areas. Under certain conditions, a rise\nof prices might be the lesser evil.' Again, large price increases might be\naverted even in the absence of subsidies. The government has used with\ngreat success the techniques of averaging costs and differential pricing.\nIf these techniques are not practical and a rise of prices is to be avoided,\nthe government may then have to resort to subsidies.\n\nThe objectives of subsidies are considered in Section II. One ob-\njective is a reduction in the cost of living or a moderation in its rate\nof increase. Another and related objective is the prevention of a rise\nof prices for all supplies to a level set by marginal costs. By paying to\nproducers or suppliers in the form of a subsidy the excess of marginal\ncosts over average costs, the government can encourage additional out-\nput and yet prevent a rise of marginal costs from being translated into\na corresponding increase in prices for all units.\n\nThe more important categories of subsidy procedures are examined\nin Section III. (1) Government purchase and resale has been used\nwidely in the industrial area; but not sufficiently for the purpose of\nreducing the cost of living. (2) In subsidizing additional costs involved\nin high cost and additional output, the government has, in various\nways, stimulated output. (3) A disguised subsidy is involved in the\nassumption by the government of certain services which private enter-\nprise is unable or unwilling to perform at a reasonable price, and in\nthe sale of these services by the government, under certain conditions,\nbelow costs.\n\n* As the Director of the Office of Export-Import Price Control for over a year and a\nhalf, Mr. Harris has had considerable experience in the operational part of subsidy pro-\ngrams. Many subsidy programs, of which this paper gives the theoretical background,\nwere worked out in his office.

The underlying principle is the same in both in-\nstances, the difference being only that the one relates to the contraction phase\nand the other to the expansion phase. It is curious that the principle should be\nso widely overlooked in the contraction phase when it is so generally recognized\nin the other. In the case of payments on account of interest, the usual contention\nholds, namely, that the operation represents a shifting about of funds. For this,\nunlike the repayment of principal, does not involve a destruction of demand\ndeposits.\n\nA further word is called for as to the applicability of the foregoing remarks\nwith respect to different parts of the national debt. For expansion in the vol-\nume of government debt held by banks, which is currently in disfavor on the\nground that it tends to be inflationary, might also be criticized as the source of\npossible deflationary developments in the future. How serious the deflationary\ntendency of a future contraction of bank credit may be is not, however, alto-\ngether clear. In view of the great expansion in circulating medium now taking\nplace, the absolute volume of circulation may come to be regarded as less\nsignificant than in the past and devices, such as rationing, for influencing the\nfreedom with which it may be utilized may be regarded as more significant.\n\nWould it be possible to prevent a contraction in the volume of bank credit,\nwhile allowing the government to reduce the size of the national debt?

More specifically, his Section\nI does not in my opinion give an adequate summary of the so-called new\nwelfare economics\"; the criticisms embodied in Section II, which are not\njejune or obscure, do not seem well taken; and the alternative suggested in\nSection III is in no sense an alternative.\n\nThese points may be developed in reverse order.

The underlying principle is the same in both in-\nstances, the difference being only that the one relates to the contraction phase\nand the other to the expansion phase. It is curious that the principle should be\nso widely overlooked in the contraction phase when it is so generally recognized\nin the other. In the case of payments on account of interest, the usual contention\nholds, namely, that the operation represents a shifting about of funds. For this,\nunlike the repayment of principal, does not involve a destruction of demand\ndeposits.\n\nA further word is called for as to the applicability of the foregoing remarks\nwith respect to different parts of the national debt. For expansion in the vol-\nume of government debt held by banks, which is currently in disfavor on the\nground that it tends to be inflationary, might also be criticized as the source of\npossible deflationary developments in the future. How serious the deflationary\ntendency of a future contraction of bank credit may be is not, however, alto-\ngether clear. In view of the great expansion in circulating medium now taking\nplace, the absolute volume of circulation may come to be regarded as less\nsignificant than in the past and devices, such as rationing, for influencing the\nfreedom with which it may be utilized may be regarded as more significant.\n\nWould it be possible to prevent a contraction in the volume of bank credit,\nwhile allowing the government to reduce the size of the national debt? The\nanswer to this question is very clearly in the affirmative as far as it relates to\ndebt held outside the banks.

The concepts are: (1) a potential inflationary gap,\nand (2) a real inflationary gap, the latter being the more significant one for the\nproblem of price inflation. The real inflationary gap, it was pointed out, is essen-\ntially the amount of expansion of cash balances in the hands of individuals and\nbusiness enterprises.\n\nFurther work on the significance of the real inflationary gap, or expansion\nof cash balances, has resulted in a statistical appraisal, for the period for\nwhich data are available (1927-1942), of the character of the pressure on\nprices resulting from changes in the cash balances of individuals.

Clark raises several\nissues which warrant brief additional comment. According to Clark, the *main\nargument\" with which he disagrees is a principle which he formulates as fol-\nlows: \"regular and habitual freight absorption is inherently and always a\nmonopolistic practice within the meaning of the antitrust laws, and proof of\ncollusion.\" My own somewhat different statements bearing on this point were:\n\"Regular and systematic price identity of this sort (identical delivered prices\naccording to a formula) over a period of time can exist only as the result of\nmonopolistic agreement or of monopolistic coercion, actual or implied\" (p.\n733); and \"It is a generally accepted principle, clearly conceived first in the\ntheory of *dumping' in foreign commerce, that systematic price discrimination\ncan occur only with monopoly\" (p. 742).\n\nApparently, Clark recognizes and accepts the well-established principle\n\"that discrimination cannot exist under competition, but only under monop-\noly\" (his phrasing), but he appears to be unwilling *to classify freight ab-\nsorption as discrimination\" (his Section II) and implies a denial that freight\nabsorption is discrimination. Whenever a mill is charging \"phantom freight\"\nand is taking \"freight absorption,\" it is making a difference in prices among\n\n?

However, criti-\ncism founded upon misunderstanding, careless reading or misinterpretation\nand likewise committed to print must stand the test of rebuttal, Mr. John\nM. Blair's review' of my Industrial Concentration and Price Inftexibility\n(Washington, American Council on Public Affairs, 1942) merits rebuttal\npartially on the grounds outlined.\n\nThe reviewer has concentrated upon two chapters of the book dealing with\nthe flexibility of prices relative to costs. The first of these, Chapter V, which is\nconcerned with methods, is somewhat tedious, and if the reviewer passed over\nit in haste he can hardly be blamed. Unfortunately, his criticism of the\nresults of the statistical study, Chapter VI, is largely invalidated by what\nwas written in the preceding chapter on methods.\n\nThe object of the investigation contained in these two chapters should\nbe clarified. It was to determine whether previous studies of the relation-\nship between concentration and price inflexibility (in the sense of amplitude\nof price decline during depression) had ignored variables other than concen-\ntration which would account for inflexible prices. The most important of\nthese other variables which suggests itself immediately but which had gen-\nerally been ignored is variation in prime costs.\n\nIf one industry experiences a drop of twenty per cent in its prime cost in a given period\nand another experiences a rise of ten per cent, it would be unreasonable to charge that,\nbecause the average price of the products of the first industry fell twenty per cent and\nthe average price of the products of the second remained the same, the second industry's\n\nprice was inflexible in view of the changes which occurred. Vet this is exactly the position\nwhich the National Resources Planning Board, for instance, must take?\n\nHaving determined that the relationship of price change to prime cost\nchange merited investigation, the writer then undertook to find the data.\n\nfreight absorption would in no way cure the latter situation and might, in fact, aggravate\nit. There is no reason for focusing upon freight absorption Per se as the principal monopo-\nlistic element or for arguing that the only way in which competition can be preserved is\nto insist upon the maintenance of uniform mill nets by each seller.\n\n^ Am.

But this is an argument, not\nfor abandoning the welfare attitude in monetary discussions, but rather for\nbringing the existing ends to the surface and broadening their scope.\n\nAgainst the present proposal it might be argued that welfare economics\nwould become essentially a defense of the status quo since all existent social\npolicies represent in some sense the collective will? Protective tariffs, for\nexample, have been legislated for three generations by democratically elected\nrepresentatives; hence tariffs are a part of our society's ends. But this argu-\nment is defective on two counts. First, a great many economic policies do\nnot in any important sense represent the collective will; silver legislation and\ndegraded flashlight lamps will serve as examples. Second, and vastly more\nimportant, specific policies are usually means\u2014in many cases mistaken ones,\nthe economist may argue\u2014and not ends.

In the nature of things the wideness with which any\nend is accepted depends upon the specificity of that end. As compared with\nthe (unknown!) distribution of income in 1939, almost everyone would agree\nthat the desired end is a more equal distribution. But, assigning some conven-\ntional measure of inequality, the acceptance of this end shrinks as the goal\nof equality is approached. Witness the less than unanimous approval of the\n$25,000 ceiling on salaries. Until the distant day when the welfare economist\ncan assign quantitative orders of importance to various (degrees of fulfill-\nment of) ends, therefore, it seems necessary for him to recommend only\ngradual changes of policy in many areas. This formal conclusion could, I\nthink, be defended on substantive grounds as the only approach which is\ncompatible with democratic social processes.\n\nA century ago John Stuart Mill observed: *Political Economy does not of\nitself instruct how to make a nation rich; but whoever would be qualified to\njudge of the means of making a nation rich, must first be a political econo-\nmist.\" His statement implies the still fundamental and unfulfilled task of\nthe economist.\n",

Ax Alternative\n\nOne may still argue along somewhat different lines that the economist may\nnevertheless put behind his recommendations of policy what little prestige\nthe Office of Price Administration has left him. The fundamental point of\nthis alternative approach may be developed by a brief examination of the\nthesis implicit in the newer welfare economics: that all ends other than\nmaximization of income are value judgments (or, in some sense, more de-\nbatable value judgments) and accordingly unsuited for scientific purposes.\n\nThe familiar admonition not to argue over differences in tastes leads not\nonly to dull conversations but also to bad sociology. It is one thing to recog-\nnize that we cannot frove, by the usual tests of adequacy of proof, the supe-\nriority of honesty over deceit or the desirability of a more equal income dis-\ntribution. But it is quite another thing to conclude that therefore ends of\ngood policy are beyond the realm of scientific discussion.\n\nFor surely the primary requisite of a working social system is a consensus\non ends. The individual members of the society simply must agree upon the\nmajor ends which that society is to seek. If any large share of the population\nactively disagrees with the society's ends, and in particular if it believes that\nthe system is unfair by that group's criteria, the social system will surely\ndisintegrate, probably with violence.\n\nThis view is almost axiomatic in modern social theory; a society is in fact\ndefined in some such terms as *a group of individuals held together by a\ncommon dominant purpose and functioning as an entity.\"5 It would be easy\n\n*W.

Nothing scientific can be\nsaid about distribution, but in appraising exchange policies we may make use\nof two well-known theorems:\n\n1. The marginal rates of substitution between commodities must be equal\nfor all individuals. If this is not so, an exchange of goods will help one person\nwithout injuring the other?\n\n2. Marginal costs must equal prices. If this condition is not met it is pos-\nsible to reallocate resources in such a way as to increase outputs of some\ngoods without decreasing outputs of any.?\n\nIf these theorems are applied to the problem of international trade, for\nexample, they show that income (of all countries together) is maximized by\nfree trade. If landlords are injured by a repeal of Corn Laws, they can be\nrecompensed and there will still be an unencumbered increase in income re-\nsulting from the adoption of free trade. Thus, without facing the ethical ques-\ntion of whether landlords' income is more or less important than consumers'\nincome, one can conclude that free trade is desirable. Whether landlords\nshould in fact be recompensed is of course an ethical problem concerning\nwhich these writers do not venture to make recommendations. (It is fair to\nsay, however, that no undue enthusiasm is displayed for recompensation.)\n\nIL The Objections\n\nAn extension of the foregoing argument will suggest the leading objections\nwhich may be raised against the new welfare economics. Consider theft; our\npresent policy toward this means of livelihood probably has adverse effects\non the national income. Prevention of theft and punishment of thieves involve\nsubstantial expenditures for policemen, courts, jails, locks, insurance salesmen,\nand the like. By compensating successful thieves for the amounts they would\notherwise steal, we save these resources and hence secure a net gain. (If this\npolicy leads to an undue increase in declarations of intent to steal, the retired\nsuccessful thieves\u2014who, after all, have special talents in this direction\u2014may\nbe persuaded to assume the police functions.) A similar argument could, I\nthink, be adduced to show that wars should be fought with checkbooks.\n\nThe replies to this reductio are obvious enough. It may not be quite so\nobvious that they are all applicable to the (typical) case of free trade, so the\nanalogy will be pressed. First, it would outrage our moral sensibilities to pay\nvoluntary tribute to thieves. The maximization of real national income is not\nthe only end of a society. Is it even the first?

                    "Thus, in the case of cold-rolled strip, which is used by Dr. Stigler as an\nexample, the percentage decline in the mill net figures between the smallest\n(1 to 3 tons) and the largest (300 to 1,000 tons) size groupings amounted to\n48.1 per cent. But the decline in the published figures (i.e., base price plus\nquantity extras) between the same size groups is only 8.2 per cent. In other\nwords, the decline in the published quantity extras comprises only a small\npart of the total decline shown in the monograph. This generalization, as may\nbe noted from the table, is true of all the other products analyzed in the\nmonograph, with the exception of steel plates for which the published quantity\nextras on very small shipments are comparatively high.\n\nFor Dr. Stigler's contention still to be tenable, it would be necessary that\nthe remainder of the decline in the mill net (i.e., that which is not due to the\nsmall decrease in the published quantity extras) be caused by a decline in\npublished quality extras. The assumption, however, that large buyers generally\npurchase steel of lower quality than small buyers simply has no justification\nin fact. Rather, the converse tends to be true. In the monograph, it was pointed\nout that ^. , . quality demands on large orders are frequently very exacting\"\n(p. 23). This represented a considerable understatement. The practice of the\nautomobile industry in demanding, and obtaining cold-rolled sheet and strip\nof extraordinarily exacting quality specifications is a well-known case in point.\n\nThus it does not appear that a decline either in published quantity extras\nor in published quality extras, or in both, could be responsible for more than\na small proportion of the decline shown in the mill net figures.\n\nThis indicates the existence of hidden concessions from extras, and it was\nconcessions of this type which were regarded in the monograph as discrimina-\ntory. But Dr. Stigler argues that these concessions might be justifiable on cost\ngrounds and therefore would not be discriminatory.\n\nThis may or may not be true. However, this argument that hidden conces-\nsions are not discriminatory if they reflect decreases in costs would indicate,\nif such were the case, that the published extras are discriminatory. In addi-\ntion, the argument is rather academic since no cost data by size of ship-\nment are available (or likely to be available because of the tremendous prob-\nlems of statistical compilation involved) and since it appears unlikely that\ndecreases in costs would be equal to the declines in the price figures, as shown\nin the monograph. One reason that the declines in costs would probably be\nless than the declines in prices is the fact that each shipment usually does not\nrepresent a separate rolling, since it is the practice of steel mills to group\ntogether a number of qualitatively similar orders which are then run as one\nrolling.\n\nFinally, in trying to make the point that price discrimination might not\nbe indicated by the data in the monograph, Dr. Stigler overlooks the declines\nshown in the base prices. These declines can only be regarded as discrimina-\ntory, since for a given product the base price is supposed to be the same for\nall buyers, regardless of the quantity or quality of the purchase,\n\nJouw M.

First, the taxation of spending not only reduces the ability of\nthe community to buy consumers! goods, but in addition encourages in-\ndividuals to save in order to reduce their tax liability. Second, the spend-\nings tax tends to immobilize savings already made. Especially if rates\nare sharply graduated, individuals with substantial savings are likely to\nhesitate to use them for consumption if a large proportion of this spend-\ning is absorbed as tax. Third, both in the higher and lower income\nbrackets income tax rates can become so high as to reduce incentive to\nproduce. A spendings tax avoids the difficulty by substituting a spend-\nings base for an income base so that marginal income tax rates need\nnot become high enough to exert this effect on incentive. Fourth, the\nincome tax is not sufficiently free from inequities to justify further\nimportant increases in rates without refinements in the concepts of\ntaxable income and the taxpayer unit, and in the rate structure, which\nwill require much time and effort to achieve. The enactment of a spend-\nings tax as a supplement to the income tax would make it possible to\nminimize the effect of some of these inequities because at a certain point\nthe tax base would be changed from income to spendings.\n\n\"The first and second of these arguments in favor of the spendings tax\noffer a means of minimizing price inflation, and therefore constitute\nthe primary reason, in the economic circumstances which have prevailed\nup to and through the winter of 1942-43, for urging the adoption of the\nspendings tax. The third argument is especially important when income\ntax rates have been increasing rapidly, but it might have to be re-\nevaluated as the economy became accustomed to high income tax rates.\nFor the purposes of this paper it is mainly the fourth in which we are\ninterested.

It is not the dissimilarity\nbetween private and public debt which is significant; rather, public authority\nbacked by the taxing and other sovereign powers can manipulate purchasing\npower and resources in ways which are not open to private enterprise.\n\n\"There is substantial evidence that continued prosperity rests on sustained\ndebt-creation. The 1920's were characterized by stability in the combined\ntotal of national, state and local government debt, but an enormous increase\noccurred in private debt, instalment sales, building mortgage, and corporate.\n\nWith many of our people living on a substandard, and most of the others\nfar from having their wants satiated, it would appear that the outlets for\nprivate expansion in plant, equipment and consumers! goods are enormous.\nWhether the political and social climate, labor-management relations, and\nthe cost-price relation will be sufficiently favorable to allow private enter-\nprise to direct its energies to the fulfillment of these wants may be the basic\nissues in the post-war period, once the initial spurt to meet deferred demands\nsubsides. There is no reliable indicator that a huge deficit-financed public\nspending program can evade these issues, if it is to create full employment.\n\nThe **no analogy between private and public debt\" spokesmen are strangely\ninclined to sidestep adequate discussion of these issues, In all major instances\nwhere the governments have assumed prime responsibility for output, such\nefforts have been associated with a regimented society.\n\nFurthermore, the growth of a vast public debt would probably encourage\nan increase in the rentier class; the debt would tend to be held largely by the\nbanks and other savers. The taxes levied to service the debt would tend to\nrest heavily upon the consuming public, thereby exercising a deflationary\ninfluence, while the interest earned by the debt would go into the hands of\nsavers, who, by and large, would want to re-invest much of the earning\u2014thus\naccentuating the *over-savings\" problem.\n\nMerely arguing that there is no analogy between private and public debt,\nthereby trying to dispel any fear of ultimate insolvency, and then proceeding\nwith a vast public expenditure program financed largely with deficits are no\nguarantee of full employment under a system in which many or most of the\nfactors of production have their prices determined by artificial forces.\n\nEwrnsoN P.

The same can be said for\nexpansion of private loans through the banking system, as was the case in\nthe 1920's. What then, may one ask, becomes of the statement that \"Every\nanalogy [of public borrowing] to private borrowing must be completely\nfalse\"?\n\nAs for the day of reckoning, both private and public debtors must avoid\noverextension as evidenced by the bankruptcies of private concerns and the\ninflation, devaluation, and debasement experienced by governments all over\nthe world and through all history.?\n\nTo be sure, there are cases where public debts have grown steadily over\nmany decades without serious difficulty arising. Are there any cases of record\nwhere governments have systematically over long periods of time, as is now\nproposed for the next decades of the United States, deliberately operated on\nvast deficits for extended periods in order to inject into the economy substan-\ntial quantities of extra purchasing power?\n\nSustained and perhaps perpetual deficit financing is justified on the theory\nthat it will so stimulate the economy that additional interest payments will\nbecome quite manageable. The same argument may be made for expanding\nprivate borrowing booms, so long as they last. May the same doubt not be\nraised of perpetually expanding public loans? When borrowing slows down,\nthe economy is likely to stagnate. Additional funds borrowed and spent by\nprivate or public bodies are subject to the principle of the multiplier including\nthe leakages. Once the rate of new loans declines, the economy shrinks; this\nis true of private loans and nothing has been stated to show that public bor-\nrowing is not subject to this same variant of the deceleration principle.\n\nEmploying public borrowing to mitigate the business cycle with the conse-\nquent alternating periods of debt-creation and debt-repayment, thus balancing\nthe budget over the course of the business cycle, is generally accepted by\neconomists as desirable policy. But the recent proposals of those who think\nthat our *mature economy\" calls for perpetual public deficits raises entirely\ndifferent questions.\n\nA private concern\u2014the New York Central Railroad, for example, in the\nfirst 75 years of its history\u2014may go ever deeper into debt so long as the\nfunds are being put to productive purposes and the servicing of the debt is\nadequately safeguarded by the earnings of the company. Similarly a govern-\nment may raise its debt obligations and keep them under manageable control\nso long as the incomes of the people and therefore their taxpaying capacity\nare favorably conditioned. The credit of the government, and therefore its\nability to sell new obligations at moderate interest rates, depends upon the\nlenders! views as to the ultimate solvency of the debtor; the same is true of\nthe New York Central Railroad or any other private borrower. What then\nbecomes of the alleged complete dissimilarity between private and public debt?\n\nThe ownership of private and public debts likewise shows no fundamental\n\n?* A century and a half ago a writer, whom we now quote only when it suits our purposes,\nsaid, \"When national debts have once been accumulated to a certain degree, there is scarce,\nI believe, a single instance of their having been fairly and completely paid.\" Adam Smith,\nThe Wealth of Nations, Everyman ed., Vol. 2, p. 412.\n"

Perhaps we can't learn enough to manage it, but I, for\none, am not yet prepared to admit that democracy is dead.\n\n'There are two approaches to the national debt which I should like to refer\nto as \"theological.\" One is to deny that there can be any possible burden. I\nsubmit that this is nonsense. The other is to dwell upon the burden, at the\n'expense of the benefits, and to treat the national debt as if it were an evil in\nitself to be avoided at all hazards. Mr. Ratchford, I feel, inclines perhaps too\nmuch to this latter view. The third, and practical, approach is to recognize\nthe difficulties, but to consider them in the light of the benefits, and to treat\nthe debt as being iz itself neither good nor bad, but only an instrument of\npolicy along with many others.\n\nAs I write, the 5 per cent \"forced saving\" victory tax is being debated.\nThis eminently sound method of preventing war inflation would have been\nadopted long ago but for a deeply rooted fear of debt per se. If Mr. Ratch-\nford's article serves, at this juncture, to reinforce uncritical prejudices re-\ngarding debts its effects may be very regrettable. I hope, however, that it will\nmerely serve to put an end to further fine-spun debates about the existence\nof a burden, and to focus our attention upon the practical issues and practical\nalternatives at stake.\n"

In the Cement Case before the Com-\nmission in the fall of 1942, counsel for the Commission states: *If a\nsingle corporation owned all the mills and attempted to operate them,\nthat is just what it would do to prevent them from competing with\neach other. Such a monopoly would act just as respondent manu-\nfacturers under separate ownership are acting when they use the\n[multiple] basing point system.\"* This statement is incorrect. A\nmonopolist would never adopt the basing-point system, since he could\nalways increase his profits by leaving the price pattern unchanged and\neliminating cross-hauling. It follows that if, as is contended by its\nopponents, the existence of the system implies collusion, it is collusion\nshort of complete agreement. On the other side, it is contended for the\nrespondents in the Cement Case: \"The term [imperfect competition]\nhas no relation to monopoly, does not shade into monopoly. ... It isa\nnatural phenomenon and is the inevitable form of competition in all\nmanufacturing industry. It is entirely consistent with free competition\nand does not imply less or weaker competition, since it is frequently\nmore keen and vigorous than *perfect competition! would be.\"* Suffice\nit to say that no economist would endorse this statement; but the\nstatement was made by learned counsel who had heard the testimony\nof a galaxy of economic talent.\n\nConvincing evidence can certainly be adduced that the basing-point\nsystem neither conforms to the economist's ideal of perfect competition,\nnor to his anathema, pure monopoly. But surely it is obvious that the\nmonopoly-competition controversy from an economic point of view is\nbarren, since the basing-point system involves imperfect competi-\ntion, containing elements both of competition and monopoly; and to\nabolish the basing-point system and require, say, f.o.b. mill pricing\nwould merely substitute one form of imperfect competition for an-\nother. This is the point of view of J. M. Clark? and M. G. de Chazeau.*\nAlthough these writers have clearly recognized the nature of the prob-\n\nfor getting to the heart of economic problems.

Three years later, in August\n1942, gross national product was 167 billion dollars (annual rate),\nindustrial production was up 74 per cent, and all wholesale prices\nexcept farm products and foods had risen 19 per cent.

The existing explicit price schedules covering a number of spe-\ncifically defined commodities were mainly continued, but to the re-\nmainder of the economy the new regulation applied, with a group of\nimportant exceptions, a general \"freeze\" of the prices of all goods\nand services at the highest levels at which actual deliveries or offers\nwere made during the base-period of March 1942. The areas directly\naffected by this new control were primarily the retail sales of com-\nmodities and services, though manufacturing and wholesaling were\ndirectly influenced in many cases and indirectly in others.\n\nThe record of administration of this regulation has been one of con-\ntinued retreat from the declared objective. In almost the first days of\nits life, a procedure was established for adjusting the individual re-\ntailer's prices upward to the going-level for specific classes of sellers in\nparticular communities. The same principle was later applied to whole-\nsaling and manufacturing. There followed a succession of amendments\nauthorizing increases in the general level of prices for particular com-\nmodities, and establishing the governing principle of replacement\ncosts plus customary rates of markup for certain groups of seasonal,\nnew and unstandardized commodities covering a wide range of both\nconsumer and producer goods.\n\nOn the enforcement front also difficulties were encountered. The\neducational task proved to be a formidable one, particularly at the\nretail level where the most severe problems had been anticipated. The\ncontrol of services raised almost insurmountable difficulties. Compre-\nhensive price freezing is at best extremely hard to enforce.

                    "Saving of Individuals in Relation to Income\n\nIn a recent article Mordecai Ezekiel raised the interesting question as to\nwhether individuals in this country tend to persist in habits of consumption\nspending; that is, whether during years of decreasing income they tend to\nspend more and to save less in relation to their income than during years of\nincreasing income. Partly to answer this question, Ezekiel made two analyses,\none of data on private saving and the other of data on consumption. Un-\nfortunately, both analyses include serious errors of data or of interpretation,\nas we shall briefly point out.\n\n1. Functional Relation of Saving and Income. By an oversight, the values\nfor saving (total offsets to saving, according to the Currie definition) as given\nby Ezekiel in his Tables I and II and also as plotted in his Figures 2 to 5 are\nall erroneous for the years 1929-40 because they omit the net contributions\nof the state and local governments. The omitted amounts varied from 1.4\nbillion dollars in 1931 to minus 1.2 billion dollars in 1934. The corrected values\nare plotted in Figure 1.? Comparison with Ezekiel's corresponding Figure 5\nshows that the corrected points for the seven depression years 1930-36 lie only\nabout half as far, on the average, from the trend line drawn symmetrically\nthrough them.\n\n2. Functional Relation of Consumption and Income. In his Figures 8 and 9\nEzekiel plots consumption as a function of net national income whereas he\nshould have used gross private income as in his Figures 4 and 5. Estimates\nof consumption are obtained by subtracting estimates of saving from estimates\nof income; hence, a plot of consumption vs. income is also a plot of saving vs.\nincome; and the choice of income used determines the kind of saving plotted.\nAs a result of Ezekiel's choice of net national income, his Figures 8 and 9\nand his corresponding equation really relate to net total saving, including\ngovernment net saving, instead of to private saving; hence, no conclusion\nas to spending habits can be drawn from this analysis.\n\n3.

                    "Buchanan's Theory of Fluctuations in Business Profits\n\nIn the December, 1941, issue of the Review! Professor Buchanan proposed\na \"general theory\" which accounts for fluctuations in business profits in flexi-\nbilities in demand and price as they affect gross income, and the degree of\nproportional variation of expenses relative to this income. Of prime importance\nin the explanation of the failure of expenses to vary proportionately with gross\nincome are the arbitrary and illogical accounting methods of the rule of *'cost\nor market whichever is lower\" for inventory valuation and the straight-line\nmethod of depreciation. Because of this fact, he says, it is time to re\u00e9xamine\nthese accounting techniques of the individual concern because of the adverse\neffect which they have on the total economy.\n\nBoth of these accounting techniques, according to Professor Buchanan,\naugment profits in prosperous years and diminish them in poor ones. It is\ngenerally true that in the case where market values at the end of the year\nare less than cost, accountants may allow, and perhaps erroneously, an external\nfactor of price fluctuation to affect the cost of goods sold, and this practice\nmay accentuate the fluctuation in business profit for that year.? The net effect\non the profit for a particular year depends, of course, upon whether the\nbeginning inventory was taken at cost or at market prices. Accountants will\nnot, however, understand or agree with his statement that the rule of the\n*]ower of cost or market\" augments profits in periods of rising prices (p. 738).\n\n* Details of the calculations, based largely on Kuznets, of. cit., will be furnished by the\nwriter on request.\n\n1 N.

                    "Price Control and Rationing\n\nCertain of the recent contributors to the Review writing on price control and\nrationing have ignored what seems to be the most important question of all.\nMost people concede that the present war will be in part decided by the rela-\ntive economic efficiency of Germany and the United States. Hence the ultimate\ncriterion of any program for freezing prices and rationing commodities should\nbe its contribution to economic efficiency as judged by wartime needs; i.e.,\nthe satisfaction of only the most essential needs of every family or person with\na minimum expenditure of resources retained from the war effort. Compared\nwith this it is immaterial if the prices of goods rise or fall.\n\nThe Administration presumably has no trust in the allocating efficiency of\nthe price system in time of war because of the considerable income inequalities\nwhich exist amongst consumers and because contracts based on costs prevent\nmaterial prices acting as rationers amongst defense firms. The increasingly\nfavored alternative is to distribute agents and final products by direct action\nmethods and to freeze the devitalized prices according to popular dictates.\nFailing supplies of essential products will then be subsidized.\n\nThis cure may be worse than the ailment. The labor cost of bureaucratic\nallocation is considerable for all concerned.

During the past ten years the discussions of\ndeficit financing have revived this issue but apparently have done little\nto settle it. Those who, following the Keynesian analysis, have favored\ndeficit financing have concentrated their attention upon the income-\ngenerating potentialities of debt creation and have dismissed the ques-\ntion of the burden of the debt in later years with the general statement\nthat an internally-held debt imposes no economic burden. On the other\nhand, those who have made special studies of the latter question have\nfrequently arrived at a different conclusion.\n\nSince the federal debt will increase greatly during the present war,\nit is a matter of considerable importance to know whether that debt\nwill be an economic burden in the post-war years. It might influence\nour attitude toward borrowing during the war; it would certainly affect\nour attitude toward deficit financing after the war.\n\nIn the discussion which follows it is assumed that the large post-war\ndebt will be held internally, that a considerable proportion will be held\nby commercial banks, and that the debt will never be reduced substan-\ntially, but that interest will be paid regularly. It is also assumed that\nCongress will continue to frame tax laws as in the past, giving more\nheed to political than to economic considerations, but that the level of\ntaxation will be much higher than in the past, with considerable re-\nliance upon a progressive personal income tax and a heavy corporate\nincome tax.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the point under consideration is the\n\n'See, for example: Ursula K.

                    "Uninvested savings, we shall find, have at each moment a balance-\nsheet magnitude as precise as that of a bank deposit. This magnitude\nchanges from hour to hour and from year to year. Alterations of this\nmagnitude have highly significant consequences. One of the most\ndangerous economic fallacies is, then, the idea that saving equals in-\nvestment. Real saving is but another aspect of real investment; but\nit is financial saving, not real saving, that diminishes the demand for\ngoods and expands the demand for securities.\n\nSome precision will be needed in this analysis. The following defini-\ntions are therefore submitted not because they are especially novel,\nbut because the rigidity of concepts characteristic of investment analy-\nsis will facilitate revelation of the elements omitted by Mr. Keynes\nand by many other writers. References to their writings must, how-\never, be restricted severely. Even the briefest examination of each of\nthe many differences among concepts would expand the discussion of\ndefinitions to such length as to preclude a survey of the results that\ncan be secured through the use of more accurate concepts.\n\nIn order to examine the phenomena significant for this purpose, all\nassets or property must first be divided into three classes: money,\nproducts, and rights. Money will exclude interbank and United States\ngovernment deposits but will include all other demand deposits and\ncurrency in circulation except cash in the vaults of active banks. The\nsignificant distinction is, therefore, that between the next two items.\n\nA $roduct is any good such that its sale creates either income or\nordinary revenue for some producer. Because of this resort to an\naccounting concept, products may be distinguished from other goods.\nThese products include business inventories as well as the services\nrendered by men and by property. The purchase of a product by either\nbusiness man or consumer advances the process of current production\nthrough one step.\n\nRights, as the term will be used here, consist of all assets not in-\ncluded within the definitions of money or of products. A house, when\nin the possession of some home owner, would therefore be a right;\neven though a few months earlier, if then in the possession of some\nspeculative builder, that house would have been a product. To a home\nowner the selling price of his house would not be ordinary revenue.\n",

In September 1940 when\nefforts at price control were first informally begun, there were already\nthose, marked by the experience of 1917-18, who advocated a general\nfreezing of prices and wages. The majority of economists, however,\nopposed such wide and drastic action at that time. The impact of the\narmament program was still extremely uneven, and it was felt that price\nand wage increases in certain areas might usefully serve to redistribute\nresources and to stimulate output, at least up to the level of current\nfixed capacity. Control was instituted in those individual markets where\nexisting and anticipated war demands were most strongly felt and where\nsubstantial price increases had already taken place\u2014at first largely\nmetals and metal products, and lumber. During the year 1941 most of\nthe basic materials, other than farm products, and some semi-fabricated\nand finished goods, were brought under control.\n\nBetween February and December 1941 some 45 formal price sched-\nules were fixed. In December 1941 and January 1942, with the sharp\nacceleration in production and production plans, 42 schedules were re-\nquired. In the year ending January 1942 the average monthly increase\nin wholesale prices was at a rate of 1.7 per cent; in the month after\nPearl Harbor, at a rate of 2.6 per cent.

                    "By W. ALLEN WarLis\n",
                    "I\n\nThe growing scarcity of consumers' goods makes the problem of\nrationing them increasingly urgent. Sugar, typewriters, bicycles, auto-\nmobiles, tires, and gasoline are already subject to direct administrative\nrationing. Although no widespread infringement of the sugar regulations\nis apparent, the experience with tires and gasoline, if it should become\nmore general, would be tragic. Even with sugar the cost of administra-\ntion is not to be blinked at in a country straining every nerve toward\nwar production.\n\nA fundamental difficulty with administrative rationing is that equal\nallotments do not result in equal treatment or equal sacrifice. This has\nbeen recognized for tires and gasoline, and varying quantities have been\nallowed different classes of consumers. But no administrative board can\nappraise the merits of claims for allotments above the minimum, nor\ncan it control the disposition of the commodity once allotted. Perhaps\nit can determine that a gasoline user's work is important for defense\nand that no public conveyance is available; it cannot judge whether he\ncould shift his residence, change jobs, ride with a neighbor. And most\nof its problems are far more complicated than this one. For success a\nrationing board requires a nearly unanimous feeling by the general pub-\nlic that rationing is necessary, that the board's methods are proper,\nand that its administration is competent, uniform and impartial.\n\nIn our economy goods have normally been apportioned through the\nprice mechanism. The commodity goes to those who want it badly\nenough to pay the price, this being dependent upon need or taste for the\ncommodity, upon the acceptability of substitutes, and especially upon\nincomes. 'The income element in determining the distribution of goods\nand services is always a source of social concern. This concern occa-\nsionally results in direct allocation of goods and services outside the\nprice system, notably free education and medical facilities, and more\noften it leads to efforts to redistribute income, notably through pro-\ngressive income, gift, and inheritance taxes.\n\nIn wartime the r\u00f3le of income in rationing through the price mecha-\nnism becomes crucial, whether the peacetime distribution of income\n",

                    "By RarPH E. HOoLBEN\n",
                    "Introduction\n\nRationing is a logical concomitant of any policy designed to control\nretail prices, since it is the only way in which the discrepancy between\nmounting consumers! demand and limited supply can effectively and\nequitably be handled. To fix prices at the retail level without a general\nplan for rationing would result in an informal sort of rationing by the\nseller wherein any prejudice or preference he may have could exert an\nundesirable influence; iso facto rationing is a prerequisite to any pro-\ngram which would distribute limited supplies equitably to the consum-\ning public.\n\nSince the fundamental theory of rationing is to equate demand and\nsupply and thereby perform (in a limited sense) the function of the\nprice mechanism, any plan of rationing must seek to regulate the flow\nof rationed commodities from the manufacturer to the retailer as well\nas the ultimate sale to the consumer. Once it is decided some form of\nrationing is necessary, fari passu it follows that a complete program\nco\u00f3rdinating output and consumption must be adopted. Specific ration-\ning, such as point rationing, if effectively administered, can equate\ndemand and supply and distribute limited supplies equitably among\nthe consuming public. Specific rationing has the virtue of being able to\nmeet particular problems of economic maladjustment as they arise.\nGeneral expenditure rationing, while it will bring about a state of sta-\nbility in the general price level, will create innumerable problems of\ndisequilibrium in the case of particular commodities, the impact of\nwhich would tend to disrupt the entire economy for some period of time.\n\nAs this discussion is developed, it will be shown that, though Mr.\nKalecki fully appreciates the theoretical necessity of a program of ra-\ntioning, his plan for carrying out such a program is both theoretically\ninvalid and practically quite unworkable.\n\nThis paper will demonstrate that the general principle of expenditure\nrationing is quite incompatible with the present program for price\ncontrol in the United States.\n",

                    "By SipNEY WEINTRAUB\n",
                    "I. Introduction\n\nModern economic analysis might be dated as beginning with the\nintensified study of the forces of demand. The use of the demand curve\nhas accompanied this development almost from the start. Nevertheless,\ndespite the importance of this analytic tool there are few thorough-\ngoing discussions of the foundations on which the curve rests. Isolated\nremarks are found in abundance, especially so in recent years when the\nconventions of earlier practice have been called into question. It is\nprobably time to integrate these remarks and to see where they lead:\nto contrast them to the older ideas and their end-results.\n\nIn the discussion, attention will first be devoted to the older, and\nmore usual, views of the demand curve. Actually this amounts to an\nexamination of Marshall's assumptions. For not only did he take the\ntrouble to mention its grounding, in contrast to lesser luminaries, but\nhe also did most to implant the curve in the general and professional\nconsciousness, although not actually the first to use the concept.\"\n\nAfter surveying Marshall's ideas, stress will be placed on the major\ntheme of the article, namely, of the interrelations among demand curves.\n\"Then, after consideration of some supplementary matters, a restatement\nof the assumptions on which the demand curve rests will be offered.\n",

The Marshallian Demand Curve\n\nTurning through Marshall's Principles for a statement of the assump-\ntions on which he draws the demand curve we find them to be fourfold:\n(1) given tastes of the consumer; (2) given income in the hands of the\nconsumer; (3) prices (and quantities consumed?) of other commodities\ngiven and constant; (4) the marginal utility of money to consumers\n\n! Among those who antedated Marshall were Cournot, Jevons and Walras in content\nif not always in geometry. Vet I think the r\u00f3le attributed to Marshall is merited. But\nsee the use made of the curves by Fleeming Jenkins, The Graphic Representation of the\nLaws of Supply and Demand (London: Series of Reprints of the London School of\nEconomics, No. 9, 1931). Despite the recent resuscitation of this work it does not seem\never to have had a wide audience. Marshall, however, does refer to it.

He shows\nthat the replacement of labor by the machine may reduce the utilization\nof existing equipment, because it sy increase the volume of speculative\nbalances and /ower the size of the current money flow. Throughout my paper\nI assumed, in accordance with most of the former writers on the subject\nof technological unemployment and for the sake of the argument, that *'Say's\nLaw\" was in force, i.e., that an appropriate money flow was maintained. Since\nMr. Hagen admits that this is possible (second paragraph, second sentence of\nhis note), my analysis seems to cover wider grounds than his. Moreover, one\nfundamental proposition of short-run price theory, viz., that supply curves\nare positively inclined, is needed by Mr. Hagen as well as by me, although Mr.\nHagen seems to dispute that. Were the supply curves horizontal, then total\nunemployment (voluntary and involuntary) in the Keynesian system (which\nunderlies Mr. Hagen's argument) could be eliminated by the simple device\nof increasing the stock of money. Surely, unemployment existing solely because\nof the inadequacy of the monetary institutions could not be called technologi-\ncal according to customary terminology.\n\nMr. Hagen misjudges the relative positions of our theoretical arguments\nbecause he seems to have difficulty in recognizing a theoretical idea if it is\ncouched in terms he is not accustomed to. Witness his footnote 4: *Neisser's\nargument that the quantity of fixed capital is of peculiar importance . . .\nin limiting employment, seems totally untenable. . . .

                    "The Introductory Course: Comment\n\nExperience has led me to agree with many of the comments of Messrs.\nRichard Clemence and Francis S. Doody, in the June issue! as to the diffi-\nculty of teaching theoretical economics to beginning students who are uncon-\nvinced of its value and whose economic studies are confined to a single semes-\nter or academic year. I should suggest, however, that this objection holds not\nonly against the type of theoretical presentation normally given freshmen\nand sophomores, but also against the Keynesianized presentation advocated\nby Messrs. Clemence and Doody and embodied to a considerable extent in\nthe excellent text of Messrs. Meade and Hitch. The propositions of Mr.\nKeynes and his followers appear to the typical college sophomore\u2014and I\nthink I speak from experience\u2014as difficult and as abstract as do the rami-\nfications of comparative advantage, marginal utility, or monopolistic com-\npetition. Students with business experience are frequently dissatisfied with\nthe stress laid by Mr. Keynes on interest as a causative factor in determining\nthe level of income and employment. Others refuse to accept the savings-\ninvestment equality without a great deal of highly involved and elaborate\nargument along Robertsonian lines. A smaller and more select group regularly\nobjects to the treatment of all labor as homogeneous. Disentanglings and\nmodifications are of course possible, but they take more time than they are\nworth, except to a tiny minority of potential economics *\u00abmajors.\"\n\nIn attacking the essentially institutional introductory course, Messrs\nClemence and Doody do not lay sufficient stress, it seems to me, on three of\nthe most telling objections to it: First, the inclusion of so wide a range of\ntopics and problems as is included in any of the institutionalist texts, or even\nthe inclusion of any profuse selection therefrom, makes the discussion of any\nsingle topic, be it banking or war economics or social security legislation,\nso sketchy as to add little but memorized facts to the student's pre\u00e9xisting\nknowledge as obtainable from the daily press. Second, this sketchiness of\ntreatment, plus the absence of any standards of theoretical reasoning, serves\nto strengthen the student's initial appraisal of economics as a branch of the\nforensic arts, in which any opinion is as good as any other, and in which\nacceptance is dependent on oratory and authority.

It will be the concern of this paper to examine the\ncircumstances under which the American controls operate with a view\nto determining what conditions may be necessary or desirable before\nthe United States can safely reopen its money markets to foreigners.\n\nThe immediate objective of any exchange control is to bring foreign\ntransactions under the scrutiny of a governmental agency in order that\nthe particular purposes of the government may be enforced. While\nthese purposes differ widely among the various countries, they ordi-\nnarily are concerned with (1) the rationing of foreign exchange ren-\ndered scarce by continued strains, arising from the balance of payments,\non cash resources,? and/or (2) the supervision of imports with a view\nto influencing the terms of trade or in support of internal economic\npolicies of the government. In general it may be said that government\nintervention in the foreign exchange markets has been provoked in most\ncases either as a necessary feature of governmental regulation of trade,\nor as a sort of temporary receivership for deranged national accounts,\nwhere the alternatives\u2014uncontrolled currency depreciations or formal\ndevaluations\u2014were thought to be more onerous methods of securing\nthe needed correction in the balance of payments.\n",

INVESTMENT, NATIONAL INCOME, AND THE SAVING-\nINVESTMENT \u00c9QUILIBRIUM\n\nIn the first article of this series we dealt with the functional relation\nbetween national income and saving or consumption as derived from\nstatistical analysis of data for the United States covering the past two\ndecades.' The hypotheses tested in the last article were:\n\n1. Saving is a function of the current level of income, increasing as\nthe level of income increases, but at a higher rate.\n\n2. Consumption is a function of the current level of net income, in-\ncreasing as the level of income increases, but at a lower rate than in-\ncome.\n\n3. The patterns of thrift, expenditure, and consumption at any given\nlevel of income are habitual patterns of action, changing only gradu-\nally in time, so that changes in current income received by each group\nproduce reasonably consistent changes in total consumption and saving.\n\nIn this article we shall examine for the same period the apparent\nrelation of investment to income while holding constant, where possible,\nthe effects of other related factors. Since by our definition in any one\nyear total investment equals total saving, the over-all relation must be\nthe same as that already shown in Figures 4 and 5 of the previous\narticle. This presents a difficulty which is similar to that of attempting\nto derive both a demand curve and a supply curve from a series of prices\nand quantities. However, we may gain a much better understanding\nof how the yearly equilibrium of total saving and investment happens\nto have been struck at the levels of gross national income prevailing\nduring each of the past twenty years if we look further into the com-\nponent elements of investment and how they are related to income and\nother factors.\n\nIn addition to studying the behavior of investment under the fluctuat-\n\ning conditions of the past twenty years, we shall also investigate what\n\n!

Since the phrase is now break-\ning into the newspapers economists are obliged, if only in self-defense,\nto have a clear understanding of it.\n\nThe currency of the phrase is, of course, a reflection of the enormous\nwartime increase in government spending and the resulting danger of\nserious inflation. Although the phrase is new, the idea that it represents\nis familiar; namely, the excess of demand over supply at a specified\nprice, applied to total effective demand, aggregate supply, and some\nprice level. The concept is most often used in connection with tax policy,\nspecifically in calculations of what amounts of additional taxation are\nrequired to prevent inflation.\n\nInstead of considering first the meaning or rather the various mean-\nings of the term \"inflationary gap\" and then considering estimating pro-\ncedures, it may be more instructive to reverse the order and to consider\ntwo estimating procedures first and then to compare their meanings.\n\nAll procedures involve a comparison of estimates of the potential real\noutput of goods and services with estimated demand, based upon as-\nsumed levels of defense expenditures. In most cases some recent date is\ntaken as a base. It is assumed that the prices of this base date are the\nones to be stabilized and therefore that the gap at that date is zero.\nConsequently, the various supply and demand factors are expressed in\nterms of changes from that base.\n\n1. The procedure used in a report soon to be published? compares the\nexpansion of real output with the increase in defense expenditures\n(supposedly on the basis of deliveries of defense material) and obtains\nas a difference the necessary reduction of civilian output.

I shall pass in review, and appraise, a recent\nnewcomer in the long series of efforts at quantification in economics,\nthe literature on statistical cost functions.\n\nThe subject invites comparison with a closely associated develop-\nment, the measurement of demand functions. From Gregory King to\nMarschak's most recent contribution, the process has been one of ever\ncloser interpenetration of facts and theory. It is typical, for instance,\nthat even to Marshall, aware though he was of the influence of factors\nother than price, elasticity of demand exclusively meant elasticity\nwith respect to price, all other factors expressing their influence\nthrough either shifts or distortions in that price-quantity function.\nMarshall never used the concept of income-elasticity of demand. It\nwas for H. L. Moore, the econometrician, to develop the idea of gen-\neralized partial elasticity coefficients of demand. As to the particular\ndependence of demand upon income and its elasticity, a relatively\nrecent, and essentially measurement-inspired addition to the econo-\nmist's toolbox, its possibilities for the further development of theo-\nretical reasoning have already been exploited by Bowley and Allen,\nand have certainly contributed to shape Hicks's ideas. In other words,\nMarshall, the theorist, could afford to be content with stating \u00a3e law\nof demand\" ceteris paribus. But attempts at measurement very soon\nmade it necessary to find out what exactly the more important ones\namong the \"other things\" really were. For measurement of the price-\nquantity function is possible only if the influence of the ce\u00a3era is suc-\ncessfully eliminated, and in order to eliminate we must know Aat and\nhow much. The devices invented for the purpose of isolating what to\nMarshall was \u00a3\u00a3e law of demand have in turn proved stimulating to\nreasoning of a purely theoretical kind.\n\nLater I shall examine whether a similar development can be expected\n\n'A paper presented at a joint meeting of the American Economic Association and the\nEconometric Society, held in New York, December 29, 1941.\n"

Students,\nin larger and larger numbers, are looking to the teacher of economics\nfor an explanation of the great changes that are everywhere taking\nplace.\n\nIn quieter times students begin their study of economics without\na great deal of enthusiasm, and the first few meetings of the class often\nsucceed in putting an end to whatever small interest in the subject they\nmay originally have had. In days like the present, however, the teacher\nof economics, in his annual retreat from reality, finds it increasingly\ndifficult to take his students with him. He is brought face to face with\nresponsibilities which become no easy matter to evade. Not that most\nteachers are particularly anxious to evade their responsibilities to their\nstudents, but in more peaceful days they may easily do so without being\naware of the fact. This is no longer possible in periods of rapid and\nviolent change, and the teacher of economics finds himself in a difficult\nand embarrassing position. The teacher himself, we hope to make clear,\nis not wholly to blame for his predicament. It is but one of the\nsymptoms of the generally unsatisfactory state into which the course\nin introductory economics has fallen. Indications are not lacking that\nthere is a growing appreciation of the inadequacy of much of our teach-\ning, and the time may well have been reached for a clear formulation\nof the issues.\n\nThe teacher of economics has accepted a position carrying with it\ngreat responsibilities, for he claims to possess both an understanding\nof the course of events beyond that of ordinary men, and the ability to\nimpart this knowledge to others. The results of current teaching in\nmost courses in general economics, however, make it difficult to believe\nthat most teachers are living up to their claims. Economists, of course,\ndo not pretend to be able to explain everything important that is\nhappening in the world of reality. Yet, nearly every competent teacher\nof economics knows vastly more of vital interest to his students than\nhe ever tells them.

It\nhas little relevance for the distribution of the current war burden, and it\nseems as likely as not to be incorrect in viewing the distribution of income by\nclasses over time.\n\nIt is surely well established by now, though unfortunately not yet recog-\nnized by some of our congressional leaders, that the burden of the present war\neffort cannot be sloughed off by this generation onto later ones, by borrowing\nor otherwise, Thus the argument that future peacetime taxes may be more\nequitably allocated than present ones is largely irrelevant for discussion of an\nequitable distribution of the current war burden, even assuming that future\ntaxes actually can be more equitably distributed (which is far from certain).\nIn considering the allocation of the burden of war financing, the real com-\nparison must be between the distribution of the tax burden now and the bond\nburden now (including the price inflation which will probably come with bor-\nrowing), rather than between present and future taxes. And if it is true that\nthe very low income groups lose especially from inflation\u2014and there is con-\nsiderable truth in the statement\u2014then even the fact that the rich buy the\nbonds does not necessarily mean a more equitable distribution of the present\nburden through borrowing, since borrowing from the rich is especially likely\nto draw on otherwise \"idle\" funds and speed price inflation.\n\nThe question of the relationship of war financing and income distribution\nover time (as distinct from the distribution of the war burden) is a much more\nsubtle one than has been generally recognized. It is by no means clear that\nthe low income groups are better off if we borrow now than if we tax, even\nthough future taxes are. assumed to be more progressive than present ones\n\n! am indebted to Dr. R.

His explanation of this is facili-\ntated by the distinction between loan interest and basic interest. Loan interest\nis used in the ordinary sense, referring to the amount of money paid by bor-\nrowers to the lenders of liquid funds. According to Gesell, the loan rate must\nalways equal the rate of return on real capital assets, whether the loan be\nmade in conventional money or stamped money. Loans contracted in stamped\nmoney will bear (loan) interest as long as the demand for loan capital exceeds\nthe supply at a zero loan rate.'* A zero loan rate must await the day when\nunimpeded accumulation causes capital assets to lose their scarcity value.\n\nIn saying that basic interest would disappear with the introduction of\nstamped money, Gesell means that the consequences which flow from the use\nof conventional money would be eliminated and processes set in motion which\nin time would reduce the loan rate and the real rate to zero. When this has\ncome about, interest income will disappear, and rentier capitalism will be at\nan end.\n\nIn this respect Gesell's ideas on long-run social reform are closely analogous\nto Keynes's *euthanasia of the rentier.\"*5 'The secular decline in the marginal\nefficiency of capital is another expression for Gesell's long-term reduction in\nthe rate of return on real capital. Keynes tells us he believes that, within a\nperiod of a generation or two, unchecked accumulation would make capital\nassets so abundant that they would cease to yield a return in excess of their\ncost.^ Both Keynes and Gesell maintain that pure interest can be made to\ndisappear without socializing the instruments of production. In the new so-\nciety individuals would still be free to accumulate, but their wealth would\nnot grow automatically through interest accruals. Nevertheless, skilled risk\ntakers would be free to venture their capital in new and uncertain enterprises,\nand if successful, would get a return in excess of their original investments.\nThus the advantages of individual initiative and enterprise would be retained,\nwhile nonfunctional income and other undesirable features of the capitalist\nsystem would disappear.\n\nThe immediately significant difference arising from the substitution of\nstamped money for conventional forms is that all resources would be con-\ntinuously employed. Basic interest would not exist as a barrier frustrating new\ncapital formation. The *natural\" forces of competitive production would\nadjust to a level of output at which resources would be fully employed. This\n\n?! Natural Economic Order, p. 263.\n\n?

In Hitler's famous list of twenty-five points, one of\nthe two points in bold-faced print calls for the *Brechung der Zinsknecht-\nschaft,\" i.e., for the abolition of *interest slavery.\" Although this anti-finance\ncapital outlook is significant, care must be taken not to identify the liberal,\nhumanitarian premises of Gesell's program with the fundamentally different\ntotalitarian premises of the Nazi party.\n\nIn order to explain how unemployment, crises and unearned income could\nbe remedied, Gesell employs a threefold classification of interest rates: the\nbasic rate (a theoretical rate), the rate of return to real capital (an estimated\nrate), and the loan rate (a contractual rate). Basic interest is described as a\npurely monetary phenomenon which has nothing to do with time-preference,\nwaiting, or the so-called *productivity\" of capital. It does not represent any-\nthing which exists in the real world, or at least there are no direct outward\nmanifestations of its existence. Gesell says, for example, \"Basic interest has\nup to the present escaped observation because it was concealed behind its\noffspring, ordinary interest upon loan-money. . . . Basic interest is a unique\nphenomenon which must be considered by itself; it is a fundamental economic\nconception.\"5 Attempts to apply the test of correspondence between the con-\ncept \"basic interest\" and the object signified by it are certain to yield nega-\ntive results because there is no signification of object. The concept has mean-\ning, but there is no question of its (immediate) truth or falsity. There can be\nno appeal to facts on this level of analysis.\n\nGesell attempts to clarify *basic interest\" by contrasting it with the *rate\nof return on real capital,\" i.e., with the hire price paid to the owners of assets\nother than money. In comparing this rate with the basic rate, he hastens to\nadd: *We ought to cease designating two such fundamentally different things\nby the same word, interest\"? This is the reference of Keynes's statement that\nGesell distinguishes clearly between the rate of interest and the marginal\nefficiency of capital.!?\n\nThis same distinction between basic interest and interest on real capital is\nalso used to contrast the declining rate of return on real capital assets with\nthe constant rate of return on money. In this way Gesell points out that it is\nthe money rate of interest which checks accumulation and impedes production.\nThe accumulation of capital assets in no way reduces the independently de-\ntermined money rate of interest. On the other hand, the accumulation of\ncapital assets does lower the rate of return on real capital. When the latter\nfalls below the basic (money) rate, accumulation ceases because it is now\nmore profitable to hold money than to invest. This forces those who need\nmoney as a medium of exchange to pay the (now) higher basic rate. This basic\nrate, according to Gesell, corresponds to the \"difference of efficiency between\n\n* Gottfried Feder, Hitler's Official Programme (London: Allen and Unwin, 1934), p. 40.\n\n* Natural Economic Order, pp. 265-66.

Sozialem Staat? contained the kernel of his ideas on monetary policy.\nBetween 1891 and 1898, Gesell published five other works on monetary\npolicy, but nothing specifically on monetary or general economic theory.\nThese were the formative years of his career.\n\nWhen Gesell returned to Europe in 1900 to reside in Switzerland and\nGermany, his practical reform proposals had already been worked out and\npublished in all their essentials. The formulation of his theory came later. In\n1911 he published Die neue Lehre vom Geld und Zins, which formed the\ntheoretical basis for his system of social reform.*\n\nA more detailed discussion is needed to indicate the logical, as distinguished\nfrom the chronological, relation of Gesell's program to his economic theory:\nfirst, because it has been the source of more misinterpretation of his position,\nand second, because of the somewhat more complicated nature of the prob-\nlem. Keynes, for example, has reversed the relation between Gesell's theory\nand program. In discussing Gesell's theory of interest, Keynes says Gesell\n*carried his theory far enough to lead him . . . to the famous prescription of\n*stamped' money.'* Keynes conveys the impression that Gesell arrived at his\npractical suggestion in spite of a *great defect\" in his theory, whereas it would\nbe more accurate to say that Gesell's theory is not, in some important respects,\nan adequate explanation of his practical suggestion. His theory is a refine-\nment of his insight that money should be forced to circulate by means of a\nperiodic tax which would offset the preference of wealth owners for *hoard-\ning\" money rather than spending it for some form of consumable or produc-\ntive wealth.\n\nGesell's contention that interest is a payment to prevent the *hoarding\" of\nmoney classes his interest theory with the \"exploitation\" doctrines of other\nsocialists. He regards the share of total social income represented by interest\nas a deduction from the income created by laborers, including industrial capi-\ntalists. His theory of interest is not, however, the same as the exploitation\ntheory of Marx. Gesell's position is both anti-classical and anti-Marxian. Al-\nthough he avowed himself a socialist and professed to be attacking capitalism\nas a whole, his anti-capitalistic position must be interpreted in terms of his\ndefinition of capitalism as \"the interest exploiting system.\"* In this particular\n",

                    "Silvio Gesell's Monetary Theory of Social Reform\n\nIn spite of the attention which has been given to the writings of Silvio\nGesell, the stamped money reformer, the unifying basis of his work has, I\nthink, been neither clearly stated nor satisfactorily elaborated. The relation\nbetween the theoretical and practical aspects of his analysis has been either\nignored, misunderstood or distorted.\n\nGesell's objective as a social reformer was to attack rentier capitalism and\nto substitute in its place an interest-free society. To fortify his reform posi-\ntion Gesell developed a system of economic theory in which he tried to demon-\nstrate that the nonutilization of resources and the presence of nonfunctional\nincome are the inevitable accompaniments of prevailing financial institutions.\nThe most important single phase of his theory as a whole is his theory of\ninterest. In its critical aspect this theory represents an attempt to show that,\nin a system of conventional money, interest income is a payment to prevent\nthe hoarding of money. In its positive aspect the theory is an attempt to\nshow that the introduction of stamped money would eliminate \"basic interest\"\nand thus pave the way to an interest-free economy, The purpose of this note\nis to show that Gesell's theory in general and his theory of basic interest in\nparticular represent an argument for his stamped money proposal. This may\nbest be shown by indicating that the practical insight which led Gesell to\npropose a tax on money was chronologically as well as logically prior to his\ntheoretical system.\n\nThat the practical aspect of Gesell's thought was chronologically prior is\nnot difficult to demonstrate. In 1886, at the age of twenty-four, Gesell mi-\ngrated from Europe to the Argentine to engage in foreign trade and small-\nscale manu\u00edacturing. There he witnessed one of the most speculative episodes\nin the history of modern capitalist development. The great boom from 1885\nto 1890 preceded a long and severe depression which lasted for the duration\nof Gesell's stay in the South American republic. The frustration of industrial\nactivity produced a strong current of resentment against the speculating\nfinanciers, brokers, stock jobbers and mortgagees. As one whose interests\nwere directly affected, and as one whose indignation was aroused by this\nfinancial debauchery, Gesell participated actively in the opposition to the\ngroup interests which appeared to be responsible for the chaotic state of\n\n!

No pronouncement by American economists has ever at-\ntracted the public attention that this received. It seems desirable, while\nmemories are reasonably accurate and some of the correspondence relating\nthereto is still available, to give a brief history of this protest. Since my friend,\nProfessor Clair Wilcox of Swarthmore, who was the leading spirit in the\nmatter, declines to tell the story, I take the liberty of doing so.\n\nWith the sharp division of economic opinion in recent years on so many\nissues of public policy, it is hard today to realize the almost unanimous op-\nposition of economists, in the spring of 1930, to the tariff bill then pending\nin Congress. Economic faculties that within a few years were to be split\nwide open on monetary policy, deficit finance, and the problem of big busi-\nness, were practically at one in their belief that the Hawley-Smoot bill was an\niniquitous piece of legislation. What later developed into a statement backed\nby over 1,250 economists originated in a very modest way out of the desire\nof Wilcox and some of his associates at Swarthmore to voice their protest. At\nthe suggestion of Wilcox, Professor Paul Douglas of the University of Chicago,\nwho was then temporarily at Swarthmore, drafted a statement in March that,\nwith some changes in phraseology, was the one given to the press five weeks\nlater. It was decided to ask an economist at each of various eastern uni-\nversities to sponsor the statement, and then to send it to a member of the\neconomics faculty at each American college, with the request that he solicit\nsignatures from his colleagues. Professors E. M. Patterson of Pennsylvania,\nFrank D. Graham of Princeton, Henry Seager of Columbia, Irving Fisher of\nYale, and F. W. Taussig of Harvard, were asked to join Wilcox and Douglas\nin sponsoring the statement. This they all agreed to do. As a result of the\ncomments of these men a few changes were made in the text, and at the sug-\ngestion of Fisher a paragraph was added pointing out the significance of\ntariff policy in connection with America's creditor position.\n\nFisher also made the suggestion that the entire membership of the American\n",

In few periods of history has capacity\nto produce goods grown more rapidly than in the last twenty years. The\nindustrial research staffs of American business in 1940 were nine times\nas large as in 1920, and so also were expenditures on research. At no\ntime in the country's history had its capacity to increase production\nbeen so great. And yet the community which possessed this unparalleled\nproductive capacity to improve methods and products did not glory in\nits strength. It was perplexed and baffled. Instead of looking forward\nconfidently to achieving ever rising standards of living, it dreaded the\nfuture. It asked whether investment opportunities were becoming per-\nmanently insufficient, whether the rules for achieving prosperity were\nundergoing fundamental changes, whether new conditions were making\nits economic institutions no longer workable.\n\nThis sense of doubt and inadequacy did not exist, in the United States\nat least, before 1929. It was created by the depression and by the dis-\nappointing recovery. The great national effort required by the war may\nprove to be precisely what is needed to restore the country's faith in its\ncapacity to master great problems. Nevertheless, the task of winning\nthe peace requires that we face frankly the questions raised by the de-\npression and the disappointing recovery. Is it true that new conditions\u2014\nthe decline in geographical expansion, the drop in population growth,\nshifts in economic and political power, and changes in public policy\u2014\nare radically altering the problem of maintaining employment, so that\nplans for the post-war world must envisage important changes in policies\nand institutions? The thesis of these remarks is that the answer to this\nquestion is a qualified Yes.\n",

            "found": "In the analyses of tax shifting, economists have concerned themselves\nprimarily with the long-run period. Few of them have given attention\nto the short-run period; and none of them has studied the probable\neffect of taxes on prices in the market period.' The present article is\nconcerned, therefore, with an analysis of the effect of taxation on the\ndisposition and price of goods already on hand, under conditions of\nboth pure and monopolistic competition. In this analysis, it will be\nshown that taxes which affect the disposition of stock-on-hand also af-\nfect simultaneously the rate of output in the succeeding production\nperiod. In other words, it will be shown that the seller's market period\nplans and short-period plans are synchronized? It is the reality of this\nsynchronization which has dictated the substitution of a sequence analy-\nsis for the Marshallian static analysis in the present study.\n\nIn Part I of this analysis, it is assumed that sellers have on hand a\nhighly perishable product for which there is neither the possibility of\ncarry-over nor of self-use. In Part II, it is assumed that carry-over and\nself-use are possible. The two parts of the study are not, however, of\nco\u00f3rdinate importance. The problems considered in Part II certainly\n\n' Throughout this study, market price refers to a price which is determined in the\nmarket period, Z.e., a period in which the supply of a good cannot exceed the stock already\nproduced and on hand.\n\n\"The reasoning and conclusions in this article are based upon the following general\nassumptions for both pure and monopolistic competition: (1) that taxes are general, (2)\nthat taxes are viewed as permanent by taxpayers, (3) that taxes do not affect demand\nSchedules, and (4) that \"pure competitors\" have identical cost and demand curves; and\nthat monopolistic competitors also have identical cost and demand curves. The definitions\nof pure and monopolistic competition which have been adopted in this article are those\nwhich have been given by Professor Chamberlin in The Theory of Monopolistic Compe-\ntition, 3rd ed., pp. 7-9. The analysis of the effect of taxation on price under monopolistic\ncompetition involves the following additional assumptions: (1) that there is complete\nprice interdependence between sellers, and (2) that the effects of selling costs, the total\nof which is assumed to be constant, are represented in the demand curve for the product\nof each firm. Under these assumptions, any one firm may be regarded as a representative\nmember for the group.\n\n*Tn the present study, it is assumed that a producer's plans do not extend beyond the\nmarket period and the succeeding production period. The length of this succeeding perioc\njs assumed to be typical of the production of a particular commodity, with existing scal\nof plant. It is such a \"succeeding period\" which is called the \"short-run period\" in tht\npresent article.\n"

Taxes may\nbe regarded as analogous to Federal Reserve open-market sales, ex-\npenditures as analogous to open-market purchases. But besides being\non a much larger scale than Federal Reserve operations, Treasury oper-\nations are more powerful, dollar for dollar. Federal Reserve operations\nare purchases and sales of securities which are almost perfect money\nsubstitutes. But the objects of Treasury operations are very unlike\nmoney. What the Treasury \"sells\" when it collects revenue is tax\nreceipts; its purchases range from planes and typewriters to cancelled\nchecks for old-age assistance. While Reserve operations affect only the\ncomposition of the public's capital assets, Treasury operations impinge,\nfurthermore, on income accounts. Both these differences give Treasury\noperations powerful leverage.\n\nIt is no novelty to suggest that since federal budgeting has monetary\nrepercussions it should be guided partly by monetary objectives.\nManipulation of federal expenditures to stimulate employment has\nbeen practical politics ever since 1933; and manipulation of taxes is a\nfamiliar idea at least to academicians. But the war emergency calls for\na shift in emphasis. Since the middle of 1940, defense has gripped the\nexpenditure side of the budget, and monetary considerations can no\nlonger affect the bulk of federal spending. If the budget is to be used\nconsciously for monetary control\u2014which at present means to check\ninflation\u2014flexibility must be on the revenue side.*\n\nThe Treasury, the Congress and the general public are of course\nfamiliar with the idea that taxes are anti-inflation weapons\u2014an obvious\nlesson of the world's long list of experiences with inflationary war\nfinance. But the application of this idea in American public policy has\ntaken the form merely of a rule of thumb\u2014Secretary Morgenthau's\n\n'! The writer is indebted to his colleague E. D. Allen for criticism and suggestions.\n\n*The writer does not mean, of course, that federal powers over the monetary situation\nare confined to taxation. Not to mention credit controls, a government borrowing program\nwhich stimulates saving can do a good deal to check inflation. But effects upon saving are\nlikely to be second-magnitude unless loans are made compulsory; and compulsory loans\nmay be regarded as sweetened taxes. (Cf. the writer's paper on forced loans at the Phila-\ndelphia meeting of the Tax Institute, Dec. 1, 1941, appearing in the forthcoming volume on\nNational Defense and. Taxation.)\n"

Both are penetrating analyses, written for scholarly\naudiences, and combine a broad scope with careful attention to detail,\nand both were published in 1941. Yet neither author thought it worth\nwhile to give more than passing notice to the phase of his subject which\nby the end of 1941 was the principal topic of discussion; namely, the\nprevention of an unduly rapid rise of money income. For both authors,\nthe fiscal and monetary problem was the prevention of deflation.\n\nObviously, if public expenditures are to be effective as an income\nstimulant they must be so financed as not to decrease other expenditures\naccordingly. Hence the choice for both authors is between deficit ex-\npenditures financed by borrowing from banks with excess reserves or\nfrom holders of capital balances (or conceivably by the issuance of\npaper money), and taxes that do not decrease either private consump-\ntion or private investment. Villard's emphasis is on deficit financing, the\nestate tax being the only important tax which he finds free from a\nsuspicion of having *income-decreasing\" effects. Hansen, however, is\nmore concerned about the possible future disadvantages of the ac-\ncumulation of government debt, the piling up of idle money in private\n\n! Fiscal Policy and. Business Cycles.
