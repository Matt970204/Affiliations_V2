Before the war a group of Oxford economists interviewed\na number of business men concerning the effect of the interest rate on\ninvestments, and the results of the inquiry have been summed up as\nfollows: \"The majority deny that their activities have been, or are likely\nto be, directly affected in any way by changes in interest rates. Of\nthose who take the view that they might sometimes be affected, few\nsuggest that the influence is an important one.\"*\n\nEconomists and monetary authorities, on the other hand, at least\nthroughout the nineteenth and the first three decades of the twentieth\ncentury, regarded interest policy as an effective instrument by which\nthe volume of investment could be contracted or expanded. Even today\nthis view has not been abandoned, although the emphasis has definitely\nshifted away from interest policy toward variations in public ex-\npenditures. The British White Paper on Employment Policy, issued in\nMay, 1944, explains the effect of interest rate policy on investments\nin the *orthodox\" fashion. ^If the cost of borrowing money is high,\nsome projects which are not profitable at that rate will be held back.\nWhen it falls again, those projects will be brought forward and others\nwill also be taken in hand.\" Nevertheless, the paper does not lay primary\nemphasis on interest rate policy. While it keeps *the possibility of\ninfluencing capital expenditures by the variation of interest rates . . .\nin view,\" it relies much more on public expenditures as a means of\nregulating investment and employment.\n\n* The author is associate professor of economics at Princeton University, at present on\nleave of absence.

The result has been a vast increase\nin the amount of currency and bank deposits outstanding, and\nthe consequent creation of a grave menace of inflation.\n\n(2) The level of interest rates has been artificially depressed\nand maintained by Federal Reserve policy and is bound to\nrise substantially before long. Federal Reserve policy will\nhave to be reversed and interest rates raised sharply if we\nare to prevent the development of drastic inflation; and inter-\nest rates will soar anyhow if inflation comes. In short, sub-\nstantially higher interest rates are inevitable, whether these\nare brought about by inflation itself or by the government's\nattempts to avoid it.\n\n(3) An immediate tightening of the money market and increase\nin interest rates, accompanied by the funding of most of the\nfederal debt into long-term obligations, would constitute an\neffective attack against the inflationary danger. At higher\ninterest rates the public could be expected to save more and\nto use much of its idle currency and bank deposits to buy\nback governments from the banks.

These men are Werner\nSombart, Johann Plenge, and Paul Lensch. Of the three only Lensch was\nan official party member. Sombart, it is true, had been sympathetic to the\nlabor movement and had been fascinated by Marxian ideas, but he was a\nstrong individualist intellectually and there is no doubt that his ideas were\ndeveloped quite independently of his acquaintance with socialist doctrines.'*\nSombart himself, even before his break with the socialist movement, would\nhave been the first to say most decidedly that he remained a partisan only as\nlong as he found himself in agreement with Marxian ideas.\n\nPlenge was never a socialist and never understood either Marx or the later\nsocialist theories, This is rather neatly shown in a book review of Plenge's\nMarx und Hegel which Franz Mehring wrote in 1911.!5 The review is a biting\nsatire of Plenge's ignorance of Hegelian and, above all, of Marxian doctrines.\nEven if this testimony of an eminent socialist theorist were not available,\na glance at Plenge's writings would convince anyone of his utter incompetence\nto stand for anything but his own narrow views; he will also learn that Plenge\nwas not only not a socialist, but not even a worthy critic.\n\nThere remains Lensch. Lensch actually was a socialist, and in his younger\nyears had belonged to the radical wing of the party. He became a deputy to\nthe Reichstag and (together with Haase and Karl Liebknecht) opposed the\ngranting of war credits to the government when it was discussed in the\nAugust 3, 1914, session of the Social Democratic Reichstag fraction. It must\nhave been in the short period between August, 1914, and the spring of\n1915 that he changed his views completely. Part of this change might be\nexplained by Lensch's ambitious character, and by his quarrels with the other\nleaders of the left wing (especially with Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg).\nBe that as it may, one thing is certain: Lensch's conversion was not repre-\nsentative of socialist opinion in general, and his nationalistic outburst was\nflatly repudiated by the majority of the party. Lensch's pamphlet, Die\ndeutsche Sozialdemokratie und der Weltkrieg, was subjected to a ruinous\ncriticism by Karl Kautsky and Gustav Eckstein, who attach to Lensch's\npamphlet such epithets as \"ridiculous,\" *directly wrong,\" and \"erroneous.\"7\n\nIn general the attitude of German socialists during the First World War\nwas one of surprising detachment and objectivity.

However, he omits to add that the\nremark was made ironically. In the session of December 13, 1892, the chan-\ncellor in a speech had remarked that army officers were satisfied with the\ndiscipline shown by socialist recruits. Bebel, referring to the discipline in the\nsocialist party, then made the above remark, That it was meant ironically\nand was so understood is proved by the stenographic report which contains\nthe word \"laughter\" after the quoted sentence.'? It would be strange indeed\nif Bebel had meant these words seriously, since in his report to the Social\nDemocratic Party Conference of the same year Paul Singer, the chairman of\nthe conference, reaffirmed the attitude of the socialists to the military pro-\ngram of the government: *Not a man, not a penny for militarism, for the\nruling military system.\"!* This anti-nationalistic attitude of the socialists on\nnumerous other questions\u2014on agricultural policy, anti-monopoly policy, in-\nternational treaties, colonial policy, and others\u2014could be demonstrated by\na mass of similar evidence.\n"

The reason for this is to\nbe found not only in the more compact logical theory of Marxism, but also\nin the fact that the German socialist movement carried forward the rationalist\ndemocratic ideals adapted from the French Revolution. These ideas had\nslowly filtered into Germany until they had provided the impetus for the\nrevolution of 1848. This revolution for a liberal bourgeois democracy was\nhailed by the socialists as their work, and later they always identified their\npolitical aims and ideals with a considerable part of those held by the 1848\nrevolutionaries. Professor Hayek has thus to admit that after 1870 \"the\nnational socialist elements receded for a time into the background.\"? This\nis rather an understatement since the national elements were completely ab-\nsent among the socialists, even among those who, following Eduard Bern-\nstein, had given up the theory of the social revolution.

The socialists voted and agitated consistently against government\nmonopolies: for instance, in 1874-76 against the state ownership of the rail-\nroads and in 1882 against Bismarck's tobacco monopoly. In 1892 there took\nplace in socialist circles a debate on state socialism.

Economically Fichte was a mercantilist; po-\nlitically he became, under the impact of the Napoleonic wars and the elo-\nquent manifestation of the weakness of a divided Germany, more and more\nof a nationalist, without, however, losing himself in purely chauvinist argu-\nments, Later socialists became acquainted with some of Fichte's works chiefly\nthrough Lassalle who considered him an important political philosopher. It\nwould be wrong, however, to claim that he was regarded by anyone as a\nfather of socialism; certainly his influence was much less than even that of\nHegel. It is true that the socialists noted with satisfaction the occasional anti-\nfeudalistic, anti-clerical, or egalitarian ideas in Fichte, but they did the same\nwith the Greek philosophers, the medieval and humanist utopians, and the\nreligious reformers. It would be almost equally preposterous to regard Plato,\nThomas More, Jan Hus, Thomas Campanella, or Winstanley as fathers of\nGerman socialism.?\n\nThe case of Lassalle and Rodbertus is somewhat different from that of\nFichte. Their doctrines were adopted more fully by the socialists than those\nof Fichte, but only in a very limited sense can they be regarded as fathers\nof national socialism. (It would be especially strange if the national socialists\nso regarded Lassalle, who was of Jewish parentage.) The original national\nsocialist writers were not acquainted with either Lassalle or Rodbertus. Their\nnames do not even appear in the writings of Rudolf Jung, Count E. v. Revent-\nlow, and Gottfried Feder. It is likely that Lassalle and Rodbertus were not\nintroduced in the national socialist literature until 1934 by Sombart in his\nDeutscher Sozialismus. A\u00edter that, occasional references to Rodbertus and\nLassalle appear, but I have been unable to locate a single source which\ntreated their views with genuine understanding.*\n\nLassalle and Rodbertus developed similar political philosophies, both as-\nsigning to the state an economic r\u00f3le. Their views were based on the Hegelian\nRechtsphilosophie, but whereas Marx, who also derived his philosophical\ninspiration from Hegel, *turned the Hegelian philosophy upside down,\"\nLassalle and Rodbertus followed Hegel in maintaining that the state is a\nmoral category (sitiliche Idee) standing above the individual. But whereas\nfor Hegel this moral category was absolute (i.e., objectively fixed) and the\nindividual completely subordinated to the state and its purpose, Lassalle\nand Rodbertus assigned to the state a purpose derived from the individuals\ncomposing it. The purpose of the state according to them is to bring about\nthe greatest freedom of the individual, which it achieves by being a welfare\nstate, a \"sozialer Staat.\"5 This view is most clearly expressed by Lassalle in\n\n*In the latter part of the nineteenth century it became fashionable among German\nsocialists to look for egalitarian ideas among the old philosophers and reformers. The\ntwo outstanding examples of this literature are found in Karl Kautsky, Die Vorl\u00e0ufer\ndes neueren Sozialismus (Stuttgart, 1895), and Georg Adler, Geschichte des Sozialismus\nund Kommunismus von Plato zur Gegenwart (Leipzig, 1899).\n\n* The fullest discussion of Rodbertus and Lassalle in national socialist literature is to\nbe found in Friedrich Schinkel, Preussischer Sozialismus (Breslau, 1934), which shows\nlittle understanding of the economic or political theories of either of the two men.\n\n\"The chief exponent of Lassalle's \"state\" or \"national\" socialism was Berhard Harms\n"

                    "I\n\nIn Chapter XII of his recent book, T'e Road to Ser\u00eddom, Professor\nHayek undertakes to show that the political philosophy of German national\nsocialism has its roots in the teachings and doctrines of German socialists.\nProfessor Hayek claims that \"the support which brought these [national\nsocialist] ideas to power, came precisely from the socialist camp,\" that, at\nleast in Germany, *the connection between nationalism and socialism was\nclose from the beginning,\" and that *it was largely with the assistance of\nold socialists that the beginning which produced national socialism rose\nduring this period.\"? This paper will examine the correctness of these state-\nments in view of the political and economic ideology of German socialism.\n\nProfessor Hayek bases his argument on two types of evidence. First, he\nreminds us that pre-1914 German socialism counted among its forbears the\nsame men\u2014-Fichte, Rodbertus, and Lassalle\u2014who are at present recognized\nas the intellectual fathers of national socialism, Second, he quotes several\nauthors whose ideas he claims were formed by their study of Marxian writ-\nings and who expressed strongly nationalistic views. These two facts he con-\nsiders sufficient evidence to convict the German socialist movement of ad-\nherence to extreme nationalism, to a glorification of state power at the ex-\npense of the individual, and to an ideology diametrically opposed to that of\ntraditional liberalism.\n\nA proper analysis of the economic and political ideology of any group con-\nsists in tracing the historical influences operative on the representative ex-\nponents of the group and in fully discussing their views. With the exception\nof Bebel, none of the men referred to by Professor Hayek can be regarded\nas having held leading positions among socialist writers or politicians. The\nappeal to Fichte, Lassalle, and Rodbertus is also deceptive. The fact that\nthese men are regarded as intellectual forbears of socialism and of national\nsocialism does not mean much by itself unless a thorough analysis is made\nof why they have attained this position and which parts of their theories\nhave been taken over. How misleading the simple appeal to spiritual father-\nhood can be is shown by reference to contemporary America, where we find\nsuch diverse groups as the Republicans and the Communists appealing to\nLincoln as their political ancestor; where we find monopolists calling on\nJefferson to protect their \"freedom of enterprise\" from the trust-busters who\nclaim to act on principles of that same Thomas Jefferson.\n\nBefore we can clearly understand the influence of Fichte, Lassalle, and\nRodbertus on both the socialists and national socialists, we must investigate\nbriefly the part of their doctrines that has been adopted by each group.\nFichte started as an admirer of the French Revolution and in his younger\nyears published political tracts abusing the feudalistic and absolutist trends\n\n!

The major objec-\ntion to this view, as presented, is not that it won't work? but that it is in-\nadequate, myopic and unbalanced. These faults stem from its failure to\nanalyze and appraise its policy goal. Full employment is neither a simple\nnor an absolute concept. Most of us do not want jobs so much as we want\nthe kind of employment that is compatible with our tastes and our abilities;\nand, more important than either, we require some measure of security of\nincome and the maximum possible opportunity for the independent satisfac-\ntion of our preferences, the exercise of our respective skills and the develop-\nment of our faculties. Full employment, then, is not a simple economic objec-\ntive; it is a complex way of life within which conflicting ends must be com-\npromised to provide the greatest benefits at the lowest feasible cost.\n\nThe full employment goal, as the kind of society in which one wishes to live,\nwill vary from one country to another depending on its cultural and economic\nstandards of living, the heritage of its past and its hopes for the future, By\nneglecting this fundamental fact, the Conference implicitly applied a foreign\nand, in my judgment, a false set of values to its problem.

The wartime control agency can and does rely heavily on a general\nfreezing of prices at some arbitrary date. The maintenance of profit margins\non particular products as cost elements change is not vital when the product\nis no longer produced or the firm is already subject to excess profits taxes\nbecause of its earnings from war business. As long as money income and\naccumulated savings in liquid form available for consumption expenditures\ngrossly exceed production possibilities, some measure of price control may\nbe required if inflation is to be held in check. Even after the transition from\nwar to peace, it is conceivable that the attempt to maintain a satisfactory\nlevel of employment will so lower the threshold of inflation that selective\ngovernment control over prices will have to be retained.\n\nBut the object of the Conference is not primarily inflation control. It\nproposes rather to secure for the public the benefits of productive efficiency\nthrough the mechanism of price control and cost appraisal. The object \"should\nbe to achieve, not so much low prices in themselves, as a reasonable relation\nbetween prices and the costs of efficient production, and between the prices\ncharged for different kinds of goods\" (p. 60). Our own experience in public\nutility regulation provides little basis for optimism in such a project. If prices\nare to be fixed by costs, the incentive to increase business income in the guise\nof costs has usually required a proliferation of controls which in the end may\neffectively substitute the judgment of the pricing authority for that of man-\nagement. Combined with profit limitation, price control may lower the quality\nof management and discourage the search for new production opportunities\nand technological improvements.'? If the size of the cake is reduced, the satis-\nfaction of receiving a larger proportionate share may be a poor consolation for\nthose who like cake.\n\nQuite apart from the gigantic task of compiling and analyzing operating\ncosts (and without regard to imponderables in interpretation), the extension\nof price control throughout the economy is of dubious benefit to the con-\nsumers for whose protection it is derived.

To attain and maintain aggregate markets which will provide high\nlevel employment under a free enterprise system is a difficult and, as yet, an\nuntried task. It requires that government establish and maintain a tax system\nwhich will not stultify the willingness to assume risks; that it co\u00f3rdinate the\ncontrol of bank credit with monetary-fiscal measures designed not only to\ndamp inflationary pressures but also to stimulate consumption'? and private\ninvestment?! when markets weaken; that it be prepared to supplement general\ncounter-deflationary measures with a program of public works, if necessary;\nand that it destroy or subjugate monopoly elements (whether business or\ntrade union) which threaten the goal by restrictive tactics. Such a program\nshould, of course, be complemented as in the British proposal by an extended\nand strengthened social security system.\n\nThere can be no guarantee that a program developed within the framework\nof a free enterprise economy will provide the levels of employment and the\nstandards of living considered essential in the post-war world.

The Control of Prices\n\nWhere imperfect competition or monopolistic factors exist, the Conference\nbelieves that neither competition nor market forces can be expected to bring\nabout desirable adjustments, Both business and the trade unions must, there-\nfore, be governed by public codes of conduct and their actions submitted *'to\nthe scrutiny of impartial authorities representing the public interest\" (p. 14).\nThis control is suggested for wages and prices as well as decisions with respect\nto conditions of employment, the demarcation of trades or the volume of pro-\nduction. But only price control is discussed extensively.\n\nMaximum price control is apparently expected to be practically universal.\nBased on mandatory uniform cost accounting, maximum prices would be set\non standardized goods to allow to producer and distributor no more than a\nreasonable profit under efficient operation. (High-cost producers, it is sug-\ngested, should be forced out of the market by price control.) The area of\nstandard goods, and therefore of standard price regulations, should be ex-\n\ntaxation.

(The\nauthors incidentally neglect the need of a measure of benefits with which to\ninterpret the significance of their measure of costs.) Technological and market\nchanges may require added investment to secure the existing investment\nagainst loss or to activate it into full use. The benefits from added investment\nmay be so intangible as to preclude direct evaluation. To derive compara-\nbility of relative costs and benefits over a broad segment of the economy,\nespecially where joint and common costs are prominent and multiple benefits\nare involved, is practically an insuperable task.* Final decisions would be made\nbut it is doubtful that comparative utilities or comparative costs would have\nmuch to do with them.\n\nThese comments do not challenge the ability of the state effectively to\nguarantee *full employment\" if it is prepared to invest directly in sufficient\nquantities? and over a wide enough area. They do emphasize, however, that\nthe price of the guarantee, on the terms here under discussion, is a substitu-\ntion of the wisdom\" of the state for the freedom of choice of the individual,\nthe probable sacrifice of important new products and processes to a high level\nof mediocrity, and the imposition of a burdensome system of central account-\ning and cost analysis of dubious value.?\n\nIf the community is willing to tolerate some measure of instability of\n\n\"The real problems of cost comparability, familiar in a more simple form in \"yard-\nStick\" government competition in this country, would not be removed even though they\nmight disappear from public view under central control of all investment,\n\n*]t is striking that the Conference did not consider how Great Britain might finance\nan undertaking of this magnitude. It is apparently assumed that, despite the burdens\nof statistical reporting, of government controls of location, direction and quantity of\ninvestment as well as of prices and wages, not to mention the extension or threat\nof extension of government ownership, private investment will be forthcoming in such\nvolume that no serious financial problem will arise.

It\nmight be assumed that I am here concerned with a \"straw man.\" And yet, the differences\nin the two views may easily be exaggerated. For Beveridge would not maintain adequate\noutlays by tax reductions which would increase disposable incomes in the hands of\nconsumers to be expended by them in conformity with their own judgments of relative\nurgency.

It would place in the\ngovernment bureaucracy the power of predetermining what new ideas would\nand what would not be permitted to be developed. On the eve of potentially\nrevolutionary developments in plastics, synthetics, the light metal alloys,\ntransport, and electronics, to mention but a few, such concentration of\neconomic power could be stifling. New ideas seldom spring fully developed\nfrom the minds of their originators, and public servants are notoriously con-\nservative.\n\nIt might be objected that the development of an over-all system of priorities\nsupported by relative cost analysis would avoid most of the dangers I fear.\nBut the concept of an over-all system of priorities in peacetime to control all\nreal investment is either naive or authoritarian. Neither *over-all priority\"\nnor its alter ego \"social utility\" can be given concrete, objective content as a\nguide to public action.* In time of war, a system of priorities is a necessary\nevil. It is also a fairly rational method of control because the bulk of the\npreferences granted are determined by the overriding needs of war (direct and\nindirect). In the residual civilian area, discretion is reduced to a comparison\nof minimum essentials. Even in wartime, however, the operation of such a\nSystem is halting, cumbersome and charged with inescapable discriminations.\nBut as soon as materials, facilities and manpower available exceed minimum\nessential civilian needs, the basis for rational judgment at the margin dis-\nappears. Decision necessarily becomes arbitrary, explicitly or implicitly reflect-\n\n*'This conclusion is not implicit in proposals to assure an aggregate volume of invest-\nment consistent with full employment. As in the Murray bill now before the U. S. Senate,\nthe state might estimate anticipated private investment and budget government ex-\npenditures so as to provide the combined level of investment considered necessary for\nfull employment. This proposal raises problems of its own, but they are not our im-\nmediate concern.\n\n*' This concept of \"social priority\" or \"social utility\" is also prominent in Beveridge,\nagain with no explanation of the criteria that could be employed to give it concrete\nmeaning as a principle of selection. Smithies takes no exception to the use of the term.\nIndeed, he goes Beveridge one better by proposing that the arbitrary element in Bev-\neridge's *double-budget principle\" might be avoided by choosing between increasing public\nexpenditures or reducing taxes on the basis of comparative social utilities. At the desired\nlevel of total outlays, \"the 'marginal social utility! of taxation should be equal to the\n*marginal social disutility' of taxation\" (of. cit., p. 359).\n\nThe concept of relative social utility is not without meaning as a philosophy of\ngovernment action. Within limits, it even provides practical guidance. Alternative\nproposals for public expenditure can be appraised roughly in terms of their relative\nsocial value. In terms of the incidence of the tax structure, a presumption may even\nbe established that projects so chosen are worth more than the incremental loss to\nthe taxpayers as long as aggregate government expenditures are small. But this conviction\nis dissipated as the volume of public expenditures increases relative to,national income\nand it vanishes entirely when the principle is raised to the status of a rational marginal\ncalculus. It is just such a calculus which is here under consideration. As a precept of\nadministrative action, social priority or social utility merely obfuscates understanding\nof the issues raised by centralization of economic decisions.\n"

No classification of\nindustries is attempted, although transport of all varieties, public utilities and\nbasic extractive industries like coal are mentioned as likely prospects. The\nthreshold for public ownership, however, is low; the test is whether any alterna-\ntive control will *secure fully efficient operation in the public interest, or\nmake thoroughly effective the power of the State to regulate the volume of\ninvestment\" (p. 47).\n\nState control over its own investment activities, even though extended over\nthe more important capital-using industries, might not be enough to assure\ncorrection of the cyclical and structural defects in the economic system.

While *nothing must be done to force firms to set up factories\nin areas which are economically unsuitable, or would involve high costs of\nproduction; and no rigid or inviolable limit should be set to the natural de-\nvelopment in the more prosperous areas of the industries for which they are\nbest suited . . .

                    "There is a growing trend of thought, especially prominent in Great Britain,\nthat economic salvation after the war must be sought in state control. The\nmain current of this opinion flows from many springs: the failure of free\nenterprise to maintain a reasonable level of employment between the two wars;\nthe debacle of the thirties; the rending of the illusion that competition and\nself-interest will secure a desirable adjustment of supply to demand and an\neffective tendency toward full employment; the recognition of pervasive\nmarket imperfections and wastes (call them wastes of competition or mo-\nnopoly as you will); and a complete system of war-born direct controls\nwhich public inertia, fear of the future, the vested interests of those in control\nand conviction as to the benefits of a planned economy now conspire to project\ninto the post-war. These, and similar influences, have produced in Great\nBritain Employment Policy and Organization of Industry after the War (the\nprimary subject of this paper), the Government White Paper on Employment\nPolicy, the Economics of Full Employment prepared by members of the\nInstitute of Statistics at Oxford, and the more imposing Report on Full Em-\nployment in a Free Society by W.

Although these economists apparently agree that the\narticle is not a revision, but a reaffirmation, of Marxism, they, nevertheless,\nreach different, even directly contradictory, conclusions on the principal point\nof theory in the Soviet statement, namely, that the law of value operates\nunder \"socialism.\" Professor Lange affirms positively that Marx \"held the\nview that the theory of value applies to a socialist economy\" (p. 128).5 Mr.\nBaran states categorically that the law of value is a \"principle ruling the\nworking of a capitalistic society\" and that the only consequence of trying\nto apply that notion to socialism *is to deprive the law of value of all its\nmeaning and significance\" (p. 869). Professor Rogin avoids any discussion\nof the concept of value.

My\ngeneral suggestion is that the operational approach, which has proved so\nuseful in other fields, may be useful in this connection in economics. Dr. von\nMering tolerates the operational method in natural science, but he apparently\nrejects its use in economics, and objects violently to my particular application\nof it in the latter field. The operational approach means that concepts are to\nbe stated in terms of \"operations,\" which in economics means in terms of\nalterable behavior, or plans of action. My particular suggestion is to use\nthe operational method of inquiry to suggest hypotheses for relating distinc-\ntive theoretical concepts in a body of theory like that of Keynes's to concrete\nproposals by the same theorist in the field of policy. I have contended and am\nwilling to defend in detail the proposition that the meaning of Keynes's theory\nas a whole and of his special concepts like liquidity-preference, marginal pro-\npensity to consume, and marginal efficiency of capital is to be found in rela-\ntion to Keynes's program of reform. This is the essence of my suggestion that\npolicy may be viewed as the operational meaning of theory. Dr. von Mering\nmay legitimately question the usefulness of this approach, but it obviously\nhas nothing to do with any desire to rule society, to vindicate particular\npolicies, or to play tricks on unsuspecting people. It is, like Peirce's pragmatic\nmaxim, a suggestion for the clarification of ideas, which in turn is prerequisite\nto scientific evaluation of economic theory and policy.\n\nI have criticized Dr. von Mering for failing to make a clear-cut distinction\nbetween meaning of theory and workability of program. Not until the meaning\nof a theory has been established in terms of alterable behavior (plan of action)\nare we in a position to raise the further question of the validity of the system\nof thought. Since any body of doctrine contains within it special practical and\nethical presuppositions, its concepts and propositions cannot legitimately be\ncriticized in terms of the concept and propositions of another system of theory,\nwhich has different practical and ethical presuppositions. Having previously\ndiscovered the meaning of the concepts, we are in a position to raise the\nfurther question of the workability of the course of action with which that\ntheory is associated, i.e., for which it is an argument. Whether or not the pro-\ngram can realize the practical and ethical aims in terms of which it is projected\nis to a large extent a matter of historical circumstances, such as the prevailing\nstate of the industrial arts.\n\nOne of the great faults of economics is that what passes for scientific criti-\ncism is hardly more than polemical dogmatism in which one set of practical\nand ethical values is used as the basis for criticizing another set of practical\nand ethical values. Instead of lowering the quality of discussion among\neconomists, as Dr. von Mering alleges, the adoption of the above suggestions\nwould, I believe, provide the best possible means for elevating the quality of\ndiscussion and criticism in the field of theoretical economics.\n\nDuprrv DirLLARD*\n"

According to Dr. von Mering an accept-\nance of my position would degrade economic theory to a level of propaganda\nwhereby it would be employed as a mere tool for playing tricks and as an\ninstrument \"to rule society.\" These are serious charges and cannot be left un-\nanswered.\n\nFirst, it should be pointed out that Dr. von Mering's criticisms are typical\nof charges which non-pragmatists make of the pragmatic position in philosophy\nand in other fields where this method of inquiry has been employed. Prag-\nmatism has been accused of degrading philosophy to a *mere means to better\ndinners,\" as Bertrand Russell says in the quotation given by von Mering,\nand as Russell and others have asserted on numerous occasions.? Such charges\nagainst the scientific pragmatism of John Dewey have even less credence than\nthe frequent assertion that Pareto, whom von Mering champions, was the\nintellectual father of Italian fascism. The prediction that \"disastrous conse-\nquences\" and \"catastrophic results\" would follow from the adoption of my\nposition is on the same level as an assertion that fascism would result from\nan acceptance of von Mering's application of Pareto's interpretation to eco-\nnomic theory. But this is polemics and not scientific discussion.\n\nA second difference between us has to do with social bias as it affects\neconomists and other social scientists. We both recognize that bias presents\na problem in the formulation and evaluation of economic theory. This arises\nbecause, as Dr. von Mering says, \"experience inevitably gives us only a very\nincomplete picture of the actual economic world.\" Having recognized the\nproblem of bias, the question becomes what to do about it, Dr. von Mering's\nposition, though unclear, seems to be that by recognizing bias we may eliminate\nit as a problem.* My position is that it is not sufficient merely to recognize\nthe presence of bias; a way must be found for evaluating a system of theory\nwhich is acknowledged to contain such bias. A characteristic of the great\neconomists, including Keynes, has been that they have made use of their biases,\nin working out their economic theories, although they may have been for the\nmost part unconscious of these biases.\n\nThe first task in evaluating a body of economic doctrine is to discover the\n",

This compares with ap-\nproximately 40 billions of private savings, and 35-40 billions of sales\nout of gross savings.

We may conclude that, in general, the profits\nof banks have been kept down relative to profits of all corporations. The\nexplanation, in no small part, is the marked expansion of the product sold,\nie., money; and hence the decline in the price per unit, ie., the rate of\ninterest obtained on loans and especially on government issues. In determining\nwhat issues might be purchased by the banks and in what amounts, the\nTreasury, moreover, imposed an effective type of price control and a limited\nprofit control upon the banks.\n\nA more detailed glance reveals that from 1939 to 1943 the rise of profits\nof member banks (other than on capital account) is explained almost ex-\nclusively by the increased earnings on securities. From 1942 to 1944, earnings\nof member banks rose by 385 million dollars and earnings on securities even\nmore\u2014by 420 millions. In the same period, taxes on net income of member\nbanks rose by 116 millions. These taxes equaled 22 per cent of net profits\nbefore taxes.

As to the former, the dividends are restricted; and mutual\nsavings banks purchase securities as middlemen for small savers.\n\nIt has been pointed out above that the banks have not gained as much as\nother groups. There are, of course, many reasons why their gains should be\nkept down and possibly even more than they have.

Part of the\ndecrease in the cost, however, stems from the fact that today, more than\nin the last war or in 1940, greater reliance is placed upon short-term and\nspecial issues. Consequently, if the current pattern of rates has to be changed\ndrastically in the early post-war years, the saving on interest charges may be\ntransitory and illusionary. On the other hand, the 35 billions of non-\nmarketable Treasury bonds are so priced with respect to redemption as to\ndiscourage excessive sales by investors prior to final maturity date.\n\nThat most of the reduction in the average interest rate is due to an\nincreased weighting in the direction of the lower-yielding short-terms is\nshown by the following comparisons: although the over-all average interest\nrate decreased from 2.260 per cent to 1.925 per cent from 1942 to 1944,\nthe yields of taxable federal bonds (7-9 years) increased from 1.93 per cent\nto 1.94 per cent, and the yields of longer maturities (15 years or more)\nincreased from 2.46 per cent to 2.48 per cent.\n\nThis is not the place to do more than mention just how the reductions\nin the computed rate of interest have been achieved: by the Federal Reserve's\nmaking large amounts of cash available to banks through open market\noperations, by the using up of excess reserves, and by the unwillingness of\nbanks to risk a rise in long-term rates\u2014all of which encourage the purchase\nof large amounts of low-yielding short-term securities.

This is certainly not the place to discuss bank earnings,\nalthough it can be shown that comparatively they are not excessive. The\npoint to be emphasized is that it seems quite obvious that the structure of\ninterest rates should be fixed, if it is to be subjected to regulation, after\nconsidering factors other than bank earnings. If the economy demands a\nlower structure of interest rates, a more conclusive argument surely could\nhave been advanced by Mr. Samuelson and his barber.\n\nMr. Samuelson also asserts that this could have been a one per cent war\nrather than a 2 per cent one. He dismisses the statement that interest rates\nmight have an effect upon private consumption and investment, although he\nconcedes that \"they may have had some minor effect upon the form in\nwhich wealth is held.\"* He does not choose to explore this possibility further,\nalthough it is deserving of additional analysis. It must not be forgotten\nthat the banks are not for the most part permitted to subscribe to securities\nin war loans and are not even permitted to purchase certain types of securities\navailable to other investors in the open market. They have been restricted\nto short-term, low interest bearing securities. One of the reasons that banks\nhave been able to purchase these securities is that corporate and other\ninvestors have preferred to hold deposits. If corporations and others pur-\nchased securities, then the banking system would have had less funds to\ninvest. This fact is very seldom realized by those who discuss the question.\nLike Mr. Samuelson, I do not wish to go into this subject because it is\nextremely complicated but it may be suggested that the interest rates offered\nto corporate and other investors are insufficient to induce them to part with\nliquid funds. To induce these investors to invest liquid funds, i.e., to change\nthe form in which wealth is held, might have required higher rates of interest\nthan those paid on securities held by banks. In discussing the interest rate\nat which this war is being financed it is well to consider this fact. This\nagain emphasizes the fact that the fixing of a given structure of interest\nrates can only be undertaken after considering a great many factors.\n\nThere are a great many aspects to this problem which Mr. Samuelson has\nnot discussed and I have not raised them here. My only objective has been\nto point out that, if a lower structure of interest rates is desirable, a much\nstronger argument than the fact that the banking system would not be hurt\nby a rise in the structure of interest rates should be cited. The determination\nof a structure of interest rates in wartime should only be undertaken after\nconsidering needs of the economy, the investment responses of savers to\nvarious interest rates, the relative costs incurred by the government, and\nthe inflationary or deflationary results of various methods of financing.\nFinally, it has been pointed out that the banking system is following con-\nsciously a portfolio policy which will result in as little loss as possible in\nthe event that the structure of interest rates might rise.\n\nGxzongcE W.

                    "672 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW [SEPTEMBER\n\nback within three years. This conclusion follows from the unrealistic interest\nrate structure assumed by Samuelson and after making a slight error in\ncomputing the ratios of new to old capital values. (While the academician\nwill find such an error trifling, to the average banker it might mean the\ndifference between a profit and loss on the bond transaction.) What is some-\nwhat surprising is that Mr. Samuelson should have taken so much pains to\nmake a calculation of this type when even the lowliest bank clerk could have\ntold him, even if his barber could not, that banks are endeavoring to main-\ntain a short position in order to minimize the loss which a rise in interest\nrates with a longer position would produce.\n\nMr. Samuelson used in his calculations the United States Treasury report\non the ownership-distribution of U. S. government securities as of February\n29, 1944. Thus it will be noted that his figures are on a \"due or first\nbecoming callable\" basis. With a rise in interest rates it is extremely unlikely\nthat any securities will be called in order to refund them into securities bearing\na higher coupon. Consequently, such calculations should be made on a\n\"maturity\" basis. However, using his figures, it might be well to note that a\n3.29 per cent decline in the value of U. S. government securities would have\nimpaired at that date about 25 per cent of the total capital invested in banks.\n\nIt should be pointed out that the banking system would recover these\nlosses over a period of time, the length depending upon the maturity\ndistribution. During that period, it would be \"frozen in\" to a given maturity\npattern. Mr. Samuelson seems to feel, however, that earnings of the banking\nsystem upon the existing portfolio would increase. He states that \"immediately\nafter interest rates have risen and capital values have scaled down, all parts\nof the portfolio, old as well as new, began to earn the higher rates.\"* He\nargues that this is true because the earnings will be made up not only of\nthe coupon return but of the amortization of the discount, and this will mean\nnew higher earnings. From the point of view of the banking system, however,\nthese \"new higher earnings\" will be purely nominal. In *writing down\"\ncapital values, losses will be established and the amortization of discount\nwill merely recover these losses.\n\nIn another place, he suggests that the bonds can be carried at cost. (He\nprobably means amortized cost.) If this is done, then it should be obvious\nthat the return will remain the same. The \"new higher earnings\" will not\nmaterialize until re-investment takes place. But it should be emphasized\nthat the re-investment will not be possible until the securities mature. A rise\nin interest rates is not, therefore, going to be the immediate bonanza for\nbanks which Mr. Samuelson seems to envisage.\n\nMr. Samuelson states further that if his argument is \"rightly interpreted,\nit will be seen that mine is an argument against interest rate increases, not\nin favor of them.\"5 'The logic of arguing for a lower rate of interest on the\nground that an increase would not hurt the banking system is diff\u00fccult to\nunderstand, but apparently it follows from his argument, already commented\n\n*!Am, Econ.

(I assume that more than two-thirds of the wartime rise in debt would\nbe subject to the additional charge.) 7f the cost of the war could have been\ncut by 30 billion dollars through a relative decline in commodity prices of\n10 per cent or somewhat more (resulting from the reduced sales of bonds to\nbanks and hence the smaller expansion of deposits) and if the high rates of\ninterest would have to be paid only for relatively brief periods, this policy\nof high rates would have been sensible. But neither of these results would\nprobably have been had.\n\n"

From\n1892 to 1932 he taught economics at the University of Wisconsin, where in\n1900 he founded the School of Commerce, of which he remained director\nuntil 1929. A graduate of the University of Rochester in 1886, he taught\nthree years at the newly founded University of South Dakota, and studied\nwith Richard T.

Early in his studies he was strongly\ninfluenced by the logic of Marx's value theory, which entranced him until\nhe was rescued from it by B\u00f3hm-Bawerk and the other Austrians, to whose\ndoctrines he continued to show great partiality throughout his life. In 1903 he\ntranslated B\u00f3hm-Bawerk's Recent Literature on Interest, and in 1915 pub-\nlished a chapter on the Austrians in Ingram's History of Political Economy.\nHis work in this field culminated with the publication in 1933 of Te Develop-\nment of Economics. Although conversant with historical backgrounds and the\ninstitutional basis of thought, Professor Scott deliberately chose to present\nthe history of economic ideas as a systematic chronological exposition of\ndoctrines as they appeared in the minds of their creators rather than to fit\nthem into a scheme of reference of his own or to compare their adequacy\nwith currently accepted theories. He preferred to let the successive writers\nof theory criticize one another; in his eyes the history of theory was its own\njudgment.\n\nHis monetary theory was akin to Menger's and closely resembled the views\nwhich were given wide currency in this country by Professor James Lawrence\nLaughlin.

These have\nbeen clearly stated in official declarations and one of them is to make\nthe currency of different countries again freely interchangeable.\n\nApplied to our particular problem, this implies that we want an\nexchange rate which equates demand and supply in a free market, that\nis, a market in which everybody is allowed to buy and to sell curren-\ncies of all countries. This is, of course, the ultimate ideal, which cannot\nbe realized at once. All experts agree that in most countries more or\nless stringent controls of the foreign exchange market will have to be\nmaintained for some time after the war. The scope, stringency and\nduration of these controls will be discussed later and will partly depend\non the rates which are chosen. But certain features of a free market\ncan and should be introduced right from the beginning: The ex-\nchange rate of a currency should be uniform, non-discriminatory. That\nis to say, the same rate should be applicable to all types of transactions\nand to all individuals, to commodity trade as well as to services, capi-\ntal and interest payments. Applied to more than two countries, this\nimplies that the rates should be consistent, that is to say, cross rates\nshould be equal to direct rates. Another postulate is that rates should\nbe as stable as possible.\n\nAnother partially conflicting objective of foreign exchange policy\nwould be to influence the terms of trade. The realization of this objec-\ntive would usually imply an overvaluation of the currency, because\nthere is a strong presumption that the setting of a high level of a coun-\ntry's currency (or an appreciation) tends to improve the terms of trade\nand a low level (or depreciation) tends to deteriorate them.\n\nSo long as exchange control is maintained this objective can be\nattained to some extent, although the abstention from discriminating\npolicies, which is implied by the postulate of uniformity and consistency\nof exchange rates, imposes severe restrictions on any attempt at doctor-\ning the terms of trade. If exchange controls are altogether removed it\nwill be found that for most countries there is very little or no leeway\n\n* The author is professor of economics at Harvard University.\n"

Introduction\n\nIn his Report on Full Employment in a Free Society, Sir William\nBeveridge has been untrammeled by official reticence in stating what\nhe considers to be the implications of a full employment policy. He con-\ntends that, to deserve the name, a full employment policy must mean\nthat the central government accepts responsibility for the level of\nemployment: *Full employment cannot be won and held without a\ngreat extension of the responsibilities and powers of the State exer-\ncised through organs of the central Government. No power less than\nthat of the State can ensure adequate total outlay at all times, or can\ncontrol, in the general interest, the location of industry and the use of\nland. To ask for full employment while objecting to these extensions\nof State activity is to will the end and refuse the means. It is like shout-\ning for victory in total war while rejecting compulsory service and\nrationing\" (p. 36). He reinforces his argument by demonstrating that\nfull employment has not been maintained for extended periods in the\npast, and arguing there is no theoretical reason to believe that it will\nbe maintained in the future if the State does not accept this responsi-\nbility.?\n\nSir William goes further in his definition of the fullness of full\nemployment than is usual amongst economists. In rejecting definitions\nwhich permit the number of unfilled vacancies to be less than the num-\nber of unemployed, he states: *Full employment in this Report means\nmore than that in two ways. It means having always more vacant jobs\nthan unemployed men, not slightly fewer jobs. It means that the jobs\nare at fair wages, of such a kind, and so located that the unemployed\nmen can reasonably be expected to take them; it means by consequence,\nthat the normal lag between losing one job and finding another will be\n\n* The author, on leave from the University of Michigan, where he is associate professor\nof economics, is at present chief fiscal analyst in the Bureau of the Budget, Washington,\nD.C.

Recently,\nattention has been drawn to an alternative approach to deficit finance under\nwhich the deficit is brought about by a reduction of tax yields below the level\nof expenditures. Both techniques may be considered at the same time and be\ncombined with other approaches not directly concerned wth the size of the\ndeficit. The level of private consumption and investment expenditures may\nalso be affected by adjusting the kind of taxes and public expenditures in-\ncluded in the budget totals, and under certain conditions public expenditures\nmay provide for a net addition to national income, even though there is no\ndeficit and the level of private expenditures does not increase.\n\nAdjusting the level of expenditures relative to tax yields is thus only one\namong several approaches. If fiscal policy is to provide for a given dollar\naddition to the national income, this may be accomplished through a number\nof alternative budgets, providing for varying tax, expenditure and deficit\ntotals and for varying revenue and expenditure structures!\n\nI\n\nThe interrelationships between the major variables of budget policy may\nbe presented in a simplified form, somewhat similar in nature to the statement\nof monetary variables in the equation of exchange.

The degree to\n\nZ' This principle, of course, does not indicate whether the budget should be large or\n\nsmall. It merely requires that long-run expenditure planning should be considered pri-\nmarily a matter of resource allocation rather than of employment creation.\n\n!

If the initial deficiency\nin over-all expenditures is large, we have seen that the balanced budget ap-\nproach will require exorbitantly high levels of expenditures and taxation, both\nof which will tend to depress private investment. If, as a result, private\ninvestment expenditures are depressed, budget figures even higher than those\nshown in Table II are needed. If the unfavorable reaction of private investors\nis violent, tax-financed additions to expenditures when carried beyond some\npoint may well lower rather than increase the over-all level of income.\n\nAll this points to the conclusion that a substantial deficit will be needed\nunless we succeed by non-fiscal means to narrow down the initial deficiency in\nthe over-all expenditure level to much below the illustrative figure of 30 billion\ndollars used in the preceding discussion. If a large deficiency remains to be\nfilled through fiscal measures, after other policy approaches have been ex-\nhausted, it will be neither desirable nor feasible to make expenditures suffi-\nciently large to balance the budget at full employment. Instead, a thoroughly\nworth-while expenditure budget should be provided including expended social\nsecurity and adequate developmental programs stimulating to private invest-\nment, but excluding made-work projects.?? On the basis of such an expenditure\nprogram the level of taxation should then be set sufficiently low to leave such\ndeficit as the economic situation may require in the average year. After the\nbudget is thus adjusted to the longer-term needs of the economic situation,\nshort-term variations in underlying conditions and localized relief needs re-\nmain to be met by a flexible expenditure program and an elastic tax system,\nincluding flexible income tax rates.

Also, private investment may be stimulated directly through de-\nvelopmental programs such as power development, urban redevelopment and\nso forth.

In other words, with respect to the term\n\u00ab (E, 4- E,) it is assumed that no additional taxes are paid by the recipients\nof the additional government payments. The fact that additional taxes are\npaid by this group and that the net increase in their expenditures falls short\nof \u00ab (E, -- E;) is allowed for in deducting QT, where T covers all additional\ntax yield.\n\nChanges in tax yield are here considered the primary planning factor, the\nnecessary changes in tax rates being determined by the changes in yield and\nincome. The opposite approach could be taken but would be less useful? As\na matter of fiscal planning, yield adjustments are the primary objective and\nchanges in tax rates the means to accomplish them. In planning rate adjust-\nments to bring about the desired change in yield, secondary changes in yield\ndue to changes in the level of income and hence in the tax base must not be\nneglected. As a matter of legislation, action is taken in terms of rate adjust-\nment but the final purpose is adjustment of tax yields.\n\nThe change in yield, or T, may be positive or negative, depending on whether\nthe yield provided for in the adjusted budget falls above or below the initial-\nly assumed level. T' is equal to zero if the yield level is unchanged. It should\nbe noted that 2-T refers to increments or decrements in tax yield only, so that\nBT does not allow for changes in private expenditures brought about by chang-\ning the sources from which the initially assumed amount of tax yield is\ndrawn, as, for instance, by changing from excise to income taxes.'?\n\nThe multiplier k is here applied to initial changes in private expenditures\non consumption or investment. It is based on the marginal propensity to con-\nsume of the community at large, not on a or f which reflect the consumption\nhabits of certain groups only. Usually, & is based on the community's mar-\nginal propensity to consume out of income before tax and thus allows for\nleakages from additional tax payments, in this paper it is based on consump-\ntion out of income after tax. Since the multiplier is based on the community's\nmarginal propensity to consume out of income after tax, & will remain con-\nstant when tax rates fall and fall when tax rates rise. This avoids considerable\ndifficulties which can only be mentioned here. If, for instance, expenditures\nare increased to sustain a higher level of income and the tax rate is held\nconstant, the initial increase in expenditures must be sufficiently high to allow\n\n? An alternative approach would be to define a as the propensity to consume out of\nincome before tax and T as such addition to tax yield as results from an autonomous\nincrease in tax rates only, excluding such additional yield as results from an increase in\n\nthe tax base. The net result, in terms of the addition to total income, would be the same\nfor both approaches.\n\n?' The lower the initially assumed yield level, the less serious is this defect. At the cost\nof some complication it may be remedied by adding another term to expression (1).\n\nThe difficulty might be avoided by redefining G to be the deficiency in income on the as-\nsumption of a zero (rather than a balanced minimum) budget. This would have the\nadvantage of making T' identical with the over-all yield level, so that changes in the f\nfor the total tax yield would be accounted for. But this would be more than offset by the\ndisadvantages of this approach, in particular (a) it would pose the altogether unrealistic\nproblem of having to estimate G for the assumption of zero public expenditures and (b)\nit would exclude the analysis of budget adjustments involving a reduction in tax yield.\n"

If\nthe expenditures qualify for inclusion in E, it is likely that \u00ab will fall some-\nwhere in between these extremes. Similarly, if the change in tax yield is in\nsales tax yield, 8 may be close to one; if the estate tax yield is involved, 8\nmay be close to zero.

For half a century thereafter, the intelligent reading public looked\nforward to the position taken by Cassel on the important economic and social\nissues of the day. His career as a teacher extended from his appointment as\nprofessor in economic and financial science at the University of Stockholm\nto emeritus status in 1933. His career as a consultant began in 1904 with an\nappointment (held until 1917) as adviser to the Department of Finance.\nThereafter he was a member of the bank commission in 1917, a member of\nthe economic council, 1920-21, and an adviser to the railroad council, 1924-26.\n\nDuring the First World War, Cassel was asked by the government of Ger-\nmany to help solve some of the country's pressing economic problems; in 1922\nhe advised in the establishment of the Russian State Bank; and in 1928, he\ntestified before our House of Representatives Currency and Banking Com-\nmittee as to means for stabilizing the purchasing power of the dollar. He\nwas the Swedish delegate to International Chamber of Commerce meetings\nduring the twenties at London, Rome, Brussels, Stockholm, and Amsterdam;\nand he participated in the World Economic Conferences of Genoa (1922)\nand London (1933).\n\nCassel enjoyed as wide recognition and honor as ever has been accorded\nan economist during his lifetime. His books were translated into many for-\neign languages. He held honorary degrees from a number of universities,\nand occupied honorary lectureships at Oxford, London, Geneva, Columbia,\nand Chicago. He was an honorary member of the American Economic Asso-\nciation and a member (1914), gold medallist (1922), and president (1926)\nof the Royal Swedish Academy. Commenting upon his death, a Stockholm\nnewspaper wrote that he was a whole academy in himself.\n\nCassel was essentially a liberal in economic philosophy in his belief in the\nefficiency and benefit of a competitive price economy. This liberalism is appar-\nent in the books already cited and, more particularly, in Recent Monopolistic\nTendencies in Industry and Trade (1927) and Socialism and Progress (1928).\nCassel frequently warned against the outcome of authoritarian tendencies in\neconomic policy: \"The arbitrariness, the mistakes, and the inevitable contra-\ndictions of such a policy will, as daily experience shows, only strengthen the\ndemand for a more rational coordination of the different measures and, there-\nfore, for unified leadership. For this reason Planned Economy will always tend\nto develop into Dictatorship.\" Tributes written by Cassel's outstanding stu-\ndents, Professor Bertil Ohlin| now Swedish Minister of Commerce, and\nSenator Gunnar Myrdal, pointed to Cassel's faith in rationalism, in progress,\n\nand in the final victory of common sense.\nTTA oC LE.

                    "OBITUARIES 509\n\nMonetary System. (1931), and The Downfall of the Gold Standard (1936).\nMonetary analysis and policy in the inter-war years were strongly influenced\nby these writings and by Cassel's participation in the numerous international\nconferences of that period.\n\n'The idea of \"purchasing power parity\" as the equilibrium value of foreign\nexchanges was not Cassel's discovery, but its popularization was undoubtedly\nhis accomplishment, Originally the concept was introduced by Cassel in the\nso-called absolute form: the international exchange ratio of two currencies\nwill tend to settle at the ratio of the absolute height of their price levels.\nBecause the costs of transportation of goods or obstacles to trade, such as\ntariffs and quotas, might operate unequally as between two countries, the\nabsolute form was rather quickly supplanted by the relative form: the equili-\nbrium rate of exchange would move, relatively to its position in a base year\nwhen equilibrium in the balances of payments could be assumed, in the same\nratio as the relation of changes in the price levels. Purchasing power parity,\neven in this formulation, has to be corrected for changes in relative trade\nobstacles, in international demand, in relative costs, and for protracted capital\nmovements.\n\nDespite these limitations, and especially if Cassel's wholesale price index\nis supplanted by one more appropriate to international equilibrium, the device\nmay be useful in forecasting the future level of a given exchange if it is free\nto move. Cassel utilized the idea, known in this context as the \"inflation\ntheory,\" to refute the official apology propagated by Germany that the com-\nplete depreciation of the mark in 1923 was explained by a mere scarcity of\ngoods and by an un\u00edfavorable balance of trade. He also based upon the parity\ndoctrine his adverse judgment against attempts to restore badly depreciated\ncurrencies to their old values.\n\nDuring the twenties Cassel predicted a world shortage of gold. This was\npartly derived from his explanation of secular price movements in the century\nfrom 1810 to 1910 in terms of the deviation of the stock of monetary gold\nfrom a. computed normal increase of 2.79 per cent per annum which would\nparallel the secular increase of physical output. There are grounds for skep-\nticism concerning this analysis, as for example the effects of changing from\na silver or a bimetallic to the gold standard in the chief trading nations during\nthe century. But the devices recommended by Cassel for alleviating a gold\nShortage by monetary changes have meanwhile come into practical acceptance.\n\nIn the field of business cycle theory, Cassel has been less influential than\nWicksell. Common to both was the doctrine that cycles consist primarily of\nalternations of an excess of investment over saving and the reverse. The only\ncategoric difference lay in Cassel's contention that the \"natural\" or \"real\"\nrate of interest would tend to conform to the market rate, whereas Wicksell\nheld the reverse. Curiously enough for the proponent of such a doctrine,\nCassel was completely out of sympathy with the recent doctrine of Keynes\nand Hansen.\n\nAn adequate appreciation of the significance of Cassel leads beyond the\nrealm of scientific literature to his extensive popular writing, his wide partici-\n"

                    "On January 15, 1945, Gustav Cassel died, the dean of Swedish economists\nand one of the most renowned economists throughout the world in the present\ngeneration. Cassel's international repute rested upon his extensive writing\nthrough the greater part of his seventy-eight years of life, his active partici-\npation in public affairs both at home and abroad, and his influence as a teacher\nand publicist.\n\nCassel's contributions to the literature of modern economics are found\nprincipally in the four fields of value theory, monetary problems, the analysis\nof business cycles, and the critique of socialism. His first notable publication\nwas made in the field of value and distribution theory in TZe Nature and\nNecessity of Interest (1903). He was chiefly concerned in this work to dem-\nonstrate a separate productivity inhering in capital, explicable on the grounds\nof scarcity of supply without recourse to psychological determinants; but the\ntreatise illuminated the theory of capital in many ways. The services of capital\nwould be scarce and valuable even in a socialist state: the problem of why\ninterest exists should not be confused with the ethical issues raised by the\npossibility of living through owning. Students of capital theory will recall also\nCassel's suggestion of what we now call a backward rising\" capital supply\ncurve, and his idea that interest rates (expressed as the number of years\npurchase) may have some connection with average life expectancy.\n\nHis systematic works in value theory include Outlines of an. Elementary\nTheory of Prices (1899), Fundamental Thoughts in Economics (1925), and\nA Theory of Social Economy, first published in German in 1918, but not\navailable in English until 1924. Translated into several languages, the Social\nEconomy came quickly to be a standard treatise and a widely used textbook\nin universities throughout the world. It departed from the neoclassical tradi-\ntion in rejecting what the author regarded as unprofitable speculations as to\nthe subjective attitudes of suppliers of economic services. Though this ap-\nproach would be favored by the behaviorist psychology, Cassel's substitution\nof a mere principle of scarcity for the idea of subjective value underlying the\nphenomenon of price has not found general acceptance, witness the current\npopularity of the indifference analysis. The work recommends itself chiefly\nas a particularly lucid exposition of price theory along the lines of the Walras\ntradition.\n\nCassel's influence upon the world of practical affairs has been largest, how-\never, in the realm of monetary phenomena. It is here that we find the largest\npart of his writing for scientific journals and newspapers, and his excellent\ntracts for the times: TZe World's Monetary Problems (1912), Money and\nForeign Exchange after 1014 (1922), Outlines of the Development of the\n",

Because he was so vitally interested in policy he worked out his\nnew General Theory as an argument for his policy. Thus he drew economic\ntheory back to the pathr of realistic policy.\"*\n\nI am afraid Dr. Dillard is not quite aware of the grave, nay disastrous,\nconsequences to which the general acceptance of his position would lead with\nrespect to the future development of economic theory. The proposition that\n\"the thought of theorists represents a more sophisticated way of thinking\nabout policy\" means in less sophisticated words that theory and theoretical\nconcepts have to be used as tools for the vindication and carrying out of a\ncertain policy. I do not believe that Keynes himself would accept this inter-\npretation of his theory, and I am even doubtful whether American pragmatists,\nto whom Dillard refers, would agree to it.* It is one thing to regard ideas\nas plans of action in the field of natural science. It is another thing to apply\nthis consideration to the field of social science, as Dr. Dillard suggests. In\nthe former sphere the concept may well have some advantages, although\nthere are, even in that field, serious drawbacks. To use Bertrand Russell's\nwords: When what passes for knowledge is considered to be no more than a\nmomentary halting place in a process of inquiry which has no goal outside\nitself, inquiry can no longer provide intellectual joys, but becomes merely a\nmeans to better dinners and more rapid locomotion.* However, this drawback\nis nothing compared to the catastrophic results which would follow from the\ngeneral adoption of Dr. Dillard's view in the economic field. The conception\nof ideas as plans of action in physics and chemistry is based on the wish to\nforetell future events and thus to dominate the material world. The ultimate\ngoal of ideas used as plans of action in the economic sphere in conformity\nwith Dillard's proposition could be no other than to rule society. Ideas would\nbecome mere tricks, and theory would be degraded to propaganda. Because\nI do not treat the Keynesian concepts as having \"specific pragmatical mean-\ning, discoverable by the operational approach,\" Dr. Dillard declares me\n\"guilty\" of \"wandering all over the place.\" Well, I prefer to go on wandering\nto accepting his notion of economic theory. The level of so-called theoretical\ndiscussions in economics is not always very high even without following Dr.\nDillard's suggestion.

Needless to say, this inference may\nwell be exerted by the way of determining first the social philosophy of the\nwriter. The main point is that notions of wZat skould be direct\u2014often un-\nnoticed by the theorist\u2014the conception of wZat is, or rather what is sup-\nposed to be. In order to prove that the Keynesian theory is a case in point\nI tried to show that the economic policy Keynes suggests as a consequence\nof his theory actually does not follow as a logical corollary from his theo-\nretical reasoning. In this connection Dr. Dillard expresses his \"fundamental\ncriticism\" of my position on the ground that in Part III of my article I\nconclude \"that policy is prior to theory,\" whereas I analyze *Keynes's theory\nin Part II as though theory were prior to policy.\" But is there really a con-\ntradiction? I am inclined to believe that a fairly careful reader could not\ndiscover any. In Part II I show that the policy suggested by Keynes does\nnot necessarily follow from his theory, as the reader would expect; and in\nPart III I conclude that policy and/or social philosophy may well determine\nthe structure of theory. Now Dillard takes issue with my question: *Does\nthe suggested policy [of Keynes] follow necessarily from the [Keynesian]\ntheory?\" and he calls this question *wrong.\" But why is the question wrong?\nIf a writer says, explicitly or implicitly, that if and only if ? (for example,\nmore equal distribution of income by heavy taxation of the wealthy), then\nq (full employment), and if I can prove that there may be q without ?, I am\nentitled to say that the explicit or implicit statement \"if and only if 5, then\nq\" is not true; and no pragmatist who regards logic as something more than\na political instrument will deny that.\n\nWhen I wrote my article I expected objections on the ground that I had\ndone Keynes an injustice by stating that somehow political purposes entered\nhis apparently \"objective\" theorizing. Now I am surprised to see that,\naccording to one critic at least, I have not gone far enough because I did not\nuse pragmatic philosophy as a means of solving the question concerning the\nrelation between economic theory and economic policy.\n\nLet us examine now the positive contribution of Dr. Dillard to our prob-\nlem. In suggesting an investigation of \"policy as the operational meaning\nof theory,\" he rightly points out that the operational approach has come to\nplay an important r\u00f3le in modern philosophy and natural science, and he\nadvances the undoubtedly original idea of applying that approach to eco-\nnomics. Fortunately we are not left in the dark about the way Dillard\nwants to apply the operational approach to economics, in particular to the\nKeynesian theory. *\"The operational concept\" is to be used \"to explain theories\nas plans of action in the sense that [John] Dewey defines ideas as plans of\naction.\" Dr. Dillard contends that the general Keynesian concepts have a spe-\ncific practical meaning, and he misses in my analysis the suggestion that a cer-\ntain theory is articulated because the pragmatically selective perspective of the\ntheorist leads him in that direction. . . . The world of policy is prior to the\nworld of theory not only in the sense that theories which are to survive must\nconform to underlying political trends, but also in the sense \u00a3Zat tke thought\nof 'theorists' represents a more sophisticated way of thinking about policy?\n\n* [talics are mine.\n"

It must be emphasized, however, that the Pareto\naspect and the pragmatic aspect are entirely different, and the explanation of my\n\"omission\" is simply that I accept the Pareto view, but I reject the application\nof the pragmatic doctrine to the problem of the relation between economic\ntheory and economic policy. According to Pareto, the psychic state of a\npeople, in particular powerful interests, determine in the long run the policy\nof a country as well as the theory which is to justify that policy. A theory\nmay seem to be conceived independently of the consequences it has in regard\nto policy. Actually it cannot escape the influence of the political trend which\ndetermines, at least to a great extent, direction and outcome of the theoretical\nreasoning.\n\nApplying the Pareto aspect to the Keynesian theory, I stated that this\ntheory is an example of the influence the political trend exerts on the argu-\n\n* Am.

The other countries are credited with an actual output which bears the\nsame ratio to their potential as in the United States.\n\nIt will be noticed from the table that Russia appears to have more than\ndoubled its per capita output of work in a decade. Several other countries\nshow notable increases, especially Canada; the latter's increase (as well as\nsome of the others) being chiefly due to water power. The per capita decrease\nin the United States is because the increase in petroleum and water power\nfailed to compensate for the decline in coal output; it may be statistical\nrather than real, since the efficiency of the use of the first two is probably\ngreater than that of coal. This may also apply to Belgium. The per capita\ndecline in Germany is due to the inclusion of the lower-ranking populations.\n\nI am deeply indebted to Mr. Melvin I.

                    "New England Mutual Savings Bank Laws as Interstate Barriers\nto the Flow of Capital\n\nI\n\nMuch has been written in recent years about state laws and administrative\nregulations that have caused state boundaries to become significant in an\neconomic sense. Attention has, for the most part, centered upon those particu-\nlar laws and regulations that have acted as trade barriers; little has been said\nabout those that have lessened factor mobility, particularly that of capital.\nSavings, before actual investment in capital goods, are highly mobile. As a\nresult, lower taxes, gifts of land for factory locations, anti-labor policies, etc.,\nare practices adopted by areas attempting to attract capital saved elsewhere.\nConversely, there have been legislative efforts in states that normally export\ncapital to hinder its emigration. The most important of these have had to do\nwith savings accumulated through mutual savings banks; in some states these\nlaws have been generalized to include investments made by trust companies\nand certain other financial institutions under state jurisdiction. Unlike state\ntrade barriers, which are a comparatively recent phenomenon, these impedi-\nments upon capital mobility are old and well established. Although they were\nof more consequence relative to the size and wealth of the United States forty\nyears ago than they are now, they still cause distortions in the geographical\nlocation of the investment of savings accumulated through savings banks.\n\nIn most of the seventeen states in which mutual savings banks are located,\nthe legislatures have prescribed the operating procedures which they are to\nfollow in considerable detail, including two types of investment restrictions.\nThe first is designed to protect the depositor from loss. Those falling under\nthis classification not only limit the fields of investment to those that the\nlegislators considered to be least speculative at the time of enactment but also\ninclude detailed credit tests which must be met by borrowers in the approved\nfields before the securities they have issued are legally approved for savings\nbank investment. The New York law has the best provisions of this type\nalthough somewhat similar ones are also found in those of most other mutual\nsavings bank states, including New England.\n\nThe second type of restriction has been designed to aid borrowers within a\nstate (or regional group of states) rather than the depositors. These have been,\nand remain, characteristic of the New England laws. There are three methods\n\n? Le, co\u00f3peratives which follow the price policies recommended here.\n?'The desirability of producer co\u00f3peratives is another story.\n",
