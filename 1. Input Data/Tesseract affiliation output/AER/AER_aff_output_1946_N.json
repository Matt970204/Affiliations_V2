By \"foreigners,\" Mill does not\nmean foreign producers of products subject to duties when sold abroad.\nA case might be made for the view that duties are sometimes shifted\n\"backward\" to the producers of taxed items. It might be argued where\nduties are imposed upon sugar imports, for example, that the price of\nsugar received by foreign sellers would decline relatively to the price in\nthe absence of the tax and that, therefore, they are bearing at least part\nof the burden. Discussions of the burden of import duties have some-\ntimes been conducted along these lines? But Mill's views are quite\ndifferent from these. He would deny that foreign producers might be\nforced to bear even a part of the burden of import duties of sugar-using\ncountries and states positively: *It is the foreign consumer of our ex-\nported commodities who is obliged to pay a higher price for them be-\ncause we maintain duties on foreign goods.\"? If we adhere to Mill's\ntheories, we must say that foreign buyers of U.S. exports are bearing\npart of the burden of U.S. import duties.\n\nMill developed his conclusions concerning the burden and effects of\nimport duties with the concept of reciprocal demand. This technique of\nanalysis was taken over, improved, and made moie definite by the neo-\nclassical school, including Edgeworth, Marshall, and Pigou. These out-\nstanding thinkers in the field greatly refined the reciprocal demand\ntechnique without, however, reaching conclusions concerning the burden\nof import duties differing substantially from those laid down by Mill.\n\n* The author, assistant professor of economics at the University of California, acknowledges\nindebtedness to his colleagues, Professors Howard S.

Compulsory Licensing Legislation\n\n\"The base of the patent systems throughout the world is the principle\nof conferring on the inventor the absolute right of excluding others,\nduring the lifetime of the patent, from in any way practicing the\npatented invention. This right of exclusive exploitation of the invention\nis granted to the inventors for the purpose of encouraging inventive\nactivity and of furthering the development of the inventions, tending,\nhowever, by all means toward the ultimate end of promoting the general\nwelfare; the reward to the inventor is no more than a fair and agreeable\nmethod to attain that final result.\n\nIn industrial countries another dominant consideration is to assure\nthe early disclosure of the invention to the public. Especially the patent\nsystems of the United States and Great Britain are based on the theory\nof getting information, for in order to obtain a valid patent, the inventor\nmust fully disclose the secret. This is a crucial requisite for the benefit\nof society as a whole, since all knowledge divulged by the patent is\nopen to public use when once the patent has expired. (Authoritative\nGerman experts admit that, in order to understand the essence, the\n\"real meat,\" of the invention described in a German patent specifica-\ntion, it is often necessary to consult with the corresponding United\nStates or British specifications.) Moreover, conferring the exclusive\nright on the patentee fulfills still another purpose that exclusively serves\nto the interest of the public, in forcing the industry to carry on research\nwork tirelessly, for fear of being anticipated by another inventor which\nwould exclude competitors for seventeen years from the newly opened\ndomain. This function of the patent system is recognized as its pri-\nmary justification from the viewpoint of public policy because of pro-\nmoting industrial progress more than anything else.\n\nSuch personal monopolies vested in owners of patents are bound to\n\n* Theauthor, onetime member of the Austrian patent office and practicing patent attorney,\nis co-author of a widely used Code annotated on Austrian patent law, Vienna, 1926, and has\npublished a series of treatises on fundamental questions of Austrian and German patent laws.\nHe came to this country in 1941.\n"

Pre-War Trends in Economic Thought\n\nEconomics is sometimes regarded with some show of envy by other\nsocial scientists because of its reputation for having a more precise\nanalytical discipline than they have ready to their hands. This is no\ndoubt in a degree true, but the advantage is not at all times very clear\nto economists who are struggling against the weaknesses and imper-\nfections of their discipline and trying out exploratory innovations. So\nfar has the experimental spirit carried during the past three decades\nthat it is hardly correct to say that there exists an agreed discipline of\neconomic analysis. Rather there is a series of more or less inter-related\ndisciplines in a degree complementary, in a degree competitive, with\nsome difference of opinion concerning what is complementary and what\ncompetitive.\n\nSince all sciences except mathematics are compounded of a body of\nobjective phenomena, a body of analytical method wherewith to estab-\nlish or state the relations between phenomena and a statement of estab-\nlished relations, an essential preliminary to analysis is to delimit the\nphenomena or aspects of phenomena which are the subject of analysis.\nIt is perhaps in the supposed existence of an economic criterion or\nbenchmark, even more than for its analytical technique, that economics\nhas been the object of envy. This criterion was historically the principle\nof value\" based upon rational self-interest. Since, however, the curios-\nity of economists has not been limited to aspects of phenomena falling\nwithin that principle, the boundaries of the science remain vague, in\nparticular as they encompass the non-rational areas of behavior and the\nareas of collective action, or as they comprehend relations which are\nnot to be approached through a psychological principle.\n\nA great deal of what is included within the scope of economic litera-\nture does not, in fact, involve very much in the way of theoretical anal-\n\n* This paper was written by request for inclusion in a forthcoming volume dealing with\nsocial and humanistic disciplines, 19391945, soon to be published by the American Council of\nLearned Societies.

                    "A Suggestion for Post-War Taxes\n\nI\n\nThe character of the federal tax problem is fairly well understood. In the\nspecific post-war tax proposals which have come to the writer's attention,\nthere is a high degree of agreement, implicit if not expressed, with the fol-\nlowing principles:\n\n1. Federal taxes should be reduced from wartime levels, but should be\nhigh enough to meet all post-war government expenditures.\n\n2. Taxes on corporations and the income derived from them should be\ndrastically revised: (a) so that each shareholder is taxed once but only\nonce on the earnings belonging to his shares; (b) so that income derived\nfrom business corporations is taxed the same as income derived from other\ntypes of business or from other sources; and (c) so that distribution of ea1n-\nings to shareholders is encouraged rather than inhibited but making it pos-\nsible for corporation managements to retain a reasonable proportion of\nearnings when funds are needed for capital expansion.\n\n3. Since the taxes supporting social security benefits are no longer closely\nrelated to those benefits, those taxes should be combined with the regular\ntax system, with extension of social security benefits if this change in taxa-\ntion results in inequitable burdens on some classes in the population.\n\n4. Taxes on capital gains ought to exempt income previously taxed which\nhas never been distributed to the owner, but to tax like other income those\ngains which represent income not previously taxed.\n\n5. Taxes on estates, gifts, and income derived from trusts need revision,\nbetter integration with each other, and better integration with the indi-\nvidual income tax.\n\n6. Most of the numerous excise or sales taxes should be abolished.\n\n7. Some method is needed of averaging personal income taxes over a\nperiod of years, in order that persons with highly irregular incomes from\nyear to year, or receiving in certain years income representing the results of\nwork done over a period of years, will not be taxed un\u00edfairly.\n\n8. The probable level of federal government expenditures, even with the\nutmost economy, is such that the cost cannot possibly be met by progressive\ntaxes on incomes larger than pre-war exemption limits, and some method\n",

The Problem\n\nSavings of individuals have expanded from a total of 48 billion dollars\nat the end of 1939 to 156 billion dollars in January, 1946. On the basis of this\nhuge backlog of liquid assets (bonds, deposits, currency) some economists\nand business analysts have predicated markets for consumer goods. Notable\namong this group is Professor Sumner H. Slichter, who prognosticated post-\nwar markets under the assumptions of whether savings would be ''hot\" or\n\"warm,\" assuming different degrees of price and wage controls.! Despite the\nattention devoted to the holdings of liquid assets by individuals, which will\nobviously influence the national consumption function, insufficient con-\nsideration has been given to the distribution of accumulated savings among\nthe various income groups or to the attitudes of holders of these savings.\nBefore a sound quantitative appraisal can be made of the translation of this\npotential purchasing power into effective demand, information of this charac-\nter is needed. Such factors as liquidity preferences of individuals and the\nmarginal propensity to consume suggest questions which must be con-\nsidered before an hypothesis of post-war markets can be made on the basis\nof the accumulated aggregate savings of individuals.\n\nIt is the purpose of this paper to depict the wartime pattern of expendi-\ntures and savings by income classes, and to examine the significance of this\nempirical evidence as these factors relate to the forecasting of new markets.\n\nIL.

Since V-J Day, however, con-\nsumer expenditures have increased while total income payments were\nslightly declining. This may be attributed to favorable subjective factors!\"\nencouraging spending more out of current earnings rather than from savings.\nThe Proportion of consumer expenditures for durables and services is below\nthe pre-war level, compared with the abnormally large percentage spent on\nconsumer non-durable goods.\n\nShortages of durable goods and homes partly explain the continued in-\ncrease in savings deposits in mutual savings and commercial banks.!* As\nconsumer goods reappear on the market, savings deposits will probably\nadvance at a slower pace or level out, as a larger proportion of current in-\ncome may be spent for goods and less money saved. Accumulation of savings\nare encouraged primarily by a desire for security against future con-\ntingencies, rather than to finance specific purchases of consumer durables.\nHolders of liquid assets may be expected to maintain their savings largely\nintact if they maintain confidence in the integrity and value of the dollar\nand have adequate income to make it unnecessary to use savings for current\nliving expenses. If speculation, encouraged by run-away prices, occurs, how-\never, savings may be diverted to stocks and real estate, culminating in a\ndisastrous deflation. Should this situation arise, the decade of 1929-1939\nwhen savings continued upward despite large-scale unemployment may be\nrepeated. The best assurance for effective demand reflected in purchases of\nconsumer goods focuses largely upon sustained high levels of employment,\nproductivity, and real consumer incomes resting upon economic stability,\nrather than relying upon a demand created out of savings.\n\nThe tremendous backlog of individual holdings of liquid assets are in-\ndubitably potential creators of expanding markets, and will /end to raise the\naggregate income-consumption schedule of the nation.

Some Conclusions\n\nThe empirical evidence clearly reveals that, despite large accumulated\naggregate savings in the country, we cannot assume that these will be\ntranslated into post-war purchases of goods during the next few years.\nFurthermore, it must not be assumed that a shift in the distribution of\nconsumer units to higher income levels will follow the same pattern of saving\nand spending characteristic of that class. Other factors such as habits of\nliving, educational training, occupation, and a conventional mode of life\nmay affect the pattern of spending rather than its being determined pri-\nmarily on the basis of income. The propensity of the consumer to save\ndepends more on his position in the frequency distribution of incomes than\non the number of dollars he earns. The correlation between the rate of\n",

It revealed, moreover, an apparent close relationship between the\nconcentration of current saving and liquid asset holdings, and showed a\nrelatively heavy concentration of these assets compared to income. While\n45 per cent of the money income in 1945 was received by the top 20 per cent\nof the spending units, these units accounted for 77 per cent of the liquid\nasset holdings. The bottom 50 per cent of the spending units, receiving 22\nper cent of the money income, held only 3 per cent of the liquid assets\n(Table IIT).\n\nAlthough the national survey could not definitely establish amounts of\nsavings people wil/ spend, it revealed that a large proportion of the spending\nunits stated they had no intention of using their liquid assets for any pur-\nposte in 1946.\n\nAlthough the Braddock Steelworker study!? does not give as detailed an\nanalysis regarding age groups, size of family, and other characteristics of\nthe holders of savings, compared to the two BAE investigations, it tends to\nconfirm the latter findings, as indicated in Table IV. Whereas, the mean\nliquid assets of the Braddock Steelworker in January, 1945, aggregated\nabout $800, these savings were concentrated in a relatively small number of\nfamilies, as 73 per cent of the families had under $800, and 50 per cent had\nless than $400 in liquid assets.\n",

On balance,\noutlays for current consumption represented a smaller share of income in\n1944 than in 1941 among families in the income groups above $2,000 after\ntaxes. But urban families with incomes under $2,000 required a considerably\nlarger share for essential goods and services in 1944 than in the earlier year.\n\nUrban families and single individuals having incomes over $3,000, com-\nprising 42 per cent of the total consumer units, accounted for 60 per cent of\nthe aggregate consumption expenditures in 1944 (Chart II). In contrast,\nurban families and single individuals with incomes under $2,500, comprising\n45 per cent of all consumer units, made 27 per cent of the aggregate con-\nsumption expenditures. The remainder of consumer units, having incomes\nbetween $2,500 and $3,000, which accounted for 13 per cent of the urban\nfamilies and single individuals, made 13 per cent of the aggregate consump-\ntion expenditures.\n\nThe skewness of savings fer se is clearly depicted in Chart III which\nshows that the high income classes accumulate most of the savings of the\ncountry. In contrast to the appreciable net deficits of 31 per cent of the con-\nsumer units with incomes below $2,000, Chart III reveals that 64 per cent\nof the aggregate annual savings were made by consumer units having money\nincomes of $5,000 and over, comprising 13 per cent of urban families and\nsingle persons of the nation.\n\nThe pilot study of liquid asset holdings in 1945 made by the Bureau of\nAgricultural Economics corresponded to the findings of the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics.5 The BAE study covering both rural and urban areas indicated a\nconcentration of ownership of savings and in each income class there tended\nto be a few cases of large holdings.

The Problem\n\nSavings of individuals have expanded from a total of 48 billion dollars\nat the end of 1939 to 156 billion dollars in January, 1946. On the basis of this\nhuge backlog of liquid assets (bonds, deposits, currency) some economists\nand business analysts have predicated markets for consumer goods. Notable\namong this group is Professor Sumner H. Slichter, who prognosticated post-\nwar markets under the assumptions of whether savings would be ''hot\" or\n\"warm,\" assuming different degrees of price and wage controls.! Despite the\nattention devoted to the holdings of liquid assets by individuals, which will\nobviously influence the national consumption function, insufficient con-\nsideration has been given to the distribution of accumulated savings among\nthe various income groups or to the attitudes of holders of these savings.\nBefore a sound quantitative appraisal can be made of the translation of this\npotential purchasing power into effective demand, information of this charac-\nter is needed. Such factors as liquidity preferences of individuals and the\nmarginal propensity to consume suggest questions which must be con-\nsidered before an hypothesis of post-war markets can be made on the basis\nof the accumulated aggregate savings of individuals.\n\nIt is the purpose of this paper to depict the wartime pattern of expendi-\ntures and savings by income classes, and to examine the significance of this\nempirical evidence as these factors relate to the forecasting of new markets.\n\nIL.

Not infrequently writers have concluded\nthat this tax is subject to shifting and that its incidence, in part, is on con-\nsumers and laborers.

                    "Concept and Teaching of Economics: Comment\n\nIn his criticism of the traditional introductory course in economic prin-\nciples under this title! Dr. Mendershausen confuses two entirely different\nproblems. First, is the content of this course as now given conducive to an\nunderstanding of economic reality? Second, should we begin economic in-\nstruction with economic theory,\"\u2014that is, a system of necessarily abstract\nconcepts\u2014or should we rather arouse the students' interest by painting\nbroad historical-sociological pictures, starting with the \"*origin and signifi-\ncance of the Ghost Dance among the American Indians in the late 19th\ncentury\" and ending up with nothing less than the 'Great Depression and\nthe War.\" That we are actually dealing here with two different issues can\nbe most easily seen in Mendershausen's suggestion that in the later years\nof college study the students should go \"into intermediate, specialized work\nin economics.\" Surely, Mendershausen cannot intend that these later\ncourses in economics should take up the teaching of the \"rationale of a sel\u00edf-\nregulating system of markets (market economy),\" which he so severely\ncondemns as unrealistic in the earlier sections of his article. He must be\nreferring to a different and sufficiently realistic type of economic theory,\nthough possibly not \"pure and systematic\" according to his terminology\n(p. 379); if so, he has failed to demonstrate that it would be impossible to\nteach an introductory course in \"economic principles\" using this type of\nmaterial.\n\nMendershausen's inability to realize this simple truth is rooted in his\npersistent identification of economic theory\" with the theory of ''a self-\nregulating system of markets\" and the '\"'crusade against the interference\nwith market self-regulation\" (p. 379). He would do well to ponder Keynes's\ndictum: \"The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled\nconclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than\na doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking, which helps\nits possessor to draw correct conclusions\"?\n\nWhat Mendershausen does not realize is that any free enterprise system,?\neven if it is not self-regulating and is \"interfered\" with, can be understood\nonly with the help of the conceptual apparatus which has been largely\ndeveloped by the neo-classical theory.

This committee not only estab-\nlished ten subcommittees on the varied phases of the subject with a total\nof seventy-eight members and consultants but also sponsored a lively dis-\ncussion of undergraduate teaching at the 58th annual meeting?\n\nThe most recent attempt to raise the level of teaching took the form of\n2 Conference on the Teaching of Economics at The American University,\nAugust 19-31, 1946. At this conference, fourteen distinguished professors\nof economics discussed objectives and effective methods of teaching for\ntwo weeks with eighteen instructors from all sections of the country and\nfrom Canada. Special features of the meetings included a demonstration of\nvisual methods of presentation, lectures on government sources of informa-\ntion, a book exhibit and several social affairs. The entire fifty-five hours of\nthe discussion was recorded. The conference was organized by the Teaching\nInstitute of Economics at The American University, which is operated\nunder a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. At the same time it\nrepresented an experiment by thesubcommittee of the Association on The\nTraining of Teachers of Economics.\"\n\nEven for the group of leading college teachers, the conference had con-\nsiderable value. Separated as they are, they would not ordinarily consult\nwith each other on teaching problems for more than a few minutes a year\nduring the annual meeting. For the younger teachers, the experience was\nunique. Seldom does an economist have a chance to review the currents of\neconomic thought as they affect teaching with a group of experienced\nteachers who are paying attention to his problems.\n\nNo attempt was made to formulate the wide range of thoughts and sug-\ngestions expressed at the conference into any series of resolutions or findings.\nMajor attention was given to the introductory course, not only because that\ncourse is crucial but also because, illogically, most colleges assign this most\ndifficult job of teaching to their least experienced teachers. A good deal of\nattention was devoted to the sequence of undergraduate work, to the teach-\ning of economic history and to the special needs of business, government\nand agriculture. At every point the questions of teaching technique were\ndiscussed in close relationship to the broad aims and philosophy of the\nsocial sciences and to the real needs of students.\n\n1 The college curriculum in economics has received some recent attention, for example,\nby Horst Mendershausen, R.

But since a systematic discussion of the basic\ntheoretical concepts requires all the time available in a 30-weeks course,\nthe average student can hardly get an adequate training in basic economic\ntheory, if much time is given to the discussion of the political-sociological-\nhistorical aspects of the four topics cited above and of the two other topics\nin which economic theory plays only a minor r\u00f3le.\n\nThere is nothing to prevent the instructor in an introductory course in\neconomic principles from making the abstract discussion of a theoretical\nsystem more vivid by relating the theoretical concepts to concrete problems\nof economic policy or economic development. But even so, abstract the-\noretical thinking is not everybody's business, and there always will be\nstudents who will shun a course on economic principles unless it is remodeled\nalong the picturesque historical lines of Mendershausen's \"political econ-\nomy.\" But what of it? Let them stay away!\n\nThe desirable content of a modernized introductory course in economic\nprinciples is quite clear. Negatively, it must refrain from describing the\npresent economy as what it is not\u2014a self-regulating system. In other\nwords, it must discuss the limitations of the stabilizing mechanisms, and\nthe indeterminateness, from the viewpoint of a purely rational theory, to\nwhich the modern credit system and the widespread monopolistic tendencies\nsubject the working of the market economy. Furthermore, the course should\neliminate all material that is not indispensable for a broad understanding of\neconomic reality, either because it is completely unrealistic (as is a large\npart of the oligopoly discussion), or because it has not yet been made fruit-\nful (as in the case of the modern stability discussion), or because it has\nproved its usefulness only for special problems with which the beginner\nneed not be bothered (for example, the indifference curve apparatus). The\nbulk of the neo-classical theory as developed around 1933 could nevertheless\nberetained; and it should be enlarged by an outline of the basic concepts\nutilized, thanks to Keynes, in the \"macro-economic\" approach to the\n\neconomic problems of our times.\nITaAwc Nvrfcerp*\n"

While differing\nin detail from country to country, these reform programs have generally\nprovided for the withdrawal of most, if not all, of the outstanding notes\nand for their conversion into new currency. \u00cdn most cases, only a\nmoderate part of the withdrawn currency has been exchanged, the\nremainder being blocked in bank accounts from which withdrawals or\ntransfers may be made only up to specified amounts or for specified\npurposes. Simultaneously, in most countries, the same or similar restric-\ntions have been imposed on all or part of the bank deposits existing at\nthe time of the adoption of these measures. Subsequently the blocked\nbalances resulting from these operations have been partly released and\nadditional portions have been or are about to be absorbed by the issue\nof government securities and by special capital levies and war profit\ntaxes.\n\nThe broad objectives of most of these post-war monetary reform\nschemes have been to exert a restraining influence on the public's ex-\npenditures, to force people to seek employment by making them\ndependent on current income instead of past savings, and to deprive the\npublic of funds with which to purchase in black markets. In some\ncountries, the conversion of currency has been chiefly an instrument for\nthe detection of concealed wealth held in monetary form and of income\ntax evasion during the war period. An incidental purpose of the reform\nmeasures has been to ascertain and cancel the amount of notes held by\nthe enemy and lost or destroyed in the course of the war. Unification of\nthe currency has been another, though never the sole, objective in\ncountries where a multitude of currencies have been introduced during\nthe war.

It has resulted, more-\nover, in a serious loss of export markets and the accumulation of enorm-\nous stocks in the hands of the Commodity Credit Corporation. In the\ncase of two of our leading exports, wheat and cotton, we have been\nrather ineffectively attempting to cling to a diminished share in the\nworld market by employing export subsidies.!\n\nTo escape from this unfortunate dilemma, the Department of Agri-\nculture proposes a post-war policy of intergovernmental commodity\nagreements to stabilize world agricultural prices and curb unmanageable\nsurpluses.

The danger will\nbe in overdoing the treatment of the actual ailment as it has been overdone\ntoo often in the past.

Or\u2014to take a better parallel\u2014it is as\nthough different members of the family were to give successive doses to the\nchild, each in ignorance of the doses given by the others.

                    "1946] COMMUNICATIONS 645\n\nis returning to the \"*normalcy\" of 1940, prophets of deficit spending may\nprove to be right. If the nation is entering a long era of post-war expansion\nwith periodically recurring set-backs in business conditions, it will need a\ndifferent, much more flexible economic policy. The practical task will be, in\nthis event, to find the proper selection, timing, and dosage of remedies de-\nsigned to coriect excessive up's and down's in employment. The danger will\nbe in overdoing the treatment of the actual ailment as it has been overdone\ntoo often in the past. Using the words of Keynes, it is as though the family\nwere to go on giving a child successive doses of castor-oil every ten minutes\nuntil the first dose had done its work. Or\u2014to take a better parallel\u2014it is as\nthough different members of the family were to give successive doses to the\nchild, each in ignorance of the doses given by the others. The child will be\nvery ill. Bismuth will then be administered on the same principle. Scientists\nwill announce that children are subject to a diarrhoea-constipation cycle,\ndue, they will add, to the weather, or, failing that, to alternations of opti-\nmism and pessimism amongst the members of the family. If the time taken\nby the first dose to act is constant, they will discover that the cycle is a true\none with a constant period. Perhaps they will suggest that the remedy is to\nbe found in giving the child bismuth when it is constipated and castor-oil\nat the other extreme. But more probably the parents will divide into bis-\nmuth and castor-oil parties, one of which, impressed by the horrors of\ndiarrhoea, will renounce castor-oil, and the other, moved by the depression\nof constipation, will abjure bismuth.\"*\n\nDisregarding these wise warnings of Keynes, his followers propose to cure\nall the evils with one medicine\u2014the castor-oil of liberal compensatory spend-\ning. Since they have no other prescription in their books and no other medi-\ncine in their bag and know in advance what they are going to administer to\nthe patient, they do not need to waste time in examining him, observing\nthe symptoms of his ailment, or studying his constitution, disposition, and\nenvironment. The procedure is simple: Get the patient to open his mouth\nwide and make him swallow as much of the salutary medicine as can be\nforced into him. This is the economic philosophy of the article under dis-\ncussion. That the post-war United States will be economically ill and in\nneed of a good dose is taken for granted. The only problem is how to make\nthe prospective patient open his mouth wide enough to absorb 15 billion\ndollars a year. The article performs this operation with commendable fervor\nand courage, and with no false pretense of having based the remedy on a\nstudy of actual conditions and trends in post-war America.\n\nW.

The Cohen committee rejected these alternatives, recom-\nmending that shareholders be required to state, on signing a transfer or\ndirection to the company, whether they are beneficial owners or not; that\nif any person is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of one per cent\nor more of the issued capital, he must make a full declaration to the com-\npany. In addition, the Board of Trade would be provided with drastic\npowers to investigate the ownership of shareholders whenever it is con-\nsidered desirable in the public interest.\n\nIn relation to other matters, the committee's proposals are drastic, es-\npecially as to the secretiveness of company accounts and the responsibility\nof directors. It was not generally known, before the inquiry, that the propor-\ntion of private to public companies had been steadily increasing in recent\nyears. The great advantage of the private company, the fact that it need not\nfile its accounts with the Registrar of Companies, has led many public\ncompanies to convert their subsidiaries into private companies. The\nAmendment Committee has suggested that no private company can claim\nexemption from filing accounts if its membership includes a body corporate\n(other than a corporation sole), or if a body corporate is benefcially in-\nterested in its shares. Although this recommendation permits the private\nfamily company to go unhampered, it stops abuses on the part of public\nfirms. In addition, holding companies are to disclose full information about\ntheir subsidiaries by publishing consolidated accounts. On the presentation\nof accounts generally the committee follows the suggestions of the Institute\nof Chartered Accountants, coming out strongly against hidden reserves and\nfor greatly enlarged financial statement data.\n\nOne major weakness of the Companies Act, 1929, was that directors were\nonly liable for untrue statements in a prospectus. The Amendment Com-\nmittee recommends that they should be liable at civil law also for misleading\nstatements and for the omission of material information which may be mis-\nleading. It will also make the expert liable for any untrue or misleading\nreport which he formally allows the directors to include in a prospectus.\nAdvertisements for \"*placings\" are to be put on the same footing as pro-\nspectuses.\n\nIn framing its report, the Company Law Amendment Committee has\navoided making any proposal which would restrict honest business manage-\nment, and it has endeavored to provide every possible impetus to increased\npublicity of financial facts. The balancing of these objectives, each with its\nproper emphasis and with relation to the nation's expanding peacetime\neconomy, transforms what might otherwise have been a dry state paper into\n\u00e0 well-conceived approach to the reform of major deficiencies in prevailing\nCompany Law. The incorporation of the Cohen committee's recommenda-\ntions in British statutory law should be facilitated both by their moderate\ntone and by the gravity of the business, accounting, financial and managerial\nweaknesses they seek to correct.\n"

This\ncommittee, composed of distinguished members of the bar, economists, ac-\ncountants and business men, was appointed by the Board of Trade to con-\nsider and report what major amendments were desirable in the Companies\nAct, 1929, and in particular to review the requirements prescribed in regard\nto the formation and affairs of companies and the safeguards afforded in-\nvestors and the public. Its report, published in June, 1945, has elicited wide\ncomment in both Britain and America as it provides one of the best reviews\nof traditional and contemporary accounting and corporate practice in the\nformer country. In addition, the committee proposes reforms, some con-\nservative, others drastic, for blatantly outmoded or illegitimate business\nprocedures, but it has skillfully avoided \"placing unreasonable fetters upon\nbusiness which is conducted in an efficient and honest manner,\" while\nmaking sure that \"as much information as is reasonably required shall be\navailable to shareholders and the public.'?\n\nThe Labor Government has accepted the recommendations of the Cohen\ncommittee in full and is preparing a bill to give effect to them. Before this\nmeasure is introduced in Parliament, however, companies are urged to\nbring their practices in line with the committee's proposals, a suggestion\nwhich has been followed by a number of prominent firms.\n\nThe Cohen committee expresses satisfaction that the great majority of\nof public and private limited liability companies are managed honestly and\nare of marked benefit to British trade and industry. The fullest practicable\ndisclosure of information concerning the activities of companies, in its\nopinion, will lessen the opportunity for abuse and coincide with an aroused\nSocial consciousness. The suggestions of the Amendment Committee have\nbeen aimed at aiding shareholders to exercise a more effective general con-\ntrol over the management of their companies, although they indicate that\nthis aim will be attained **more by selection of the proper governing body\nof each company than by the provisions of any statute.\"\n\nWhen viewed in its entirety, the Company Law Amendment Report is\nseen to stress that the future system of private enterprise must operate with\ncomplete honesty and with full publicity. When considering all aspects of\nbusiness and accounting practice, including company managements, the\ncommittee has attacked each subject with equal intensity except, perhaps,\nthat of the increasing use of nominees for shareholdings. So widespread, in\nfact, has this procedure become that in 1943 over 600,000 individual hold-\nings of stocks and shares were registered in the name of nominees of joint\nstock banks alone.

The case for non-price rationing in Russia\nis much the same as the case for rationing in wartime in capitalistic coun-\ntries. In both types, the pattern of income is unequal and the rich would,\nin either case, consume unduly at the expense of the poor.\n\nUnder socialism, it is doubtful whether consumers can be taxed by a\nturnover tax levied by the state upon its own agencies. Taxation implies\nthat someone is forced to give up something to the state which he would\nhave retained if the state had not exercised its taxing power. The \"turnover\ntax\" does not do this. A state sales tax upon products sold by state agencies\nisan insistence by the central administration that the accounting practice of\nthe trusts label part of the profits \"tax receipts\" instead of simply \"profits,\"\nand the tax may act as an administrative instruction to change prices of\nproducts. Only the price change can be significant, and it has significance\nas a decision to ration more or less by price and less or more by direct\nmeans. Given the price policy of the government, the \"tax\" is purely\nnominal in character and can scarcely be regarded as being a burden to any-\none.\n\nIf this point of view is correct, the tax should not be regarded as a weapon\nto \"force mobilization of the community's savings.\" If, with increases in tax\nrates, state agencies charge higher prices, the action has the effect of ration-\ning relatively more by price and, in addition, it takes more money out of the\nhands of the public. With less money, people may spend less in the future\nand thereby reduce the work-load of non-monetary rationing devices and\nincrease the relevance of price as a rationing device. Thus, it seems to me\nthat the turnover tax should not be considered as one of the more important\n\naspects of the Soviet financial system.\nTian. Dornenk\n"

                    "1946] COMMUNICATIONS 661\n\nMr. Sumberg's Interpretation of the Soviet Turnover Tax\n\nIn the March, 1946, issue of this Review, Mr. T. A. Sumberg in his article,\n\"Soviet Union's War Budgets\" provides a valuable summary and analysis\nof Russian wartime finance. In speaking of the \"turnover tax,\" Mr. Sum-\nberg states: \"The tax is the main financial instrument by which the Russian\nstate curtails consumption in order to promote capital construction and\nnational defense. Offering no possibility of evasion by the taxpayer-\nconsumer, it is also an efficient weapon for the forced mobilization of the\ncommunity's savings in the interest of rapid industrialization and urbaniza-\ntion.\"! This statement suggests a point of view which, it seems to me, should\nnot be left unchallenged. It is dif\u00fccult to understand how the tax can\noperate to curtail consumption. The allocation of resources in Russia as\nbetween production for war and for civilian purposes has been determined\nby direct rather than by financial means. The over-all plan predetermined\nwhat resources were to be devoted to war needs and what to civilian uses.\nIf by \"consumption,\" is meant \"real\" consumption, it is not clear how the\nturnover tax made any difference in the quantities of civilian goods made\navailable to the general public. Soviet civilians would not have had more\nfood if the tax had not been imposed.\n\nOne may also question whether the tax should be regarded as borne by\nconsumers. In a socialistic state, the price of products sold by the trusts are\nestablished by administrative rule. Whether the tax raises prices depends\nnot upon the tax itself but, rather, upon the accompanying instructions, if\nany, to trust price-fixers as to what price changes are to be made. If no price\nchange is made with the imposition of the tax, the taxis without significance.\nA change would be made in accounting terminology only. Instead of all of\nthe net return of the trusts being called \"profits,\" a part would be called\n\"turnover tax yield\" and the remainder, if any, \"profits.\" Such a procedure\nwould alter labels, not substance.\n\nThe Soviet practice appears to adjust prices in accordance with changes\nin the rates of the turnover tax. Even in this event, the tax itself is also of\nlittle significance; what is important is the decision to charge the public\ndifferent prices. In a setting of diminishing supplies of real things, Soviet\nofficials were forced to decide to what extent to employ price and to what\nextent to employ direct controls to ration the limited supplies among the\nmembers of the public. A decision to ration by price alone would call for\nraising prices under such conditions. The price policy of the government is\nimportant because it determines to what extent monetary mechanics\n(money expenditures and prices) are to be used to ration available supplies to\nthe public. Whatever its price policy, it seems untenable to hold that the\ncivilian population as a whole would be worse off, even if prices were set so\nhigh as to make all non-monetary rationing devices, such as rationing cards,\nselected admittance to special stores, standing-in-line, unnecessary. The\npopulation as a whole would get the same quantities, but a decision to use\nprice alone to ration might, and probably would, have given some people\n\n1 Am. Econ.

                    "By J. CaRL POINDEXTER*\n",
                    "Recent preoccupation with the issues of fiscal policy and the na-\ntional debt has engendered widespread interest in the collateral prob-\nlem of possible fiscal techniques for minimizing the debt and tax\nburdens associated with prevailing financial practices.\n\nAs is well known, the process of bank-credit creation has long pro-\nvided the basis for an irrepressible philosophy of monetary reform\nwhich would eliminate interest payments on government debt arising\nout of government borrowing from commercial banks. The arguments\nof its adherents run as follows: The coinage and regulation of money\nis an exclusive and sovereign prerogative of government; government\nborrowing from commercial banks is not \"genuine borrowing\"; the\ngovernment should not be obliged to pay, in perpetuity, hundreds of\nmillions a year to the banks for the deposit currency which the banks\nsimply manufacture and turn over to the government in exchange for\nits bonds; if a fiscal policy which involves the creation of new money\nis to be pursued, the government, rather than private issuing agencies\n(banks), should enjoy the seigniorage on the new money issues. In\nother words, most exponents of these views relating to present fiscal\npolicy regard government interest payments to the banks as wholly or\npartly unearned and, at least, a partially unnecessary burden on the\ngovernment and the taxpayer. They insist, therefore, that if the banks\nare to be permitted to create the funds which they advance to the gov-\nernment, a new, fiscally less burdensome method of compensating\nthem for manufacturing credit for the government should be instituted.\n\nOne possible and representative method calls for the issuance to the\nbanks of special, non-marketable, non-interest-bearing securities. This\nmethod contemplates that, in return for the monetization of each se-\ncurity of a given denomination, the banks be paid a \"reasonable\"\nservice charge at the time of issuance, but nothing in the way of interest\nthereafter. The criterion of repayment of even the principal of such\nsecurities would be inflation control, not contractual obligation.\n\nAs safeguards against possible inflation, the more subtle proponents\nof this sort of fiscal innovation propose that the monetary authority be\ninvested with plenary powers over reserve requirements, open market\noperations and, in addition, the power to impose special taxes to re-\ntrieve inflationary excesses in the money supply.\n\n'\n* The author is professor of economics at Roanoke College.\n",

            "found": "The integrating principle of economics lies in maximizing satisfac-\ntions by the use of available scarce resources, in man-hours and the\nbounties of nature, as well as in savings resulting in capital. The\nallocation of these resources among the various spheres of enterprise,\nthe combination of varieties of one resource with varieties of another\nresource, the substitution of one resource for another, and the division\nof income between consumption and saving, are central in achieving\nmaximum satisfaction with the resources at hand.\n\nUnder capitalism the guide to the distribution of resources among\nthe channels of economic activity is price, the price of consumer goods\nand the price of the resources, labor, land and capital, in a setting\nof free enterprise and competition. We balance utilities against costs.\nTo use a few simple examples, in competitive equilibrium the fact\nthat price equals minimum average cost implies that the least expendi-\nture of resources is incurred to obtain a utility; the assertion that\nthe inefficient producer drops out of competition means that the\nproducer who uses up more resources than other producers in order\nto get the same result is eliminated; and when a high cost and high\nprice are associated with small purchases of a given commodity, the\nidea is that, because a given utility necessitates a large use of.re-\nSources, it is enjoyed sparingly.\n\nIt is doubtful whether Adam Smith, Ricardo and their early fol-\nlowers, from whom Marx learned much of his economics, put this\nprinciple at the heart of economic analysis. To Smith the central prob-\nlem of political economy was efficient production, to Ricardo the\nexploration of the principles of the distribution of income. The place\nof utility. was not prominent in their minds. Smith goes no farther\nthan to mention that all production is evidently for purposes of con-\nsumption;* Ricardo goes no farther than to state that if goods are to\nbe produced at all they must be useful. To Marx economics is pre-\n&minently a study of class exploitation in a given society in its evolution\nto the next, higher, social order, and the object of the economics of\ncapitalism specifically is the investigation of the principles governing\nthe exploitation of the proletariat, the fatal maladies of the system,\nand its dialectic disintegration into socialism and communism.

While actual labor markets are obviously far from perfect, one\nis still inclined to believe that some such tendency toward wage equalization\nis operative. |\n\nIt is always somewhat disturbing, therefore, to observe the great variety\nof rates for apparently comparable jobs which prevails in actual labor\nmarkets. The National War Labor Board has during the past several years\ncollected the rates paid by different firms for certain \"key occupations\" in a\nlarge number of industrial areas. Inspection of these data indicates that\nthe highest rate in an area is usually at least 50 per cent and frequently\n100 per cent above the lowest rate for workers classified under the same job\ntitle.\n\n\"These differences in rates are of course not necessarily significant for wage\ntheory. Their significance could be determined only by correcting for all the\nconditions assumed equal in the theoretical problem. First, the workers\nwhose earnings are being compared may not be of equal ability or may not\nbe working equally hard. This could readily account for differences in piece-\nrate earnings, and even under time rates, inter-firm wage differences might\nbe offset by differences in the level of ability or effort required by various\nfirms. Second, jobs called by the same name may not be the same jobs and\nthe workers doing them may not be interchangeable. Terms such as 'ma-\nchinist,\" *welder,\" and even \"common laborer\" are notoriously unreliable\nindicators of job content.\n\nThird, even if one could find two jobs requiring performance of exactly\nthe same operations, these jobs might differ in almost numberless other\nrespects. Among these are the extent of \"fringe\" wage payments\u2014 bonuses,\npaid vacations, paid holidays, pension systems, free medical care, etc.\u2014the\nshift involved and the shift differential if any, the expected regularity of\nwork, the length of the work day and week, the extent to which the worker\nis protected against layoffs by seniority or other rules, the opportunity for\nadvancement, physical conditions of work, the congeniality of fellow-workers\nand supervisors, the quality of personnel management in the company, and\nthe presence or absence of a union. Competition in a perfect labor market\nis supposed to equalize, not money rates of wages, but the total attractiveness\nof the same job in different plants.

The Need for a National Full-Employment and\nFull-Production Policy\n\nA number of economic models relating to the national budget\nrecently developed on the basis of pre-war income and expenditure\npatterns have demonstrated that severe depression in the years\nimmediately following the transition period is highly probable in the\nabsence of a national policy to assure full employment. From these\nmodels the economists have concluded that in the post-war period (1)\nnational policy must be directed toward changing the income and\nexpenditure patterns so as to increase private expenditures for con-\nsumption and tangible investment, and (2) the federal government\nmust assume the responsibility of adjusting its own outlays and\nrevenues so as to maintain aggregate expenditures on goods and services\nby both government and the private economy at the level required for\nfull-employment production.\n\nThe logic underlying these models will be indicated in a later section.\nThe conclusions derived from the models may, however, be arrived at\nin a very simple manner. In 1944 and the first half of 1945, the\nAmerican economy produced at an annual rate of about 200 billion\ndollars of finished goods and services for consumption, business invest-\nment and government use. Both the labor force and the output per\nmanhour have been subject to conflicting influences during the war,\nsome of which have tended to raise and others of which have tended\nto lower the gross national product. There is widespread agreement,\nhowever, that when these wartime influences are eliminated, the\nAmerican economy, in the years immediately following the transition\nperiod, will be able to produce the same total volume of goods and\nservices as it did at the peak of the war effort. Our capacity to produce\nin 1950, in other words, will be about 200 billion dollars gross national\nproduct in 1944 prices, and it will steadily increase thereafter as a\nresult of population growth and increases in productivity.^\n\n* The views expressed by Mr. Mosak are his own personal opinion and do not necessarily\nreflect in any way those of the Office of Price Administration.\n\nThe author is indebted to the following persons for their very careful reading of the\nmanuscript and their many helpful suggestions: Henry S.

Psychology and Economics\n\nIn his presidential address at a recent meeting of a psychological\nassociation, Gardner Murphy pointed out that most of the problems\nfacing psychologists today are interdisciplinary problems.'

Yet, the\nneed for collaboration between the two disciplines has frequently been\nacknowledged. For example, in an essay on *Human Behavior and\nEconomics\" in 1914, Wesley C. Mitchell deplored the prevailing trend\ntoward *non-intercourse with psychology\" and added that \"we may\nhope both to profit by and to share in the work of contemporary\npsychologists.\" Four years later J.

If the economist borrows his conception of man\nfrom the psychologist, his constructive work may have some chance\nof remaining purely economic in character. But if he does not, he will\nnot thereby avoid psychology. Rather, he will force himself to make\nhis own, and it will be bad psychology?\n\nBorrowing a useful conception of man from psychology became\nincreasingly difficult in the 1920's when behaviorism and psychoanalysis\nwere the most popular schools of psychology.

Hicks elaborates a\npartial theory of invention which, though incidental to his theory of\ndistribution, nevertheless embodies the use of concepts which have\nso captured the economist's fancy that the theory of invention has\nachieved a certain fame of its own. Indeed, the terms *labor-saving\"\ninvention, \"induced\" invention, and *autonomous\" invention have be-\ncome stock in trade to most economists, so much so that they are\nfrequently used without questioning the ultimate theory of techno-\nlogical progress upon which they rest. The Hicksian exposition is\nbased in part upon a dichotomy between the induced invention and\nthe autonomous invention; and in part upon a distinction between the\nlabor-saving and the very labor-saving invention. It will be shown\nin the following discussion that the first classification is not all-\ninclusive and, in fact, omits, either through obscurity or error, what\nis a very common type of labor-saving invention. The second classifica-\ntion, while more proper, is mistaken in emphasis. Inductive in-\nvestigation suggests that the invention whose introduction would have\nbeen profitable even if factor prices had not changed is not un-\ncommon, as Hicks supposed, but on the contrary is a frequent occurrence\nin the favorable environment provided by American industrial enter-\nprise.\n\nBefore exploring the intricacies of the theory of invention, a brief\nr\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the Hicksian terminology may prove helpful.\n\nInduced Invention?\u2014an invention which is made as a result of a\nchange in the relative prices of the factors.\n\n* The writer, at present serving as a Lieutenant in the Navy, is indebted to Professors\nE.

At the same\ntime there is fairly general agreement that the volume of aggregate\neffective money demand for consumers! durable goods will play a\nstrategic part in this problem. This volume is in turn determined by\nvarious factors, among which two are by far the most important. One\nis the number of consumer units (single persons or families); the other\nis the amount of income which each consumer unit is able and willing\nto spend for these goods. In recent economic literature there has been:\na tendency to assert or to imply that, in the long run, variations\nin aggregate effective demand for consumers! durables are predomi-\nnantly caused by what we may call the quantity factor\u2014the growth\nor decline, or the change in the rate of growth or decline, of the number\nof consuming units\u2014with the income factor playing only a relatively\nminor part.' Quite often this view, combined with the observation that\nwe are living in a period of declining population growth, has led to\npessimistic predictions as to the adequacy of investment outlets in the\nfuture.\n\nTwo questions must be distinguished here. One of them has to do\nwith the final results of a declining rate of population growth, i.e.,\nthe eventual relative, or even absolute, decline in the number of income-\nearning units (single adult persons of income-earning age; families\nthe heads of which are potential income earners).

                    "The Doctrine of Economic Maturity\n\nDr. George Terborgh has written an important book.! It has been declared\na \"must\" for business men's reading by the National Association of Manu-\nfacturers; it has been summarized in Fortune magazine; it has been enthusi-\nastically reviewed in the New York T?mes and elsewhere. It is hailed in some\nquarters as an effective debunking of all that is lumped together as New\nDeal economics.\" Certainly, its general conclusion, that policy should be\ndirected toward increasing investment and savings, rather than to raising\nthe standard of living in more forthright fashion by increasing the share\nof income spent on consumers' goods, private and public, is the antithesis of\n*New Deal economics,\" and indeed of almost all economics that has been\nwritten in the last ten years. The implications of this reversion to pre-World-\nWar-I economics are of serious import; for a policy of maintaining full\nemployment by \"such a stimulus to private investment that . . . will imme-\ndiately put all savings to work in providing capital\" would redistribute income\nfrom the poor to the rich\u2014just the reverse of the policies of the \"stagnation-\nist,\" as Terborgh calls the economists he lumps together for attack. Conse-\nquently, although the book is aimed at the general public and employs a style\nof presentation that is scarcely academic, it requires the careful consideration\nof academic economists, and of all others interested in economic policy.\n",

                    "The Incidence of the Corporation Income Tax: A Rejoinder\n\nMr. Bowen's note raises again the question as to what \"shifting\" a tax\nmeans. Admittedly, the concept of shifting and incidence is ambiguous.\nReasonable clarity requires that all who speak of shifting specify wat is\nshifted were or to whom and by what process. It might be still better to\ndiscard the terminology entirely. In the article to which Mr. Bowen refers I\ncentered attention on the possibility of shifting through higher commodity\n",
                    "1946] COMMUNICATIONS 147\n\ntal to be reduced. This reduction in supply of capital tends to raise the\nmarginal productivity of capital and to lower the marginal productivity of\nlabor and land. In this sense, some part of the tax tends to be shifted, in the\nlong run, to workers and landowners. This shifting, moreover, is not dependent\non any change in the general level of prices.?\n\nAs Mr. Goode suggests (p. 50), this conclusion is subject to qualification.\n\"The tax, through its effects on both investment and saving, may influence the\nlevel of national income. The level of national income, in turn, may affect\nthe return to the factors. Thus, the ultimate effects of the tax may differ\nfrom its immediate effects. Any conclusion as to whether the tax, on balance,\ninfluences income in the direction of expansion or contraction depends upon\nthe character of the fiscal policy which it is assumed would be adopted in the\nabsence of the tax.\n\nThe income effects of the tax, however, do not necessarily alter the conclu-\nsions regarding its effect on the return to capital. Because of the fact that the\ntax results in a relative scarcity of capital, the rate of return to capital would\nbe higher, at any level of income, than would otherwise be expected a\u00a3 zat\nlevel of income. In this formal sense, the tax would be shifted regardless of\nits effect on national income.\n\nIt is true that if the tax were expansionary, the increase in return to capital\nresulting from the increased income would offset, wholly or in part, the direct\neffect of the tax on the return to capital, On the other hand, if the tax were\ndeflationary, as seems more likely, the income effect would accentuate the di-\nrect effect of the tax on the return to capital. Or, if the deflationary effects of\nthe tax were offset by other elements of fiscal policy designed to stabilize\nthe economy, the tax could be said to have no net influence on national income.\nIn that case, its influence on the return to capital would be confined to its\ndirect effects, and at least some degree of shifting would result.\n\nMr. Goode touches on this argument when he states (p. 50) that the cor-\nporate tax would \"limit the capital available to corporations.\" But he passes\nover the point with the conclusion that a restriction in supply of capital would\nnot necessarily produce an increase in the general price level. He ignores any\npossible relation between a reduction in supply of capital and the shifting of\nthe tax via changes in the marginal productivity of capital.\n\nHowanp R. BowEN*\n\n? Professor Boulding suggests, also, that a profit tax may reduce the supply of enterprise.\nAm. Econ.
