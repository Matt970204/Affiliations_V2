During his years of graduate study, 1880-90,\nand his career as a creative economic theorist, 1890-1915 being his\nmost active period, he was a contemporary of Menger, B\u00f3hm-Bawerk,\nWalras, Marshall, Wagner, and Spiethoff, whose works, apart from\nthose of his colleagues in Sweden, D.

Mr. Hicks has\npresented a simple theory of the business cycle, based on his own\nrecombination of elements previously recognized. These elements are\nprimarily the interaction of the accelerator and the propensity to con-\nsume, subject to lags, and a ceiling on the rate of increase of production\nat or near full employment. The accelerator expresses the tendency for\ninvestment, or possibly disinvestment, to be induced by changes in the\nlevel of income or production. In its simplest form it is the ratio of the\namount of investment so induced to the change of national income\nwhich induced it. From a sophisticated viewpoint the accelerator may\nbe regarded as a more complicated description of the manner in which\ninvestment or disinvestment is influenced over time by changes in the\nlevel of national income or of its components. The propensity to con-\nsume expresses the tendency for the level of consumption to depend\non the level of income. In its simplest form the marginal propensity to\nconsume is the ratio of the additional consumption expenditure asso-\nciated with a given additional amount of income to that additional in-\ncome. More generally the term propensity will be used in this discus-\nsion to cover the dependence of the rate of expenditure on the level of\nincome, the term accelerator, to denote the dependence of the rate of\nexpenditure on changes in the level of income.\n\nThe accelerator has long been used in the explanation of certain\nphases of the business cycle; but its r\u00f3le as a possible generator of\ncumulative movement was not fully recognized until it was combined\nwith the Kahn-Keynes multiplier?

In this\ncentury, there has arisen a considerable literature dealing with the more\nprecise and logical interpretation of th\u00e9se propositions. The discussion has\ntaken several directions: (1) What is the meaning of increasing or maxi-\nmizing *community welfare\"? Both of the words in quotation marks lead\nto problems. (2) What are the precise statements of the ''optimum\" condi-\ntions? (3) What are the circumstances under which these conditions do\nnot coincide with the operations of perfect competition?

I can see no particular reason for\nconsidering the bill of exchange as a claim and the bank deposit as an actual\npayment. Similarly, if the exporter actually gets paid in dollars, these dollars\nmust have been provided out of a balance in the United States already owned\nby somebody in the importer's country or by dollars purchased against a\ncredit (probably to an American bank) in the importer's country. In either\ncase the exporter has been paid by a change in claims; either foreign claims\non the United States have been reduced or United States claims on the foreign\ncountry have been increased\u2014a debit entry in either case.\n\nMr. Enke is quite right in pointing out the difficulties in drawing inferences\nregarding exchange rate pressures from the balance of payments statistics\nalone; these can only mirror what has happened in the past, when it is\nalready too late to do anything about it. It is like trying to measure the\ninflationary or deflationary *gap\" in the internal economy by looking at last\nyear's product and income statistics. By the time the transactions have\noccurred, the gap has been closed, or the specific problem solved in one\nfashion or another. Reference might be had on this subject to the Interna-\ntional Monetary Fund's concept of compensatory official financing.?\n\nIn the last paragraph of his note Mr. Enke states that a nation's balance\nof payments is not analogous to any familiar accounting statement. It seems\nto us that there is a direct analogy between the balance of payments and a\nstatement of \"source and disposition of funds.\" The latter, like the balance\nof payments, may include transactions which were not actually settled in\ncash such as when net profit is shown as a source of funds and an increase\nin accounts receivable as a disposition of funds. The profit concept is, of\ncourse, foreign to balance of payments terminology; funds are \"provided\" to\na country through reductions in its assets or increases in its liabilities\n(credits) and are used, or disposed of, to increase its assets or to reduce its\nliabilities (debits).\n\nFinally, one \"pitfall? mentioned seems a little less than real. Certainly\nit is unlikely that any student of economics would be apt to consider \"that\nthe aggregate saving-investment of a national economy\" can \"be inferred\nfrom the state of its (international) Current Account alone.\"\n\nRosnEnT L.

                    "Some Balance of Payments Pitfalls: Comment\n\nI share with Mr. Stephen Enke the opinion expressed in his communica-\ntion Some Balance of Payments Pitfalls\"* that the terms receipts and pay-\nments, as used in balance of payments presentations, may be somewhat mis-\nleading. As may be seen from an examination of our articles in the Survey of\nCurrent Business, we dropped the terms receipts and payments beginning with\nthe figures presented in the issue of June, 1950.\n\nThe terms receipts and payments may, however, not be so confusing as Mr.\nEnke seems to suggest. It is true that a credit entry is made for any trans-\naction which results, or would ordinarily be assumed to result, in a claim on\nforeign countries, or a reduction of foreign claims on the exporting country.\nHowever, except in the case of gifts in kind, an offsetting debit will appear,\nusually in one of the capital accounts, and this debit can be considered to\nrepresent the payment\" for the export. This Mr. Enke concedes in the para-\ngraph on the top of page 163. This being the case, where does the confusion\narise? True, it might be more accurate to label the items \"transactions giving\nrise to receipts\" instead of just \"receipts,\" as in ordinary bookkeeping sales\nare usually referred to as receipts. In both cases it might be argued that the\nreal receipt is the increase in an asset (e.g., cash), which, of course, is by\nitself a debit entry.\n\nThe foregoing notwithstanding, I too prefer the use of the terms debits\nand credits, although we customarily explain their use in terms of the rule\ngiven in an elementary accounting text. This rule is simply to debit increases\nin assets and decreases in liabilities and to credit decreases in assets and in-\ncreases in liabilities.\n\nWith the exception of the unilateral transfers (gifts) and, possibly, income\non investments, all of the entries in the balance of payments record the re-\nduction or increase of an asset or liability. Exports of merchandise and\nservices are credits because they represent a transfer of assets from the re-\nporting country to foreigners. Similarly, an increase in a United States invest-\nment abroad is represented by a debit entry because it is an increase in assets\nof this country. A reduction of foreign investments in the reporting country\nis a debit because it is a reduction of the country's international liabilities.\nOf course, it must be kept in mind that (except for the nonmonetary gold\nentry) only transactions with foreigners are to be recorded in the statement.\n\nFor example, if wheat is exported against payment from a foreign dollar\naccount in New York, the reduction in an asse\u00a3 (wheat) is recorded by a\ncredit entry and the offsetting reduction in a liability is a debit. If a foreign\ncurrency or bill of exchange had been accepted in payment, the second entry\nwould still be a debit, of course, but because it reflected an increase in an\nasset\u2014a claim on foreigners.\n\nIt seems to me that this is a much simpler explanation of the debits and\ncredits than the discussion of cla?ms by Mr. Enke. Actually, in these days\nall business transactions are settled in claims of one sort or another. If an\nAmerican exporter receives \"payment\" for his export either in the form of a\nbalance in a foreign bank or a bill of exchange on the foreign importer, he has,\n\n!

Given these preferences and \"technological\" ideas, the individual acts\nupon them in order to arrive at a more satisfactory state. The preferred state\nwhich the actor expects to attain is his *end\"; the steps by which the actor\nattempts to attain his goal are the *means.\"? It is this praxeological concept\nof action that distinguishes the observed movements of men from those of\ninorganic matter.*\n\nThis axiom of action is indisputably an important truth, and must form\nthe basis for social theory. To deny it would be absurdity. How has our knowl-\nedge of the truth of this axiom been attained? In this way: an individual re-\nflects, discovers the concept of action and its applicability to all human indi-\nviduals, analyzes its components, and then sets it forth orally or by the\nwritten word. Each individual, upon reflecting on the axiom of action, must\nagree to its truth and to its importance. It is in this respect that the action\naxiom must be *universally recognized as true.\"* What name we apply to\nthis method of obtaining knowledge is basically unimportant and involves\n\n!

Cf., especially,\nChapter II, pp. 44-50.\n\n* The difficult case of animal behavior, ranging from the lower organisms to the higher\nprimates, cannot be discussed here.\n\n*Schuller's questioning of the validity of the praxeological axioms and procedures on\nthe basis of the possible inability of the vast majority to grasp them is an old problem\nfor the physical sciences. How can Einstein's theory of relativity be true if the mass of\nthe people cannot understand the demonstration of its validity? Whatever solution physical\nscience has developed for this puzzle may be adopted by praxeology as well.\n",

However, it\nis a mistake to assume that they are analyzing the same subject.\"\nIn many respects Chamberlin is extending the Marshallian tradition,\nbut with a revolutionary addition; he is studying competition with\nproduct differentiation. Logically, as Triffin has pointed out,* the ad-\nvent of product differentiation destroys the concept of industries and\ngroups, and so Chamberlin has really taken a first step towards ex-\nplaining the competitive adjustments of different product-making firms\nwithin the economy. Mrs. Robinson, despite the misleading title of her\ncelebrated book, is concerned only incidentally with competitive ad-\njustments; excepting Chapter 7, she is almost exclusively bent upon\nanalyzing an isolated monopoly or contrasting it with competition.\nThis distinction is important because it affects the ability of each theory\nto make predictions regarding the typical adjustments of sets of firms.\n\nOne of the main potential uses of value theory to the economist is as\na predictive aid. This is particularly so, when as is so often the case,\n\n* Many of the ideas in this paper have been inspired by the thoughts and work of Pro-\nfessor A. A. Alchian.

The Cambridge economists, up-\nholders of the classical tradition, duly noted these difficulties and\npromptly dismissed them as unimportant.

This effort clearly brings\nthe historian and the theorist closer to a common perspective on the\neconomic process, for the economic historian has hitherto mainly con-\ncerned himself with a more or less purposeful description and analysis\nof the sequence of economic development in various regions. The\npresent note constitutes a few interim observations on the theoretical\nstructure which has thus far emerged. Its purpose is to suggest the\npossibility of certain refinements and elaborations in the existing\nmodels and to focus the attention of historians and other empirical\ninvestigators on certain problems of fact whose solution may assist\nthe elaboration of an improved theoretical framework for the under-\nstanding of the growth and fluctuations of economies. This note is\norganized as a series of discrete comments on the model presented by\nMr. J. R. Hicks in A Contribution to the Theory of Trade Cycle. As\nMr. Hicks has underlined, his study is part of a growing stream of con-\ncepts and speculation. Nevertheless, his formulation is a convenient\npoint of departure.\n\nFluctuations in Mr. Hicks's system reflect levels of total investment\nwhich are inappropriate to the long-run rate of increase of output,\nin a progressive economy. These inappropriate fluctuations in total\ninvestment result from the interplay of the multiplier and the ac-\ncelerator, when their values are taken at certain levels. In his view, it\nis likely that the levels of investment induced by a rise in income\nwill yield a spiral of investment and income increases which the system\nwill reject as inappropriate. The form of that rejection is an upper\nturning point and downward spiral in output initiated by the existence\nof bottlenecks in capacity which throttle the increase in output and,\nthrough the accelerator, lower investment, income and, in turn,\ninvestment.\n\n* The author is associate professor of economic history at the Massachusetts Institute of\n\"Technology.\n!

Introduction\n\nPostwar experience with the General Agreement for Tariffs and\n\"Trade and various other internhtional economic organizations con-\ntinues to validate a remark made by Lloyd Metzler that *\"The practical\nconduct of international trade is . . . much more a problem of negotia-\ntion and compromise than the classical economists believed.\"* It is the\npurpose of this paper to investigate some recent contributions to the\ntheory of international trade which are closely related to Metzler's\nwidely shared opinion. These contributions are based upon the central\nidea that the economic judgments of those in control of a country's\ninternational trade can be given formal theoretical expression, and\nthe advocates of the new approach purport to provide us with a clear-\ncut graphical representation of the economizing activities of ruthless\nand short-sighted national states. Their methodology relies upon curves\nof reciprocal demand and community indifference which were first\ndeveloped by Marshall and Edgeworth.

No doubt he meant it purely rhetorically that *there can be no doubt that\nthe import of Cadillac cars, Coca-Cola, nylons and such-like products from the United\nStates which bulk large in Italian costs, has seriously aggravated the difficulties of a sensible\nemployment policy.\" I cannot see that this is a fact. Besides, if the issue really were be-\ntween Cadillacs on the one hand and vitally needed foodstuf\u00eds and raw materials on the\nother, there would be hardly any point worth fighting about. The facts are, of course, that\nexchange controls keep out vitally needed raw materials and that the imports of Cadillacs,\netc, are not worth talking about. Not only that: under bilateral agreements a certain\nnumber of Cadillacs or their equivalent usually have to be taken by each party to the\nagreement in order to receive the really wanted products. (For example, see United Na-\ntions, 4 Survey of the Economic Situation and Prospects of Europe [Geneva, 1948], p. 97\nand elsewhere.)\n\nI also wonder how the British people feel about bilateral agreements now that their meat\nration has been cut substantially because of Sefior Peron. Or whether the Danes are\nentirely happy about their inability to have their prices increased as much as they\noriginally liked. It is an interesting factual problem whether Britain gains more from\nexploiting Denmark than she loses from being exploited by Argentina.

                    "I shall consider very briefly some aspects of two questions: (1)\nWill price control work without rationing, and (2) is rationing a good\nsubstitute for price control?\n\nWhenever unrestricted demand exceeds the available supply of a\ncommodity at the ceiling price, some sort of rationing will occur\u2014by\nqueue, by lot, by seller's choice, by government order, or by some\nother means, I interpret our first question to be: Will price control work\nin the absence of rationing by government order? I think the answer\nis yes or no.\n\nPrice control on cigarettes worked very well in this country in World\nWar II even when the shortage was pronounced. The opposite case,\nwhere price control will not work well without rationing, is aptly\nillustrated by meat and by clothing. In the industrial field, price con-\ntrol was quite effective, even before the adoption of allocation, the\nterm used for rationing of industrial materials, in most primary metals,\nin chemicals, and in other commodities such as agricultural equipment.\nScrap metals and lumber present instances of the opposite sort in the\nindustrial field where price control cannot work well without rationing.\n\nThe examples just given point to important elements affecting the\nanswer to our question, the nature of the market structure and the\ndegree of control by sellers over the flow of the product and of its\ncomponent materials. It is not easy to establish a new cigarette manu-\nfacturing company or to divert substantial quantities of established\nbrands from the regular distribution channels through which the big\ncigarette producers want their products to go. On the other hand,\nlive animals may travel different routes to the mouths of meat-hungry\nconsumers, In World War II a host of country slaughterers sprang\nup and the flow of animals to the regular packers almost dried up at\ntimes. Black-market dealers channeled the meat into black-market\nrestaurants and butcher shops and the meat supplies of the chains and\nof other legitimate retailers were constricted. In this case effective price\ncontrol requires not only consumer rationing but also control of the flow\nall along the line.\n\nSimilarly, the big metal and chemical companies can control pretty\nwell the flow of their products into immediate consumption, and the\n",

Many other persons still\nbelieve that the conflict with Russia will continue to be a cold one\nindefinitely if we increase our bargaining power by building up our\nmilitary strength. And for this purpose, partial mobilization is said to\nbe enough. But for either full or partial mobilization some sorts of\ndirect price and wage-rate controls are said to be necessary. It is my\ncontention that, given the fact of some such controls, they must be\ngeneral and thoroughgoing rather than piecemeal. They should cover\nthe wage rates of all workers and the prices of all raw materials, semi-\nfinished products, and final products.\n\nThere are human or political as well as economic reasons for this\nconclusion. On the economic side the basic questions are, How can we\nsuccessfully stabilize the cost of living, i.e., prevent an inflationary\nrise in the prices of civilian consumption goods, without controlling the\nprices of the raw material and labor components of the consumption\nproducts? And how can we stabilize the prices of some products and\ntheir raw materials and labor components without stabilizing those of\nothers? Not to do the first would distort the wage-price structure\n\"horizontally.\" Not to do the second would produce \"vertical\" distor-\ntions.\n\nOn the human-relations or political side, the following considerations\nappear to be fundamental: If a sizeable portion of our resources is to be\nallocated to war products, there will be fewer civilian goods available.\nIn real terms this means sacrifice for the country as a whole. And if\nevery one is to cooperate in the mobilization, the sacrifice will have to\nappear to be equitably distributed. In money terms this means the\nfollowing: (1) In the *horizontal\" sense, labor would become exceed-\ningly restive if the controls on wage rates were more rigorous than\nthose on product prices and profits. And firms would feel it unjust for\nthe controls on product prices to be tougher than those on wage rates.\nSimilarly with raw material producers vis-\u00e0-vis final-product makers.\n(2) In the \"vertical\" sense, if the prices of some products and their\n",

The most significant change in recent years has been the\nabsorption of a large fraction of a greatly expanded national debt by\nthe commercial banking system. Federal Reserve policy has been domi-\nnated by debt management considerations arising from this develop-\nment. Much thought has been devoted to devising reform measures to\ncreate a situation in which central banking powers may again be avail-\nable for purposes of monetary management. A plan which has received\nconsiderable attention is that commercial banks should be required to\nhold a special reserve of short-term government securities against de-\nposits.

One such examination has been conducted in the field of taxation in\nan effort to trace the welfare effects of indirect versus direct taxation.' The\nbasic neoclassical conclusion quite briefly was this: that the direct tax was\nless detrimental because it simply caused a loss of utility due to the reduction\nin disposable income at the margin, whereas the indirect tax not only did\nthis but also distorted the choice between commodities since relative prices\nwere no longer the same.

Some people limit the concept of payment\nreceived to receipts of U.S. funds from foreign residents. However, if foreigners\nrelinquish foreign funds to American residents, this constitutes a disbursement\nby other countries, and consequently one would suppose a receipt of payment\nby the United States.

Actually, there is no reason\nwhy economists should not, and perhaps there are several reasons why they\nshould, assess all lending and borrowing, all bank balance shifts, and all gold\ntransfers, in terms of the claims and counter claims to merchandise imports\nand exports.*\n\nThe existence of different national currencies in the world is glossed over\nin the usual national balance of payments. For instance, some U.S. imports\nfrom the United Kingdom are bought and invoiced at a contracted dollar\nprice and some perhaps at an agreed-upon sterling price. However, ai] these\ntransactions will be represented as dollar debits in the U.S. balance and as\nsterling credits in the U.K. balance of payments.\n\nIn these days of exchange control the national currency in which different\ninternational transactions are denominated may be important. In certain cases\nit would be helpful, if the requisite data were available, to construct a balance\nof payments for a nation with multiple debit and credit columns, one for each\ncurrency. If this were done for the United States, it would still be true that\nall sterling debits should logically cancel all sterling credits, and that all\nFrench franc debits and credits should offset one another too; but, naturally,\none would not expect to find any particular account, such as the bank balances\naccount, to be in exact balance, either for individual currencies or for all cur-\nrencies collectively.\n\nThere is often an unwarranted temptation to draw inferences regarding\nexchange rate pressures from that part of the Short Term Capital account that\nconcerns American ownership of foreign bank balances and foreign ownership\nof American bank balances. We shall call this subsidiary account the Money\nAccount. If the Money Account shows that Americans are receiving payment\nfrom foreigners\u2014i.e., the account is negative on balance\u2014some people might\nconclude that the dollar was hardening. This would, however, not necessarily\nbe so. The negative Money Account might arise from the reliquishment of\ndollar balances by foreigners, or, alternatively, by the acquisition of foreign\nbalances by Americans without foreign exchange ever being sold for dollars.\nAdditional information regarding the debits and credits of specific currency\n\n*One means of payment in these days is through intergovernmental gifts. The goods\n\nexported under ECA give rise to merchandise credits for the U.S. economy. The offsetting\ndebit is the gift voted by Congress to the foreign nations concerned.\n",

However, this does not mean\nthat U.S. residents have paid out $y to foreign residents during the accounting\nperiod. On the contrary, it means that, because foreign residents have paid\nU.S. residents $y during this period, U.S. claims to receipts have been dimin-\nished by this amount. This revelation usually comes as something of a shock\nto students who previously imagined that the Department of Commerce uses\nthe term Receipts to mean money received and the term Payments to mean\nmoney paid out.\n\nThe Receipts and Payments terminology is only valid when it refers re-\nspectively to U.S. claims to money and foreign claims to money. Inasmuch as\nit is claims that are under consideration, one might better, it seems, use the\nordinary language of double entry bookkeeping and refer to plus items as\nCredits and minus items as Debits. There is less danger that people will inter-\npret Credits to mean actual receipts and Debits as actual disbursements.\n\nThe true nature of the U.S. Balance of Payments is more clearly revealed\nif one adopts the Credit and Debit terminology. It is then seen to be a list\nof the claims of U.S. residents against others for payment together with the\ncounter claims to payment of foreign residents. Thus American sales of mer-\nchandise, securities, gold, or bank balances all occasion U.S. credits and\nforeign debits. And any act that reduces U.S. claims to payment, such as\nwhen a foreign debtor settles in cash, occasions a U.S. Debit and a foreign\nCredit.?\n\nThe objection most frequently raised against the Credits and Debits termin-\nology is that many people are unfamiliar with it. In the writer's opinion this is\na merit. It requires people who do not understand their precise meaning to\nlearn them. On the other hand, because most people think they know the\nmeaning of Receipts and Payments, they may incorrectly assume that a nega-\ntive Money Account indicates the acquisition of American bank balances by\nforeigners.?\n\n* Students of international economics often think it strange that long-term investments\nshould occasion debits for the lender, who is now a long-term creditor, because they\noverlook the fact that it is claims to payments during the current accounting period\nwhich occasion credits. The prospect of bond redemption, years in the future perhaps, is\nignored by today's balance of payments. In the case of short-term lending, covering\nperhaps only 90 days, a majority of the loans made during a calendar year are repaid\nwithin the same year, and hence these transactions are not recorded in the international\nbalance of payments. However, if U.S. residents were to own more foreign bills at the\nend of a year than at its outset, this would mean, other things equal, that the United\nStates had on balance accepted these foreign bills in lieu of payment, thereby reducing its\nclaim to payment during the period in question, so that this increased bill holding would\nappear as a U.S. debit.\n\n*Actually the language of ordinary accounting is becoming ever more widespread\n\namong businessmen and economists\u2014the kind of people who read the Survey of Current\nBusiness, for example.\n",

                    "Some Balance of Payments Pitfalls\n\nMost economists and many businessmen have become \u00edamiliar with the\nbalance of payments series published by various national governments. How-\never, what valid inferences can or cannot be drawn from these statistics are\nnot so generally understood, and the terminology is at times confusing. Most\npeople know that ** the balance of payments must always balance,\" at least in\nthe forms usually published, but not so many understand why or how. The\npurpose of this paper is to indicate a few balance of payments pit\u00edalls.\n\nThe international transactions of governments, firms, and residents (as\ndistinct from citizens) in the United States are recorded in the various ac-\ncounts of the U.S. Balance of Payments by either plus or minus entries. For\nexample, it has long been customary to record the sale of exports as a 'favora-\nble\" or plus action, and the purchase of foreign securities as an *unfavorable\"\nor minus action. The algebraic sum of all these recorded transactions should\nbe zero for any given accounting period, whether it be a week or a year, if all\nthe conventions are followed and the data are complete and accurate.*\n\nLogically, if export sales are positive and a zero balance is to be approxi-\nmated, any transfers of funds by foreign importers to American exporters\nmust be viewed as negative. International trade gives rise to two entries in\nthe U.S. Balance of Payments. The act of sale occasions a plus entry in the\nmerchandise trade account and the act of settlement occasions a minus\nentry in some other account. Whether the foreign buyer accepts a bill of\nexchange or settles in cash, there is a subtraction from one or other of the sub-\nsidiary Short Term Capital accounts of the United States.\n\nA difficulty arises over what to call these plus and minus entries. Some\npeople\u2014the writer included\u2014refer to plus items as Credits and minus items\nas Debits. However, the Department of Commerce, and hence an increasing\nnumber of people, uses the terms Receipts and Payments, respectively. How-\never, this latter terminology is often confusing because many people not un-\nnaturally suppose that Recepits of $x for exports means that U.S. exporters\nreceived $x in funds for their exports and that a minus entry of $y on short-\nterm bank holdings means that Americans have paid out $y to foreign resi-\ndents. Actually, each inference would be quite invalid.\n\nA Receipts entry of $x on account of exports really means that exporters\nhave established, through sales during the accounting period, claims to re-\nceive $x. Some of this they will have received and some of this they will still\nbe owed. In international trade, partly because of the time needed to ship mer-\n\n*In practice, of course, statistical errors and omissions prevent such a perfect balance\never being struck, as is evidenced by the tables that periodically appear in the Survey\nof Current Business.\n",

                    "Mises \"Human Action\": Comment\n\nIn the June, 1950, issue of this Review, Mr. G. J. Schuller, in his review\nof Ludwig von Mises! Human Action, makes various criticisms of the book\nwhich deserve reply.\n\n1. Schuller claims that Mises asserts a *law of social development whereby\nthe majority in the long run . . . chooses the system which provides the\nhigher standards of living.\" Mises makes no such absurd claim. What he does\nsay is that the majority of a people choose that form of government which\nthey believe will provide them with highest standards of living. This is\nsimply saying that all exercise of power rests on the consent to obey by most\nof the inhabitants.\n\n2. Schuller maintains that Mises \"provides no clear test of incorrect versus\ncorrect praxeological reasoning. '\" The tests are, on the contrary, clear\nenough. Praxeology consists of two main elements: (1) the fundamental\naxioms, and (2) the propositions successively deduced from these axioms.\nNeither the axioms nor the deduced propositions can be \"tested\" or verified\nby appeal to historical fact. However, although the axioms are a Priori to\nhistory, they are a posteriori to the universal observations of the logical\nstructure of the human mind and human action. The axioms are therefore open\nto the test of observation in the sense that, once postulated, they are univer-\nsally recognized as true. Such recognition may be accused of being \"intro-\nspective,\" but it is nonetheless scientific, since it is an introspection that can\ncommand the agreement of all. The deductive propositions are tested accord-\ning to the universally accepted laws of logic. (Laws, incidentally, which are\nalso a priori to historical fact.) The fact that a proposition comes at the end\nof a \"long chain of deduction\" makes it no less valid than a proposition at\nthe end of a short chain.\n\n3. It is curious that an economist who is convinced of the truth of economics\nShould be accused of *uncompromising dogmatism.\" An attitude of frank\nconviction is a refreshing change from the timidity and apolegetics that are\nall too frequent among economists.

Both the voluntarist and meliorist positions may be found in Mises.\nOn the former: *Only if men are such that they will finally espouse policies\nreasonable and likely to attain the ultimate ends aimed at, will civilization\nimprove. . . . Whether or not this condition is given, only the unknown future\ncan reveal\" (p. 193). On the latter: *Human society. .. . is the outcome of a\npurposeful utilization of a universal law determining cosmic becoming, viz.,\nthe higher productivity of the division of labor\" (p. 145). \"The chiliastic\nempires of dictators are doomed to failure; they have never lasted longer than\na few years. We have just witnessed the breakdown of several of such 'millen-\nnial' orders. Those remaining will hardly fare better\" (p. 153). The two\nstrains are rooted in Mises! praxeological axioms. After postulating a common\nhuman striving for abundance (p. 19), he tells us that *reason [is] man's\nmost characteristic feature\" (p. 176) but that **man very often errs in select-\ning and applying means\" (p. 20).\n\nThe ancient problem in the social disciplines of uniting science and policy\nis not solved by Mises! question whether *characteristically reasonable men\"\n(p. 176) \"will finally espouse reasonable policies\" (p. 193). In my review I\nasked whether Mises would try to reconcile this dilemma by regarding his\nlaw of development as a praxeological law, effective only so long as its as-\nsumption of rational action obtains, while regarding the specific future out-\ncome as dependent also on historical accidents (perhaps including knowledge)\nwhich may abort the inner tendencies and therefore make apodictic predic-\ntion impossible. Rothbard would reconcile the dilemma by his profound\nobservation that men will choose whatever system they believe will accomplish\ntheir objectives.\n",

Schuller reads into Mises the truly absurd statement that all intelligent\nchoice of means requires calculability. He then asks how Mises can intelli-\ngently choose between market economy and socialism. Mises never, explicitly\nor implicitly, claims that a// intelligent choice requires calculability. Obvious-\nly, the consumer does not have to calculate in order to decide whether he\nprefers to read Hamlet or a detective story the next evening. Calculability is\nonly a requisite in the choice of \u00bbeans of production in a complex economy.\nIt is not required for any other judgments of value or for Crusoe-type choice\nof means in a simple economy. Certainly, Mises offers no basis for Schuller's\ncharge. Indeed, in his essay, *Economic Calculation in the Socialist Common-\nwealth,\" Mises explicitly states the conditions under which calculation is\nrequired for intelligent choice.?\n\n8. When Mises presents us with the choice between the free market and\nsocialism, he is saying that in-between systems of a hampered market are not\ncoherent, consistent systems. He demonstrates that any measure of govern-\nment intervention in the market creates problems and consequences which\npresent the people with a further choice: repeal this measure, or effect another\nmeasure of governmental intervention. Thus, if we may use the term in this\nsphere, we may say that an interventionist society is always unstable and in\n*disequilibrium,\" while the only societies in *equilibrium\" are the free market\nor socialism, since interventionist measures logically lead to one or the other.\nSince a socialist system cannot exist, the only intelligent choice is the purely\nfree market.\n\n9. Since Mises demonstrates that every form of government intervention in\nthe market creates consequences that lead to an economy worse than that of\nthe free market, Schuller cannot distinguish between rational and irrational\nforms of government intervention, or designate market intervention as a\n\"technology.\" For Mises, all government intervention in the market is irra-\ntional and therefore contrary to economic law.\n",

Schuller then cites various instances of what he calls arbitrary applica-\ntions of catallactic principles to historical reality. In most of the cases, how-\never, he cites not applications, but the principles themselves.\n\na. Mises is not being arbitrary in stressing monopoly and competitive\nprices rather than a special type of *monopolistic competitive\" price. This is\na result of trenchant criticisms of the monopolistic competition analysis.\nMises also discusses cases of incomplete monopoly, duopoly, oligopoly,\ncartels, price discrimination, and monopsony, and furnishes new insights on\nall of these problems.\n\nb. Schuller contends that Mises! theory of business cycles assumes full em-\nployment at the beginning of the interventionary credit expansion, and \"is not\nconcerned with the effectiveness of the same policy under large-scale unem-\nployment.\" This charge is completely false; Mises specifically deals with this\nproblem on pages 576-78. He there demonstrates that his business cycle\ntheory is fully applicable to conditions of large-scale unemployment of factors\nof production.\n\nc. Mises does not have to explain how systems other than the pure market\nhave managed to survive historically. Merely to survive, regardless of the\nlevel of existence, does not require more than the rudiments of the free market,\nmore than a little white in the gray picture. Whatever economic success other\nsystems have had was due to those elements of the market that were per-\nmitted to exist.\n\nd. It is difficult to understand what Schuller means here. Mises does not\noffer any \"stagnation\" thesis. If Schuller means empirical illustration of the\nunfortunate consequences of government intervention, such evidences abound.\nOne has only to point to the condition of present-day England, or observe the\nvarious \"dollar gaps\" to mention just some of the countless possible illus-\ntrations.\n\ne. Here is a point which especially seems to worry Schuller\u2014the contrast\nbetween man's economic rationality on the market, and his irrationality in\nthe political sphere. Mises is not contradicting himself here, but asserting an\nimportant truth about human behavior. It is a truth that is not difficult to\nexplain. When an individual chooses purchases on the market, either as con-\nsumer or as entrepreneur, he has certain definite guides for selection. The\nconsumer knows the prices of the various goods, and he can test the quality by\nselection. If he buys what is labelled *breakfast cereal\" and it turns out to be\na package of hay, he knows it soon enough, and that firm soon finds itself\nout of business. The consumer is in a position to arrange a set of preferences\naccording to his tastes, to evaluate the products open to him. But, in the\npolitical sphere, the reverse is true. The consequences of different sets of\npolitical measures can only be understood by the ability to grasp complex\nchains of abstract praxeological reasoning. The vast majority of the voting\npublic do not have this ability. There is no empirical test that will demon-\nstrate one type of governmental measure valid as opposed to another type.\nConsequently, the voter turns to whichever political leaders state their case\n",

Coming later,\nhe is in a position to refine the structure as well as to add new developments\nof his own.\n\n4. There is no conflict between an historical and a praxeological statement\nwhen Mises says that the gold standard is an historical fact and that this\nstandard was responsible for increasing welfare, liberty, etc. ^Money\" is a\npraxeological category, arising when the market chooses a commodity to\nserve as a general medium of exchange. Such choice of a money leads to\nenormous economic benefits, as is demonstrated by praxeology. Furthermore,\ngovernmental interference with the functioning of this money leads to conse-\nquences, according to Mises, universally recognized as undesirable. This, too,\nis a praxeological statement. But that the commodity gold happened to be\nchosen by the market is in the category of an historical fact.\n\n5. Schuller's next criticism is a dual one, with one part contradicting the\nother. He asserts (1) that Mises fails *to bridge\" the dualism between\na priori praxeology and a fosteriori history, and (2) that Mises succeeds in\nso doing for the free market but not for other types of markets. Schuller\nmaintains that in order to forge this bridge, Mises would have to furnish\n*positive theorems covering all types of historical situations\" and \"instruc-\ntions for determining when the conditions of a particular situation coincide\nwith those assumed by a particular theorem.\" Such stipulations are absurd,\nand can never be fulfilled by any theorist. It is precisely the task of the\nhistorian to attempt to explain historical situations by the use of praxeological\ntheorems, to uncover their complex interactions in the actual historical situa-\ntion. But even at best, such historical work is tentative and inexact, relying\nto a large extent on judgments of relevance and emphasis by the historian.\nIt is vain to search for magic formulas to provide simple explanations for all\nhistorical events, and the knowledge that such attempts are vain accounts for\nMises' \"failure\" to provide the *bridge.\"\n\nSchuller's contention that Mises confines his praxeological theories to the\nfree market alone is clearly erroneous. Mises first develops the praxeological\nlaws of the free, or unhampered, market. He then analyzes the effects of each\ndifferent type of government intervention in the market. Part Six is wholly\ndevoted to this analysis. In Part Five he analyzes the consequences of a totally\nsocialist economy, where the free market in factors of production is abolished.\n\nSo Mises, far from giving us a \"single standard . . . the color white alone,\"\nanalyzes all the different types of situations, white, black and all shades of\ngray.\n\nWhen Mises, on page 854, implies, in Schuller's terminology, an unilinear\nrelationship between departures from the free market and departures in con-\nsequences, he is not simply making an offhand assumption. He is summarizing\nthe results of the analysis of Parts Five and Six, an analysis which Schuller\nseems to ignore completely. His standard does not become normative. As an\neconomist, Mises is value-free. But, if the demonstrated results of intervention\nand socialism are such as to lead to consequences which everyone will con-\n",

                    "Mises \"Human Action\": Comment\n\nIn the June, 1950, issue of this Review, Mr. G. J. Schuller, in his review\nof Ludwig von Mises! Human Action, makes various criticisms of the book\nwhich deserve reply.\n\n1. Schuller claims that Mises asserts a *law of social development whereby\nthe majority in the long run . . . chooses the system which provides the\nhigher standards of living.\" Mises makes no such absurd claim. What he does\nsay is that the majority of a people choose that form of government which\nthey believe will provide them with highest standards of living. This is\nsimply saying that all exercise of power rests on the consent to obey by most\nof the inhabitants.\n\n2. Schuller maintains that Mises \"provides no clear test of incorrect versus\ncorrect praxeological reasoning. '\" The tests are, on the contrary, clear\nenough. Praxeology consists of two main elements: (1) the fundamental\naxioms, and (2) the propositions successively deduced from these axioms.\nNeither the axioms nor the deduced propositions can be \"tested\" or verified\nby appeal to historical fact. However, although the axioms are a Priori to\nhistory, they are a posteriori to the universal observations of the logical\nstructure of the human mind and human action. The axioms are therefore open\nto the test of observation in the sense that, once postulated, they are univer-\nsally recognized as true. Such recognition may be accused of being \"intro-\nspective,\" but it is nonetheless scientific, since it is an introspection that can\ncommand the agreement of all. The deductive propositions are tested accord-\ning to the universally accepted laws of logic. (Laws, incidentally, which are\nalso a priori to historical fact.) The fact that a proposition comes at the end\nof a \"long chain of deduction\" makes it no less valid than a proposition at\nthe end of a short chain.\n\n3. It is curious that an economist who is convinced of the truth of economics\nShould be accused of *uncompromising dogmatism.\" An attitude of frank\nconviction is a refreshing change from the timidity and apolegetics that are\nall too frequent among economists.

It has been realized that the magnitude of de-\npreciation charges is a major determinant in the distribution of income.\nFundamentally, the larger are depreciation allowances the larger the\nproportion of the national product which will be absorbed by business\nenterprises before any '\"'distribution\" of income takes place. For one\nthing, the higher are depreciation charges, other things remaining un-\nchanged, the lower must be ''profits\"; hence the lower will be profits\ntaxes. And a corporation whose official profit figures are low may also\nbe better able to resist trade unions, stockholders and others who might\ncovet the corporate gain.\n\nA not uncommon defense against charges by labor and consumer\ngroups that corporate profits have been unconscionably high has been\nthe argument that depreciation allowances are too low and hence\nprofits are overstated. This argument, in perhaps unsophisticated\nfashion, declares that the cost of replacing expiring equipment in to-\nday's inflated market is actually much greater than current depreciation\ncharges, which are related to original cost of assets.\n\nThere are various levels at which those who are so inclined may care to\nmeet this argument. For one thing, they may raise the effect of tech-\nnological advance and increases in productive efficiency. It may be quite\npossible, in spite of inflated prices, to replace old assets with new ones\nwhose dollar cost per unit of productive capacity or output is less than\nthat of the cheaper but less efficient assets being replaced. Secondly,\nsome question may be posed as to the basic relevance of replacement\nrequirements to the consideration of depreciation allowances.

The Problem\n\nIt has been argued that, when manufacturing is conducted with\nfacilities designed by modern engineering techniques, the least cost\npoint of a plant is located either at or near capacity output. By capacity\nis meant the greatest physical output possible in some relatively short\nperiod of time, such as an hour or a normal work day. The argument\ncontinues that, when modern engineers are successful, the short-run\nmarginal cost curve for a product always lies below the average cost\ncurve at all levels of operation short of capacity. The result is that the\nmarginal cost curve cannot intersect the marginal revenue curve (1) if\nthe average revenue curve is horizontal, or (2) if the average revenue\ncurve is high and relatively elastic.! The foregoing thesis has been at-\ntacked from many quarters.?\n\nThe validity of much price analysis hinges upon the shape of the\naverage cost curve, to which are related both the location of the least\ncost point and the shape of the marginal cost curve. To discover the\nshape of the average cost curves for actual companies is an exceedingly\ndifficult task. Even if the shape of the curves could be ascertained, the\nexisting controversy would continue. The reasoning of marginal price\ntheory is valid if businessmen believe curves to be shaped as theorists\nassume, even though the curves are actually shaped as opponents con-\ntend; conversely, orthodox price theory is not valid if businessmen\nbelieve curves to be shaped so that their least cost points are at or near\ncapacity, even though the curves really have the shape which conven-\ntional theorists maintain. Hence, marginal price theory stands or falls\ndepending upon what businessmen think, because their short-run de-\ncisions to expand or to contract are based upon what they believe\nrather than upon what is actually true.\n\nThe easiest way to discover what businessmen think is to ask them.\n\n* Wilford J.

Under existing law there is\npressure on any corporation with excess profits tax liability to obtain\nadditional capital in order to increase its excess profits credit and\nthereby reduce or eliminate income subject to the 30 per cent excess\nprofits tax. Such additions may be made either through equity or debt\nfinancing; and depending upon the cost of obtaining additional capital\nas shown by the contractual interest rate or equity capital cost rate,\nnet tax saving is possible over a significant range of these rates even if\nno return is obtained by the use of these funds. Decisions to increase\ninvested capital thus may be made in part or entirely because of tax\nconsiderations. This bias introduced by our tax system extends farther\nto affect the form that such financing will take. Corporate income tax\nlaws have long encouraged debt as compared with equity financing, and\nthis unneutrality is continued under the additional impact of excess\nprofits taxation. This paper will consider the extent of the pressure for\ncapital additions which is induced by tax considerations as. well as the\nbasis for the use of borrowed funds rather than equity capital for such\nexpansion. Some of the technical aspects of the law affecting corporate\nborrowing are interpreted in order to determine the manner in which\ntax savings can arise and also the extent of such savings.\n\nThe most practical possibility of making an actual tax profit is in\nthose cases where capital additions result in a reduction of both the\ncorporate income tax and the excess profits tax. This is possible where\nborrowed funds qualify as invested capital additions, and this also ex-\nplains the advantage of debt over equity financing. The interest ex-\npense of borrowing is used to reduce income subject to both the cor-\nporate income and excess profits tax, while with equity financing the\ndividend payments which may be necessary to attract additional capi-\ntal are not allowed as a deduction. For this reason, allowances for bor-\nrowed capital and the derivation of tax saving under existing law are\ngiven special emphasis in this paper.\n\n* The author is economist, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

The main feature of the\naccord, as soon became apparent, was that the Federal Reserve would permit\nsome rise in the yield of government securities, short-term and long-term, if\nnecessary, as part of a restrictive monetary policy to help prevent inflation.\nOn April 9, 1951 a Subcommittee of the Congressional Joint Committee on\nthe Economic Report was established, under the chairmanship of Congressman\nWright Patman, to investigate the government's monetary and debt-manage-\nment policy. A similar subcommittee, with Senator Douglas as chairman, had\ncovered much of the same ground under different circumstances in 1949.?\n\nThe volumes under review constitute the materials prepared for and by the\nPatman Subcommittee and consist of three parts:\n\n1. Replies to questionnaires addressed by the Subcommittee to the Secre-\ntary of the Treasury, the chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, the Council of Economic Advisers, the presidents of the\nFederal Reserve Banks, State bank supervisors, a number of other government\nagencies and selected economists, bankers, life insurance executives and gov-\nernment securities dealers (1900 pages, of which about one-third is from the\nTreasury and the Board of Governors).\n\n2. The record of the oral hearings before the Subcommittee, at which Sec-\nretary Snyder, chairman Martin of the Board of Governors, chairman Keyser-\nling of the Council of Economic Advisers and forty-two other witnesses testified\n(1000 pages, of which about one-fourth is from the first three witnesses\nnamed).\n\n3. The report of the majority of the Subcommittee, Congressmen Patman\nand Bolling and Senator Flanders (with some reservations) and a minority\nreport of Senator Douglas, with Congressman Wolcott concurring (80 pages).\n\nA study of this kind can be appraised at two levels\u2014first, its contribution\nto policy and action and second, its contribution to thought and knowledge.\n\n* The author is associate director of research for the Committee for Economic Develop-\nment.

It\ndeals, like most contributions to this subject, with the problems of defining\nthe wel\u00edare of a society and of ordering the various possible states of a society\naccording to their *desirability\" under that definition. As usual, also, the most\nobstreperous difficulties arise in the attempt to translate a set of taste-\nstructures of individuals into a \"taste-structure\" of the society as a whole.\nThe famous question of the interpersonal comparability of utilities is only\none of these difficulties. But Arrow differs from most of the other approaches\nto this problem area by the use of a set of considerably more powerful and\ngeneral concepts. For example, he follows the lead of Bergson in considering\nunder the caption of welfare not only the attitudes of individuals toward their\nown actual and possible possessions, but also their attitudes toward many\nother happiness-determining aspects of the world, such as the possessions of\n\n?

By this action, Adams quite rightly observes, the District Court\nhas placed Alcoa on a five-year probation during which the latter will un-\ndoubtedly follow the policy so effectively employed by other monopolistic\ncompanies in the past of \"live and let live,\" of *avoiding any aggressive or\nexpansionary\" activity which might give the government a basis on which to\npress for dissolution, divorcement, or divestment in 1955.

This would mean that efforts to promote\nthe flow of public and private capital from develoyed to underdeveloped areas\n(which in turn implies a tendency to more nearly balance the relativity of\nfactor distribution in underdeveloped and developed economies) would not be\nconducive to expanding world trade. In other words, if world trade thrives on\nunequal factor distribution, measures tending to balance such distribution\nwould tend to diminish and discourage trade. This would in turn imply that\nthere would be a tendency for an international economic policy of promoting\nthe outflow of capital from developed economies to impede or interfere with\nan international economic policy of expanding international trade. I see no\ntendency in this direction. The fact, for example, that Canada's trade with the\nUnited States over the past two decades has been expanding in both directions\nin real terms at the same time that Canada's pattern of factor distribution has\nbeen coming closer to that of the United States, indicates empirically that\nthere is considerably more involved in determining trade pattern and volume\nthan the relative distribution of the basic factors of production.\nCuanLEs Worr, Jn.*\n* The author is presently employed with the Technical Cooperation Administration of\n\nthe Department of State.

Triangular clearance follows.\nIt should, however, be noted that there is nothing in this model which warrants\nthe inference that the clearance will be complete, 2.e., that the trade surplus\nand deficit of each country with its respective trading partners will balance\nout. Even in this simplest case, and given the complementary inequalities in\nfactor distribution among the economies concerned which the model assumes,\nbalance-of-payments difficulties may exist, and multilateral clearance may be\nimpaired. It is difficult to see how a theory of multilateral trade which ignores\nsuch questions as supply and demand elasticities, commercial and foreign ex-\nchange policies, and the important relationships between these considerations\nand the multilateral clearance of trade accounts can pretend to be \"general.\"\n\n3. Hansson's formulation also seems to assume technological stasis. Con-\nsider further the simple model referred to above, which Hansson subsequently\nmodifies (pp. 64, 65, 67) to admit into the system additional trading partners\nwith different relative supplies of the basic factors. What will happen if each\nof the economies comes to have the same or more nearly similar relative sup-\nplies of the basic factors? Hansson's reasoning would suggest that they will be\nless likely to trade because the \"pulling force\" in the system will be attenuated.\n\nI would suggest they may still trade, and they may still trade the same kinds\nof goods. What were originally labor-intensive goods (e.g., rubber) under the\ntechnological conditions prevailing when the system took the form referred to\nin (2) above, may\u2014assuming favorable climatic conditions\u2014be produced by\n,economy A under more advanced technological conditions with relatively\nmore capital and less labor. Similarly, what were land-intensive goods under\nthe original technological conditions, e.g., grains and wool, may under more\nadvanced technological conditions be produced by economy B using more\ncapital and less land. This would be the case, for example, where construction\nof large irrigation facilities (capital) permits the cultivation of several crops\nfrom the same land where formerly only one crop was raised, thereby *'econo-\nmizing\" land. With changing technology, the over-all pattern of factor distri-\nbution may become more nearly alike and yet specialized production and\ntrade may still continue and grow.\n\n4. An important element left out of Hansson's \"general\" theory is the in-\ncome aspect of trade determination. The possible dampening effects on trade\nfrom a more equal distribution of factors may be more than offset by the\nhigher income levels which accompany the attainment of the new pattern of\nfactor distribution. This would generally result in a net growth in trade even\nthough the relative scarcity or abundance of different factors were to become\nmore nearly alike in the developing and the more developed economies. It\nhas, for example, occasionally been suggested that the recent textile slump in\nLancashire has been partly due to reduced Indian imports because of in-\ncreased textile production arising from higher investment in textile equipment\nwithin India. But consider what a 1 per cent rise in Indian money income\nwould do to expand textile demand bot for Indian production and Lancashire\nimports.\n\nIf one accepts Hansson's thesis, then the inference would be warranted that\n",

                    "A General Theory of the System of Multilateral Trade: A Comment\n\nIn his interesting article, K. E. Hansson! presents a useful addition to trade\ntheory. Developing Ohlin's work further, Hansson's paper is helpful in relat-\ning conceptually the structure of production\u2014conceived in terms of the rela-\ntive abundance or scarcity of different factors of production\u2014in different\ngroups of economies, to the anticipated and actual pattern of trade between\nthese groups of economies over different periods in their development. The\npaper thus sheds light on the way in which complementary patterns of factor\ndistribution facilitate the multilateral clearance of international accounts.\n\nWhile recognizing the importance of his paper, I nevertheless believe Hans-\nson has erred on several significant points of omission and emphasis:\n\n1. Hansson begins his \"general theory\" with the broad statement that *in-\nternational trade takes place in response to the unequal distribution of the\nfactors of production\" (p.61). This is, obviously, a relevant generalization but,\nat least in its present form, misleading. Adam Smith attributed the flow of\ntrade to the gains from international specialization and division of labor. This\nneed not\u2014though it \u00bbay\u2014conflict with Hansson's generalization. Consider,\nfor example, the economic development of that group of underdeveloped\neconomies referred to by Hansson as \"The Tropics\" (p. 59). As their economic\ndevelopment proceeds, the structural relationship between the factors of pro-\nduction\u2014measured in terms of machinery per worker or per square kilometer,\nwhich are the indexes suggested by Hansson\u2014may be expected to move in\nthe direction prevailing in the more developed economies; in other words, the\nsupply of capital in the Tropics may be expected to increase relative to the\nsupply of land and labor. Does this mean that the stimulus to trade between\nthe Tropics and the more developed areas will diminish because capital in the\nTropics comes into relatively moderate\" or *ample\" supply, and hence there\nis less inequality in factor distribution? Hansson's initial generalization would\nappear to imply that a more equal distribution of factors of production will\nrestrict trade. Presumably an exactly equal relative distribution of factors of\nproduction would eliminate trade entirely among the economies concerned.\nThis conclusion would appear to be inescapable if trade is presumed to depend\nsolely on inequality of factor distribution. I submit that this is unacceptable.\nEven with a similar productive structure in terms of a similar relative abun-\ndance or scarcity of the same basic factors, it will still be profitable for the\nfactors to be concentrated on the production of some commodities in one\ncountry, others in a second country, and for surpluses to be traded. The classi-\ncal arguments on the gains from international division of labor are obvious\nand familiar and need not be elaborated. However, they represent a separate\nstimulus to trade which is lacking in Hansson's schema.\n\n2. In Hansson's simplest case (pp. 61 and 63), capital-intensive goods are\nbought by economy A, which is short of capital but rich in labor, from\neconomy C which is short of land and rich in capital; economy B, which is\nrich in land but short of labor, buys labor-intensive goods from A; and\n\n* K, E.

                    "And we cannot have a policy designed to prevent such winning of competition\nthat does not throttle the very thing the policy pretends to promote. This\ndilemma calls for a fresh approach to the antitrust problem. Two things may\nbe said in that connection. First, the failure of a dominant producer to use his\npower to destroy his competitors is not, as Adams seems to suggest, a meaning-\nless subterfuge designed to mollify the courts. Self-restraint is precisely what\nwe expect the antitrust laws, and indeed all laws, to elicit. It does not follow\nthat simply because an assailant is big and powerful his actions are therefore\nmalicious. Perhaps what is needed is not to bring the assailant to trial, but to\nredefine our concepts of assault and competition in a way more nearly con-\nsistent with the necessary and inevitable structure of modern industry and\nsociety.\n\nThe second point that may be made in connection with the dilemma we face\nin trying to prevent someone's winning competition without destroying that\nwhich is a precondition to competition and which makes competition desirable,\nis that the Sherman Act should be replaced by a system of laws that recog-\nnizes the technological inevitability of monopoly and oligopoly in modern in-\ndustry. It becomes increasingly more evident that the Sherman Act, with its\nimplied suggestion of dissolution, divorcement, and divestiture, rigorously\napplied can destroy what is most precious about the system it naively tries to\nsafeguard and preserve. The morality of the Sherman Act is anachronistic. We\nneed to make a fresh start in our thinking about big business, competition, and\nbusiness ethics and the kind of public policy we should have in connection with\nthem. A profitable beginning might explore the wisdom and possibility of\ntreating our */Big Three's\" and \"Big Four's\" as new forms of modified public\nutilities, inevitable, desirable, but regulatable in a manner that preserves their\ndynamism, encourages their innovational drive, and makes them socially re-\nsponsible. A public member or two sitting in on top-level strategy and policy\nmeetings of the big producers and distributors may be able to do more by way\nof preserving and promoting enterprise, honesty, and efficiency in big business,\nand do more to preserve the kind of economy we seem to want than all the\nVictorian proscriptions of our present antitrust laws.\n\nCDlenemnene TovevermprK\n",

This, Adams vigorously contends, is bad economics,\nbad public policy, and besides is not in keeping with the Sherman Act.\n\nAll this may be true, as far as the analysis goes. But it must go further.\nWhile business leaders may not do a good job of making the point, there is\nsomething to their charge that antitrust activities of the aluminum kind tend\nto punish efficiency, size, and success. As a matter of public policy we want\nbusiness to compete, but we do not want any one producer (or any three in\na given industry?) to win the competition. We want the kind of competition\nwhich does not lead to monopoly, and we behave as if there were a benevolent\nnatural law according to which it is not in the nature of things for someone to\nwin the competition. As if to give this law a helping hand, we devise public\npolicies to discourage anyone from winning the competition and to punish any-\none who does win it. Yet at the same time we do not wish to discourage the\nenterprise, dynamism, and even scheming that make for getting competitive\nadvantage\u2014in short, for winning competition and creating monopolistic or\ntight oligopolistic situations. In a word, we wish to preserve competition but\nface the anomolous situation of punishing its most successful practitioners and\nof destroying those ingredients of competition that make competition possible\nand desirable.\n\nOne need not approve of the many iron-fist-in-velvet-glove techniques of\nbig business in order to sympathize with its problems. Because of the increasing\nautomaticity of the modern technology, because of the fantastically increased\ncapital requirements, we should therefore not be surprised or alarmed at hav-\ning more numerous three-producer, two-producer, or even one-producer indus-\ntries, Electronics and atomic energy will hasten the necessity and inevitability\nof such industries, as the electrical revolution of the 1910's and 1920's so\ngreatly helped increase industrial concentration then. The Sherman Act (as\nwell as its patchwork progeny, the Clayton Act) was a reaction to the eco-\nnomic concentration that resulted from the leviathan of shady financial man-\nipulations, immoral intrigue, and primitive aggrandizement of power. But\ntoday's concentration is the more-or-less inevitable consequence of a new and\namoral leviathan\u2014monster technology. Yet we continue to invoke the ethics of\na horse and buggy antitrust law to the situation of a hot rod industrial society.\nThe result is legalistic confusion and uncertainty and the possible eventual de-\ngeneration of the economic system.\n\nPerhaps the *go-getting\" component of the American business culture will\nsurvive antitrust attacks and provide a continuous stream of highly motivated\nbusiness leaders, but it is not inconceivable that a series of successful prosecu-\ntions over a number of years of the type attempted in the aluminum case may\nthrottle the dynamism of American capitalism, reducing competition to a sort\nof verbalistic remains of the real thing, to torpid manipulation of the symbols\nof competition in a system that is devoid of really dynamic creative activity.\n\nWe cannot have \"old fashioned\" intra-industry competition (or what\nappears for many to pass for the same thing, namely *workable competition\")\nwithout reasonably expecting somebody to win or nearly win that competition.\n",

Six annual series were made the basis of his comparison:\nrailroad operating revenue, value of total merchandise imports, pig iron\nproduction, cotton consumption, coal production (anthracite and\nbituminous), and clearings for selected cities. Eckler's findings for the\nthree most severe depressions are given in Table I.\n\nThough the series included in his study are representative of impor-\ntant sectors of the economy, the results lack force due simply to the\n\nTABLE I.\u2014EckrER DATA ON THE SEVERITY OF DEPRESSIONS\n\nAverage Percentage Rank in\n\nDecline* | Severity\n1873-1878 33 2\n1920-1921 32 3\n1929-1932 56 1\n\n* These percentages are necessarily approximate, since they are taken from the histogram\nappearing o. cit., p. 77.\n\n*' The author is a teaching fellow in economics at Harvard University.

As befits its im-\nportance, the problem of growth has been attacked from a number of vantage\npoints, theoretical as well as empirical. A number of macroeconomic models,\nof varying degrees of abstraction and complexity, have been suggested. Some\nare concerned with alternative paths along which income may grow, the specific\npath taken being determined by the particular set of assumptions regarding the\nbehavior of consumption and investment.! Others are concerned with economic\ngrowth as a sine qua non of continuing economic stability.

Instead they are reverting to an earlier and more funda-\nmental aspect of a maximum position: namely, that from the top of a\nhill, whether or not it is locally flat, all movements are downward.\n\"Therefore, the real import of marginalism is embodied in the following\ntype of statement: for any produced units of output, extra revenues ex-\nceed extra costs; but for any further producible units, extra revenue\nwould fall short of extra costs. These marginal inequalities\u2014which need\nnot apply to small local movements alone\u2014do, in well-behaved cases\nwith smooth slopes, imply the usual marginal equalities. But they are\nmore general, in that from them we can derive most of what is po-\ntentially useful in marginal analysis, a point which has been missed by\nboth the defenders and attackers of \"marginalism.\" And more than\nthat, the marginal inequalities can apply to cases (like simple compara-\ntive advantage) where the marginal equalities fail.\n\nIn recent years economists have begun to hear about a new type of\ntheory called linear programming. Developed by such mathematicians\nas G. B. Dantzig, J. v. Neumann, A. W. Tucker, and G. W. Brown, and\nby such economists as R. Dorfman, T. C. Koopmans, W. Leontief, and\nothers, this field admirably illustrates the failure of marginal equaliza-\ntion as a rule for defining equilibrium. A number of books and articles on\nthis subject are beginning to appear.

            "found": "In connection with the discussion of the Rearmament Program it has\nbeen suggested that a certain flexibility be introduced into the structure\nof our import tariff. The reasons advanced in favor of such a policy are\neasy to understand. Under the pressure of a large-scale rearmament\neffort of considerable duration, the production of many marketable\ncommodities is bound to be reduced for a number of years whereas the\npurchasing power of considerable groups of the population is likely to\nbe increased perceptibly. Hence it is a tempting idea to lower or to\neliminate the duties on certain commodities until such time as expanded\nproduction could again catch up with the demand. Impending reduc-\ntions in standards of consumption could then be alleviated; a desirable\noutlet could be found for enhanced purchasing power and the size of\na dangerous \"inflationary gap\" could thus be reduced.\n\nThere are, of course, a number of questions which deserve careful\nconsideration in order to arrive at a reasonable appreciation of the\neffects which can be expected to result from the introduction of such a\nflexible tariff. Since an over-all tariff reduction can hardly be contem-\nplated, the questions arise as to how to proceed in selecting the com-\nmodities the importation of which could be promoted through tempo-\nrary relaxation of existing duties? And how to assess the effects of the\nreductions (a) upon the volume of imports; (b) upon the prices of the\ncommodities whose protection against foreign competition would be\nreduced? (c) upon the economic conditions of the countries which\nwould be the sources of increased exports? Any final judgments upon\nthe deflationary effects of tariff reductions would depend upon the an-\nswers to these questions.\n\nFrom the outset it appears advisable to emphasize the specific mean-\ning which attaches to the term \"flexible.\" A flexible tariff structure means\na system of import duties which can be adjusted to changing conditions.\nHence in order to give more or less precise answers to the questions\nraised, it is necessary to make certain assumptions as to the conditions\nwhich are likely to prevail during the execution of the Rearmament\nProgram.\n\n* When this paper was prepared, the author was on the staff of the Tariff Commission,\nWashington, D.C.

The net stimulating effect could not\nbe negative, but it might be considerably enhanced by making the benefits\nunder the scheme contingent on the izcrease in spending rather than on the spe-\ncific purpose. 'To demonstrate such an increase is patently difficult since there is\nno way of telling what the firm would have spent without the funds. However, an\noperational rule surmounting this difficulty might be to assume that any decrease\nin the funds not matched by an increase in liquid balances is rima facie evi-\ndence that there has been an incremental expenditure.\n\n3. Finally, should the provision have a time limit for the use of the funds or\nshould the balances be allowed to accumulate for as long as prosperous condi-\ntions exist, even though that be twenty or twenty-five years?

It would seem, furthermore,\nthat with certain modifications, the program could be so devised as to be even\nmore effective as a stabilizing device without making it any more cumber-\nsome administratively.

                    "past trend of increasing tax rates, businessmen would probably be pessimistic\nabout the wisdom of substituting future for present rates.\n\nOther factors that may discourage the use of this provision by Swedish firms\nwould seem to include the administrative red tape inevitably accompanying\na measure of this type, and the disinclination of businessmen to anticipate a\ndepression\u2014an attitude which may have been accentuated by many years of\nprolonged prosperity. On the other hand, they would seem to have much\nto gain and little or nothing to lose by taking advantage of it. Deviations from\ngovernment instructions with regard to use and/or timing of the funds are,\nin effect, not penalized. The tax liability incurred in case of violation is im-\nmediately offset by the possibility of writing off the asset created by the use\nof the funds if these are used to purchase inventory or equipment; in other\nwords, the cancellation of the pre-expenditure deduction is immediately offset\nby the creation of an equal post-expenditure deduction when the funds are\ninvested. In the meantime the firm has had the use of the larger funds at low\ninterest, as indicated above. It would therefore seem that firms have every\nincentive to utilize the provision but little or no compelling incentive to\ncomply with the government in the disposal of the funds.\n\nIt is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the above incentives and dis-\nincentives from data available concerning the size of Swedish investment funds,\nsince no comparable data on corporate profits are at hand. At the end of 1950\n(the latest year for which we have information), the funds totalled 214\nmillion kronor, of which 80 per cent was in the category to be spent on plant.\nOnly 33 million kronor were earmarked for equipment, 8 million for inventory,\nand 2 million for mining development. The emphasis on construction purposes\nis partly explained by the fact that other investments are subject to immediate\ndepreciation and therefore carry with them their own tax reduction possi-\nbilities without resort to the provisions for investment funds.\n\nIf there is no substantial increase of the funds in coming years, their impor-\ntance to cyclical policy would in all likelihood not be very great: compared\nto the value of the Swedish gross national product in 1950 they amounted to\napproximately 0.7 per cent. Today this would be comparable to a fund of\n$2-2.5 billion in the United States.\n\nThe question raised by this survey so far is whether incentives such as\nthose offered in the Swedish provisions are really sufficient to bring about the\ndesired change in the business spending pattern. Certainly if actual long-run\ntax deductions were offered, this would provide a stronger incentive for busi-\nness firms to use the provisions according to government plans. This could be\naccomplished by not eliminating depreciation privileges on the assets financed\nby the funds.\n\n2. Another question which comes to mind in considering the Swedish pro-\nvision is whether it is advisable to restrict the use of the funds to specific\npurposes such as here the financing of construction, equipment, inventory,\nor mining projects. In the first place, various other spending outlets of similar\npriming effect may be imagined; moreover, the usefulness of a separation be-\ntween the purposes mentioned is not immediately clear. An artificial rechan-\nneling of business intentions may result in uneconomic use of resources. True,\nsince no real penalty appears to attach to action taken without government\n",

The first and most important question is whether this arrangement\nactually will change business investment patterns over the cycle. What incen-\ntives does the scheme offer to make businessmen stabilize their investments?\nIt should be noted that over the long run, from the profit and loss viewpoint,\nthere is no significant tax reduction offered under the Swedish provision, since\ninvestments financed from the funds are not subject to such subsequent depre-\nciation as would otherwise have been allowed. The investment funds simply\noffer the alternative of a pre-expenditure rather than a post-expenditure de-\nduction, with the difference, however, that the firm has somewhat greater\nfreedom in timing pre-expenditure than post-expenditure deductions, particu-\nlarly in the case of plant. The provision consequently serves, in some ways, the\nfunctions of the carry-forward and carry-back provisions of American tax\nlaws; such provisions do not exist in Sweden. The resemblance to carry-for-\nward and carry-back provisions is not complete, however, since the Swedish\nfunds set aside in prosperous and spent in depressed years are augmented by\nthe contributions from the firm in addition to the taxes which are shifted.\nFurthermore, under a carry-forward and carry-back provision there is no in-\ncentive for a firm receiving a tax rebate to use this money in ways which\nstimulate the economy, which is the essence of the Swedish provision.\n\nThere is an incentive in the form of an interest advantage, since the taxes\ntemporarily waived by the government and invested by the firms are in the\nnature of an interest-free loan if the funds are subsequently used with the\napproval.of the government. Even if they are not so used, the investment\nfunds may be profitable since it is likely that they can be invested at a higher\nrate of return than the rate imputed by the government when taxes are ulti-\nmately levied (2 or 3 per cent respectively).\n\nUnder the Swedish scheme, deferred taxes are levied at the current tax rate\nin the event the firm uses the funds without government approval or has no\nopportunity to use them with such approval within the ten (or fifteen)-year\ntime limit. This would appear to inject an element of uncertainty, the effects\nof which would most likely be discouraging. If tax rates are anticipated to\nfluctuate with the cycle, this would, it is true, be an incentive, but given the\n",

The eventual disposal of the funds for stimulating purposes is partly\nunder the control of the government, which can specify the year or years\nwhen the funds should be used (on a permissive or mandatory basis). The\ngovernment through the Labor Commission, which is the administrative agency\nsupervising the investeringsfonder, may also specify which of the four funds,\ncategorized by purpose, are to be released, and whether all or only specific\nfirms or industries may utilize their funds. Furthermore, the Labor Commission\nmay in special cases permit funds set aside for one purpose to be used for\nanother. In short, the government has a wide latitude in determining when,\nwhere and how the funds should be used. ?\n\n5. The tax exemption on these funds is ultimately realized only if the funds\nare used with the approval of the government. If a firm decides to cash any\npart of its funds without government approval, the total amount withdrawn is\nsubject to taxation at the rate current during the year in which the fund is used,\nand the taxable value of the withdrawn portion of the fund is increased by a\n3 per cent interest compounded from the year in which the funds were set\naside. If the government decrees that during a certain period the use of the\nfunds is compulsory, and a firm does not spend the money as directed, any part\nof the fund not properly used plus a 3 per cent compounded increment becomes\nsubject to taxation at the current rate.\n\n6. Similarly, funds which have not been released by the government are\nliable for taxation after ten years (or a maximum of 15 years if extended by\nthe government). In this case the taxable value of the funds is compounded at\n2 per cent.\n\n7. If a firm uses its funds, with the approval of the government, to procure\nplant or equipment, it is 20\u00a3 permitted to charge depreciation on these assets\nfor purposes of reducing its taxable income in that year or in subsequent years.\nIf a firm supplements its investeringsfonder with funds from other sources, it\ncan carry the asset on its balance sheet at the value represented by the amount\nof the funds it supplied.

                    "?' A theory of competitive exchange depreciation might even be said to have more validity\nthan the theory of competitive tariff increases, in the sense, at least, that tariff rates are\noften set on a piecemeal basis, whereas the exchange rate is determined by one over-all\ndecision, and is therefore more truthfully the object of rational policy making through\ndeliberate action of the government than tarif\u00eds are.\n\n?!

The Kaldor-Scitovsky argu-\nment, with such additions and qualifications as the analogy with the theory of\noligopoly may suggest, belongs in the first part. So does what may be called the\ntheory of competitive exchange depreciation which it would, of course, be\npossible to develop along the same lines.?? Discussion of a country's product\"\npolicy, in the second part, should include a consideration of the development of\nbackward countries and its repercussions, as this is essentially a large-scale\nalteration of the *products\" of the countries in question. Analysis of a country's\n\"selling\" policies, in the third part, should take up public promotional efforts\nof all kinds designed to influence the minds of men in the matter of their\nbuying activities.\n\nIt is not necessary that such a theory be based upon \"'the concept of ruthless\nand short-sighted national states bent upon exploiting one another,\"! as\nStevens believes is the case with the Kaldor-Scitovsky argument, and it is\npossible to build the theory from the standpoint of the long-run interests of\nthe country. Indeed, there is no reason why it could not explain \"consultation\nand mutual economic aid,\" which, as Stevens argues, seems to be acquiring ever-\n\nincreasing importance in the free\" world.\nXT.

This unsatisfactory state of affairs is brought home to us by the\nfact that, beginning with Edgeworth, the price, under conditions of\nbilateral monopoly, is designated as \"indeterminate\" by authoritative\neconomists (B\u00f3hm-Bawerk, Bowley, A. M. Henderson, Marshall,\nNichol, Pigou, Stackelberg, Stigler, Tintner). This indeterminateness\nis not a characteristic of the price in itself (as is conceded by some of the\naforesaid economists), but is a consequence of the inadequate theories of\nbilateral monopoly that miss their mark, ;.e., the determination of the\nfinal price resulting from the bargaining. If we accept the theory that\nthis price is indeterminate, we submit to agnosticism. But the agnostic\nattitude is sometimes defended, by pointing out that the problem is not\neconomic, but one that belongs in the realm of psychology. However,\nthis argument cannot be accepted, because one of the tasks of economics\nis to elucidate the relation between the price and the psychological\nfactors (the latter being known as data). Neither is it allowable to neglect\nthe problem with the argument that the element of power plays a de-\ncisive r\u00f3le at the bargaining table; as will be shown below: power (as far\nas it is of an economic nature), can be analyzed by economic theory.\nThe present state of the theory is all the more unsatisfactory because\nwage determination under trade unions, being a case of bilateral monop-\noly, is also left in the dark. Thus, this agnosticism would mean bank-\nruptcy of the theory of wages.\n\nIn the meantime some rather isolated attempts have been made to\ntackle the problem. Dismissing such solutions as that by Cournot,! who\nsupposes that one of the bargainers dictates the price and the other re-\nacts by quantity manipulations, we must start out from an active atti-\ntude of both bargainers with respect to the price.

Not only is Duncan's procedure inadequate in cases involving an inelastic G-curve,\nbut, even though the E-curves be shifted in such a way as to give the same terms of\ntrade when either method is followed, the magnitudes of the imports and exports involved\nwill depend on the method employed.\n\n? When the change in trade is an increase, we may restate Marshall's conclusions in\nterms of the relative magnitudes of movements. Viner uses this terminology, and Graham\nsuggests that Marshall shoud have done so, at least in speaking of the terms of trade.\nHowever, G's exports decrease when G's curve is inelastic; thus, E's imports show less\nchange from their original total and are greater the more elastic is E's curve.\n",
                    "an equi-proportional shift for Viner is an iso-elastic shift with respect to rice;\nfor Marshall, it is an iso-elastic shift with respect to quantity. Although it\nhas not been so stated in the literature, an iso-elastic shift of some kind is\nthe significant kind of movement, for we wish to determine the effects of a\nshift of a curve of given elasticity.\n\nSince Marshall's procedure involves an increase of E's exports for a given\nquantity of G's exports, which constitutes a fall in the relative price of E's\ncommodities, Duncan states that Viner, in wishing to restate Marshall's\nproposition, should have shifted his E-curve vertically downward instead of\nhorizontally to the right.? Now, so far as just the export ratio of the two\ncountries is concerned (or the import-export ratio of either country), an\nincrease in E's demand could be represented by maintaining E's exports and\nreducing G's exports, or by holding G's exports constant and increasing E's\nexports. The latter method is Marshall's. Duncan, who is attempting to re-\nstate Marshall's solution with a Viner-type diagram, inexplicably uses the\nformer method. His version of Viner's figure is correct on that basis, but by\nassuming that E's exports remain constant while the terms of trade vary, it is\nnot possible to analyze the Marshallian problem involving an inelastic G-\ncurve.^ If Marshall's approach is used, \u00a3.e., increasing E's exports and\nmaintaining constant E's imports, by moving the increasing E-curves along a\nrectangular hyperbola, it can be seen that some of Marshall's stated con-\nclusions do not obtain for E when the G-curve is inelastic.

With the elastic G curve,\nan increase in E's demand causes E's exports and imports to be greater and\nher terms of trade to be worse the more elastic the E-curve; and, with a\ngiven increase in E's demand, the more elastic the G-curve the greater is Gs\ntrade and the worse her terms\u2014which are Marshall's conclusions.

Marshall's rule was criticized in some respects\nby Graham,? who later was supported by Viner;? but Duncan,* among others,\npointed out that Marshall was correct on his own definition of \"increased\ndemand,\" which was not identical with that of Graham and Viner. In dis-\ntinguishing the Marshall type of shift of the reciprocal demand schedules\nfrom the Graham-Viner type, two points will be discussed below: (1) Viner,\nfollowing Marshall and Graham, assumed that the various reciprocal demand\nschedules of countries E and G were elastic, and largely in order to include\ncases of inelastic demand in the Marshallian problem, it is desirable to alter\nDuncan's correction of Viner's exposition; (2) Viner's type of diagram differs\nsomewhat from that of Marshall, and we shall translate the argument of\nViner into a straight-line version of the Marshallian curves.\n",

                    "Reply\n\nMy differences with Professor Fellner may be focussed on a single issue of\ncentral importance. Fellner maintains, in both his Tables I and II, that upward\ncross-elasticities must be zero between any two firms in atomistic competition\n(pure or differentiated) ; and he holds, similarly, that positive upward cross-\nelasticities necessarily imply oligopolistic interdependence. It is my view that\ncross-elasticities (upward and downward) may be positive, and indeed very\nlarge, without implying oligopoly. Specifically, cross-elasticities will be high\nbetween any two members of a large-number group when the products of the\nrival firms are sufficiently near the homogeneity pole. Fellner's conclusion\n(usually without the upward-downward distinction) has been the instinctively\nplausible one to many people.* Hence it is all the more important to emphasize\nthe grounds for my different view. I do so by means of a numerical example.\n\nImagine 1,000,001 suppliers of physically comparable but very, very slightly\ndifferentiated products. Assume that the firms are all charging equal prices and\nselling equal quantities. Assume, furthermore, that if the ith firm's price is\nraised very slightly (with all other prices constant), all but a negligible frac-\ntion of the business lost by that firm is transferred, in equal amounts, to the\n1,000,000 other firms in the group. This means that the change in g; will be\n(approximately) 1,000,000 times the opposite change in any other group\nmember's g;\u2014in both absolute and percentage terms. For example, if 5; is\nincreased so that g; declines by 1 per cent, each q; will increase by (approxi-\nmately) .000,001 per cent. This is the negligible impact of one atomistically\ncompetitive firm on its fellows. I propose to show that it does not necessarily\nimply a \"zero\" or negligibly \"small\" cross-elasticity.\n\nSuppose, now, that the ith firm's own elasticity E;; (up or down) is\n\u20141,000,000,000. To reduce g; by 1 per cent, 5; need be raised by only\nabout .000,000,001 per cent. Hence the cross-elasticity Ej; is approximately\n1,000, since the .000,001 per cent increase of g; is 1,000 times the initiating\npercentage increase of 5;.\n\nNow I beg the reader who sits in judgment to contemplate: (1) this very\nlarge number of firms; (2) this enormous own elasticity, implying a remark-\nably close approach to product homogeneity; and (3) this very high cross-\nelasticity! Is this situation oligopolistic or not? If it is not, let us be rid once\nand for all of the tempting but quite erroneous preconception that high cross-\n\n* Still another example of this view comes from R. L. Hall and C. J.

Defending a position taken earlier by Chamberlin,\nhe maintains that \"while cross-elasticity may be infinite in the undifferentiated large group,\nit falls to zero with the least differentiation\" (p. 902, n. 4). It falls to zero, say Fellner,\nbecause \"in the event of the least differentiation the sales-increment of the price-reducing\nfirm can be made smaller than azy finite magnitude provided that the price reduction\nbecomes small enough.\" This remarkable argument implies that every finite derivative and\nelasticity is zero. My opening numerical example provides my own positive demonstration\nof nonzero and high cross-elasticities in the \"large group . . . with the least differentiation.\"\n\n?*In the second paragraph of n. 4, p. 902, Fellner implies agreement with this view; but\nhe fails to recognize that it undermines his central thesis as to the uniquely zero upward\ncross-elasticity in pure competition.\n\nAlthough Chamberlin now seems to be with me for the most part on these questions,\nour agreement is still not complete. His limiting process (1) on p. 915 implies that there\nis a limiting value of the expression given there when \"the number of sellers and *own'\nelasticities\" are \"infinite.\" This is the same meaningless concept for which I am criticizing\nFellner.\n",
                    "A fundamental logical trouble that has a\u00edflicted cross-elasticity pronounce-\nments from the very beginning is that two kinds of limit are involved: (1) if\nown elasticities are constant and finite (because the product is not strictly\nhomogeneous), a steady increase in the number of firms in the group does\nimply a steady decrease of cross-elasticities toward zero as a limit (never\nactually reached) ; and (2) if the number of firms is constant, an approach to\nproduct homogeneity implies a steady increase in cross-elasticities toward\ninfinity as a limit. Fellner's mistake, as I see it, is in supposing that the\nnumber-of-firms limit (which cannot be reached) must be dominant over the\nproduct-homogeneity limit (which can). If bot of these limiting processes are\noperating simultaneously, no one can say iz general how the cross-elasticities\nwill behave. But cross-elasticities may assuredly be either high or low no\nmatter how many firms there are in the group. It all depends on the number\nof firms relative to the degree of product homogeneity (as reflected specifically\nin the own elasticities).\n\nIn the context of Table II, Fellner relaxes his requirement that there must\nbe an \"infinite number\" of firms for atomistic competition; but now he insists\nthat cross-elasticities must be based on *'ad /oc selected finite price changes.\"\nHe also specifies the treatment of *subjectively unnoticed ('negligible') quan-\ntities as zeros.\" When products are homogeneous (absolutely or practically)\nand firms are many as in my opening example, a negligible increase of 5i\nhas a negligible effect on g;.

Clearly, this is not\njust a matter of \"point\" versus \"arc\" elasticities; for my own example was\nstated in terms of a finite price increase, and the \"incremental\" cross-elasti-\ncities turned out to be very high.

                    "There is a world of difference between such microscopic, passive reactions\nand oligopolistic interdependence. The typical oligopolistic reaction to a price\ncut is not just passive, but retaliatory. That is, it is designed to discourage such\nprice cutting in the first place, even at the immediate cost of the retaliator's\nhurting himself even as he seeks to discipline the aggressor. Oligopolistic col-\nlusion, explicit or tacit, accordingly implies a reluctance to make certain\naggressive moves solely because of an expected or feared reaction from one or\nmore rivals. Hence an oligopolistic *equilibrium\" typically implies that the\nfirms are at positions significantly different from those that would be implied\nif the firms were to make their business decisions on an assumption of negligible\nreactions from rivals.\n\nThe likelihood that collusion will be attempted\u2014and if attempted, success-\nful\u2014depends not only on the mere perceptibility of the effects of one firm's\nactions on another, but on the magnitude of those effects and the character\nand magnitude of the reactions. Least of all can the likelihood of oligopolistic\nbehavior be prejudged simply on grounds that the analyst chooses to use\npoint elasticities (or arc elasticities that are based on very small finite price\nchanges). I confess I am somewhat surprised to have to rebut a view that the\nprinciples of Competition Among the Few are now automatically applicable\nto \"competition among the few million\" simply because the author used point\nelasticities.\n\nI also have misgivings about Fellner's use of the concept of an \"infinite\nnumber\" of firms. Some limits can be reached (e.g., an absolutely homogene-\nous product). Others cannot (e.g., an \"infinite number\" of firms). \"Infinity,\"\nin this context, is not a number\" but simply an implication that there is no\nfinite limit. In Fellner's Table I, point cross-elasticities (upward and down-\nward) are infinite when identical products are supplied by any finite number\nof firms. But he also believes that, with an \"infinite number\" of firms, the\nupward cross-elasticities will be uniquely zero. Now if this is to mean anything\nat all, it must mean that the upward cross-elasticities apfroach zero as the\nnumber of firms grows indefinitely large. But this they do not do, on the\ntestimony of Fellner's own Table I. With strictly- homogeneous products, the\nleap from infinite to zero cross-elasticity takes place only in a never-never\nland of *infinite numbers\" of firms. Hence it is not consistent with the basic\nprinciples of taking a limit.\"\n\nProvided that there is a very large number of producers of a homogeneous product, I\nalso think that either the Cournot model or the Bertrand model is quite acceptable (again\ncf. Fellner's n. 12). These two models then give approximately the same results, They give\nsignificantly different results, and are both unacceptable, only when the number of firms is\nsmall. In other words, neither Cournot nor Bertrand had a satisfactory theory of oligopoly;\nbut they both did have satisfactory theories of competition.\n\n\"In the foregoing paragraph I have willingly repressed my own misgivings about the\ndeterminacy of cross-elasticities when there are three or more suppliers of absolutely\nhomogeneous products (of. cit., pp. 793-94). I am willing to follow the convention that\nFellner seems to accept\u2014namely, that any change in q, will affect oppositely, to at least\nsome extent, every other q; in the group. Then the cross-elasticities within the homo-\ngeneous-product group are all infinite no matter what the number of firms\u2014just as the\ncross-elasticities approach infinity when product homogeneity is merely approached, for\nany given number of firms.\n",

My reason for that choice is that the analogy to the number\nof firms in a well-defined, symmetrical group is intuitively meaningful. On the other hand,\nbecause a *numbers equivalent\" is applicable *even when there is no distinct grouping of\nfirms\" (^Elasticities, Cross-Elasticities, and Market Relationships,\" Am. Econ.

Chamberlin, pp. 913-14).\n\n* Naturally, the demand relevant for a firm's price-output decision is not, in general, a\nceteris paribus demand; but it is an essential condition of atomistic competition (pure or\ndifferentiated) that the other-prices-constant demand be a very close approximation of the\nrelevant demand. For example, if all the members of a purely competitive group have fixed\nsupplies, the relevant demand facing the ;th firm has an elasticity equal to z times the\nindustry-demand elasticity, where z; is the ratio of industry quantity to the ith firm's\nquantity (cf. op. cit., p. 795, esp. n. 26). With variable supplies (upward-sloping marginal\nCosts), the relevant elasticity is even higher; for a given increase of q., lowering price very\nslightly, will then reduce all the q;'s microscopically, and so cause price to fall even less\nthan in the case of fixed supplies (05. cit., p. 797, n. 28).\n\nAlthough \"negligible\" and \"imperceptible\" are often used loosely as synonyms, I feel\nthat it is neither necessary nor desirable to make atomistic behavior depend on the myopia\nor the \"limited sensitivity\" of the firms, as Fellner would have it (p. 904, esp. n. 12). In\nmy view, the mere \"awareness\" of very small effects is not likely to give rise to oligopolistic\nbehavior; and it is this presumption as to behavior, it seems to me, that is the proper focus\nof market classification.\n",

We merely try to predict the\noutcome of that \"behavior\" test by means of such \"structure\" tests as the\nnumber of firms.* If \"numbers\" are sufficiently large, we infer (empirically)\nthat any relevant change of business decision by firm ; will have, at most, a\n\"negligible\" impact on j; and we then conclude (empirically) that j's reaction,\nif any, will also be negligible.\" It is not necessary that either the initial effect\nor the reaction be literally *imperceptible,\" but only that the interfirm re-\npercussions be negligible even if perceived.\n\nFor example, a purely competitive firm will typically affect price ever so\nslightly if it changes its output substantially; but the situation will still be\npurely competitive, for all practical purposes, if the demand schedule relevant\nfor the firm's output decision differs only negligibly from the strictly hori-\nzontal. This does not require that the change of that firm's output will have\nliterally no effect on the outputs of the other firms, but only that the reactions\nof those other firms must not be such as to destroy the approximate hori-\nzontality of the relevant demand facing the one firm.* The main point is this:\nif the negligible impact of any one firm on its fellows gives rise to only micro-\nScopic, \"passive\" reactions, there can be no significant degree of oligopolistic\ninterdependence.

Fellner does not\nobject to either of these practices separately; but he regards their combination\nas somehow invalid.\n\nAs to my use of \"point\" rather than \"arc\" concepts, this was also the prac-\ntice of all my predecessors, including Fellner; for we all used partial derivatives\nin our elasticity and cross-elasticity notation. Point elasticities are convenient\nbecause of their lack of ambiguity. Specifically, they characterize a firm's\nsituation with respect to even the smallest conceivable price-quantity change;\nand they also reflect, approximately, the implications of small, finite changes.?\nThe underlying conception of smoothly continuous demand functions is, of\ncourse, an \"idealization\"\u2014but again one that is familiar, convenient, and often\n(though not always) a defensible approximation of discrete reality. My basic\ndisagreement with Fellner concerns his view that there is some tying clause\nin the theorist's contract that necessarily links this idealization with another\nquite different one\u2014namely, an insistence that atomistic competition cannot\nexist with anything short of an \"infinite number\" of firms.\n\nIn the context of Table I, Fellner uses point cross-elasticities but refuses to\nclassify a situation as atomistically competitive unless there is an \"infinite\nnumber\" of rival firms. He would thus classify my numerical example, above,\nas an instance of \"differentiated oligopoly.\" As long as Fellner remains within\nthe context of his Table I, a million suppliers of perfect or near-perfect substi-\ntute products are just a million oligopolists.

Several methodological questions of some subtlety are in-\nvolved here; but the main point, it seems to me, is that Fellner here confuses\nthe mere use of a convenient analytical tool (point elasticities) with an un-\njustifiably stringent empirical assumption.

Fellner maintains, in both his Tables I and II, that upward\ncross-elasticities must be zero between any two firms in atomistic competition\n(pure or differentiated) ; and he holds, similarly, that positive upward cross-\nelasticities necessarily imply oligopolistic interdependence. It is my view that\ncross-elasticities (upward and downward) may be positive, and indeed very\nlarge, without implying oligopoly. Specifically, cross-elasticities will be high\nbetween any two members of a large-number group when the products of the\nrival firms are sufficiently near the homogeneity pole. Fellner's conclusion\n(usually without the upward-downward distinction) has been the instinctively\nplausible one to many people.* Hence it is all the more important to emphasize\nthe grounds for my different view. I do so by means of a numerical example.\n\nImagine 1,000,001 suppliers of physically comparable but very, very slightly\ndifferentiated products. Assume that the firms are all charging equal prices and\nselling equal quantities. Assume, furthermore, that if the ith firm's price is\nraised very slightly (with all other prices constant), all but a negligible frac-\ntion of the business lost by that firm is transferred, in equal amounts, to the\n1,000,000 other firms in the group. This means that the change in g; will be\n(approximately) 1,000,000 times the opposite change in any other group\nmember's g;\u2014in both absolute and percentage terms. For example, if 5; is\nincreased so that g; declines by 1 per cent, each q; will increase by (approxi-\nmately) .000,001 per cent. This is the negligible impact of one atomistically\ncompetitive firm on its fellows. I propose to show that it does not necessarily\nimply a \"zero\" or negligibly \"small\" cross-elasticity.\n\nSuppose, now, that the ith firm's own elasticity E;; (up or down) is\n\u20141,000,000,000. To reduce g; by 1 per cent, 5; need be raised by only\nabout .000,000,001 per cent. Hence the cross-elasticity Ej; is approximately\n1,000, since the .000,001 per cent increase of g; is 1,000 times the initiating\npercentage increase of 5;.\n\nNow I beg the reader who sits in judgment to contemplate: (1) this very\nlarge number of firms; (2) this enormous own elasticity, implying a remark-\nably close approach to product homogeneity; and (3) this very high cross-\nelasticity! Is this situation oligopolistic or not? If it is not, let us be rid once\nand for all of the tempting but quite erroneous preconception that high cross-\n\n* Still another example of this view comes from R. L. Hall and C. J.

                    "political and journalistic heat has seemed greater than its capacity to\nfurnish the basic fuel for the American industrial economy. In the\npolicy controversies of the war and postwar years there was an apprecia-\ntion of the national importance of the bituminous coal industry, but\nthere was not always an equal recognition of its peculiar economic char-\nacteristics. The public press often attributed the operating pattern of\nthe industry to the personalities of particular individuals without much\nallowance for the physical fact that coal mining is an industry of vary-\ning seams, faults, shafts, strips and product volatility. Numerous\nactions for dealing with strikes in this industry, and indeed in others,\nwere taken; and the cry of national emergency\" whenever a stoppage\nwas threatened became a clich\u00e9 without much specific meaning.\n\nIt is the purpose of this article to develop a theory of the impact of\ndisputes on production particularly applicable to the bituminous coal\nindustry, but which may also outline some features that are of broader\nsignificance. Such a theory will not furnish a solution for national\nemergency strikes, but it may furnish guidance for determining when\nan emergency is present. In social as in medical science, it might be\nwell for diagnosis to precede surgery. Even complete success in micro-\nscopic measurement of the influence of labor disputes upon coal produc-\ntion in the eighteen years, 1933-1950, will do no more than create a\n\"small window that looketh out upon a great world.\" That window will\nhave more than one opaque pane, and some mullions badly fitted, wait-\ning for other more skillful efforts with better tools and more nearly\npure materials to present a clearer view.*\n",

He\nlived in a nation where two great problems, inflation and free trade, gave\ndirection and significance to economics. And now, 130 years after his death,\nhe is as fortunate as ever: he has been befriended by Sraffa\u2014who has been\nbefriended by Dobb.\n\nKeynes told us, in 1933, that Sraf\u00edfa, *from whom nothing is hid,\" would\ngive us the full works of Ricardo within the year.?

This\nis desirable as well as inevitable: it would be high tragedy if Ricardo had\nbeen forced to wait more than a century before revealing his ideas. Moreover,\nthere is little point in the conventional \"estimates\" of past economists. One\ncan indeed debate the desirability of the influence Ricardo exerted on eco-\nnomics, but his vast influence is undeniable and the debate serves no clear\npurpose beyond exciting his heirs and intellectual assignees. I doubt whether\ndead professors should be graded\u2014 but for those who must have grades, I\nthink Ricardo's policy recommendations were profoundly good but his theory\nwas not of the highest quality.?\n\nBe that as it may, I shall restrict my comments to three subjects: the\nquality of the edition; Mill's influence on Ricardo; and Ricardo and Malthus\non Say's Law.\n\n* The author is professor of economics at Columbia University.\n\n!

From this he concluded that **. . .\nthe phenomenon of growth places on shaky ground those who would argue that\ndepreciation allowances are insufficient to meet replacement requirements.\"?\nEisner is literally correct in this conclusion, but it appears that he meant by\n\"those who would argue\" the many businessmen and accountants who contend\nthat depreciation allowances are too low, for at the start of his paper he stated\nthat their argument *'. . . declares that the cost of replacing expiring equipment\n[thereafter referred to in his paper as replacement requirements] in today's\ninflated market is actually much greater than current depreciation charges,\nwhich are related to original cost of assets.\"* The inference is that the business-\nmen and accountants who contend that depreciation allowances are too low\nmay be wrong under their own measurement criteria.\n\nBefore examining the validity of this inference, it is advisable to note the\nfollowing concepts: (1) The calculation of depreciation involves the establish-\nment of both a cost basis and an allocation basis. (2) Conventional accounting\npractice is the straight-line allocation of historical cost. (3) Eisner used the\nterm \"replacement requirements\" to mean the allocation of replacement cost\nto the year of retirement.\n\nEisner was mistaken in his impression that the critics of conventional ac-\ncounting practice advocate replacement requirements for the measurement of\ndepreciation. Although some popular discussions of the subject do use the word\n\"replacement\" rather loosely, to my knowledge use of replacement require-\nments has not been advocated for calculating depreciation. Indeed, a survey\nof the literature reveals that all that has been advocated and discussed is a\nchange in the cost basis, i.e., the substitution for historical cost of either re-\nplacement cost or current purchasing power of historical cost.* Under either of\n\n!

To illustrate this,\nassume a 25 per cent rate of discount and a receipts function of\n\nC, \u2014 50 \u2014 30(1 4 .015)*7\n\nin which case the asset has a useful life of 24 years and a cost of $51.13. The\nstraight-line depreciation is $2.13, and the economic life depreciation rises and\nfalls in the interval between $2.00 and $2.50 during the first nineteen years\nand then falls to zero.\n\nIn conclusion, if economic life is a valid measure of depreciation and if the\nassumptions of the third case are, in fact, a reasonable basis for predicting the\nbehavior of an asset's receipts, then straight-line allocation is superior to pro-\nductive capacity as a measure of depreciation. However, if the fall in an asset's\nreceipts parallels the fall in its productive capacity, the superiority of straight-\nline allocation does not hold as the values of the parameters become relatively\nlarge.\n\nFinally, there has been considerable dissatisfaction on the part of many\nbusinessmen, economists, and accountants with the two principal accounting\nconventions\u2014historical cost and straight-line allocation. It is hoped that this\ncomment may prove useful in the evaluation of the latter convention.\n\nMvnoN J.

The latter is widely\nused solely because it is simple and objective; the accounting profession ra-\ntionalizes the practice with the view that depreciation is *. . . a process of\nallocation, not of valuation.\" Similarly, there is no a ?riori reason why the\nmaintenance of productive capacity should result in the correct determination\nof income. Therefore, comparison of the two methods requires the establish-\nment of a standard of comparison, a third method that is theoretically valid.\n\nSuch a criterion is to be found in neoclassical theory, where an asset's in-\ncome is defined as the periodic payment in perpetuity that has a present value\nequal to the present value of the asset's expected future receipts.\" Since\ndepreciation is simply the difference between receipts and income, it follows\nthat a definition of depreciation is implicit in the above. This definition can be\nstated directly as the present value of the future receipts at the start of the\nperiod less the present value of the future receipts at the end of the period with\nthe period's actual receipts excluded from the latter quantity. Or, restated in\nthe language of accountancy, the cost (of depreciable assets) incurred in\nrealizing a period's revenue is the expiration in present value of the assets\nexpected future receipts. If this measure of depreciation, termed here the\n*economic life method,\" is accepted as valid, straight-line allocation and\nexpiration of productive capacity may be compared for accuracy by determin-\ning how closely each approximates economic life depreciation. Such a com-\nparison is made below through three illustrative cases, each of which assumes\na different path for an asset's receipts over its life.\n\nBefore going into these cases, two points should be noted: (1) The cost\nbasis of valuation is a fundamental postulate of accounting, and this postulate\nwill not be violated. Specifically, although the expected receipts at time of\npurchase will be used to determine that portion of an asset's cost to be charged\nas depreciation in each year of its life changes in expected receipts over the\nasset's life will not modify its cost or the depreciation charge.

From this he concluded that **. . .\nthe phenomenon of growth places on shaky ground those who would argue that\ndepreciation allowances are insufficient to meet replacement requirements.\"?\nEisner is literally correct in this conclusion, but it appears that he meant by\n\"those who would argue\" the many businessmen and accountants who contend\nthat depreciation allowances are too low, for at the start of his paper he stated\nthat their argument *'. . . declares that the cost of replacing expiring equipment\n[thereafter referred to in his paper as replacement requirements] in today's\ninflated market is actually much greater than current depreciation charges,\nwhich are related to original cost of assets.\"* The inference is that the business-\nmen and accountants who contend that depreciation allowances are too low\nmay be wrong under their own measurement criteria.\n\nBefore examining the validity of this inference, it is advisable to note the\nfollowing concepts: (1) The calculation of depreciation involves the establish-\nment of both a cost basis and an allocation basis. (2) Conventional accounting\npractice is the straight-line allocation of historical cost. (3) Eisner used the\nterm \"replacement requirements\" to mean the allocation of replacement cost\nto the year of retirement.\n\nEisner was mistaken in his impression that the critics of conventional ac-\ncounting practice advocate replacement requirements for the measurement of\ndepreciation.

We have seen many cases before in which there are discontinuous curves\nand in which no marginal cost-marginal revenue intersection exists. Continu-\nous curves either (a) assume continuous data, or (b) are a distortion of\nreality in the interest of explanatory clarity. The fact that economists use\nsuch curves to discuss data that is essentially discrete does not invalidate\nmarginalism; it merely means that the real world is more complicated than\nour \"ideal-type\" construct which is little more than a first approximation to\nreality.\n\n4. If it is assumed (a) that businessmen attempt to maximize a single\nmagnitude\u2014money profit\u2014-or some complex of objectives which can be\nordered on a scale and termed \"satisfactory\" profit or *net advantages,\"\n(b) that they have adequate knowledge regarding the relevant variables, and\n(c) that they act rationally, then the essentials of present-day marginalism are\nalready implied regardless of the existence or nonexistence of the superficial\nmarginal cost-marginal revenue intersection. Eiteman and Guthrie have con-\ncentrated their attack upon trivia rather than upon substance.\n\nLAWRENCE S. RiTTER*\n\n*As Bishop has pointed out, strictly speaking the marginal cost curve ends in inde-\nterminacy at capacity. Cf. Bishop, of. cit., pp. 611-12.\n\n*1f the demand curve is not sufficiently high and elastic, we get the usual intersection\nof the marginal curves. Eiteman-Guthrie imply that declining average costs are, in some\nway, incompatible with marginalism, although they never state this view explicitly. That\nsuch is not the case can easily be seen by a perusal of any standard work, such as, for\nexample, Joan Robinson, The Economics of Imperfect Competition (London 1933), in\nwhich most marginal cost-marginal revenue intersections occur during the phase of de-\nclining average costs.\n\n?'\"The definition of capacity by Eiteman-Guthrie as excluding all overtime work and\npayments is \u00e0 partial begging of the entire question. Orthodox marginalism can offer an\nexplanation of a failure to increase output and therefore can at least partially explain why\nat any one time some firms are and some are not producing beyond \"capacity.\" It is not\nthe purpose of this note, however, to disparage the usefulness of the questionnaire results,\nper se, but rather to criticize the implications the authors draw therefrom, even if the\nsurvey is taken at face value.\n\n* The author is assistant professor of economics at Michigan State College.\n"

Eiteman to assert that the results of his un-\nusually intelligent and unloaded questionnaire on the imagined shape of\naverage cost curves constitute empirical refutation of something called\n\"marginalism,\" an old enemy of his.\n\nHis results do overthrow the conventional U-shaped cost curves of con-\nventional textbooks! and conventional review articles. Amen, and so much\nthe better. But the U-shaped curves are not marginalism; they are merely\npretty pictures, just as the hourglass figure is not the human female but the\n\"foundation garment.\" We like our cost curves parabolic (i.e., U-shaped)\nbecause it is so easy for the rudimentary mathematician to derive and visualize\naverage-marginal relations from this particular shape. But marginalism as\nsuch assumes no curve types\u2014U or V or W or any other. All are grist to the\nmill. Any of Eiteman's eight curve types is just as marginal (or just as anti-\nmarginal) as any other. His error lies in treating certain curve types as\n\"supporting\" and others as \"not supporting\" the *marginalist hypothesis.\"\n(References?) Strange things result. This writer, for example, considers him-\nself a marginalist of sorts, albeit lukewarm and long-run.? Yet in classroom\npresentation, he likes to work with curves of the two types (6-7) found most\nrealistic by Eiteman\u2014and labelled *antimarginalist\"! (What, in particular, is\n\"antimarginalist\" about the U-shaped type 6?)\n\nThe issue between marginalists and averagists in cost and price theory is a\nreal one. Marginalism is not pure tautology, despite some unguarded state-\nments by overenthusiastic proponents; it is perfectly possible for businessmen\nto act in an antimarginalist manner. Whether they do so act or not depends\nnot on curve types but on whether they do (or should) base their price and\noutput policies on marginal rather than average cost considerations, wien\nmarginal and average costs diverge materially. On this topic, the researches of\nEiteman and Guthrie tell us little or nothing. And necessarily so, as a glance\n\n* Among the notable exceptions is Lorie Tarshis' Elements of Economics (Boston 1046).\nIs Tarshis an antimarginalist because he foresook the U-shaped cost curve in favor of\nsomething like a beaver's front tooth?\n\n* M.

His treatment of my handling of the interwar Jewish\nproblem in Poland is particularly objectionable because he clearly implies that\nI was at least sympathetic with the anti-Semitism of that period. I should\nlike to make it quite clear that any such implication is entirely unfounded.\nMandel charges that, in my book, Everybody, from the United States to\nHitler and Stalin, is blamed for Poland's sorry plight, except the Poles them-\nselves; but more than anybody else\u2014the Jews\" (p. 32). But on the page of\nmy book to which he refers, I listed six different sets of circumstances which\ncomplicated the handling of the basic economic problems of interwar Poland;\nand the Jewish problem, one of the six, received no particular stress as com-\npared with the other five. There is no basis whatever for the charge that I\nblamed the Jews for anything. What I did say, on page 103 (the other\nreference which Mandel gave), was:\n\nSome industries were almost completely dominated by Jews, for example,\n94.7 per cent of the textile industry and 95.6 per cent of the leather and\nfur industry. The typical economic position of the Polish Jew was that\nof the small entrepreneur, and the concentration of two-thirds of the\nJewish population within the cities presented a difficult problem in a\ncountry which had over 60 per cent of its total population engaged in\nagriculture, since the position of Jews in commerce and handicratts\nblocked the natural channels of economic expansion of the non-Jew.\n",

Unfortunately this is not all that marginal\nanalysis implies, for the theory suggests also a technique for maximizing\nprofits. It would be foolhardy to deny that businessmen desire maximum\nprofits. My argument is that the techniques they employ do not work towards\nthis goal even when their actual cost curve is U-shaped. Given a U-shaped\ncost curve and a relatively elastic average revenue curve, the most profitable\npoint of operation is admittedly that scale of operations where marginal costs\nequals marginal revenue. However, in the world of reality, businessmen are\nnot given \"cost and revenue curves,\" and if they believe that their least\ncost point is at capacity when it is not, then the equilibrium point towards\nwhich they bend their productive efforts is capacity and not the point of\nequilibrium of conventional theory.\n\n'Thirdly, one critic admits that businessmen are not guided by considera-\ntions of marginal revenue and costs but he contends that the theory, when\nproperly understood, explains business behavior nevertheless. In those cases\nin which the \"guiding principles\" of businessmen happen to lead to the same\nresult as conventional theory suggests, the explanation offered by conventional\ntheory does not conflict with facts. However, in those cases in which the\n\"guiding principles\" of businessmen lead to a different result than conven-\ntional theory, the theory does not jibe with reality nor explain managerial\nbehavior.\n\nFurthermore, it must be remembered that theory is used to predict be-\nhavior as well as to explain it. For example, the question of the probable\neffect of a state income tax was raised recently in Michigan. The corporations\nsaid, \"We will pass the tax on to the consumer in the form of higher prices\";\na well-known economist said, *an income tax cannot be shifted.\"* Without\nentering into the merits of his argument, it will be recalled that the pro-\nposition that an income tax cannot be shifted rests upon an assumption that\nthe sales price set by a manufacturer for his product is on the demand curve\n(it is the maximum price that could be charged for that quantity of the\nproduct). In theory no businessman would sell for less; in practice they do.\nIt is dangerous to attempt to predict what businessmen will do by reasoning\nfrom theories that are based upon what businessmen do not do.*\n\nIn conclusion, the objective of an economist is not to draw pretty pictures\n\n?A person wlio \"does not understand\" is obviously anyone who happens to comment\non the discrepancy between theory and the facts of life.\n\n*'fhe president of one of America's largest corporations is convinced that his firm has\nalways shifted the income tax to its customers.\n\n* Marginalists seem to obtain a great deal of comfort from the fact that businessmen\noccasionally engage in marginal type thinking. For example, a firm manufacturing 9,500,000\nproducts might weigh the cost of sufficient advertising to sell another 500,000 products\nagainst the profit to be obtained from the additional sales, before deciding upon the ad-\nvertising expenditure. However, this is something quite different from setting prices and\nproduction schedules on such considerations.\n",

The present article is intended as a further contribution in\nthis direction, but it aims at synthesis as well as innovation.\n\nThe first section restates the static theory for an economy with a\ngovernment and with foreign trade, and in order to achieve consistency\nwith the social accounting approach makes a sharp distinction between\nfirms and households. This involves a clear separation of business sav-\ning from personal saving, a good example of useful *disaggregation.\"\nSection II analyses the effects on national income of changes in gov-\nernment spending and taxation without being confined to one type of\ntax and one type of spending. It is shown that the theorem that a\nbalanced budget-increase has a multiplier of unity is a very special\ncase, Section ITI, which uses a pure Stockholm School approach, demon-\nstrates how the relationship between saving and investment ex post\nand ex ante can only be understood if, consonantly with the division\nbetween households and firms, the markets for factors and for goods\nare distinguished. It is also shown that since saving (7.e., not-spending)\nis a derived concept, analysis in terms of spending is preferable because\nof its directness.\n",

Millett, executive director. The Commission consisted of twelve members:\ncollege administrators (8), and businessmen and lawyers (4). The executive\ncommittee consisted of Messrs. P. H. Buck, F. A. Middlebush, and H. M. Wris-\nton. No economist was included, though the problems were primarily economic,\nand no nonadministrative faculty member was included.\n\nThis Commission has written an important report, for which all should be\ngrateful; and it has made available an abundance of materials which will\ngreatly lighten the tasks of researchers in this field for many years. Both the\nRockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation are to be congratulated\nfor their generous donations for the work of this Commission, which made pos-\nsible the provision of so much valuable material.\n\n\"These eleven volumes offer an opportunity to discuss the vital economic is-\nsues confronting Institutions of Higher Learning (hereafter referred to as IHL).\nAt the outset, however, we should note some peculiarities of the market for\ncollege students. First, many potential buyers\" are excluded from the market.\nStudents have to meet minimum standards (e.g., a high school diploma). Such\nrestrictions limit the number of \"buyers\" of higher education. Second, buyers\nare not usually asked to pay the full costs of an education. The effect of \"sales\"\nbelow cost is to increase numbers seeking a college education, though the net\neffect here is not so great as is commonly supposed (except in medical schools,\nwhere a tuition of about $700 per year is to be set against a cost per year of\nabout four times the tuition). For private institutions, the \"subsidies\" per year\namount to about $120 and for public institutions about $260, or an average of\nalmost $200. These sums are large in relation to educational costs (one-third\nof educational costs for private institutions, two-thirds for public), but much\nless relative to the $1,000 to $2,000 total cost in private IHL and a minimum of\n$1,000 for in-students at state IHL, plus in each instance the income foregone.\nCosts for nonresidents are less.! Education below cost is offered despite the fact\nthat a college graduate can look forward to an income of $100,000 more than\na noncollege graduate and a medical school graduate, $300,000 to $400,000\nmore.?\n\n* The author is professor of economics at Harvard University.\n\n!

                    "A Note on the Relationships of Bank Capital to the Lending Ability\nof the Commercial Banks\n\nThere has been published in recent months a spate of articles, pamphlets\nand monographs which have discussed the problems of bank capital.!' Most of\nthese take note of the very low ratio of capital accounts to assets or deposit\nliabilities.? In the samples which have come to my attention this is universally\nregarded as an unfavorable development from the standpoint of the longer-\nterm interests of the bankers, their customers and patrons. The authors point\nwith alarm to the fact that inadequate bank capital creates a condition inimi-\ncal to the maintenance of depositor confidence, to the ability of the banks to\nabsorb losses and still maintain their solvency\u2014and lastly, that inadequate\nbank capital curtails the ability of the banks to supply their business customers\nwith needed credit.\n\nIt is with this last \"function\" of bank capital that issue is here taken.\nJudged by the many variants of statements concerning the relationships of\nbank capital to the lending ability of the banks, the belief is apparently widely\nheld that the capital accounts constitute a source of loan-funds; that com-\nmercial banks loan out the savings of the banks' owners.\n\nSuch statements are common and are to be expected in the trade journals,\nbut when they appear in the more scholarly publications, or are authored by\nprofessional economists, they should not be allowed to go unchallenged. Four\nsuch statements have been selected for examination here.?\n\nIntroduction to Economics (New York, McGraw-Hill, 1930), Ch. 1x. Index numbers of\nthe elements of the equation of exchange for the United States for the period 1919-1947,\nquarterly and annually, are given in a paper, \"Index Numbers of the Elements of the\nEquation of Exchange,\" presented by the writer at a joint meeting of the Econometric\nSociety and the American Statistical Association, December 28, 1948 (available in mimeo-\ngraphed form; abstract published in Econometrica, Apr. 1949, XVII, 176).\n\n! The terms capital and capital accounts are used synonymously. As so used they include\nthe aggregate of capital stock, surplus, undivided profits and all net worth reserves.\n\n? Bank capital as a percentage of total liabilities has declined, with minor reversals of the\ntrend, for the past seventy-five years; from a percentage of approximately 35 in 1875 to\nabout 7 as of the present time. The series is characterized by a number of sharp declines\nin the capital ratios with connected plateaus of relative stability. In the 1880's, for example\nthe level was about 30 per cent as compared with about 20 per cent during the 1900-1910\nperiod, and about 12 per cent in the 1920's. In the course of World War II, the ratio fell\ndecisively below the 10 per cent level, traditionally regarded as a minimum for safety.\nSince the end of the war the capital ratios have tended upward, largely due to an expan-\nsion of bank capital accounts. This in turn is almost entirely attributable to retention of\nearnings.\n\n* The Increased Dependence of Business on the Commercial Banks, Bull.

Davidson, in an article\non \"Valutaproblemets teoretiska inneb\u00f3rd\" (Theoretical Implications of Problems Relating\nto the Value of Money), Ekon. Tids., 1920, xxii, 83 ff. It referred to the progressive acquisi-\ntion of wealth by the debtor class or enterpreneurs from creditors and rentiers that occurs\nin an inflationary period as a result of the decline in purchasing power of money.

Because\nthese preconditions were not even approximately realized during his lifetime,\nWicksell found it necessary to agitate for political reforms to make them pos-\nsible, and to support progressive income and property taxes. Although the\nlatter were not a perfect answer to his quest for justice in taxation, they tended\nat least to remove the worst injustices perpetrated under the tax systems of\nhis day. Those systems relied almost exclusively on indirect taxes enacted by\nparliamentarian majorities representing mainly the propertied classes because,\nuntil the close of World War I, the franchise was generally denied to the prop-\nertyless.\n\nWicksell's advocacy of the *confiscation principle\" of taxation to obtain the\ndesired revision of the distribution of wealth, was mainly intended (a) to elimi-\nnate all forms of rent from the category of private income and (b) to make\nrestitution for and prevent the recurrence of the \"capitalistic bolshevism\"^\nthat affects the distribution of wealth when the value of money is undergoing\nsubstantial change, especially during periods of inflation.\n\nTo the extent possible, Wicksell wanted to eliminate rent from private in-\ncome by taxation, because income of this type can presumably be taken from\nindividuals by the state without impairing their production incentives and\nwithout reducing the output of goods and services. Then the state in turn\nought to use the corresponding revenues for a secondary distribution of social\nreal income to all citizens in the form of an increasing variety and quantity\nof useful public or social services, especially in the fields of education and\npublic health, for expansion of these services would provide greater equality\nof opportunity for all citizens, and they would also contribute both directly and\nindirectly to an increase in general productivity.\n\nIn order to reinforce the foregoing long-run aim by appropriate short-run\naction, Wicksell held that the pervasive changes in the distribution of wealth\nwhich are a byproduct of significant changes in the value of money should, so\nfar as possible, be prevented.

He ascribes Eastern's\nprofitability to its *policy of offering a high volume of frequently scheduled\nservice.\"!5 There is nothing inconsistent with frequent service and low load\nfactors, but can Koontz mean that most lines are profitable because of high\nload factors, and Eastern is profitable because of low load factors?\n\nKoontz concludes that there is a high degree of correlation between large\nairlines and service in large markets, defined as the top 97 pairs of stations,\nin rank order of traffic generation. Such a conclusion would appear tautological,\nthe same statistical unit, volume traffic, accounting for both large carriers and\nlarge traffic centers. It is, however, not inconceivable that the profitability of\nthe large carriers serving large markets is due, to the extent that it is related\nto the size of the markets served at all, to the service of few small markets\nrather than many large. Koontz offers no direct evidence at this point.\n\n\"There is, at any rate, still further room for question of his hypothesis: The\nimportance of having the high traffic density pairs of cities on a carrier's routes\ncannot be overestimated. Heavy travel brings favorable load factors, particu-\nlarly where aircraft can be scheduled nonstop between the high traffic generat-\ning pairs of cities.\"!* The exceptions to this proposition, as he indicates,\" are\nTWA, National, and Western, which carriers served the so-called productive\nmarkets but did not get their *prorated share\" as calculated in Table VI.!*\nThat failure to get the *prorated share\" is ascribed to equipment shortages,!?\nor in other words, a shortage on the supply side.

If output, measured in revenue ton miles, changes, one would\nexpect an alert management to be able to change its costs in the same direc-\ntion, although, of course, not necessarily proportionately. Thus if traffic de-\nclines, management, at least within the limits imposed by the indivisibility of\nthe productive unit, the aircraft, should succeed in making some cost reduc-\ntions; and likewise, above the minimum size, one would expect management to\nhave to increase its costs somewhat when traffic rises. On heavily travelled\nroutes the qualification of indivisibility may become unimportant.\n\nA leading trade paper, American Aviation, publishes monthly data on air\nline traffic and expenses, taken from reports of the carriers filed currently with\nthe Civil Aeronautics Board. During the period of relative price stability be-\ntween January 1947 and the outbreak of the Korean War, carriers! cost figures\ncan be used without the clear-cut necessity of a deflator, so that simple corre-\nlations of total operating expenses, in unadjusted dollars, and total revenue\nton miles can be made for individual carriers. As just indicated, one would\nexpect the well-managed carrier to show a positive relation between changes\nin revenue traffic and changes in total cost. For the period for which I have\nscrutinized the data, January 1947 to May 1950, twenty-nine observations or\ntwenty-eight intermonthly periods, tightly managed and profitable Eastern\nhad such a positive relation 20 times, and negative only 8. United had 17\npositive relations and 11 negative. TWA, least profitable of the large carriers,\nhad a positive only 13 times, and negative 15 times. Thus it was more often\nthan not the experience for TWA, at least during those 29 months, to spend\nmore when traffic declined and to cut expenditures when traffic rose. I think it\ncan be said that differences of this magnitude in managements' responses to\nchanged conditions may well be sufficient to account for the differences in\nprofitability, at least as between the particular carriers mentioned. That dif-\nference in profitability had been substantial.\n\nKoontz then suggests that load factor is the most important factor in finan-\ncial self-sufficiency, and that high load factors may be obtained by serving\nmajor markets.'* This may be another way of saying the aircraft in conven-\ntional use are too large for the market they serve at the existing price level.\nBut let us examine a moment the first proposition: that high load factors mean\nprofitability. Koontz' Table V, showing, for 1949 and 1950 for each trunk\ncarrier, actual load factor and net operating income adjusted by his method,\nthat is, by charging passenger fares to the mail load, is the basis for his asser-\ntion that improved load factors are the solution. He points out that most lines\ncould have operated profitably, even after mail pay adjustment, if they had\nhad the load factor of American, United, or TWA, about 58 per cent in 1949\nand a few points higher in 1950. But he ignores his figures which indicate that\nEastern operated profitably on a 46 per cent load factor in 1949; and 53 per\ncent in 1950. For 1949, the lines with higher load factors than Eastern's, but\nnevertheless with losses after mail pay adjustment, represent nine of the twelve\nother trunk carriers, though in 1950 only two were clearly inconsistent with\nhis position.

Koontz,\nhowever, regards 1949 as more normal than 1950,* even though most economic\ntime series show a dip for the earlier year. It is this evidence of poor financial\nperformance\u2014that is, what would have been poor financial performance if\npassenger fares had been paid for the carriage of mail\u2014that leads Koontz to\nsearch out its causes (other than his own assumptions) and make his policy\nrecommendations.\n\nThere follows a section in which Koontz demonstrates that there are not\nsubstantial differences in the average cost per available ton mile of the sixteen\ncarriers.? Available ton miles represent total transport capacity, some of which\nwill be utilized, and some left to perish through underutilization. Presumably,\nhowever, air line management is producing revenue transportation rather than\npotential transportation, so that a more relevant calculation might have been\naverage cost per revenue ton mile. But because the average cost per available\nton mile does not show great variations between carriers, Koontz concludes\nthat economies of scale are absent, although he points out later that it is\nvariations in the load factor!? which essentially account for the less favorable\nearnings in the commercial market of the smaller carriers.!* This implies that\nperhaps a smaller proportion of seats are occupied on the smaller lines, which\nstill further implies that possibly the unit is too large. I submit that the match-\ning of the size of the productive unit, in this case the plane, to the size of the\nmarket, is one of the problems generally comprehended among those of econo-\nmies of scale. It is also true, and the industry has shown considerable concern\nthereon, that no small modern aircraft, suitable to lightly trafficked routes, are\navailable from American manufacturers. Smaller air lines thus are largely\nforced to employ units larger than can be filled by their traffic. But no amount\nof corporate merger will solve the technical problem of providing small, fast,\nand cheap aircraft for thinly trafficked routes.\n\nKoontz then turns to variations in the effectiveness of management as a\npossible explanation for the variations of profits between carriers. He explains\nthe profitability of Eastern and American as resulting, in part, from the offer-\ning of a high volume of frequently scheduled service.'? If the profits of these\ntwo carriers are due to the size of their output, this hardly seems consistent\nwith his statement on the preceding page: When only the nine largest carriers\nare considered, evidence of any economies of scale virtually disappears.\"!*\n\nKoontz indicates that although there are wide differences in managerial\neffectiveness, such differences are insufficient to explain the differences in\nprofitability. While that may sometimes be true, there may be other cases in\nwhich differences in managerial ability are important.

The passenger\nservice is sold in a mass market, in which, although there is often but one\nseller of the air line service, there is a broad group of buyers who choose air\nservice as only one of several competing means of transport. In such a market,\nconventional pricing concepts are applicable. Mail, however, is transported\nunder conditions approaching those of bilateral monopoly, with a single buyer\nof the service, the Post Office, and often a single seller, the air line serving the\npair of cities involved. Nor is there even any relation between the postage\nrates which Congress establishes for the Post Office to charge the users of the\nair mail service and the rates which the Civil Aeronautics Board establishes\nfor the Post Office to pay for the carriage of its mail. The price elasticity of\ndemand for the carriage of air mail may well be zero. It is hard for me to see\nwhy passenger rates, an average of coach and first-class fares in continually\nvariable proportions, even assuming that existing passenger fares represent\noptimum pricing in the various passenger markets being served, should some-\nhow represent a norm for mail rates, which would appear to be a completely\ndifferent market. In a bilateral monopoly situation, such as the relation be-\ntween the Post Office and the air lines, there will be no market price in the\nusual sense, and price will be determined by bargaining.

Jasny's\nmeasurement of Soviet social accounts in terms of United States dollar prices\nof 1926-27, about which I had expressed certain misgivings, is not as heavily\nrelied upon by the author as I had mistakenly assumed. It is, in fact, confined\nto his evaluation of the total ou\u00a3puts of various economic sectors, such as in-\ndustry (broken down into consumers' and producers! goods), agriculture, and\nconstruction, and to an appraisal of investment outlay and its chief com-\nponents. In each case a parallel valuation in terms of Soviet prices of 1926-27\nis given, and the final structure of national income, as it emerges from Jasny's\ncalculations, is entirely based on these prices.\n\nSerious as this error may be, it does not, I think, materially affect the valid-\nity or relevance of my observations concerning the danger of using *esoteric\"\nprice structures in Soviet national income analysis. While Soviet prices of\n1926-27? are not of course esoteric to the postwar Soviet economy in a spatial\nsense, they still suffer from a remoteness in time which is greatly aggravated\nby the intervening process of industrialization.

Even yet there is con-\nfusion, induced partly by careless reading and exposition of the indif-\nference curve analysis and partly by misunderstandings of the purposes\nand implications of utility measurement. This paper attempts to\nclarify the r\u00f3le and meaning of the recent revival of measurement of\nutility in economic theory and of the meaning of certain concepts and\noperations commonly used in utility theory.\n\nMeasurement in its broadest sense is the assignment of numbers to\nentities. The process of measurement has three aspects which should\nbe distinguished at the outset. First is the purpose of measurement,\nsecond is the process by which one measures something, z.e., assigns\nnumerical values to some aspect of an entity, and the third is the\narbitrariness, or uniqueness, of the set of numerical values inherent\nin the purpose and process. In the first part of this paper we briefly\nexplore the idea of arbitrariness or uniqueness of numbers assigned by\na measurement process. In Part II we state some purposes of utility\nmeasurement. In Part III we examine a method of measuring utility,\nthe purpose of the measurement and the extent to which the measure-\nment is unique.

Since neither has seen the final draft they must be\nrelieved of responsibility for remaining errors and ambiguities.\n\n''The explanation assumes no mathematical background and is on an elementary level.\nThis paper is not original in any of its ideas, nor is it a general review of utility and\ndemand theory.

Ta-Chung\nand Ching-Gwan Chang argue that the price level should be introduced into\nthe consumption and investment equations. In justification of this it is argued\nthat, though this procedure gives *about an equally good\" fit for the prewar\nperiod it gives a better fit for the three postwar years for which data are\navailable.\n\nThis argument, however, is open to the following criticism. Both the con-\nsumption equations, the one using and the other ignoring the price term,\nunderestimate the actual data for the postwar years; this is only as it should\nbe, for during this period the data were influenced by a special factor, the\npent-up war demand. In order to derive the true relationship, one would have\nto subtract this factor from the actual data, and since we do not know how\nlarge this factor is, we cannot say that the equation coming closer to the actual\ndata (in a linear way only, for there are points of inflexion in neither the\ndata nor the estimating equations for these years) gives a better indication of\nthe true relationship. This consideration is enhanced by the fact that a small\ndifference in the estimation of the pent-up demand would destroy the signifi-\ncance of the price term, for the differences between the equation using the\nprice term and the equation ignoring it are 1/10, 1/8 and 1/3 (for 1946, 1947\nand 1948 respectively) of the pent-up demand as measured by the difference\nbetween the actual data and the better fitting of the two equations. Thus the\nonly evidence to show that the equation using the price term is superior is that\nof 1948, when the pent-up demand must have been of less importance than in\nthe two preceding years. To argue from the evidence of one year is obviously\nmost tenuous. \u00c0 similar consideration throws grave doubt upon the estimated\nvalue of the price parameter, the calculated value of the price elasticity and\nalso on the introduction of a price term in the investment equation.\n\n'THoMAs Mavzn*\n* The author is an economic analyst in the office of the chief economist, Bureau of\n\nMines.

The authors\nsuggest that \"the failure of the postwar investment expenditures to come up\nto the levels estimated from the prewar investment function may perhaps be\nexplained partially by the feeling of uncertainty which existed in the minds of\nthe entrepreneurs as regards the possible course of the developments of the\nAmerican economy\" (p. 574). The hypothesis that the depressing effect of\n*uncertainty\" on investment was \"greater\" during three years of uninter-\nrupted high level prosperity (with a backlog of investment demand due to\nwartime disinvestment in many lines) than during the most depressed decade\nin U.S. history seems, at best, novel.\n",

The Investment Function\n\nThe stated rationale of the Liu-Chang investment function (I \u2014 dY -- eF\n-F i, where d, e, and i are parameters) is that income is a measure of the\n\"evel of economic activities which generate demands for capital goods,\" while\ncorporate profits after taxes \"indicate the magnitude of the incentive for\nactually making the investment at a given level of demand\" (p. 568).\n\nNote that F\u2014corporate profits after taxes\u2014is considered exogenous. This\nin itself makes prediction on the basis of the function impossible, in that\ncurrent corporate profits are obviously related to the level of current income.\nMore important (given the authors' limited aims), a high degree of colline-\narity between Y and F renders the two parameters *e\" and \"d\" virtually\nmeaningless.\n\nIt is difficult to find justification for this sort of an investment function. The\nfact that no lags are intrinsic to annual data does not make the function any\nmore useful: no meaningful hypothesis as to the behavior of the individual\ninvestor is being tested.\n\nThe dismissal of the \"so-called 'acceleration principle! \" for lack of any\nevidence (p. 568), seems somewhat rash. Presumably Liu and Chang were\n\n*T am fully cognizant of the difficulties these distinctions involve, but they are not ot\nessence in the present argument.\n\n?'

There is a good fit between C and Y, hence we\nhave \u00a3he (?) consumption function. Their defense against criticism on this\ncount is based on calculations indicating that disposable income is a good\nlinear function of gross national product and that: \"projections from the\nrelation between the two during the prewar decade yield figures for postwar\n*disposable income! extremely close to the actual figures\" (p. 570).\n\nIf the \"institutional\" relationship between Y4 and Y has not changed as\nbetween prewar and postwar, it no doubt follows that an apparent re-establish-\nment of the prewar (derived) relationship between C and Y is good evidence\nthat the behavioristic relationship between C and Y, is the same as before the\nwar. It is important to note, however, that the usefulness of the Liu-Chang\nstudy is severely limited, a fact not sufficiently emphasized by their own\narticle. Their so-called consumption function cannot be used either for pre-\ndiction or for testing hypotheses of consumer behavior. It is not invariant with\nrespect to changes in the Y vs. Y, relationship, hence variations in tax struc-\nture, transfers, corporate savings, etc., will invalidate it.\n\nThe only positive justification the authors provide for the use of VY is that\nit simplifies the system.

Had implicit expectational elements? been thus brought in\non the right-hand side, their function would have been more readily reconcil-\nable with the assumption of dynamic **money sophistication.\"\n\nIn the use of Y as a determinant of C one can also quarrel with Liu and\nChang. Unlike the use of lags, the use of Y instead of Y, is not just a simpli-\nfication. The function, as it stands, does not provide us with a testable hy-\npothesis of behavior.\n\nThere are three possible methods of approach to \"the\" consumption func-\ntion:\n\n1.

But where the two periods under consideration differ in P as much as do the\npostwar and prewar, we must be wary of such approximations.\n\n\"It could be argued that implicit in the exclusive use of current magnitudes is a pre-\nsumption that the elasticity of expectations is unity; that in fact people expect the\nparameters relevant to their decisions not to change.

Their first argument, that a function based on *money illusion\" better\nconforms to theory than one which relates real consumption to real income, is\nambiguous. What are the \"theoretical grounds\" on which we should expect\nthe absolute price level to play a part in consumption decisions? The authors\ndo not specify. If narrowly defined, the use of the term *money illusion\" would\nindicate that they are suggesting \"irrationality\"? on the part of consumers.\nYet, since the implication that a hypothesis of systematic \"irrationality\" is\nsubject to \u00a3eoretical proof is patently unacceptable, it is more likely that Liu\nand Chang are thinking in terms of \"rationality\" in a dynamic world. Either\ninelastic price expectations or '\"Pigou effects\" could induce \"rational\" be-\nhavior which would appear (to an observer with a static frame of reference)\nlike money-illusion \"irrationality.\"*\n\nBy accepting the importance of such dynamic effects, however, the authors\nundermine the logical foundations of their own function. If current prices and\nincomes are the sole variables relevant to consumption decisions, then the\nform of the consumption function cannot be governed by tacit consideration\nof other variables (expectations, nonequity assets, etc.).* If prices and in-\ncomes are really the only things that belong on the right-hand side, then it\nfollows that only \"irrational\" behavior can validate an undeflated function.\nNo empirical evidence is cited in favor of such \"irrationality\" and I, for one,\nam loath to give up the assumption of \"*rationality\" for a model based on\nsystematic \"irrationality.\"\n\nThe authors! second argument, that the indices available for deflation are\nof tenuous applicability, though correct in itself, is irrelevant. The technical\nfaults of currently used deflating procedures provide excellent reason for\ncautious interpretation of so-called \"real\" figures: they do not validate unde-\nflated figures.\n\nSuffice it to conclude:* (1) that most prewar studies suggest that deflated\n\n*'[rrational\" is a poor word for the intended concept but its analogous place in the\nvocabulary of price theory and the lack of an obvious substitute perhaps justify its use.\nNote, however, that it must be very narrowly defined as implying nonmaximizing behavior\nin terms of a specified frame of reference.

The problem is a slippery one\nthough. It is true that replacing two uncorrelated variables x and y by zx and zy will\nresult in a non-zero correlation.

It seems reasonable to suppose that the optimum rate of population\ngrowth would be higher during the earlier part of this period when the ratio\nof population to land and other resources was extremely low and the total\npopulation was well below an optimum. Further, the inflow of foreign capital\nduring the first part of this period would raise the optimum rate of growth for\nthat period.

Ta-Chung\nand Ching-Gwan Chang argue that the price level should be introduced into\nthe consumption and investment equations. In justification of this it is argued\nthat, though this procedure gives *about an equally good\" fit for the prewar\nperiod it gives a better fit for the three postwar years for which data are\navailable.\n\nThis argument, however, is open to the following criticism. Both the con-\nsumption equations, the one using and the other ignoring the price term,\nunderestimate the actual data for the postwar years; this is only as it should\nbe, for during this period the data were influenced by a special factor, the\npent-up war demand. In order to derive the true relationship, one would have\nto subtract this factor from the actual data, and since we do not know how\nlarge this factor is, we cannot say that the equation coming closer to the actual\ndata (in a linear way only, for there are points of inflexion in neither the\ndata nor the estimating equations for these years) gives a better indication of\nthe true relationship. This consideration is enhanced by the fact that a small\ndifference in the estimation of the pent-up demand would destroy the signifi-\ncance of the price term, for the differences between the equation using the\nprice term and the equation ignoring it are 1/10, 1/8 and 1/3 (for 1946, 1947\nand 1948 respectively) of the pent-up demand as measured by the difference\nbetween the actual data and the better fitting of the two equations. Thus the\nonly evidence to show that the equation using the price term is superior is that\nof 1948, when the pent-up demand must have been of less importance than in\nthe two preceding years. To argue from the evidence of one year is obviously\nmost tenuous. \u00c0 similar consideration throws grave doubt upon the estimated\nvalue of the price parameter, the calculated value of the price elasticity and\nalso on the introduction of a price term in the investment equation.\n\n'THoMAs Mavzn*\n* The author is an economic analyst in the office of the chief economist, Bureau of\n\nMines.

It further\nsimplified the computation of the consumption function in the iext because the variance\nand covariance matrix of Y and C had already been computed in connection with the\nmodel in the appendix which was worked out first.\n\n??

An assumption implicit in the\noriginal paper is of course that the liquidation of *pent-up demands\" was\nsomewhat smaller than the total postwar *excesses\" in consumption, a hypoth-\nesis admittedly impossible to establish by any statistical effort at the present\ntime.\n\nIn the discussion of the consumption function in Sections I and II in Mr.\nBator's comments, he suggests that there are three possible grounds on which\nthe absolute price level might be introduced into the consumption function:\ninelastic price expectations, the *Pigou effects\" and \"irrationality\" on the part\nof the consumers. Since he believes that \"the implication that a hypothesis of\nsystematic \"irrationality' is subject to theoretical proof* is patently unaccept-\nable,\" he attributes the introduction of the price level into our equation (1) to\nthe first two factors and then proceeds to criticise the equation on this basis.\nThe \"money illusion\" implied in equation (1), however, is of the \"irrational\"\ntype.? The criticism, therefore, is not relevant.\n\nBator believes that *no meaningful hypothesis as to the behavior of the\nindividual investor is being tested\" in connection with our investment func-\ntion, equation 2, which has gross product and profits after taxes as independ-\nent variables. If profit incentive as an explanatory variable for investment \"is\nnot grounded on a micro-economic hypothesis,\" one is at a loss to find another\nthat is.? A serious omission occurred in the original paper in not having pointed\nout profits as a major source of supply of capital for investment? which would\nfurther reinforce the desirability of introducing profits as an independent\nvariable in the function. The authors may perhaps be excused for their \"*dis-\nmissal\" of the \"so-called 'acceleration principle,' \" as any statistica] attempt\nto find the \"acceleration principle\" in a rigid, quantitative form, not neces-\nsarily linear and for whatever time-unit (annual, quarterly, etc.), is a dead\nanimal unworthy of revival. On the other hand, the level of output must have\ninfluences on the demand for investment as a result of a host of reasons,? of\nwhich the \"acceleration principle\" is but one underlying consideration. It is\nof course extremely difficult to determine on a friori grounds the net result of\n\n* Equation (1) represents of course an empirical attempt to see whether \"money illusion\"\nexisted.\n\n5'The *money income illusion\" is of the \"irrational\" type, as a proportional fall in both\nincome and price will leave real income unchanged but will increase the real value of\nrnoney holdings.\n\n* Bator also criticizes our investment function on the ground that we failed to \"assign\na role to expectations (directly, or via lags, rates of change, etc., indirectly).\" One has yet\nto invent a method by which expectations can be included in a statistical function directly.\nIndirectly speaking, it is not necessarily true that expectations must be associated with\nlags or rates of change. Expectations can be formed on the basis of current values alone.\n\n? See the discussion of this point in S. C. Tsiang, \"Accelerator, Theory of the Firm and\nthe Business Cycle,\" Quart. Jour. Econ.

In connection with his argument that if exchange\nrates were set free to find their equilibrium levels and countries pursued\ninternal stabilization policies, balances of payments would be quickly\nequilibrated without great changes in the terms of trade, Haberler re-\nfers to the \"burdens\" of such adjustments. He refers to a primary bur-\nden, which arises from the fact that an import surplus provides a coun-\ntry with a net amount of goods available for domestic use in excess of\nits own production. If we use the term standard of living to refer to the\nreal amount of goods available for domestic use (including consumption,\ninvestment, and the provision of government services), the primary\nburden will be a reduction in the standard of living by an amount equal\nto the real deficit in the balance of payments.

Exchange depreciation may either worsen or improve a country's\nterms of trade. If it worsens the terms of trade, there will be a secondary\nburden in terms of reduced standard of living to be added to the primary\nburden mentioned above.

                    "Technological Change and Aggregate Demand\n\nA widely accepted opinion among contemporary economists is that rapid\ntechnological change stimulates aggregate demand. Accordingly, many have\nlooked upon the recent (apparent) acceleration in the rate of technological\nchange as a harbinger of stable full employment, or at least as an important\nbulwark against future depression. Presumably this opinion rests on either or\nboth of two assumptions: (1) that technological change increases the demand\nfor capital, or (2) that it raises the consumption function.\n\nThat rapid technological change is a favorable factor in the economic out-\nlook is a recurrent theme in the Economic Report of the President for 1954.\nThis report states, for example (p. 61): *Research and development activities\nof industry, nonprofit institutions and Government are steadily enlarging the\nopportunities for new investment.\" This argument is buttressed by a special\nappendix presenting estimates of expenditures for research and development\nin recent years. A vigorous statement of the same idea is found in an address\nby Sumner H.

However, my original presentation and\nHarris! reply deal with very complex issues with which most economists are\nnot very familiar.

But because\nall slums cannot be cleared out at once or because the problems of the aged\nand of those with subnormal incomes cannot be solved at once, it does not\nfollow that a frontal attack should not be made on the financing and organiza-\ntion of medicine. I make this point because the AMA has so often contended\nthat the road to improved health lies in better housing, higher incomes, better\nnutrition, etc.; in their view, improvements in these directions are needed,\nnot reforms in the methods of organizing and financing of medicine. I am\nafraid that Ginzberg's presentation implies an agreement with the AMA\nposition.\n\nWhat is wrong with medicine is inadequacy of resources; their maldistribu-\ntion; the inadequate mechanisms for pooling resources on an insurance prin-\nciple; the excessive weight given to payment on the fees principle, with un-\nfortunate delays in seeking help; the shortages of important personnel and\nfacilities. It is possible to channel more resources into medicine and achieve a\nbetter distribution, and probably with a resultant rise of income several times\nthe additional costs. It is no more anti-free enterprise to use the taxing power\nto cut down the consumption of tobacco and alcohol in order to increase the\nconsumption of medicine (as the British have done) than it is anti-free enter-\nprise to use the general property tax to finance the major part of a $7 billion\neducational bill. How much would we be spending on elementary and high\nschool education today if the same organized pressures had prevailed a century\nago in education as now prevail in medicine to keep down expenditures both\npublic and private?\n\nWhat every economist should know about medicine is that at our standard\nof living we ought to spend more money on medicine and ought to obtain an\nimproved distribution.

The opposition of medical societies, such as\nthe New York State Medical Society, expressed both in state legislation,\nwhich frequently makes the formation of such plans impossible, and in perse-\ncution of physician-members is in no small part the explanation of the snail's\npace at which comprehensive prepayment plans have advanced.\n\nShort of the solution of compulsory national health insurance (NHI), the\nacceptable way out is prepayment comprehensive health insurance. This is the\ncrucial conclusion of the Magnuson Committee. (The Ives-Flanders Bill in\nthe Senate, which the sponsors recently withdrew under pressure from the\nadministration, embodied provisions similar to those recommended by the\nMagnuson Committee.) But financial subsidies are needed: especially for\ninitial organizing expenses, construction of health centers, and direct subsi-\ndies to various comprehensive plans approved by the states, in order to make\npossible rates low enough for most people to join, or else subsidies to indi-\nviduals with low incomes which would make possible their participation. This\nis the approach of the Commission.\n\nComprehensive plans seem to the writer a healthy compromise between\nNHI, so effectively disposed of by the AMA for the time being, and /aissez-\nfaire in medicine. Ginzberg is critical of the Commission for suggesting an\noutlay of $750 million by the federal government (and a similar one for state\ngovernments) to expedite a comprehensive insurance program. In fact,\nthroughout his review Ginzberg seems greatly concerned over the financial\ncosts to government of all facets of medical costs. Yet may not one contend\nthat a $367 billion economy that can reduce taxes by 10 to 13 billion dollars\ncan also afford an ultimate increase of $1 billion for medicine and education?\n\nIndeed an outlay of $1.5 billion (one-half to be paid by federal govern-\nment) to stimulate the growth of comprehensive insurance may not solve all\nthe problems, as Ginzberg contends\u2014and there is need for allowing time for\nfacilities to grow. Perhaps the Commission merits criticism for urging too rapid\na development of comprehensive insurance. In an independent estimate which\nI presented to the Senate Labor Committee on April 22, 1954 in its hearings\non the Eisenhower Health Program, I proposed a governmental outlay of\n$2,150 million (shared by federal, state, and local governments), this figure\nto be reached only after ten years. Part of the costs of comprehensive insur-\nance would be met by employers and employees through social security con-\ntributions, with government subsidies of $100 for incomes below $1,000 and\ndeclining to $20 for incomes above $4,000. This would start us well on our\nway towards an adequate program. This would not wholly solve the problems\nof chronic illness, though the suggested added grants by the federal govern-\nment would help greatly. Time is essential to incubate comprehensive pro-\ngrams, for the effects of the present program would be merely to subsidize the\npresent inadequate health insurance programs, and thus freeze an unhealthy\nsituation.\n\nDifferences between the Commission and Ginzberg stem largely from\nphilosophical and ideological considerations. In general, Ginzberg is wary of\ngovernment spending, of government influence upon the spending pattern, or\nof public interference with the distribution of medical resources. When there is\n",

Despite the phenomenal rise of Blue Cross and Blue\nShield, prepayment health insurance is still a relatively small factor in Ameri-\ncan medicine: all prepayment plans provide but $1.5 billion of the more than\n$10 billion of private costs of medicine. Group practice is still in a primitive\nstate. The crucial issue is, why is this so?\n\nThe reviewer of the Magnuson report contended that group medicine has\nmade so little progress primarily not because of the opposition of medical\nsocieties and lack of finance but because American physicians are individual-\nists and do not like group practice. I am unable to accept this interpretation.\nThe medical societies ruthlessly fight prepayment programs, in part because\nthey believe that the net effect is likely to be reduced revenues for the profes-\nsion. Indeed, they support Blue Cross, in part because the net effect is to\nchannel more money into medicine; but Blue Shield insurance is restricted to\nlow or moderate income groups. In other words, the doctors are given the\nfreedom to charge what the tra\u00edfic will bear in the case of patients with\nincomes above, say, $5,000, and are given additional protection in the case of\npatients with lower incomes through insurance and a spreading practice of\ninflating charges when the insurance agency pays the bill or a major part of\nit. Indeed Ginzberg is right when he says that doctors want independence.\nBut every producer wants freedom from control by the consumer. Medicine\nis surely a unique market in that the consumer is denied any control over the\nservice and price, and doctors are allowed to organize in professional societies\nwhich, to some extent, determine pricing and service practices. Group medi-\ncine is in part an attempt to protect the consumer against one-sided control\nof the market. The spectacle of a New York physician, head of a unit of the\nHealth Insurance Plan of New York, being persecuted by the New York\nMedical Society for advertising for new members to join this plan, is distress-\ning.\n\nIt is a striking fact that comprehensive prepayment insurance covers but\n3 per cent of the population; and there are few of these plans that allow free\nentry. Why have they not made more progress? Ginzberg does not believe that\nopposition of medical societies is a decisive factor. Yet the New York Times\nand Herald Tribune each year publish vigorous attacks by the societies on\nthe famous Health Insurance Plan of New York, a comprehensive plan with\n400,000 members.'? This plan has survived so far in part because of the help\n\n71 See, for example, various statements before the Wolverton Committee, Congressional\nRecord, App., Jan. 20, 1954, pp. A368, 371. For example, in Michigan one group that\nraised its fees in order to get full coverage for surgical expenses found that one result\nwas an average charge by the surgeon of $20 more per identical service rendered than for\nmembers of another group that did not raise its fees. The surgeon seemed to increase his\ncharge merely because the insured was more nearly covered.\n\n\"* See editorials in the New York Herald Tribune, January 16, 1954 and May 16, 1954,\nand New York Times, May 15, 1954 in reply to attacks made by medical societies. \"County\nmedical societies ought not to have the power to prevent a legitimate health insurance plan\nfrom telling its story through advertisements, or from carrying on any ethical activities\"\n\n(Herald Tribune, January 16, 1954). After defending fee-splitting, the New York State\nMedical Society voted against the practice of paying salaries to doctors *and voted changes\nin the code of medical ethics aimed directly at the destruction of a vast number of voluntary\nprepayment medical care plans\" (ibid., May 16, 1954).\n",

But performance under this act depends upon appropria-\ntions; and the present administration appropriated $50 million for 1954-55.\nThe Connnission itself would add but $77 million per year to the construction\nprogram as of 1952 (Vol. I, p. 79). I can only conclude that Ginzberg's figures\nare highly inflated\u2014even if, despite a stabilization of prices since March 1951,\nwe allow for an inflation of construction costs of 5 to 10 per cent since 1949-\n50. (Actually construction costs were stabilized in 1951 and 1952 and hos-\npital construction costs in 1951 were 7 per cent in excess of those for 1948-\n50.)*\n\nI cannot leave this discussion of hospitals without commenting on another\nof Ginzberg's statements. Again, I do not find support for this generalization:\n\"Further, since the recent advances in medicine have given most persons a\ngood chance of staying out of hospitals from the time they are born until\nthey begin to undergo the decrepitude which accompanies senescence\u2014uwith\nthe possible exception of a day or two for a tonsillectomy or a week or so\nfor an appendectomy\u2014the exclusion of patients with long-term illness from a\nplan for financing health involves a major restriction. Every general hospital\nin the country is aware of the fact that it is being transformed from an insti-\ntution concerned with the treatment of acute conditions to one primarily con-\ncerned with caring for the multiple complaints of the aged\" (p. 117). In this\nconnection, note the following:\n\n1. From 1935 to 1952, there was *'a decrease in the length of patient stay\nby 32 per cent in non-federal hospitals.\"* Is this consistent with the increased\nand almost exclusive use of hospitals for chronic illness?\n\n2. In 1951, 89 per cent of total beds were in short-term hospitals and 11 per\ncent in long-term hospitals, with average length of stay being 8.3 and 114\ndays, respectively.\"\n\n3. **On the basis of diagnosis, chronic diseases account for probably 25 to\n50 per cent of the days of hospitalization of all general hospitals, 7.e., exclu-\nsive of mental and tuberculosis hospitals.\"*\n\n4. How much care for chronic long-term patients is provided by short-term\ngeneral hospitals is difficult to say. Under the Blue Cross Plan in 1948, 2.8\nper cent of the cases paid for had a stay of 30 days or longer; these cases\nentailed 16.4 per cent of the total days of care paid for by the plan.? Other\nstudies of Blue Cross suggest that chronic diseases were responsible for 28 to\n34 per cent of all hospital days.!?\n\nPerhaps my main differences with Ginzberg revolve around the problems of\n\n* Survey of Current Business and Magnuson Report, Vol. IV, p. 274.\n\n* Financing Hospital Care in the United States: Recommendations of the Commission\non Financing of Hospital Care (Chicago, Ill., 1954), p. 37.

Cf. Vol. III, p.\n98.)\n\nOn the need of new hospital beds, Ginzberg also disagrees with the Com-\nmission. He is critical of the Commission for accepting the Hill-Burton\nformula (the basis of the Federal Hospital Construction Act which provides\nfederal subsidies) for determining need of new hospital beds; and he also is\nalarmed by the costs involved in meeting the estimated deficiency of beds.\nOn the first point, note the Administration in 1953, after a careful survey of\nestimates of needs of hospital beds, supported the Hill-Burton formula.? In\nfact, hospital building under the Hill-Burton Act over several years has not\nreduced the deficiency. The original deficiency under the Hill-Burton formula\nwas 800,000 beds with existing capacity at 1 million: the President's undocu-\nmented estimate in 1954 was 600,000; the actual provision over several years\nof building under the Hill-Burton formula has been about 100,000 with clos-\ning of federal hospitals, obsolescence and growth of population more than\noffsetting this gain of 100,000. In fact, total beds were down from 1,739,000\nin 1945 to 1,530,000 in 1951, with the decline of government beds exceeding\nthe total decline.* Deficiencies are especially serious for mental and chronic\nillnesses. In the case of the latter, for example, the deficincy at the end of the\nwar was almost 3 times the current capacity; but in June 1952 the deficiency\nwas 6 times current capacity. Chronic beds accounted for more than 30 per\ncent of the total deficiency and yet accounted for but 4 per cent of the projects\n(dollar value) under the Hill-Burton Act until June 1952.\n\nGinzberg's estimates of costs of construction of hospitals seem very high.\nHe estimates the cost of the Commission program for construction of general\nhospitals at $4.5 billion, and of mental hospitals at $5 billion. But on the\nbasis of the costs of construction under the Hill-Burton program (this program\nfinanced construction beginning in 1948), I obtain the following (Vol. IV,\np. 279):\n\nMocunuu P. m.s] fF.\n",

My criticism of the Commission would be not that they\nexaggerate the shortage but that they underestimate it. It is of some relevance\nthat there were substantially fewer physicians in relation to population in\n1950 than in 1900 or 1850 and a smaller number (absolute) graduating from\nall medical schools in 1950 than in 1905. Surely the large rise of physicians'\nincomes also points to shortages of personnel.'\n\nOn the issue of subsidies to medical education as a means of increasing the\nsupply of physicians, Ginzberg is critical of the Commission for not dealing\nwith the financial problems of the Institutions of Higher Learning (IHL).\nBut as one who served on the financial panel of the Commission and also\nsummarized for the Commission the discussion of what I thought was an\nexcellent two-day seminar by leading experts on financial problems, I am sure\nthat the Commission was aware of the problems of the IHL. Thus, Dr. Ward\nDarley, dean of the medical school and vice-president of the University of\nColorado, pointed out to the Commission orally and in writing that transfers\nto medical schools from university funds had risen from 7 to 34 per cent of\nmedical school income over a period of eight years. \"This is creating serious\nfinancial problems for many universities\" (Vol. IV, p. 94). Ginzberg also\ncontends that there are inadequate applicants for medical schools, in part\nbecause the peak of veterans! enrollment has been reached. But he surely\nmust be aware that in 1954 we reach the minimum of numbers in the college-\nage group and by 1960 there will be 20 per cent additional population of\ncollege age, and by 1970 about 70 per cent additional. Responsible estimates\nput IHL enrollment at 3 to 4 million by 1970 as against 2 million currently.?\n\nGinzberg also writes: *Nor did the Commission sense that an increasing\nnumber of deans of medical schools would be claiming in 1953 that they were\nfacing a shortage of promising applicants\" (p. 109). Aside from the relevance\nof the fact that increasing college enrollments are to be anticipated, I refer\nagain to a statement by Darley: *Most medical educators believe that if\nsufficient funds for all medical schools could be made available, continuing\nincreases in their enrollments, consistent with high quality education will\nrapidly catch up with the need. . . .\" (Vol. III, p. 98).\n\nPerhaps, as Ginzberg contends, a $100 million subsidy will not solve the\nproblem of the medical schools. But as long as it costs $3,000 per year to\neducate a medical student who pays about $500, the medical schools are going\nto find expansion most difficult. A subsidy of $1,000 per new (additional)\nstudent and $500 for existing enrollment, which was provided in a Congres-\nsional bill that came close to passage, would help greatly.

                    "What Every Economist Should Know about\nHealth and Medicine: Comment\n\nIn the March 1954 issue of the American Economic Review, Professor Eli\nGinzberg, in a review article entitled *What Every Economist Should Know\nabout Health and Medicine,\" assesses the Magnuson Report (Building\nAmerica's Health, A Report to the President by the President's Commission\non the Health Needs of the Nation, Washington, 1953). Since the Magnuson\nvolumes are undoubtedly the most important study of the financing and\norganization of medicine since the famous reports of the Committee on the\nCosts of Medical Care more than twenty years ago, it might be well to\npresent to economists another version of What Every Economist Should\nKnow about Medicine.\"\n\nLet me say at the outset that Ginzberg makes many wise and penetrating\nremarks about the economics of medicine and about the Report under discus-\nsion. As Ginzberg contends, there is little use of pumping more money into\nmedicine unless an attack on shortages of personnel, equipment, and facilities\nis also made. Otherwise the effect is likely to be inflation rather than improve-\nment of service. But this is a principle well known in Washington. Even in\nthe presentation of its program of National Health Insurance (NHI) the\nTruman administration time and again stressed the need of limiting addi-\ntional demands on services to those markets where they were equal to the\nstrain. No one conversant with recent British experience could be blind to\nthe danger of a hasty expansion of services offered not offset by an adequate\nprovision of future supplies. Nor was the Commission blind to this considera-\ntion.\n\nGinzberg raises questions concerning the shortage of personnel, an issue on\nwhich the Commission is eloquent. The application of doctor-population ratios\nin rich states to the nation necessarily reveals a shortage of physicians. This\napproach, credited to the Commission, is faulty, as Ginzberg contends.\n(Though this is not the only approach used\u2014see Vol. I, p. 13.) Ginzberg\nreally seems to believe that there is no shortage of physicians. He should\ncompare each of the following variables for 1900 and 1950: the supply of\ndoctors, the number of annual medical graduates, per capita national income,\npopulation, the demands put upon the medical profession by increasing births\nand the proportion of the aged in the population, the additional needs related\nto improved financing and organization, the requirements (present and\nprospective) set by the cold war, the scarcities of psychiatrists and the in-\ncreased need for them, the increased complexities of medicine, the maldistri-\nbution of personnel both geographically and occupationally (inclusive of an\nexcessive number of specialists relative to practitioners). Against these factors\nall pointing to additional needs (often unmet because of financial obstacles to\nseeking medical care), we can only weigh the improved quality of the doctor,\nthe greater ease of getting around, and, as the American Medical Association\nso frequently points out, improved teamwork. (Nurses complain bitterly, how-\never, of the unwillingness of physicians to allow them to assume responsibili-\nties of which they are capable.) On the issue of teamwork, it might be said\n",

The\nsupply of land may usually be taken as fixed for all time, and, so far as\nthe economist is concerned, a datum. Population changes and differences\nin the rates of change between two countries will have profound effects\non trade, but these variations are nowadays also taken to be, at least\nin some measure, independent of economic processes. But accumulation\nis a purely economic sequence, and the student of trade who neglects\nit is neglecting part of his subject. The ideal dynamic theory of trade\nwould no doubt cope with both population change and changes in the\ncapital stock simultaneously. But can it be doubted that such a theory\nwould be of a most advanced and difficult kind, and that the simpler\nstarting point is accumulation without population change?\n\nWhat follows is an attempt to construct an extremely simple dynamic\nmodel of trade between two countries which are similar and unchanging\nin all respects except their capital stocks. As a starting point we sup-\npose first that neither has any fixed capital at all. Then we start accumu-\nlation going in one and watch what happens, assuming land plentiful\nand labor supplies constant.\n\nA long series of assumptions of the most formidable kind has to be\nmade before the argument can be reduced to any degree of simplicity\nand precision.

The proofs of these results, however, assume\nthe existence of perfectly competitive pricing throughout the economic\nsystem.' This paper explores the nature of the burdens and benefits of\nexcise taxes in an economy where some, and perhaps most, of the\nmarkets are other than perfectly competitive.\n\nClassical theory did not recognize the possibility of excise tax\nbenefits. The traditional conclusion was that a partial excise tax, by\naltering the allocation of resources and hence the composition of final\noutput, imposes on consumers an excess burden which a general excise\nor income tax does not carry.? Excise tax benefits are also ignored in the\ncontemporary extension of classical doctrine to include general excise\nand income taxes. The extended argument points out that all excise and\nincome taxes alter the price of leisure and thereby distort the work-\nleisure choice. The conclusion reached is that an income tax may inflict\na greater burden than a partial excise tax if its distortion of the work-\nleisure choice is sufficiently greater than that produced by the excise\ntax?\n\n* The author, assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley,\n\nis indebted to Professors Howard S.

Hence analysis of the probable economic effects\nof any proposed change in the rate schedule involves consideration of\nthe way in which the progressiveness of the tax will be affected. For\nchanges in the progressiveness of the tax are likely to affect the distribu-\ntion of income, and thus not only involve equity considerations but\nalso have an impact upon the propensity to consume and the level of\nincome itself.\n\nIt might at first sight appear a simple matter to measure the way in\nwhich a given change in the income-tax rate-structure would affect the\nprogressiveness of the tax; but in fact it is quite complex, since much\nmore is involved than a simple comparison of two schedules of legis-\nlatively established rates. In the present paper the meaning of income-\ntax progressiveness and the established concepts of the tax ratios to be\nused in measuring it will be reviewed, and two much improved measures\nof progressiveness will be developed.\n\nI.

                    "since 1949 have been very nearly stable, but the extent to which they have\nbeen unstable has not been consistently related to changes in size of armed\nforces.\n\nIf we take only the civilian labor force and compare it with the eligible\nnoninstitutional nonmilitary population we find the 1949-1952 labor-force\nparticipation rate even more stable than the conventional measure of participa-\ntion for these years. But this also justifies no generalization about any appar-\nently well-established stability in labor-force participation. A glance at the\nfigures for 1940 in Table II shows all the pertinent ratios to be considerably\nbelow their postwar counterparts. Long would argue, of course, that any over-\nall rate of only about 3 percentage points below the postwar high amounts to\nstability. But as was noted above, such a statement involves relegating to un-\nimportance total plus and minus variations of from 5.1 to 7.7 per cent of the\n1952 labor force and total plus and minus variations in the 1952 GNP of\nfrom $11.4 billion to $17.1 billion. No economic policy-maker could very well\nsubsume such large changes under the heading of \"stability.\"\n\nBut even if one were inclined to accept this criterion as a guide\u2014to accept\nalso the contention of long-run labor-force stability\u2014we cannot permit this\nto obscure certain changes that have been occurring over the years in the\ncomposition of the labor force. These, viewed in light of Long's assertion of a\nclose correlation between armed-forces withdrawals and female entry into the\nlabor force, raise additional doubts about the adequacy of the claimed rela-\ntionship. For example, there was an over 5 percentage point, or over 17 per\ncent, difference between the prewar and postwar participation rates. The post-\nwar increase is too substantial to dismiss as being either random or of no\nimportance, and it cannot easily be attributed entirely to the growth of armed\nforces. It is the female rate that has been responsible for the greater than\nnatural increase in the postwar labor force. But because women constitute only\nabout a third of the total labor force, relatively large increases in their par-\nticipation rates create comparatively small changes in aggregate labor force\nstatistics. A 17 per cent increase in the labor-force participation rate for a\ngiven group during a short ten-year period when other groups changed very\nlittle is a remarkably high figure, irrespective of the numerical size of the\ngroup or its proportion of the general category from which it is drawn. Long\nobviously does not overlook or deny that a significant change has occurred\nhere. But on the one hand in submerging this fact by limiting his correlations\nto over-all labor-force figures and on the other, urging a close direct relation-\nship between armed-forces expansion and female entry into the labor market,\nhe fails to test one conclusion against the other. The two are not consistent.\nWhile this does not mean that under conditions of high military mobilization\nLong's conclusions are incorrect, it does mean that at least in respect to com-\nparatively small changes in the size of armed forces no prediction is justified\none way or the other about the resultant changes in female labor-force partici-\npation, and that over the long pull female labor-force participation rates have\nbeen influenced more by nonmilitary changes that have been occurring in our\nsociety than Long's correlations and conclusions seem to indicate.\n\nIn sum, it can be said that while Professor Long's inferences about the long-\nrun stability of the over-all labor-force participation rate may be entirely cor-\n",

                    "\"The fact that there was substantial unemployment in 1940 is not likely to have\ninfluenced the results since there is now wide agreement, and Long's studies certainly\nsupport the view, that the existence of widespread unemployment has no discernible effect\non the labor-force participation rate.\n",
                    "increase in total labor-force participation; with a 1,448,000 increase in the\narmed forces, equal to over 42 times the 1949-1950 increase, there was only a\n.5 increase in total labor-force participation, and with a 512,000 increase in\narmed forces from 1951 to 1952 there was a .1 decline in the labor-force par-\nticipation rate. In connection with female labor-force participation, on the\nother hand, a 34,000 armed-forces increase was accompanied by a .7 per-\ncentage point rise in labor-force participation; in the next year the 1,448,000\nexpansion of armed forces was accompanied by the same percentage point but\na lower percentage increase in female labor-force participation, and in 1951-\n1952, when armed forces increased 512,000, female labor-force participation\nincreased by only .1 percentage point.\n\nIn light of these figures it is doubtful that Long's simple postwar correla-\ntion of .589 for total labor force and armed forces has very much short-run\npredictive value. However, since the 1950-1952 draft emphasized young, un-\nmarried men to a greater degree than the 1940-1945 draft, it might be argued\nthat this would tend to explain in part the lag in the female participation rate\nfor the later years and the anomalous results noted in the preceding paragraph,\nparticularly in respect to female participation rates. While a priori this would\nseem to be true, a perhaps more legitimate test of Long's proposition is pro-\nvided by comparing changes in armed-forces withdrawals and female labor-\nforce participation in 1940 (when the draft emphasized young, unmarried men\nin the same degree as in the 1950's) and in the 1950s. Thus while the actual\ndifference between the 1940 and the 1950 armed forces was about as great as\nthe 1950-1951 difference, the latter was accompanied by a female participation\nrate increase of only .7 percentage points as against the former increase of 4.9\npoints. This would tend to confirm the inadequacy of the claims of a close\ndirect relationship between these variables.!?\n\nIt might also be contended that my selection of 1949-52 as a basis for test-\ning Long's 1946-52 correlations may have introduced a selective bias in favor\nof the case against Long's conclusions. But this is doubtful since his is a corre-\nlation analysis based on the entire seven-year range while mine is a simple\narithmetic year-to-year comparison of changes between the pertinent variables.\nIn view of this difference in method it cannot easily be argued that the selec-\ntion of a different time span is particularly important. The point here is not so\nmuch that we are comparing different ranges of time, but that we are employ-\ning different methods. What is important is that the correlation method hides\na great deal of significant information about the actual year-to-year changes\noccurring between allegedly related variables.\n\nFurthermore, while Long holds to the existence of a close and direct positive\nrelation between armed-forces variation and female labor-force participation,\nTable II also indicates that the relation between female labor-force participa-\ntion and size of armed forces, at least during \"relative\" peacetime, appears to\njustify no correlation presumption of any degree of confidence one way or the\nother.

                    "there are occasional wide divergences from the so-called normal participation-\nrate patterns, Long argues that these are attributable almost exclusively to\narmed-forces withdrawals. He notes, to be sure, that a conclusion to the effect\nthat size of armed forces was the only significant determinant of the labor\nforce during, for example, World War II \"should be drawn only with great\ncare.\"5 Elsewhere he points to the failure of Germany's wartime participation\nrate to have risen as rapidly as those of the Allied nations as evidence that the\nincrease is not automatically a function of size of armed forces but is condi-\ntioned by the economic pressures which force women to become breadwinners.?\nStill he shows that *the correlation between labor force and armed forces was\nthe strongest of the various relationships\"? that he tested. He therefore con-\ncludes that armed-forces expansion provides the most meaningful explanation\nof swollen participation rates, pointing particularly to the great influx of\nwomen into the wartime labor market as additional supporting evidence.\n\nHe obtained a wartime simple correlation for labor force and armed forces\nof .956, higher than any other simple correlation included in his series. Multi-\nple correlations including unemployment and various measures of per worker\nincome and hourly earnings failed to yield significantly better results. For the\npostwar years 1946-52 the simple correlation is .589, with multiple correla-\ntions being somewhat, but not a great deal, better. He suggests that while the\npostwar correlations are distinctly weaker, they do not invalidate the conclu-\nsion of a close direct association between the two variables. Two possible\nexplanations are offered for the weaker postwar correlations: One is that\npowerful patriotic and other moral forces reinforce the impact of all-out\nmobilization on labor supply. The other is that the underlying estimates of\nlabor force\u2014furnished by the census\u2014are exposed to sampling errors that are\nminor in relation to the huge wartime variations but play a more prominent\nrole in the moderate postwar changes.\" Thus, in spite of the comparatively\nsmall changes in the postwar armed forces, Long seems to suggest that even\nfor these minor variations his conclusions about the close relationship between\narmed-forces size and labor-force participation still hold. The question to\nwhich we now address ourselves is whether other measures of this relationship\nduring the postwar period support such a thesis.\n\nTable II may be consulted for a cursory statistical examination of the extent\nto which this thesis can be generalized. The labor-force participation rate for\nthe years 1949-52 appears to have been quite stable indeed, ranging between\n58.0 and 58.8 per cent. The rate for men was even more stable, being for the\nfour respective years 84.5, 84.4, 84.8, and 84.6 per cent. But at the same time\nwe find some rather interesting changes in the relation between size and growth\nof armed forces and total and female participation rates which tend to chal-\nlenge the predictive value of Long's correlation results. It will be seen that\nwith an armed-forces increase of 34,000 in 1950 there was a .3 percentage point\n",

[prior to and]\nuntil the Korean outbreak, the over-all proportion [of persons in the labor\nforce to the noninstitutional population of fourteen years and older] remained\nhighly stable in each of the three nations [United States, Great Britain, and\nCanada], its maximum range of variation having been 1.5 per cent of popula-\ntion fourteen and older\u2014half to a third of what normally occurs in this coun-\ntry and Canada from one season to another within the same year.\"*\n\nLong thus seems to suggest that the long-run labor-force participation rate\nmay fluctuate within the entire range of normal seasonal fluctuations without\nviolating his criterion of stability. This means that a total plus and minus\nfluctuation of from 3 to 4.5 per cent in the participation rate is not inconsist-\nent with the concept of stability. In 1948 he suggested a similar conclusion,\nand added that \"If further research supports this stability, then economists\nand economic policy-makers may proceed more confidently in their theoretical\nspeculations and practical plans.\"5 It may be assumed therefore that repetition\nof the 1948 conclusions in 1953, the latter being based on further research,\nindicates satisfaction with the earlier statement, even though the 1953 criterion\nis stated in a more casual manner than Long would undoubtedly be satisfied\nwith in a more elaborate discussion of the problem.\n\nAs Long's criterion presently stands, however, it is doubtful whether, with-\nout some rather detailed statement of its limitations, it is a particularly useful\nguide for economic policy-makers. An indication of such limitations is pro-\nvided in Table I which shows the magnitude of labor-force and gross-national-\nproduct variations which would be allowed under this criterion. For example,\nan assumed 3 per cent range of variation in labor-force participation would\nhave allowed in 1952 a total labor-force variation of approximately 3.4 million\npersons. An assumed 4.5 per cent range of variation would have allowed a total\nlabor-force variation of approximately 5.1 million persons. On the basis of the\naverage adjusted increase in gross national product attributable to each worker\nparticipating in the labor-force expansion that occurred between 1951 and\n1952, this would have permitted at the outside a variation in the 1952 gross\nnational product of from $11.4 to $17.1 billion (in 1947-49 dollars).\n\nSuch highly elastic results suggest that Long's criterion seriously mini-\nmizes the importance of apparently minor variations in labor-force participa-\ntion rates. Small variations are deceptive. Using his criterion it would be possi-\nble for the labor force to vary by as much as 7.7 per cent and gross national\nproduct by as much as 5.6 per cent with \"stable\" participation rates.9 It\nwould seem, therefore, that the employment of seasonal participation-rate\nchanges (and \"other important economic magnitudes\") as criteria for indi-\n\n* Ibid., p. 461.\n\n* Long, \"The Labor Force and Economic Change,\" in Insights Into Labor Issues, edited\nby R.

In reality,\nthe \"shortage\" was a distribution of the industrial labor force among\ncompeting users such that the capital equipment, and hence the\nproductive potential, of the coal mines and several export industries\nwere underutilized for lack of manpower. The Labour government's\npostwar economic aim was expressly to overcome the unfavorable\nbalance of payments on current international account by restricting\nimports and, particularly, by increasing exports. Realization of the\nlatter goal was frustrated by the manpower shortage; in consequence,\nmanpower targets were included in the general economic plans set forth\nin the annual Economic Surveys, the major purpose of which was to\nattain export targets.\n\nIn its origin, the manpower shortage was the result of \"natural\"\neconomic forces conflicting with economic-administrative policies.

Even when correctly constructed the box diagram has limited\napplicability to problems in international trade theory.\n\nMeade's Diagrammatical Analysis\n\nIn his Geometry of International Trade? J. E. Meade has recently presented\na geometrical technique which makes possible a more complete analysis of\nthe two-country, two-commodity model than was possible with the box\ndiagram.? A brief summary of Meade's technique will illustrate its advantages\nover the box diagram.\n\nIn the second quadrant (X'OY) of Figure 4 country Is relative preferences\nand production possibilities for X and Y are represented respectively by\nconsumption indifference curves, i,, i\u00bb, etc., and the production block OAP,B.\nCurve AB is concave to the origin because increasing costs are assumed.\nVisualize the production block OAP,B as being moved along consumption\nindifference curve i, so that some point on AB is always tangent to i, and\nthe sides O4 and OB are always parallel to the X and Y axes respectively.\nThe point of tangency of the production block with the consumption in-\ndifference curve moves from P, toward A as the block is shifted northeast,\nand from P, toward B as the block is shifted southwest along z,. The origin\nof the production block, O, traces out a locus of points which Meade calls\na trade indifference curve, denoted \u00a3, in Figure 4. Next, place the production\nblock so that it is tangent to the next higher consumption indifference curve\nand trace out the next higher trade indifference curve. In this manner a\nfamily of trade indifference curves can be traced out for country I. After\nsuch a family has been constructed, country I's offer curve is defined by the\npoints of tangency between country I's trade indifference curves and exchange\nlines rotated around the origin, O. Country I's offer curve is shown in Figure\n4 by the line OI. Similarly, an offer curve, O/I, is derived for country II.\nTo avoid clutter Figure 4 shows only one trade and one consumption in-\ndifference curve for country II, whose relative preferences and cost relation-\nships for X and Y are assumed to be depicted in the third quadrant (Y'OX).\n\nThe intersection of O7 and OII at T denotes the point of free-trade\nequilibrium, To determine what country I's production and consumption are\nat this point, the production possibilities block is placed so that its origin\ncoincides with point T. Because of the way in which the trade indifference\ncurves have been constructed, the production block is tangent to consumption\nindifference curve i\u00bb, corresponding to \u00a3\u00bb, the trade indifference curve passing\nthrough T. At the point of tangency, P;, the slopes of the consumption in-\ndifference curve and the production block are the same as the slope of f,\nat T.? Therefore, at point P, consumption and production are adjusted\nto the exchange ratio OT. Country I consumes OH of X and OJ of Y, but\nproduces TE of X and TG of Y. Country I has, therefore, a surplus\n\n' (London, 1952).\n\n*In his rather extensive exposition of this new tool, however, Meade did not criticize\nprevious forms of diagrammatical representation nor indicate in what way his technique\nis an improvement.\n\n* Meade, o. cit., pp. 13-14.\n",

                    "Constructional Limitations of Box Diagram Analysis\n\nWhen drawn as in Figure 3 the box diagram strikingly illustrates the\nclassical conclusion that total welfare is enhanced by unimpeded interna-\ntional trade and specialization. The diagram also shows that in the absence\nof retaliation one nation can improve its welfare at the expense of the other.\nIf, by means of a tariff, country I alters its offer curve, O,/, in Figure 3 so\nas to intersect O,/I somewhere between L and S, e.g., M, country I attains\na higher level of welfare than under free trade, for M must lie on a higher\nconsumption indifference curve than Z5, which passes through the equilibrium\nfree-trade point, S.*\n\nThe use of the box diagram in this argument implies that the imposition\nof a tariif does not alter the pattern of production in either country, i.e.,\nthat each country continues to specialize. Were the imposition of the tariff\nto alter the foreign and domestic exchange ratios for X and Y so as to induce\neither or both countries to cease specializing, Figure 3 would cease to be\nmeaningful. As demonstrated in the above comparison of Figures 2 and 3,\nthe quantities of X and Y produced by the two countries determine the\ndimensions of the box and any change in these quantities alters the dimensions\nof the box and the positions of the offer curves and contract curve.\n\nUnder the assumption of constant costs it is not unreasonable to conclude\nthat the imposition of a tariff would not easily alter the pattern of production.*\nIn Figure 3 the terms of trade could vary between O,B and O,B' without\neither country finding it advantageous to cease specializing. If, however, in-\ncreasing costs are assumed to prevail, every change in the terms of trade\nresults in a changed pattern of production? and for each pattern of produc-\ntion the box diagram has different dimensions. Furthermore, with increasing\ncosts the offer curves cannot be defined within the framework of the box,\nfor with each change in the exchange ratio the initial distribution of X and Y\nbetween countries I and II alters, and the origin of the curves shifts.\n\nThe box-diagram exposition is valid only under the classical assumptions\nthat constant costs prevail and that each country specializes as if in free-trade\n\n' This argument has been set forth diagrammatically \u2014 Nicholas Kaldor, *A Note on\nTariffs and the Terms of Trade,\" Economica (Nov. 19040), VII, 377-80 and Scitovsky,\n0p. cit., pp. 372-77, and is summarized here only for the purpose of introducing into the\nargument qualifications that are inherent in the box diagram.\n\n* Kaldor, o5. cit., and Scitovsky, of. cit., state no assumptions about the nature of costs\nunderlying their diagrams.\n\n\"Increasing costs are represented by production curves concave toward the origin.\nExchange lines representing various ratios of exchange between X and Y do not touch the\nproduction curve all at one point as in the case with constant costs, but rather are tangent\nat different points throughout the range of the curve; each point of tangency defines a\ndifferent composition of output of X and Y.

It is clear that Marshall's offer curves were\ndrawn on the assumption that each country was specializing, for in his \"Note on Mill's\nTreatment of an Exceptional Case\" in The Pure Theory of Foreign Trade, pp. 15-16, he\ndrew a diagram (Figure 6 in that work) in which he indicated that the point of isolated\nproduction would be somewhere up the offer curve from the origin. The origin could not\nbe, therefore, the point of isolated production as in Figure 2. An error in Edgeworth's\ndiagrams in *\"The Theory of International Values,\" oj. cit, pp. 425, 623, resulted in\nmisinterpretation, for these diagrams resemble that part of Figure 2 contained in quadrant\nYO,X, yet are constructed on a different principle.

To be consistent with the principle of maximization,\nthe offer curves must be drawn as in the Leontief-type diagram, for only\nthen do they denote points of equilibria at which productive resources as well\nas exchange opportunities have been exploited to the fullest extent.\n\nIt is apparent, however, that Figure 2 cannot be made meaningful by\ndrawing the offer curves in such a way that they originate at 4 and A\". If the\ncurves originated at these points, the intersection of the offer curves would\nbe devoid of its usual significance. The exchange lines, by means of which\nthe offer curves are derived, would not originate from the same point, and\nthe intersection of the offer curves at T would not define a ratio of exchange\nbetween X and Y that would be the same for both countries. The equilibrium\ncondition that the terms of trade be the same for both countries would not\nbe satisfied. Further, the point of intersection would not lie on the contract\ncurve. Since the exchange lines which are tangent to the respective consump-\ntion indifference curves at the point of intersection of the offer curves would\ndiffer in slope, the consumption indifference curves would not share a common\ntangent and therefore would not be tangent to one another at this point.\n\nThe conclusion that each country continues to produce a\u00edter the opening\nof trade as it did before is certainly alien to the classical model. Under the\nassumption of constant costs the well-known conclusion of the classical model\nis that when trade is opened each country shifts its productive resources so\nas to specialize in the product in which it holds the comparative advantage.\nThe box diagram in Figure 2 does not and can not show this shift in\nproduction.*\n",

Country I is\nin equilibrium at P, where the production possibilities line is tangent to a\nconsumption indifference curve. This denotes the highest level of welfare\nthat country I can attain in isolation, and at P country I produces and\nconsumes OX, and OY. Similarly, prior to the opening of trade country II\nis in equilibrium at point P^ where OX'/, and OY\", are produced and con-\nsumed.\n\n! One of the few step-by-step constructions of the box diagram as applied to international\ntrade theory is presented by Donald B. Marsh, World Trade and Investment (New York,\n1951), pp. 275-85.

Bowley,\nMathematical Groundwork for Economics (Oxford, 1924), pp. 5-9, for \"the best description\nof such a diagram\" (p. 380 n). Marsh's and Bowley's constructions are essentially the\nsame. Marshall's international trade diagrams in \"Pure Theory of Foreign Exchange,\"\ncirculated privately in 1879 and later published as The Pure Theory of Foreign Trade\n(London, 1930), and in Appendix J of Money, Credit and Commerce (London, 1923),\npp. 330-60, : \u2014 Edgeworth's in \"The Theory of International Values,\" Ecom.

                    "A Note on the Use of the Box Diagram in International Trade Theory\n\nThe simple classical model of two countries trading two commodities has\noften been illustrated diagrammatically by a device which might be called\nthe box diagram. The use of this diagram has been justified by the analogy\nbetween the classical model of trade between two countries and barter between\ntwo individuals. There are limits to this analogy which render ambiguous the\napplication of the barter diagram to the two-country, two-commodity analysis.\nAn important limitation lies in the difficulty of defining unique sets of com-\nmunity consumption indi\u00edference curves for the two countries. Other limita-\ntions are posed by the question of how meaningful is an analysis in terms of\ntwo countries acting as individuals when, in fact, the trading world it seeks\nto analyze is made up of many individuals in many countries trading many\ncommodities. Disregarding these quite fundamental limitations, the following\ndiscussion seeks to show that the box diagram is not appropriate for use in\ninternational trade theory because of constructional limitations which are\nusually ignored.\n",

                    "A Note on Corporate Concentration and Turnover\n\nCorporate concentration is usually measured by applying some kind of\ndistribution concept: for example, by the share of the largest x firms in the\nassets or employment (or other variables) of all firms. The trend of concen-\ntration over time is measured by comparing the size of this share at two or\nmore successive dates. The basic data are very imperfect, and there are also\ndifficulties with the concept itself. A different measure of changes in size\nStructure was suggested some years ago,* and has recently been applied on a\nlarge scale.? It is obtained by drawing up a list of the largest x firms at various\ndates, and then counting the number of firms which have dropped out of the\nlist and have been replaced by other firms. This concept has received almost\nno formal treatment. The purpose of this brief note is to compare these two\nconcepts\u2014of distribution and of turnover\u2014and show to what extent they\nare logically related or unrelated to one another. This is more easily done if\nwe first develop the turnover measure somewhat by presenting some rear-\nrangements of the data which may also be of interest for their own sake.\n",

The policy can no longer be viewed\nas temporary. It has won the advocacy of a body of legislators of both\nparties who are formidable both in numbers and power. They clearly\nhave on their side an important sector of farm opinion despite the\nformal opposition, so far, of two of the three national farm organiza-\ntions During the presidential campaign of 1952 both candidates\ncommitted themselves, for the immediate future, to price supports at\npresent levels and to the extension of protection to products not now\ncovered.

Only the smaller and more regional\nFarmers! Union supports the policy. However, it has been evident for some time that the\nFarm Bureau, especially in the South, does not have the full concurrence of its state units\non this issue, and presidents of State Federations have appeared before Congressional\ncommittees in opposition to the position taken by the national organization.\n\n? In his first press conference, in what may not have been the happiest choice of words,\nSecretary Benson expressed the belief that price supports should be used only to protect the\nfarmer from \"undue disaster.\" Amplifying this later at St. Paul, he said, \"Price supports\nshould provide insurance against disaster and help stabilize national food supplies.

If one considers a market\nfor services or a market for perishable goods, it is fairly clear what is\nmeant by the familiar statement that \"price tends to be established at a\nlevel which equates supply and demand.\" If price were greater than the\n\"equilibrium\" level, buyers would be confronted, in effect, with a\n*queue\" of willing sellers; since some sellers would accept a lower price\nin order to avoid inconvenience (and loss) associated with *queuing,\"\nprice would tend to fall. If price were less than the equilibrium level,\nsellers would be confronted, in effect, with a queue\" of willing buyers;\nsince some buyers would offer a higher price rather than \"wait their\nturn,\" price would tend to rise.\n\nIf one considers a market for durable goods, matters are rather\ndifferent. In this case it is usual to argue that if price were above the\nlevel which equates supply and demand, commodity stocks would ac-\ncumulate; since some sellers would accept a lower price to avoid holding\nundesired stocks, price would tend to fall. A similar argument is used\nto show that if price were set temporarily below the equilibrium level,\nforces would be set in motion which would tend to make price rise.\nThe difficulty in these cases is that it seems equally plausible to argue\nthat if price lies above the equilibrium level, this may be because some\nindividuals wan\u00a3 to accumulate stocks. Otherwise the phenomenon of\ninvestment would be incomprehensible. But does the mere process of\ninvestment in stocks imply a tendency for price to fall? Similarly, if\nprice is below the equilibrium level so that demand exceeds supply,\nit is reasonable to argue that some individuals wan to disinvest. Does\nthis necessarily imply a tendency for price to rise?\n\n\"This paper attempts to give precise answers to the above and related\nquestions.

But it is the range of\nthe variation which is most striking; it extends from 2 shillings to the dollar\n(equivalent to \u00a31 \u2014 $10.00), to 8 shillings to the dollar (equivalent to\n\u00a3l - $2.50). Two-thirds of the observations fall within the rather consider-\nable range 3.57 shillings to 5.50 shillings to the dollar (or within the range\n\u00a31 \u2014 $3.64 to $5.60).\n\nThese results are not presented as a great puzzle; an explanation of a sort\ncan be provided. For one thing, it must be noted that British publishers own\nthe primary copyright on some of these books, while American publishers\nown it on others. However, this fact would at best lead us to expect two dif-\nferent ratios, and not the scattering of values actually found. Secondly, wage\nrates in the printing industry are not uniform in the United States, since\nthere is a North-South differential. But this is believed to be a factor of limited\nsignificance for the matter considered here. The most important explanation\nseems to be that the patterns of mark-up are quite different in the two coun-\ntries. A British publisher evidently sets a rather low mark-up on one title and\na higher one on another, while his American counterpart reverses the rule\nand establishes a higher mark-up on the former title than on the latter.\nWhether it is sensible to link these international differences in the patterns\nof mark-ups to variations in the British and American structures of demand\nand its elasticity can not be considered here.\n\nIn any case it does seem evident that in international trade theory an im-\nportant place must be reserved for such phenomena as differences in mark-up\npatterns in the various countries. Moreover, bearing in mind the different\nprice ratios that are observed, the low tariff on books, and the small costs of\ntransfer, it appears that even so literate and presumably so well-informed a\ngroup as those who buy books is either singularly blind to its own pecuniary\nadvantage, or alternatively it places a very high, and oddly variable premium\nupon its own convenience.\n\nT ^n\u00bb 'TAincrrce*\n",

If at\nthe same time the pattern of mark-ups is the same in both countries, then\na calculation prepared for each title like that above should give the same\nresult in terms of the number of shillings to the dollar, since this means no\nmore than that the price ratios are the same.\n\nHowever, when this was done it was found that instead of a clustering of\nthe results around a central value, or two of them, they were in fact widely\ndispersed.

                    "International Price Ratios and International Trade Theory\n\nIn the absence of trade, or when the obstacles to trade in the form of tariffs\nand costs of transport are significant, the price structure in one country would\nnot be expected to duplicate the price structure in another. Differences in factor\nendowments in the various countries would normally lead to a wide difference\n\naP4 yP4\nand (or to put this differently, between\nzP, B yP, B yP. A\n\nbetween the ratios\n\nand Pr where P is the price of A4, Ps the price of B, and the subscripts\nyPs\n\nx and y refer to the two countries X and Y. This is the familiar basis of inter-\n\nnational trade theory, and it is commonly employed to account for the composi-\n\ntion of trade.\n\nIn theory too, when trade is unhampered and costless these differences in\nprice ratios disappear. If such differences can still be observed after trade is\nopened, they are taken to reflect the existence of transport costs, tariffs, or\nother expenses of trade. To explain trade, then, we must first account for such\ndifferences in price structure as would exist were trade impossible; and in\norder to explain the observed differences in price structures once trade is\nopen, we must look for various costs of transfer.\n\nAn explanation along these lines is generally put forward when we seek to\nshow why, for instance, Canada sells us wood pulp, while she buys automo-\nbile parts from us. The two products differ so greatly that we may reasonably\nhope to explain, in terms of the different factor endowments of the two coun-\ntries, why the ratio of the Canadian price of wood pulp to the U.S. price of\nthe same product would, in the absence of trade, be much lower than the\ncomparable ratio for automobile parts. We would have looked, until recently\nat any rate, for the Canadian price (in the absence of trade) to be especially\nlow for that product which required for its production a relatively large\namount of the factor which Canada possesses in relatively (to the United\nStates) ample supply.* Finally such price discrepancies as are seen to exist, are\nsupposed to reflect tariffs and other costs of transfer, and they would not be\nexpected to exceed these transfer costs.\n\nWithin certain classes of products, however, we should have no obvious\nreason to expect different price ratios, despite the different factor endowments\n\n? But recent work on both the theoretical and statistical basis for this view shows that\nit may not be correct; see for example, S. F. James and I. F. Pearce: \"The Factor Price\nEqualisation Myth,\" Rev. Econ.

The case of the tax\nlaid on one firm or on a few firms in a competitive industry is by no means\nas trivial as he seems to think. AII local taxation tends to be of this nature\u2014\nic., the tax does not affect the long-run price of the product because\nthere are plenty of firms outside the local area which are not affected. Even\nnational taxation where the product is produced for a world market may be\nregarded as a \"local\" tax in the sense that in so far as it is not universal\nthe world price will not be affected. There are interesting problems when the\ntax covers a large part but not the whole of the market: here the effect would\nseem to depend on the elasticity of supply in the nontaxed area. If supply\nis very elastic even taxes which cover a large part of the total industry will\nnot affect the market price, as the untaxed part will expand to take care of\nany decline in sales in the taxed part.

Conclusions\n\nIf a fixed tax is imposed on a perfectly competitive industry where the\nfirm's indifference curves are parallel, (1) production, sales and price will\nremain constant as long as no financial shortage prevents the attainment of\noptimum output and (2) output will fall, market price will rise, and sales will\nlikely fall, if production is limited by a money shortage. Where lower indiffer-\nence curves are flatter output generally will fall!5 as a result of the tax and\n(1) sales rise and price falls if no money shortage limits production and (2) if\noutput is limited by financial shortage, sales may either rise or fall and price\neither fall or rise.!*\n\nIf a tax is imposed on each unit of product sold by a monopoly faced with\nconstant marginal cost, sales and output will decline by the same amount\nand price will rise. But sales and output will not fall as much as Boulding\nindicates and the price rises more than in Boulding's solution.\n\nIf a variable tax is levied on the output of a perfectly competitive industry,\nboth output and sales fall and market price rises if the marginal rate of\nsubstitution of money for commodity is invariant with respect to money\nholdings. If the indifference curves become flatter at lower money holdings,\n\n\"One exception would be where marginal cost is constant and the firm is able to\nattain the peak of the utility hill both before and after the tax.\n\n? For an exception see the second case in n. 9.\n\n\"Only in very unusual circumstances here would the industry supply curve remain\nconstant and hence the market price and the firm's sales remain unaffected by the imposi-\ntion of fixed tax.\n",

But output will decline except in unusual cases.!*\n\nWhen the variable tax is industry-wide, the same analysis applies except\nthat the effect on market price must be considered. With parallel indifference\ncurves, both output and sales will tend to fall. In addition market price will\ntend to rise because of the negative shift of the firm and hence industry supply\nSchedules. (With the new total cost curve, the volume of the firm's sales at\neach price will tend to be smaller and hence also the industry supply to the\nmarket.) With the higher price, the investment in inventory will also tend to\nfall. But with flatter indi\u00edference curves at lower money holdings, the firm's\nsales may increase even though production falls (as outlined above) and hence\nthe industry's supply schedule may shift to the right and a /ower market price\nprevail after the tax. Thus in Figure 3 the firm will be faced finally with ex-\nchange path P;K;, produce Q;P; and sell S;P,. If the tax is very steep and the\nslope of the lower indifference curves doesn't fall greatly, however, sales are\nlikely to fall and hence the industry supply schedule to shift negatively and\nmarket price to rise. In either case inventory investment is likely to fall.\n\nThus the result may differ markedly from that obtained from elementary\nmarginal analysis where invariably output and sales (which are identical)\nfall and market price rises.

A Sales Tax on a Monopoly\n\nBecause of a serious error in the analysis, Boulding's solution to this case!?\npredicts an incorrect output, an incorrect sales volume, and a wrong price.\nLet us follow Boulding by assuming a constant marginal cost so that the\n\n*One wonders whether Boulding's assumption that market price remained constant\nwas mistakenly connected in hi& mind with the fact that marginal cost does not change.\nHe says: \"the marginal cost is unchanged, and the market price likewise assumed to be\nunchanged\" (op. cit., p. 104).\n\n\"To get as high up the utility surface as possible, the firm will move along the produc-\ntion opportunity line P R;P; to P. where it is just tangential to a market exchange path,\nand then move along the exchange path PiKi to K, where an indifference curve is just\ntangential to the exchange path.\n\n*'This result seems to be quite general as long as production is not restricted by money\nshortage and lower indifference curves are flatter.\n\nThese conclusions do not hold when a shortage of financial capital prevents the\nattainment of optimum output. In this case, output will fall and sales may also fall\n(and market price rise) or sales may rise (and market price fall). Another exceptional\ncase where these conclusions do not hold is that of constant marginal cost when the\nfirms attain the peak of the utility surface both before and after the tax. Here output\nand sales would tend to rise and the price to fall.\n\n? 05. cit., pp. 106f. Boulding's case is that of \"imperfect markets.\" But since he ignores\nany inter-firm demand relationships, it seems preferable to specify a monopoly.\n",

If there\nare 200 identical firms in the industry, the industry supply at these two prices\nwill be 200 times these quantities. Similarly the amounts the firm will be\nwilling to make available at other prices can be ascertained and then also the\nindustry supply schedule. 7f the market price remains constant at the negative\nof the slope of K;P, (say) after the imposition of the fixed tax R,R., then\nproduction will remain constant at Q;,P; \u2014 Q,Pi; but sales will increase\nfrom P,S, to P,S; since the lower indifference curves are flatter and hence\nthe point of tangency of an indifference curve with the exchange path P;K;\ncomes at a smaller abscissa\u2014as Boulding notes. But with the new total cost\ncurve, at al/ prices the firm will similarly throw more on the market. Thus\nafter the imposition of the fixed tax there is a positive shift of the firm's\nsupply schedule even though marginal cost remains constant at each abscissa!\nThus a positive shift of the industry supply curve also follows if the tax\nis widely imposed*\u2014and hence a fall in the equilibrium market price to the\nabsolute value of the slope of P,K; (say). At this price the firm produces\nQ;P; rather than Q;P..\n\nThus not only may sales increase as Boulding notes, but also market price\nand the firm's production may \u00edall. These are important modifications to\ncustomary elementary analysis where the imposition of a fixed tax on the\nfirms of a purely competitive industry is held to affect neither the firm's\nproduction (as long as it is not driven out of business) nor the market price\n(unless a significant number of firms are driven out of business).

                    "Sales and Output Taxes\n\nThe application of K. E. Boulding's asset-indifference technique! to taxation\nproblems is of particular importance? to economists interested in public policy\nbecause the results occasionally differ markedly from those obtained from the\ncustomary analysis based on the assumption that production always equals\nsales. The purpose of this note is to re-examine two of the tax cases Boulding\ntakes up and then to analyze briefly a third important case. A more meaningful\nand realistic result is obtained in Boulding's first case when an important\nassumption of his is removed and his analysis extended. A serious error in\nreasoning is discovered in his second case.\n\nSince Boulding's asset-indifference apparatus is perhaps not, as yet, well\nknown, a short preliminary explanation of this technique seems in order. Its\nbasic assumption is that firms aim at preferred holdings of goods and other\nassets at a point of time rather than mere profit maximization over a period of\ntime. The initial asset position of the firm is depicted by P, in Figure 1. The\nordinate of P, shows the firm's initial money stock and the abscissa the original\ncommodity stock. P,R,P, is the firm's *production opportunity line\" or total\ncost curve showing the possible combinations of money and commodity attain-\nable by producion. P,R, represents the total fixed cost and R,P, the total vari-\nable cost in the present period. If the firm does not produce in this period, its\nmoney stocks will simply fall by P,R, and the firm's new asset position will\nbe R,. The marginal cost of production, the slope of R, P, is assumed in this\ndiagram to increase as output increases.\n\nP,K;, the firm's *exchange path,\" shows the amount of money obtainable\nby selling the commodity in the market. Since a perfect market is assumed\nin Figure 1, total revenue increases at a constant rate. Thus the slope of P,K,\nis constant and its absolute value equals the market price. The firm will ex-\nchange commodity for money until it has reached the highest indifference curve\ntouching its exchange path. It is readily seen from the diagram that, to get as\nhigh up the utility surface as possible, this perfectly competitive firm will move\nalong its production opportunity line, P,R,P;, to that point where an exchange\npath is just tangential to it and then will proceed along that exchange path to\nK, where an indifference curve is tangential to it. Optimum output is then\nQiP,, optimum sales P,S,, and optimum inventory accumulation S,Q,.\n\nL A Fixed Tax on a Perfectly Competitive Firm\nBoulding concludes that a fixed tax on a perfectly competitive firm (1) will\nnot affect production, sales or price if the marginal rate of substitution is\ninvariant with respect to the amount of money and (2) will affect sales but\nneither production nor price if the indifference curves are not parallel. The\nsecond conclusion seems faulty* since it is incorrect to assume the market price\n* K, E. Boulding, A. Reconstruction of Economics (New York, 1950), Ch. 6.\n\n^In this application Boulding uses \"the asset-indifference apparatus to produce some\nmoderately significant new results\" (W. Vickrey, Am. Econ. Rew., 1951, XLI, 674).\n\n* Op. cit., p. 104.\n*Actually both conclusions are faulty. The first conclusion cannot hold where the\n",

Controls over entry and prescription of minimum rates were the\nprime tools. The rails led in persistent advocacy of that regulatory policy\nbecause they were suffering low traffic and earnings as the result of depression\nconditions and the rise of competing transport means. But somehow that plan\nof regulation has backfired. The rails now are advocating more rate competi-\ntion in transport, whereas truck and water lines, many of whom earlier had\nnot favored extension of regulation, are now opposed to basic change in pres-\nent regulated competition. What has happened in the meantime?\n\nSeveral developments have been building a case for a fundamental review\nof regulation. First, long-term technological substitution has reduced the rail\nshares of total intercity passenger-miles and ton-miles from 90 per cent or\nmore to only about 6 and 50 per cent respectively. Regulation has not slack-\nened the decline in the role of the railroads. Secondly, projected large-scale\ninvestment of public funds in interstate highways, inland waterways and the\nSt. Lawrence Seaway has further increased the railroads' feeling of insecurity\nunder regulation of competition. Thirdly, except for less aid to trunk airlines,\nlittle progress has been made in adjusting user fees on a sound economic basis\nor in establishing such fees for use of public airway and waterway facilities.\nFourthly, the railroads have become greatly discontented with postwar rate\nregulation. They have been held to low rates of return compared with other\nindustries and have often been blocked in their attempts to reduce particular\nrates to hold or attract traffic. Finally, two world wars have emphasized the\nstandby essentiality of almost all rail facilities in a way that makes continual\ntraffic-share declines and low earnings of concern to the public.\n\nThese pressures prompted President Eisenhower to establish a Cabinet\nCommittee in July 1954 to review federal transportation policies and prob-\nlems. Whether economists can subscribe to the full bill of particulars of the\nrails against current policies or all of the legislation recommended by that\nCommittee, it is clear that a full cycle of experimenting under depression and\nprosperity conditions has taken place; and few fundamental problems have\nbeen solved.

The drive on the part of unions in the\npostwar period for greater economic security for their members has already\nresulted in a spectacular growth of fringe benefits to workers and costs to\nemployers in the form of pension programs, health and welfare programs,\nannual improvement factors, etc. The Ford settlement adds to this list of\nfringe benefits an employer-financed supplementary unemployment compensa-\ntion program.\n\nThe term \"guaranteed annual wage\" has been used to refer on the one hand\nto certain specific wage plans! under which workers are in a sense hired by\nthe year instead of by the hour or week and, on the other hand, as a generic\nterm for any wage plan which provides for maintenance of the workers! in-\ncome for *a fairly long period into the future.\"?

That is, each\n(short) section of the text should be followed by a list of problems, the first\nones being entirely abstract to isolate the basic principles, the later ones in\neach list being applications. These are the puzzle kind of problem, not the\npolicy kind dealt with in the first part of the course. Most of the students'\ntime outside of class should be devoted to working problems. The instructor\nshould not proceed on the assumption that he must get through the entire\ntext or cover a certain fixed amount of material; he should proceed as rapidly\nor slowly as the student body at his institution can acquire a reasonable mas-\ntery of the tools.\n\nThere are a number of problem-workbooks on the market, but they have\nserious defects. They are separate volumes from the textbook and therefore\nare not sufficiently integrated with the text itself. What is worse, they com-\nmonly do half the work for the student; that is, instead of merely stating the\nproblem, they set it up for him, so that he does only the final steps. This is all\nright as long as we are aiming only at a reading knowledge; but if we want to\ndevelop some skill in the student, we must do as the mathematicians do. (In-\ncidentally, this is the reason why economics workbooks now are and must be\nseparate volumes from the text: to set up the problem\u2014e.g., to give numerical\nvalues for ten or twelve points on a supply curve\u2014takes a lot of space. If the\nproblems were merely stated as in a mathematics text, it would be feasible to\ncombine text and problem-book.) The text should develop the methodology of\neconomic theory with great care; and the instructor should pay a great deal\nof attention to it. This is the great weakness in economic training: under-\ngraduate majors don't understand what theory is all about; some graduate\nstudents don't either; and occasionally we have the spectacle of a well-known,\nrespected professor of economics making elementary mistakes in print. The\nfault lies with no one in particular, but the place to start doing something\nabout it is at the very beginning\u2014in the introductory course.\n\nSuperficially, the proposal looks like reversing the usual order, teaching\napplied economics first and pure economics afterwards. Looked at in this way,\nit sounds crazy.'* But this is the wrong way to look at it. The ideas of pure\neconomics are an integral part\u2014in fact, the most important part\u2014of the first\nsection of the course. In the first semester they are taught at a very simple\nlevel.

The\nassumptions are sometimes so outrageously unrealistic, the diagrams so ab-\nstract, that students are apt to dismiss the whole analysis as the dreamings of\narmchair theorists out of contact with the real world, not worth the bother of\nlearning. And the theoretical tools of economists have grown prodigiously in\nthe last quarter-century so that any attempt to cover all the usual topics, even\nin an elementary way, overloads a beginning course, especially in view of all\nthe other kinds of material that must be included. We have all learned tricks\nfor dealing with these problems\u2014we use problems books, we give realistic\nexamples at every turn, after a time we learn not to try to teach both in-\ndifference curves and marginal utility. But the bagful of tricks, though help-\nful, is not enough; the results of teaching theory continue to be disappointing.\nThe whole approach to teaching theory needs revision.\n\nOne approach is to teach principles first and teach applied economics later.\nThe questionnaire of the Subcommittee on Elementary Courses indicates that\nin nearly half of its sample the first half of the course is devoted to principles\nor pure economics and the second half to applied economics.!* In other cases,\none type of principles, such as value and distribution theory, may be followed\nimmediately by applications, say, to the monopoly problem; then the prin-\nciples of money and banking are introduced, followed by their application\nto problems of inflation and depression. The general rule is: pure economics\nfirst, applied economics afterwards.\n\nThe usual procedure has a serious defect. The students are plunged into\nhighly abstract analysis without adequate understanding of why theory is\nnecessary. They therefore lack motivation for learning. They also lack a sense\nof direction\u2014an awareness of the ultimate goal\u2014which would be a big help\nto the learning process. Vanderbilt during the past six years has used in its\nSophomore course an approach which solves this problem at the expense of\nsacrificing the one great merit attainable with the more usual procedure. A\npolicy problem, such as monopoly, is introduced with a statement of the issue.\nNext, tools of formal theory are brought in on grounds that they are needed\nfor a proper understanding of the problem. Finally the tools are used to\nilluminate the problem. Then the course proceeds to the next issue. This\nmethod has been successful. Students are no longer bothered by the seeming\nunreality of theory. But because tools are mixed up with policy issues, few stu-\ndents acquire any skill in actively using the tools; few get beyond the read-\ning-knowledge stage. What is needed is a course (or a section of a course)\nwhich has for its primary purpose training in theoretical skills.\n\nTherefore, the course described in the previous section should be used as the\nfirst half or two-thirds of the introductory course, with the second part con-\nfined to theory.

On the one hand, most teachers are\nagreed that they want to include a heavy dose of theory; on the other hand,\nthe results achieved are unsatisfactory. No doubt, the desire to teach theory\nstems in part from wrong motives\u2014an unconscious desire to start every-\nbody on the road to becoming a professional economist or an absurd assump-\ntion that students will master enough theory in one year to be able to apply\nit to policy problems after they leave college. Nevertheless, there are sound\nreasons for teaching theory in an introductory course. A few will become pro-\nfessional economists; a number will major in the field; others will want to\ntake an advanced course or two. All such need to be shown what economics\nreally is like. There are weighty reasons for teaching theory even to those\nwho will go no further. Theory can and should give a deeper understanding of\neconomic issues. Moreover, one of the objects of a liberal education is to learn\nsomething about the methods of science. From this point of view, the typical\nmethods of analysis used by economists ought to be demonstrated if at all\npossible.\n\nTheory must be taught\u2014but how? Comparison of examination results with\nother teachers and observation in advanced courses of students who had ele-\nmentary economics from some one else gives evidence that the poor results\nof which I am painfully aware in my students are not just the result of poor\nteaching. The inherent difficulties of teaching theory are well known. The\ntrains of logical deduction are hard to follow\u2014not so hard perhaps as what\n",

The other two gave answers which indicated they\nwere not opposed to admitting such students on grounds that they would not\nderive sufficient benefit from the course; rather, they were afraid that in a\nmixed group the ones without previous economics would be graded by the\nsame standards as the others. Since three out of the seven had already had\neconomics, at least two of the three did not feel their previous work kept\nthem from benefiting from the course.\n\nThe students felt that, if anything, the course should be made simpler. In\nreply to the question whether the reading was too difficult, too easy, or about\nright, they were almost unanimous in thinking it about right; but a majority\ncommented that some of the reading was over my head\" or \"too technical.\"\nIn answering a request for suggestions for improving the course, one man\nwrote, allow only those students with some economics background (perhaps a\nminor) into the course or make more effort to teach the basics before jumping\ninto an involved issue.

It consisted of four graduate students and three\nundergraduate seniors. They were all good students. In addition they were un-\nusually mature: six out of seven were married, five were over 25 years of\nage. One had practiced law for five years, another had been a newspaper re-\nporter for a similar period. The unusually high quality of the students in some\nways spoiled the class as an experiment, since the real test of the approach\nmust come from a class more nearly typical.\n\nIn one respect the unusual composition of the class heightened the value of\nthe experiment and imposed a severe test. The course was already under criti-\ncism from other departments because it was a beginning course for seniors and\ngraduate students. They doubted if the course would have a sufficiently high\nintellectual content, even though they were not aware that it was being de-\nliberately made much simpler (in one sense at least) than our sophomore\ncourse. To make matters worse, three of the graduate students had had\nprevious work in economics. Nevertheless, no effort was made to step up the\ndifficulty or the intellectual content of the course. It was taught just the same\nas if the students were sophomores.\n\nAt the end of the course the students were asked to fill out an anonymous\nquestionnaire, and their answers showed clearly that in their opinion the con-\ntent of the course was worthy of them. One question asked, ^What students\nShould be permitted to take the course? Check one or more.\" The categories\nwhich followed were: freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors, graduate stu-\n\n\" A.

The reason\nfor so dividing the discussion is this: It is more effective and more stimulat-\ning for the student to read and listen to men with vigorous opinions than for\nhim to read and listen to a scholar who says, \"some people say such-and-such,\nand others say so-and-so.\" It is hard for anybody to do justice to a side of the\nargument which he himself does not believe; moreover, the teacher can better\nplay the role of the impartial scholar who clarifies issues and brings to bear\nindisputable facts and principles.\n\nThe key to success in using outsiders lies in asking them not to give a\nlecture but to answer questions and participate in a give-and-take discussion.\nThis greatly reduces (and often eliminates) the need for advance preparation\non their part and greatly increases their willingness to participate. Further-\nmore, discussion is better than a lecture because the teacher can direct what is\nsaid so that it ties in with the rest of the course.'?\n\nThe ideal textbook for the part of the course just described would be short\nand simple, leaving room for a large amount of outside reading selected to em-\nphasize principles and to represent different points of view.

T4e Economics of Everyday Life?\nNone of these three little books, excellent as they are in many respects, will\nquite do. They give short shrift to some important ideas. The discussion of\nbasic economic ideas is not in the context of American policy problems. A\ntextbook is helpful because it can ensure systematic coverage of the main ideas\nof economics; but it should be short, making room for extensive outside read-\nings, because a textbook suffers from inherent limitations. The writer of a text\nnever writes it because he has something vital to say. Textbooks at their worst,\ntherefore, have a deadening effect which is not wholly absent from the best\nof them. Furthermore, a long textbook means that the arguments on all sides\nof controversial issues are presented by one man. As was argued above, this\nkills off the stimulus obtainable from controversies, It is better to assign read-\nings by men who are sincerely arguing their own points of view.\n\nOne last requirement of the ideal text: it should be written in a lively, in-\nformal style.

In\nthis context an outsider is anyone not currently teaching the course in question and may\nbe a faculty colleague within or without the economics department, or an alumnus, a\nvisitor brought to the campus for other purposes, or a local union leader, government\nofficial, business man or newspaperman with a special knowledge of the issue to be dis-\ncussed. Such people are happy (and complimented) to be invited to air their views.\n\nLarger schools are apt to have multiple sections of the elementary course, multiplying\nthe problem of finding enough outsiders, but the resources of the larger schools are also\nlarger. It would be helpful for sections given in the same quarter to meet together when\nan outsider is present.\n\n? Chandler, op. cit.; A. C.

Two principles should govern its selection: it should contribute, directly\nor indirectly, towards the matters we are trying to teach; and it should all\nbe simple enough to be readily understood. Ideas which are either irrele-\nvant or difficult (or both) clutter up many textbooks and keep the student\nfrom concentrating on the main points\u2014and in extreme cases keep him from\nknowing what the main points are.\n\nIn applying the principles already discussed to specific course organiza-\ntion, it will be convenient to assume that value and distribution theory will be\nput at the end of the course, leaving the justification of this procedure till\nlater, and discuss how the first half or (better) two-thirds of the course can\nbest be organized.\n\nSelection of the price mechanism as the major idea does not imply that it can\nserve as the unifying theme. Unfortunately, economics has two branches,\nmicroeconomics and macroeconomics. The price mechanism belongs primarily\nto the former and cannot be successfully used to unify the course. As a unify-\ning theme I propose the question of what kind of economy does America want,\nwith special emphasis on how far Americans want to rely on the price mecha-\nnism. This does not mean a course in comparative economic systems. The\nissue in America is not between capitalism, socialism, and communism. The is-\nsue is what mixture of free enterprise and government interference is wanted.\nIn other words, there are a number of specific policy problems, each of which\nis part of the over-all problem.\n\nAfter a preliminary discussion of the goals of economic policy to encourage\nthe students to start thinking through what goals they want, the course starts\nwith a statement of the over-all problem in terms of the functions of prices\nin a free-enterprise economy. Then it goes on to a series of specific policy prob-\nlems: price supports for farm products; monopoly; TVA; unions (with spe-\ncial emphasis on wages); personal distribution of income; inflation; depres-\nsion; foreign economic policy. At the end of this part of the course there is a\nfinal discussion of the over-all problem. The teacher (and the textbook, if there\nis one) concentrates on basic facts and ideas, getting just far enough into the\npolicy problems to state the issues and show how basic economics is related\nto them.\" Formal economic theory is kept to a bare minimum; abstract dia-\ngrams are omitted altogether.\n\n*' Each teacher should have his own list of basic ideas. Mine follows: specialization and\ndivision of labor; the price mechanism; the *law\" of supply and demand; price competi-\ntion as an essential part of a free enterprise economy ; the definitions of monopoly, oligopoly,\nperfect competition, and monopolistic competition; the marginal idea (but not the full\nrange of marginal analysis); opportunity cost; the distinction between microeconomics\nand macroeconomics; the process by which banks create money; the loose relation between\nthe money supply and the price level; the methods by which a central bank influences the\nmoney supply; the cumulative process of the business cycle; national income concepts;\nthe distinction between real and money income; a simplifed Keynesian model; the de-\npendence of exports on imports; the definitions of progressive, proportional, and regressive\ntaxation; the definition of a public utility; equilibrium; the tendency for economic in-\nstitutions to change; the value judgments on which Americans seem generally agreed;\nsignificant differences in value judgments among Americans; objectivity in economics; an\nelementary conception of the methodology involved in simplifying assumptions; and the\nfundamentals of interpreting charts and statistics.\n",

This result is enhanced by the practice of stating theory in\ndiagrammatic as well as verbal form, so that the student has to learn every\nidea twice; and it is further enhanced by the common misconceptions of stu-\ndents as to what theory is all about, particularly the unrealism of the as-\nsumptions. Diversion of the students' attention from the main point is not an\ninevitable consequence of teaching theory; but it is an inevitable consequence\nof trying to teach too much theory.\n\nIt is, of course, a simplification to assume that all the material of an ele-\nmentary course can be neatly classified into three types: a single crucial idea,\na limited number of significant ideas, and those lesser ideas which students for-\nget immediately. In reality, there is a continuum. Some students learn and\nretain more than others; moreover, it may be underestimating students'\ncapacity to assume that most of them can make only one idea part of their\npermanent active thinking. The three kinds of material shade off into each\nother.\n\nMy candidate for the runner-up spot is the creation of money by banks.\nThis, irrespective of what conclusions one may draw from it, seems to me\nthe single idea which most illuminates the problems of depression and infla-\ntion. It is not difficult to give it considerable emphasis. It can be taught once\nby itself, emphasized again in connection with the F'ederal Reserve banks, re-\nemphasized when discussing business cycles, touched on in connection with\nthe theory of employment, and brought in once more in connection with inter-\nnational trade.\n\nNow let us consider the second type o\u00ed material, the significant ideas\u2014and\nfacts\u2014which the students are expected to know at the time of the final\nexamination but which will afterwards fade from their memories. Some stu-\ndents will have an active, writing knowledge of them all at the time of the\nexamination and will retain some of them indefinitely; others will never get\nmuch more than a passive, reading knowledge of them; this difference gives\nthe basis for diversity of final grades. Every teacher should have his own list\nof ideas. Students vary in ability from college to college and even from one\nyear to the next. The extent of the list must be adjusted to their abilities.\nWhat we aim to teach must vary with our students. Moreover, strict uni-\nformity among teachers, even where students of the same ability are involved,\nwould hardly be advisable; progress is made by each teacher thinking for\nhimself and exchanging the fruits of thinking. But it is important that the\nteacher have such a list, that he make up his mind how much he is trying to\nteach; otherwise, the danger of teaching too much (or too little) is enormously\nincreased. It is our indecision about the content of the course that Taylor and\nHewett in the passages cited above rightly criticized. The principles under-\nlying such a list should be these: the ideas should be important in themselves;\nthey should be limited in number; where possible they should contribute\ntoward teaching the price mechanism.\n\nTo avoid overloading a course, we must not only decide what we are aiming\nto teach but must also be careful about the third (supplementary) kind of ma-\n",

Two possible misunderstandings\nmust be avoided. Teaching how the price mechanism works does not mean\nadvocating it: the point is that the citizen needs to understand the price\nmechanism if he is to understand most of the big economic issues\u2014\u00edree en-\nterprise vs a controlled economy; monopoly; the tarif\u00ed, farm policy; wage\npolicy; controlling inflation by monetary policy vs price control.\n\nThe other possible misunderstanding concerns the level at which the price\nmechanism is taught. I have in mind a very elementary level, the level at which\neducated people who are not economists are apt to talk about economic prob-\nlems; in other words, the level of Chapters 10 and 11 in Chandler's A Preface\nto Economics, or pages 36-40 (together with pages 14-17) of Samuelson's\nEconomics, or Chapter 9 in Burns, Neal and Watson's Modern Economics?\nEven at this level, educated people are woefully ignorant. A brilliant faculty\nmember, who has several advanced degrees and has studied a little economics,\nlistened to a lecture in which Frank Knight touched on rent control in an ele-\nmentary way; in the discussion period afterward, he asked a question which\nshowed he did not understand that price can act as a rationing device if it\nis free to seek its own level. This was no blind spot in the thinking of a single\nman. It is typical.\n\nIt is commonplace that repetition is an important aid to learning. Few stu-\ndents have the steel-vise type of mind which needs contact with an idea only\nonce in order to master it. But the billboard advertising kind of repetition,\nwhich reiterates the same message in the same words, will not work with college\nstudents. We must keep coming back to the same idea but always with a new\ntwist, a different context, a fresh application. This is not difficult to do in a\ncourse organized around policy problems, for each new problem involves a new\napplication of the basic idea of the price mechanism. This is true even in\nmacroeconomics. In the field of monetary policy, interest rates are prices; and\nKeynesian analysis is a reply to the contention that prices free to fall, particu-\nlarly wage and interest rates, would ensure full employment.\n\nIn the elementary course, formal economic theory, far from contributing to\na basic understanding of the price mechanism, is ordinarily a positive hin-\ndrance. The logic of theory is so difficult for most sophomores that they are\nforced to concentrate their full attention on it; even so, they wind up with\nSuch a slight grasp\u2014at best a reading knowledge rather than a writing knowl-\n\n?L.

The full-year course described in this note\nfulfills this requirement in the process of attaining its other objectives.\n\nII. Content of the Course\u2014First Part\n\nThe statement quoted earlier from Hewett says that the content (as well\nas the objectives) of the elementary course should be reduced.? Apparently\nthe other members of the sub-committee did not disagree with this half of his\nargument; and to judge by some of the textbooks on the market, in many\ncases it is only too true. On the other hand, some textbooks (and presumably\nsome courses) make the opposite error: in the effort to simplify the analysis\nand cut down on content, they eliminate important ideas. One reason for the\nperpetual dissatisfaction with elementary texts is that those that give an ade-\nquate statement of important ideas are overloaded; and those that are ad-\nmirably simple give short shrift to some of the main points.\n\nHere I want to make a suggestion which I have not noticed in the Report on\nteaching economics: that we organize the course on the basis of explicit as-\nsumptions about how much economics students can learn in one course. Al-\nthough this suggestion is simple and obvious, it could help in solving the\nproblem of how much content to put into the elementary course. It would be\nbetter, of course, if we had scientific knowledge about how much students can\nlearn; but that would require long and extensive research, for which an\neconomist is not particularly well equipped. It is far better to proceed on the\nbasis of our guesses than that we not think about the matter at all.\n\nIt is common knowledge that students retain precious little permanently;\neven for examination purposes they know only a small fraction of what we\nteach. Moreover, a great deal of what they learn is not learned well enough\nfor them to use and apply it independently. To make this clearer, let us apply\nto economics the kind of distinction made in foreign languages between a read-\ning knowledge and a speaking (or better, writing) knowledge. It is much\neasier to learn to read a foreign language than write it. Similarly, it is much\neasier to learn to read (or hear) an economic discussion with understanding\nthan to speak or write about it afterwards or apply the ideas to a new context.\nWe should not despise a reading knowledge of economics. The role of the\neducated citizen in a democracy is not to be an expert on all things but to\nknow enough so that he can follow the arguments with some understanding\nand to choose among the experts when they differ. It is not important that the\ncitizen be able to explain the process by which banks create money; and\neven if he does not remember that they can create money, it is helpful if the\nidea is familiar enough to him so that if he listens to a speech by Senator\nDouglas, a brief reminder will bring it back to him. But of course a writing\nor speaking knowledge of economics is better.\n\nI propose the following working assumptions: that if we succeed in giving\nmost of our students a writing (or speaking) knowledge of one important\nidea which he will retain permanently, we shall accomplish more than most\ncollege courses; that students can learn only a limited number of ideas and\n\n?

Such problems as inequality\nof income, monopoly, depression, inflation, restrictions on foreign trade, and\ninternational monetary arrangements have troubled America since the found-\ning of the republic. Most of them are not restricted to free enterprise econ-\nomies; they are inherent in asy kind of economy.\n\nBut though the problems themselves endure, their context constantly\nchanges. For this reason, there is little enduring value in a course which puts\nits whole emphasis on a thorough discussion of current issues. In a free society\nthe best we can do is to clarify the issues for the student, arouse his interest,\nand give him some tools of analysis to help him make up his mind. Our aim\nshould be to stimulate his interest, not satisfy it. If we use just so much dis-\ncussion of the great issues as helps us most to get across ideas and principles,\nwe shall have gone as far as is wise toward teaching the issues themselves.\n\n3. To acquaint students with basic economic facts and. institutions. Some\nknowledge of facts and institutions is indispensable to teaching ideas and is\nworth while for its own sake. The question is how far should we go. In a\ncollege course, such information should be subordinated for several reasons:\ncollege students come to us with a greater store of information than we com-\nmonly realize; such information is constantly becoming out of date; and we\nought not to sacrifice principles to description. If we aim at teaching ideas,\nusing policy problems as a vehicle, it will take very little care to ensure that\nthe course contains sufficient facts for this purpose.\n\n4. To get students to think through their economic value judgments. 'To\nmake up their minds on economic issues, students have to have value judg-\nments. It is better that they consciously decide what they want and resolve\ncontradictions than that they adopt goals uncritically and unconsciously.\nClearly, a course in elementary economics cannot also be a course in philoso-\nphy, religion, and ethics; but clearly also economic goals are too specific to\nbe left entirely to other parts of the curriculum. The elementary course ought\nto encourage students to think through what goals they want policy to pursue.\n1f, as is argued above, we want policy problems to loom large in the course,\nit will require very little care and no extra time to do this. It takes no extra\ntime because to teach the significance of economic ideas we must clearly dis-\ntinguish between means and ends.\n\n5. To help achieve the general objectives of a liberal arts education. ^\nliberal arts college has many objectives; I shall discuss only one: to acquaint\nthe student with the heritage and ideals of the West. In economics this does\nnot mean inculcating the principles of nineteenth-century free enterprise, but\nit does mean teaching what those principles were, together with the leading\ncriticisms of them that have led Americans to modify greatly their economy.\nOn the one hand, the student should not be ignorant of traditional ways of\nthinking; on the other hand, he should be their master, not their slave.\n\n6. To prepare students for advanced courses. Usually there is only one\nelementary course, which must do alike for those who will go no farther and\nfor those who will take advanced work.?

They quite rightly argued that different objectives are not necessarily\ninconsistent. Although the elementary course is often over-loaded, the prob-\nlem is not to cut down on the number of objectives but to find ways of\npursuing them simultaneously. There is, however, an important problem of\nemphasis: we must decide which objective is most important. The following\ndiscussion lists the main objectives, assesses their relative importance, and\nexplains how they can be reconciled:\n\n1. To teach important ideas. 'The Subcommittee on Elementary Courses in\nEconomics sent out some questionnaires, one of which dealt with teachers'\nopinions as to how the course should be taught. The answers apparently mean\nthat to a majority of us the most important specific objective is to get across\nbasic economic ideas or principles.5 It is not clear to what extent teachers\nreach this common conclusion for the same reason. Very likely the consensus\nhides a large measure of disagreement. But there is one reason to which many\nwill subscribe: the elementary course is most likely to be of permanent value\nto students, especially to those who take no more economics, if it concen-\ntrates on basic ideas. Institutions change; the context of policy problems\nchange; but the basic ideas we want to teach in an elementary course today\nwould have been useful fifty or a hundred years ago; and we have faith that\nthey will go on illuminating economic problems for a long time to come.\n\nEconomic ideas are only half-taught unless the student is shown why they\nare important and how they can be applied. Now, their importance stems\nprimarily from their power to illuminate problems of government policy.\nHence, the teaching of ideas could not be divorced from discussion of policy\nproblems even if the latter were not itself an objective.\" Furthermore, a great\ndeal is lost if the ideas are taught in the first semester and their applications\nare deferred to the second. Ideas can be more effectively taught if the ideas\nand their applications go hand-in-hand. This means that a course designed to\nteach principles should really be oriented around policy problems.\n\nPolicy problems can serve the teaching of principles in another way\u2014by\nstimulating interest. We economists are interested in economics for its own\nsake; our beginning students are not. For them, policy problems are intrinsi-\ncally more interesting and can be a vehicle for arousing their interest in ideas.\n\n2. To develop an intelligent interest in policy problems.

An economist writing on economic education confines himself to his\nown limited experience and his own limited thinking, and he does not bother to\ninquire whether he is saying anything new. This is not to say that there are no\ncontributions in the Report cited. On the contrary, there are many valuable\nones, and all teachers of economics should be grateful to those who devoted\ntime and energy to preparing the Report.

It is impossible to say how much was lost or foregone by the union's\ninsistence on the principle of the guarantee.\n\n? Whether or not the wage plans developing in the auto industry become a pattern for\nother industries is highly conjectural. The annual improvement factor which was intro-\nduced in this industry five years ago has not spread. On the other hand, health and welfare\nand pension programs have developed in the past few years on a fairly widespread basis,\nbut they have an appeal for all workers since old age is inevitable and sickness and ac-\ncidents are uncertain. The insecurity arising from possible layoff is not so generalized or\nuncertain and many workers and their unions will not favor using their bargaining\nstrength for objectives which do not benefit the majority of the membership. In many\nindustries unions have already decasualized income among members by decasualizing em-\nployment through job control and the hiring hall or dispatching office. Such unions are not\nlikely to bargain for supplementary unemployment compensation at the expense of other\npossible gains. In industries in which employment is highly sensitive to seasonal or cyclical\nfactors and where the union does not have job control, privately negotiated supplementary\nunemployment compensation may be more likely to become a major bargaining issue.\nThe auto industry is the first major industrial area where management has accepted the\nresponsibility for maintenance of workers! incomes.\n\n*' The author is assistant director of the Institute of Labor Economics, University of\nWashington.\n",
                    "in the auto industry have not as yet (October 1955) announced an increase\nin the prices of cars, and this probably will not occur until new models are\nintroduced. Even if the prices are raised it would be virtually impossible to\nassert that the increase exactly covered the cost of the new wage plan since\nlabor costs are affected by other changes in wage rates, fringe benefits, etc., in\nthe new contract. Undoubtedly the cost of the guaranteed wage would be an\nimportant causal factor in inducing a price increase if such occurs.\n\nWith a guaranteed wage plan such as that of the Ford Company, the income\ntransfers which are likely to occur will be a mixture of those discussed above.\nThere may be some slight increase in the stability of employment in the com-\npany, causing the transfer among workers. In part the 5 cents per hour won\nat the bargaining table for this guarantee was at the expense of some other\ngains which might have been won;? and thus some workers have foregone in-\ncome which they might have had. On the other hand, the 5 cents per hour was\nprobably in part a net additional gain to the total wage package, and, since it\nnow represents a new dimension to the contract which must be bargained for,\nit may result in future net gains to the wage package. Thus the other forms\nof income transfers will be likely to result.\n\nThe types of income transfers which we have discussed are not new in our\neconomy since similar transfers occur with the various state unemployment\ncompensation programs, and they produce desirable stabilizing effects on the\neconomy. If the UAW-Ford settlement should become a pattern for other\ncollective bargaining negotiations, and this is by no means certain,!^ these\ntransfers would become far more important in our economy. The fact that\nseems to be overlooked by unions and their membership when they negotiate\nfor guaranteed annual wages, particularly of the UAW-Ford type, is that they\nare bargaining for income transfers, some of which they may not approve.\n\nPururP.

There may also be shifts among the auto\ncompanies as shares of the market change with price increases. These changes are not\nstrictly transfers, as they generally result from a decline in total output rather than a\nredistribution of that output.\n",
                    "The remaining cases assume the other extreme, which in fact appears more\nlikely, that the pattern of production through time remains unaffected by the\nguarantee. Several cases emerge, depending on whether the direct cost of the\nguarantee (2.e., the 5 cents per hour contribution) is in addition to or is in lieu\nof a wage increase. In the latter event two types of transfers occur. The first\nis simply a transfer over time, the workers receiving the income at one period\nof time which they contributed at another. The second is a transfer among\nthe workers from those who are employed relatively more to those who are\nlaid off relatively more. This probably means a transfer from workers with\nmore seniority to those with less since the latter are more likely to be laid off.\nIdentified in this way, the more senior workers may not have preferred to\nforego a possible wage increase in order to maintain the income of less senior\nworkers. They might prefer spreading the work rather than the income.\nUntil such time as the trust fund reaches 85 per cent, a senior worker will\nunder most circumstances be eligible for more benefits than a junior worker as\na consequence of the provisions described in the table of cancellations of\ncredits. However, the fact remains that the less senior workers are far more\nlikely to be drawing benefits. Once the trust fund reaches 85 per cent the\ntransfer of income from senior to junior workers is, of course, more obvious.\n\nNext let us assume that the cost of the guarantee, 7.e., the 5 cents per hour\ncontribution, is in addition to any other wage benefits which might have been\nwon at the bargaining table. Then various groups are forced to transfer in-\ncome to workers whose income is sustained by benefit payments. If the guar-\nentee had been negotiated only with the Ford Motor Company in an industry\nsuch as the auto industry the transferors would undoubtedly become the\nstockholders in so far as payments into the trust fund come from profits. This\nmay mean a reduction in corporate retentions rather than dividends, of course,\nbut this still represents a transfer from the stockholders.*\n\nSince a similar guarantee has been negotiated with other major firms in the\nindustry, it is quite possible that the firms involved may raise the price of\nautos to compensate for the additional 5 cents per man-hour cost.\" In this case\nthe transferors become the buyers of the product, presumably the auto-con-\nsuming public, perhaps to some extent automobile dealers.

                    "doubtedly not practicable. In fact, if changes in production or merchandising\nwhich would significantly increase stability of employment were economically\nprofitable in the auto industry, they would have been made regardless of the\nguaranteed wage commitment. Stable production brings large cost reductions\nper unit of output both in savings on overtime and premium labor rates and\nin better utilization of capital equipment. The nature of the market demand,\nhowever, precludes the profitable possibility of substantial changes in stability\nof employment. However, it should simply be borne in mind that to the extent\nthat greater stability of employment ensues asa result of the guarantee,\nworkers, more or less, pay for their own guarantee by transferring income\namong themselves.\n\nTo the extent that stability of employment over the year reduces the capital\nrequirements per unit of output it results not only in cost reduction to the\nfirm but also in a transfer of income from other factors to labor. In the auto\nindustry, however, capital-output and capital-labor coefficients are not com-\npletely variable, resulting in what is sometimes referred to as \"lumpiness of\ninvestment.\" It could hardly be expected, for example, that the Ford Motor\nCompany would reduce the number of assembly plants even if it could sta-\nbilize its production over the year. However, they might defer adding new\nplants with the growth in the market, thus altering the capital coefficients.\n\nChanges in the capital-labor coefficients may result for a different reason\nthan the stabilizing of output. It has been argued* that in the auto industry\nthe guarantee may be expected to reduce the rate of substitution of automatic\nequipment for labor, thus resulting in a transfer of income from producers of\nthis equipment to workers (transferees) or a deceleration in the rate of trans-\nfer from workers to these producers. The argument here is somewhat obscure\nand really is concerned with the rate of substitution of capital for labor rather\nthan the ultimate or desired capital-labor ratio. The increase in the relative\nprice of labor under the guarantee and the fact that it becomes a partially\nfixed cost reduces its relative desirability as a factor, thus tending to cause\nan increase rather than a decrease in the ratio of capital to labor. However,\nthe existence of an obligation for 26 weeks lay-off (in this case severance)\npay to workers who would be displaced by the introduction of labor-saving\ncapital equipment makes the introduction of that equipment appear less profit-\nable. Changing payroll cost into a partially fixed or sunk cost makes the cal-\nculation of the profitability of introducing new equipment in place of labor\nanalogous to the problem of replacement of obsolete but usable equipment\nwith new, more ef\u00fccient equipment. The firm must recognize that the old\nmethod of production (whether it be with the existing capital-labor ratio or\nwith old machinery) is cost-free as far as the fixed cost factor is concerned,\nwhereas the amortization cost of the new method is a real cost to be incurred.\nIn our case this means that in so far as is practicable substitution of capital\nfor labor would proceed at a rate consistent with market expansion and attri-\ntion of the labor force, but that substitution at a rate in excess of this would\nbe retarded by the guarantee commitment.\n\n*S.

The\nanalysis has dealt with the impact of such a plan on the cost structure of the\nfirm or industry (including the element of risk), on the profit position, on\ninvestment expenditures, on the flexibility and stability of production and\nemployment, on the mobility of labor and various other aspects a\u00edfecting the\nfeasibility and desirability of such plans. However, much of this analysis is\ninappropriate to the guaranteed wage plan negotiated by the UAW and the\nFord Motor Company. The feasibility and desirability of this plan can per-\nhaps best be determined by examining the plan in the context of transfer pay-\nments.\n\nIf a specific group of auto workers receive an income under the terms of\nthe UAW-Ford wage plan which they would not have received in the absence\nof the contract, and if the plan does not result in an increase in production and\nhence in national income, then the additional income received by these workers\nmust be simply a transfer from some other group. It is certainly not expected\nthat the UAW-Ford Company wage guarantee will result in significant in-\ncreases in output over a year's period, and hence all payments resulting from\nthe plan are really income transfers. The desirability of the plan from the\nstandpoint of all parties concerned depends in large measure on who the\ntransferors are, i.e., who gives up income. It is the purpose of this note to\nidentify the transferors under the UAW-Ford plan given certain assumptions\nconcerning the effects of the plan. Although the following discussion refers to\nthe specific plan negotiated by the UAW and the Ford Motor Company, most\nof the analysis is applicable to other guaranteed wage proposals.\n\nThe essential features of the UAW-Ford contract as they affect the transfer\nproblem are as follows. The company agrees to contribute to a trust fund at\nthe rate of 5 cents per hour for each employee hired until the trust fund\nreaches a figure of $55,000,000, known as 100 per cent trust fund position.\"*\nAfter this position is reached the company will contribute, at the same rate,\nonly when necessary to maintain the fund in this 100 per cent position. This\ncontribution to the fund is the sole and maximum financial liability of the\ncompany under the plan.\n\nEvery worker who has a year of seniority will be eligible to apply for bene-\nfit payments from the fund according to the credits he has accumulated.\nWorkers will acquire credits at the rate of V4 credit per week of work of 32\nhours or more until June 1957 and 77 credit per week thereafter. Credits may\nbe accumulated to a maximum of 26. When the worker is laid off he becomes\neligible, after a waiting period of one week, for payments from the trust fund\nwhich supplement his unemployment compensation. The total of his unem-\nployment compensation and his supplementary payment will be 65 per cent\nof his weekly take-home pay for four weeks, and thereafter 60 per cent of\ntake-home pay. The credits which the worker has accumulated are canceled\n\n* Actually there are two trust funds, one for workers designated as defense workers and\none for other workers. The terms of the agreement are the same for both funds, however.\nThe $55,000,000 maximum is applicable to the two funds taken together.\n",

The drive on the part of unions in the\npostwar period for greater economic security for their members has already\nresulted in a spectacular growth of fringe benefits to workers and costs to\nemployers in the form of pension programs, health and welfare programs,\nannual improvement factors, etc. The Ford settlement adds to this list of\nfringe benefits an employer-financed supplementary unemployment compensa-\ntion program.\n\nThe term \"guaranteed annual wage\" has been used to refer on the one hand\nto certain specific wage plans! under which workers are in a sense hired by\nthe year instead of by the hour or week and, on the other hand, as a generic\nterm for any wage plan which provides for maintenance of the workers! in-\ncome for *a fairly long period into the future.\"?

This effect may be divided into two parts.\nThe first is the reduction in the real amount of goods and services available\nfor domestic use that will result from the removal of the import surplus; this\neffect of exchange rate adjustment on the standard of living Haberler referred\nto as the \"primary\" burden. But the change in exchange rate would ordinarily\nalso affect the country's terms of trade and therefore result in either an addi-\ntional or \"secondary\" burden if the terms of trade are worsened, or a \"secon-\ndary\" benefit if the terms of trade are improved. And to assess the effect of\nexchange rate adjustment on the standard of living, both of these burdens or\nbenefits must be considered.\n\nSmith points out that in the case in which the conditions for stability in the\nforeign exchange market are not satisfied, so that improvement of the balance\nof payments will necessitate exchange appreciation, the terms of trade will\nimprove to such an extent as to overbalance the direct effect of the removal of\nthe import surplus, thus bringing a net improvement in the standard of living.\nBut even in the \"normal\" case in which the foreign exchange market is stable\nso that depreciation improves the balance of payments, this improvement may\nbe accompanied by a bettering of the terms of trade, thus offsetting in part\n(or in the limiting case, entirely) the *primary\" burden on the standard of\nliving. \"This will happen if the product of the elasticity of foreign demand for\nexports and the elasticity of the domestic demand for imports exceeds the\n\n!

This paper is\nintended to help clarify some of the underlying issues and to begin\nto provide a theoretical basis for their analysis.\n\nMany of the underdeveloped areas of the world have large agrarian\npopulations in which there is either persistent open unemployment\nor in which the marginal productivity of the working force is so low\nthat it is commonly believed that withdrawal of a sizable fraction\nwould not significantly affect output. This seems to be the case to\nvarying degrees for much of Asia and the Middle East. Other countries,\nsuch as Italy, show persistent urban as well as rural unemployment\nor underemployment. It is a common feature of the unemployment in\nthese countries that it fails to respond to fiscal policy measures designed\nto increase employment by stimulating effective demand. Use of con-\nventional income-generating techniques appears in fact to create infla-\ntionary pressures and balance-of-payments difficulties long before full\nemployment is approached.\n\nThis interpretation of the condition of many underdeveloped areas\nhas led to the formulation of a number of alternative explanatory\nhypotheses which are presented in Section I. One of these hypotheses\nappears, at this stage of investigation, to be particularly fruitful in\ncasting light on some of the outstanding characteristics of under-\ndeveloped areas and is elaborated in Section II. Two approaches to\nthe problems of empirical testing of the hypotheses are outlined in\nSection III.\n\n*'The author is assistant professor of economics, on leave of absence from Brandeis\nUniversity, and presently research associate at the Center for International Studies, Massa-\nchusetts Institute of Technology.

So far, however, only one empirical\napplication seems to have been published.?\n\n'The closely related f*'transportation model\" has won a prominent\nplace in the linear programming literature and has been applied suc-\ncessfully to the shipping problems of some industrial concerns. In this\nmodel, specified quantities of a commodity are to be shipped from each\nof a number of sources and other specified quantities are to be received\nat each of a number of destinations, total receipts being equal to total\nshipments. The receipts at each market are determined in advance and\ndo not depend upon price.

There are several comments, however,\nthat might usefully be made.\n\nWright states that *one major qualification\" is necessary to the tables he\npresents on the sterling countries! yearly positions with respect to the dollar\npool. This qualification is that because of the intrasterling-area transactions\nin \"dollar-saving exports\" the country figures, even if perfect? would not\nshow the \"true contribution\" which each country has made to the problem of\nthe entire sterling area's dollar shortage.?\n\nI think that there is a more important qualification that needs to be made.\n'The contribution a sterling-area country is making towards the solution of\nthe entire sterling area's dollar shortage must be measured not only by its\nbilateral position vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar area but by its global balance of pay-\nments. This latter provides a measure of the degree to which the country\nmakes necessary a drain on the external resources of the area or contributes\nto building up the external resources of the area. Note, for example, that in\n\n! Am, Econ. Rev., Sept. 1954, XLIV, 557-76.\n\n? Wright mentions that the dollar accounts of the sterling-area countries other than\nthe United Kingdom are underestimated when these countries do not take account of\ndollar zoods received through intermediaries in the United Kingdom. The share of the\nUnited Kingdom is also exaggerated because: (a) The dollar cost and proceeds of goods\nthat undergo processing in the United Kingdom and that enter into intrasterling-area\ntrade are allocated to the United Kingdom in the U.K. balance of payments accounts;\n(b) The whole of the British oil companies! production expenditure in dollars is allo-\ncated to the United Kingdom in the British accounts though much of the output is\nconsumed in the rest of the sterling area; (c) Dollar investment in the rest of the sterling\narea by American companies often appears in the balance-of-payments statements of\nthose countries (e.g, Southern Rhodesia) as the receipt of sterling.\n\n?

Pakistan's drawings\nare shown as $11 million too high in 1951, and too low in 1952. This is\nprobably because the $11 million gold purchase was ascribed to 1951 while it\nactually occurred in 1952. The same is true of the gold purchase of $11 mil-\nlion by Ceylon. It occurred in 1951 rather than 1950.

Their contribution is\nslightly more than the rise in sterling balances held by the colonies since\n1946, and in effect, represents a rather curious capital movement from the\ncolonies to the United Kingdom in the form of dollar exchange\" (p. 569),\nwhich is later amplified, *For the colonies, however, dollar pooling has had\nserious drawbacks. Lacking autonomy in their own dollar import policies,\nthey have contributed almost $2 billion to the pool in 1946-52 and have\naccumulated sterling balances of roughly equal size during the same period.\nThe colonies have thus been exporting capital to the United Kingdom in the\nform of dollar exchange\" (p. 574).\n\nAs Mr. Wright also states, however, not all the colonies have been net con-\ntributors to the dollar pool. Some have run substantial deficits, and many\nhave not had significant balances either way. Clearly, therefore, they have\n",
                    "To illustrate my point by a particularly fortunate example: in 1953, the\ncolonies, excluding Hong Kong, had a deficit on current account of \u00a315\nmillion, yet colonial sterling balances, excluding Hong Kong, went up by\n\u00a357 million.\n\nThere are some corrections in Table III on page 571 that Wolfgang Weigel\nhas called to my attention: Table III shows a gold and dollar contribution to\nthe central reserves by Australia in 1950 of $24 million. It should be $54\nmillion. The difference is equal to the amount of gold sales to the United\nKingdom which were probably not taken into account. Pakistan's drawings\nare shown as $11 million too high in 1951, and too low in 1952. This is\nprobably because the $11 million gold purchase was ascribed to 1951 while it\nactually occurred in 1952. The same is true of the gold purchase of $11 mil-\nlion by Ceylon. It occurred in 1951 rather than 1950. In 1952, the figure for\nSouthern Rhodesia is $15 million too low, perhaps by reason of the omission\nof gold sales of this amount to the United Kingdom. Footnote 4i of the table\nstates that statistics were not available for several countries, among these\nIceland and lraq: regional balance-of-payments data are available for Ice-\nland in the Balance of Payments Yearbook of the International Monetary\nFund. Published figures are also available for Iraq for the years 1951 and 1952\nin the Quarterly Bulletin of the National Bank of Iraq, Nos. 3 and 7.\n\nA. M. KAMARCK*\n\n?

In commenting on this question, I\nshall limit my discussion for the most part to the very special case of isolated,\nsymmetrical groups of z rival firms.\n\nIn such cases, Hieser and I agree that the ratio \u2014Eii/E;; \u2014 n \u20141 reflects\nthe \"numbers\" criterion to at least a fair approximation (p. 376). We also\nagree that the classification of market relationships requires a \"substitution\"\ncriterion as well. We differ, however, in that I prefer the own elasticity E;; for\nthis purpose, while Hieser prefers the cross-elasticity E;;. At bottom, this dif-\nference between us is definitional; but it is well worth debating which defini-\ntion is the more useful analytically. For my part, I acknowledge that the cross-\nelasticities E;; and Ei; indicate the substitutability between the ith and jth\nproducts; and Hieser seems to agree, in turn, that Ei; reflects what I called\nthe \"total substitutability\" between the ith product and all others taken to-\ngether\u2014or all others within the relevant group when there is no significant\nsubstitution between the ith product and others outside that group (p. 375).\nWe would further agree, I take it, that both \"'total substitutability\" and the\n\"individual substitutability\" between pairs of products have their own respec-\ntive significances. It remains, therefore, for me to indicate my reasons for pre-\nferring Ei; as the more useful substitution criterion for the specific purpose of\nclassifying market relationships. I am especially grateful for the opportunity\nto do so; for Hieser's note has made me belatedly aware that I have never\ngiven anything like a complete explanation of my choice in this respect.\n\nIn reply to the first round of criticisms of my article, it was necessary for me\nto emphasize that a remarkably close approach to pure competition is con-\nsistent with very large magnitudes of E;;, provided only that \u2014Zi; is all\nthe larger\u2014such that \u2014E;;/Ej; \u2014 n \u2014 1 is also large.* At the same time, I\nalso observed that \"'cross-elasticities are not necessarily high in atomistic com-\npetition.\"? This goes to the heart of the question as to the relative merits of\nEi; and Ej as the preferred criterion of product homogeneity or heterogeneity\nin the context of market classification. I must now emphasize that a remark-\nably close approach to pure competition is also consistent with very small\ncross-elasticities, provided that \u2014 E;;, while itself very large, is small relative\nto n\u2014such that \u2014E;;/(n \u2014 1) \u2014 Ej; is small?\n\n! *Reply,?

FnisroE*\n* The author is assistant professor of economics at the University of Florida.\n\nThe Growth of American Unions: Comment\n\nThe most challenging conclusion in Irving Bernstein's recent article! is that\n\"The conventional monocausal explanation for fluctuations in union member-\nship, the business cycle, is without general validity.\" Bernstein attempts to\nshow statistically that neither cyclical movements as a whole nor leading com-\nponents of the cycle (specifically consumer prices, employment, wholesale\nprices, and industrial production) correlate significantly with unionism. He\nfurther concludes that cyclical changes are \"useless\" in understanding secular\nexpansion in union membership and only sporadically helpful in respect to\nshort-term changes.\n\nOn the affirmative side, Bernstein summarizes his findings as follows:?\nA multicausal system (including the cycle) is necessary to account for\nthe rise of trade unionism. The primary forces that have shaped secular\ngrowth are the expansion of the labor force, growing social acceptability\nof unionism, increasing homogeneity in the working class, and extension\nof collective bargaining provisions for union security. In the short run\nmembership has expanded sharply as a consequence of wars and very\nsevere depressions. Unions, in other words, have been the beneficiaries\nof disaster.\n\nAlthough we do not quarrel fundamentally with Bernstein's pluralistic\nexplanation of union growth, our analysis leads us to conclude that he has\nminimized unduly the importance of the cycle in a multicausal system. We\nhave assumed, as does Bernstein, that the business cycle may be adequately\nrepresented by the four series: cost of living (consumer prices), employment,\nwholesale prices, and industrial production. Bernstein found no meaningful\nrelationship between \"real\" union membership (;.e., the number of union mem-\nbers corrected by the size of the labor force) and any of the four economic\nfactors cited.\n\nIn our investigation, we deemed it more reasonable to examine the relation-\nship between the growth of unions during a given time period with the char-\nacteristics of the business cycle during the previous time period rather than,\nas in Bernstein's analysis, for the same time period. A time lag is reasonable\nbecause on the downturn union members rarely fall away at once and on the\nupturn it takes time to launch organization drives to attract new members and\nregain former members.\n\n!

The rate of increase in total membership over the long run is\nunlikely to equal the rate for the postwar period, with actual setbacks occur-\nring during periods of declining business activity. The future is, however, very\nuncertain and any conclusions must necessarily be highly qualified and tenta-\ntive.\n",

As indicated above, these structural changes were one\nof the most important factors making possible the great union expansion from\n1933 to the end of the war. There is, however, no reason to suppose that future\nstructural changes will be so fortuitous from the standpoint of organized labor.\nThe increasing complexity of our industrial system, the expansion of govern-\nmental functions, and rising real incomes are bringing about a decline in the\nmanual segment of the labor force, that segment which has furnished the only\nfertile field for the union organizer. The South, and other areas of anti-union-\nism, have been expanding industrially relative to those areas which are more\ncongenial to organized labor. The ultimate result of this development may be\nto lessen greatly the currently strong and widespread anti-union sentiment in\nthese areas, but there is no assurance that this will be the case. A trend toward\nwide decentralization of industry in the not too distant future is a definite\npossibility. By shifting industry toward the smaller communities, such a\ndevelopment would increase substantially the organizational problems of the\nunions. These few examples of possible future developments suffice to indicate\nthe fallacy of assuming that future structural changes will benefit, or will not\nbe detrimental, to organized labor. It is possible, and in the writer's opinion\nprobable, that they will create a continuously less favorable environment for\nthe unions. In any case, conclusions concerning the future growth of the\nAmerican labor movement based upon an analysis which does not include con-\nsideration of this important factor do not warrant a high degree of confidence.\n\nIn drawing upon historical evidence to support his contention that unionism\n\"will suffer little or no loss in bad times\" the author fails to consider the fact\nthat, in comparison with past decades, a very much higher percentage of union\nmembers are now concentrated in those very industries which are most subject\nto cyclical decline. In 1950, the United Automobile Workers, Steelworkers,\nand Machinists alone comprised nearly 20 per cent of the total of organized\nlabor, and these same three unions were responsible for over one-third of the\ntotal increases in membership which occurred from 1948 to 1953.* Also at pres-\nent a much higher percentage of total membership is made up of workers in the\nunskilled and semiskilled groups than was true during most of the period under\nstudy by Bernstein. These workers are not as likely as skilled workers to retain\ntheir membership during periods of layoff. It seems reasonably certain, there-\nfore, that a major decline in the level of business activity would substantially\nreduce union membership. Even the relatively mild and short-lived recession of\n\n1949 reduced union membership by 200,000.\n\n*Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Directory of Labor Unions in the United States,\n1949; BLS, Directory of Labor Unions in the United States, 1953.\n",

It is quite\npossible that certain weaknesses in Bernstein's analysis may have misled\nhim into an overoptimistic appraisal.\n\nIn his analysis of the growth of the American labor movement Bernstein\nwas concerned entirely with the determinants of the long-run trend and failed\nto consider the special circumstances which may have conditioned the growth\nduring particular periods. This was especially unfortunate with respect to the\nperiod 1933 to 1946, since the highly favorable environment making possible\nthe phenomenal growth of organized labor during these years is unlikely to\nexist again in the future. By 1933 the stage was set for a great union advance.\nPopulation growth and industrialization had created a pool of millions of\nindustrial workers, largely concentrated in the urban centers, and for reasons\nthat are well known these workers were almost entirely unorganized in 1933.\nThus a tremendous potential existed at the beginning of this period. Within\nthe climate of opinion toward group action created by the psychological impact\nof the depression, industrial unionism and the protection of a benevolent gov-\nernment provided the immediate stimuli for union growth. As a result, millions\nof workers flocked into the unions. The industrial expansion during the second\nworld war created additional millions of jobs in those industries which lend\nthemselves readily to organization, or which were already highly organized,\nthus providing further impetus to the union movement. In the postwar period,\nhowever, the labor movement has lost its momentum. Those segments of the\nlabor force most susceptible to organization had by 1946 been fairly well\nexploited, and the postwar campaigns to penetrate those areas and those labor\ngroups less amenable to unionization have met with only very limited success.\n\nThe great expansion of employment in the construction industry and in\nother industries which lend themselves readily to organization has made possi-\nble continued growth in the postwar period; however, since the membership\nincreases have been concentrated primarily in these industries, the over-all\nincrease has not been impressive. According to the estimates of the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics, membership in labor organizations rose from 15 million to\nbetween 1614 and 17 million, an increase of only two million or less, during\nthe period 1946-53.? During this same period employment in nonagricultural\nindustries increased by 8.5 millions. This experience is in sharp contrast to the\nwar years (1940 to 1945) when organized labor drew 5.9 million additional\nmembers into its ranks while employment in nonagricultural industries rose by\nonly 6.2 millions? If the estimates of the Bureau are accepted as a reasonable\napproximation, the conclusion seems inescapable that a future large-scale\nunion advance will be unlikely unless organized labor is successful in pene-\n\n?

Irving Bernstein advanced persuasive\nargument, supported by considerable historical evidence, in support of the\ncontention that the future of the American labor movement is quite bright.\nHe cited figures to show that the trend of membership of organized labor was\nsteadily upward during the period 1897 to 1953, not only in absolute terms,\nbut also relative to the increase in the size of the total civilian labor force.\nThis secular trend in real membership\" (membership as a percentage of the\ncivilian labor force) is explained by the operation of four factors: the expan-\nSion of the labor force, the growing social acceptability of trade unionism,\nincreasing homogeneity in the working force, and the extension of collective\nbargaining provisions for union security. His investigations led him to believe\nthat these same four factors are likely to be operating in the future, assuring\nthat organized labor will *grow steadily in the long run.\" It is apparent that\nto \"grow steadily in the long run\" encompasses a very wide range of possi-\nbilities, but it is clear from the entire context of the article that Bernstein is\noptimistic concerning the prospects for the future growth of organized labor.\nBernstein also analysed the relation of the business cycle to union growth,\nand concluded that unionism will \"suffer little or no loss in bad times.\"\n\n*I.

However, changes in the cost-of-living index and changes in industrial\nproduction individually seem to bear the strongest relationship to changes in\nunion growth.\n\nIn order to evaluate the joint relationship between the changes in the four\ncharacteristics of the business cycle and changes in union growth, the multiple\ncorrelation coefficient has been computed. We find that R \u2014 .481 and this is\nsignificant at the 5 per cent level. This indicates that there is a relationship\nbetween changes in the growth of unions during a given time period and\nchanges in the four variables related to the business cycle during the previous\ntime period when all of these variables are considered at the same time.\n\nThe foregoing analysis does not purport to show that the growth of unions\nmay be completely explained by business cycles.

FnisroE*\n* The author is assistant professor of economics at the University of Florida.\n\nThe Growth of American Unions: Comment\n\nThe most challenging conclusion in Irving Bernstein's recent article! is that\n\"The conventional monocausal explanation for fluctuations in union member-\nship, the business cycle, is without general validity.\" Bernstein attempts to\nshow statistically that neither cyclical movements as a whole nor leading com-\nponents of the cycle (specifically consumer prices, employment, wholesale\nprices, and industrial production) correlate significantly with unionism. He\nfurther concludes that cyclical changes are \"useless\" in understanding secular\nexpansion in union membership and only sporadically helpful in respect to\nshort-term changes.\n\nOn the affirmative side, Bernstein summarizes his findings as follows:?\nA multicausal system (including the cycle) is necessary to account for\nthe rise of trade unionism. The primary forces that have shaped secular\ngrowth are the expansion of the labor force, growing social acceptability\nof unionism, increasing homogeneity in the working class, and extension\nof collective bargaining provisions for union security. In the short run\nmembership has expanded sharply as a consequence of wars and very\nsevere depressions. Unions, in other words, have been the beneficiaries\nof disaster.\n\nAlthough we do not quarrel fundamentally with Bernstein's pluralistic\nexplanation of union growth, our analysis leads us to conclude that he has\nminimized unduly the importance of the cycle in a multicausal system. We\nhave assumed, as does Bernstein, that the business cycle may be adequately\nrepresented by the four series: cost of living (consumer prices), employment,\nwholesale prices, and industrial production. Bernstein found no meaningful\nrelationship between \"real\" union membership (;.e., the number of union mem-\nbers corrected by the size of the labor force) and any of the four economic\nfactors cited.\n\nIn our investigation, we deemed it more reasonable to examine the relation-\nship between the growth of unions during a given time period with the char-\nacteristics of the business cycle during the previous time period rather than,\nas in Bernstein's analysis, for the same time period. A time lag is reasonable\nbecause on the downturn union members rarely fall away at once and on the\nupturn it takes time to launch organization drives to attract new members and\nregain former members.\n\n!

The rate of increase in total membership over the long run is\nunlikely to equal the rate for the postwar period, with actual setbacks occur-\nring during periods of declining business activity. The future is, however, very\nuncertain and any conclusions must necessarily be highly qualified and tenta-\ntive.\n",

He pointed out that the charge\nagainst du Pont of having monopolized cellophane involved two ques-\ntions: *1. does du Pont possess monopoly powers; and 2., if so has it\nachieved such powers by *monopolizing! within the meaning of the Act\nand under United States v. Aluminum Company of America [?]\" He\nconcluded that \"unless the first is decided against defendant, the second\nis not reached.\"* Judge Leahy did not need to reach the second question\nfor he found the defendant not guilty. In doing so he concluded that\n*[f]acts, in large part uncontested, demonstrate du Pont cellophane is\nsold under such intense competitive conditions acquistion of market\ncontrol or monopoly power is a practical impossibility.\"* In reaching\nthis conclusion Judge Leahy reviewed at length evidence introduced by\nthe defendant to show that du Pont behaved like a competitor, not like\na monopolist. The court found that du Pont conducted research to im-\nprove manufacturing efficiency, to reduce cost of production, and to\nimprove the quality and develop new types of cellophane. It promoted\nthe development and use of packaging machinery that could handle\nboth cellophane and other flexible wrapping materials.

It\ncame from Malthus and led him to support the tariff on grain. The\nidea is worth examining because it helps to understand a historical\nperiod and some current issues as well, and the occasion is appropriate\nbecause of the continuing interest in all aspects of Malthus' work.'\n\nThe reasoning is fairly simple. Suppose, as Malthus does, that the\nworker is an agricultural laborer who is paid in corn and that he re-\nceives the same quantity when the price is high as when it is low. He\nconsumes some of the corn and exchanges the rest for other goods.\nAs the price of corn rises and the prices of other goods (some of them\nsubstitutes for corn) do not rise as much, the worker can do two things:\n(a) He can consume the same quantity of corn as when its price was\nlow and exchange the rest for a larger quantity of other goods. (b) He\ncan reduce his consumption of corn, because it has become relatively\nexpensive, and consume a larger quantity of other goods, because they\nhave become relatively cheap. His welfare again will have increased,\nbecause he will have a quantity of corn plus other goods which together\nyield him as much satisfaction as corn alone yielded when its price was\nlow, and in addition he will have a larger amount of other goods than\nhe had when corn was cheap.\n\nConversely, as the price of corn falls and brings his money wages\ndown with it (7.e., the money value of a constant quantity of corn),\nwhile the prices of other goods do not fall or fall less, there is a decline\n\n* The author is associate professor of economics at the University of Illinois in Chicago.\nHe wishes to thank T.

Such possibilities reveal the\nsubstance of Buchanan's remark that a general tax may lower, increase, or\nleave the rate of return unchanged. In other words, a given government dis-\nbursement program can exert a set of effects that may offset, intensify, or\nswamp the effects of a given tax. I do not deny the possibility. But I fail to\nsee that this is a basis for holding that it is improper to analyze separately the\neffects of taxes from the effects of other fiscal acts. Therefore it appears to\nme that Buchanan's methodological point remains an assertion.\n\nSeparate analysis of distinct fiscal acts, however, requires abstraction. If\nBuchanan is only saying that abstraction must be done carefully, I will agree\nwith him. If he means that abstraction is pointless, I will not agree because\nI am not antitheoretical. I will admit, however, that the particular *com-\npensating variation\" I chose\u2014a reduction of personal income taxes and an\nincrease of transfer payments\u2014;nay a\u00edfect the rate of return in the manner\nBuchanan asserts or assumes. But before I admit the point, I would like to\nsee a definitive demonstration of it. I invite Buchanan to undertake an\nanalysis of the capitalization and rate-of-return effects of personal income\ntaxes (and transfer payments). If he does, I am willing to bet that he will\nhave to analyze income taxes in isolation from other taxes and fiscal acts.

                    "There are two answers to Buchanan's methodological criticism: First, I\ncould suggest that those who, like Buchanan, criticize the work of others (like\nmyself) because we do not take account of what is done with the tax proceeds,\nshould develop a theory of government spending. Then we could put the\nseparate theories together and have a more satisfactory treatment of fiscal\neconomics than we presently have. A theory of debt management and a theory\nof transfer payments would also be necessary to take care of Buchanan's\ncomplaint, because the proceeds of any given tax may be used to retire gov-\nernment debt or to pay pensions.\n\nThe second answer is that it is impossible to determine what is done with\nthe proceeds of any given tax under modern monetary institutions. The dollars\na given tax raises go into a cash balance, which is augmented by the proceeds\nof other taxes, bond sales, and the sale of government-provided goods and\nservices. From this cash balance the government spends and thus acquires\ngoods and services, it retires debt, and it makes transfer payments. If\nBuchanan means that the analysis of a given tax should encompass an analysis\nof every possible use that may be made of tax dollars, he is asking for a\ncompletely integrated theory of fiscal economics, the formulation of which\nmust transcend the separate examination of distinct fiscal acts and of taxes\nas such.\n\nFor the time being I choose to concentrate on taxes alone, and on excise,\ncorporate, and property taxes in particular. This choice rests on the feeling\nthat each tax exerts effects which are peculiar to the given tax, and that these\neffects are important. Moreover, I feel that the effects of any given tax are\nindependent of what is done with the proceeds of that given tax.\n\nlf taxes do exert effects peculiar to themselves and independently of what\nis done with the tax proceeds, then it is methodologically legitimate to ignore\n(or abstract from) \"what is done with the money,\" even if we know in fact\nwhat is done with the specific dollars raised by a particular tax, which we do\nnot. \"These effects of taxes are a consequence of shifting their money burden\n(a tax's \"income effect\") and the ramifications of that shifting process\nthroughout the price system. The shifting process is complex. It merits\nintensive analysis. It is difficult\u2014for most of us at any rate\u2014to treat such a\ncomplex process and simultaneously develop theories of government spending,\ndebt management, and transfer payments.\n\nBuchanan states that: *The net effect of the fiscal action on the net yield\nof capital is held to be determined primarily by the productivity of the state's\nusage of the funds relative to the alternative productivity of these funds in\nprivate employments in the absence of the tax.\" This is Einaudi's argument.\n(1f the adverb \"primarily\" is taken seriously, the statement really means that\ntaxes are relatively unimportant\u2014it is what the government does with the\nmoney that is vital. But this is only an assertion.) What this statement more\ngenerally means may be illustrated by the following example. Suppose the\ngovernment imposes a general excise tax of $10 billion. It simultaneously\nincreases, say, its peanut-purchasing program by the same amount. The tax\nper se, as I had hoped that I had demonstrated, will lower the rate of return\non investment.

                    "the rates of return people use for capital budgeting purposes directly reflect\npersonal income taxes (and transfer payments). Frankly, I had never con-\nsSidered these as likely consequences of personal income taxes (and transfer\npayments). Moreover, I doubt that personal income taxes have these effects.\nRather, I prefer to go along with Irving Fisher and make a sharp distinction\nbetween the earnings of things, particularly nonhuman resources, and the\nmoney people receive because they own things\u2014including themselves and\nclaims that entitle them to transfer payments. It was the earnings of things,\nspecifically the agencies for which it is meaningful to keep capital accounts,\nand the behavior of people toward things with which my analysis dealt. If\nthe distinction between the earnings of things and the personal income of\nprivate individuals is relevant, and the logic and justification for capital\naccounting rests on this distinction, then it seems appropriate to hold that any\nforce which reduces asset earnings will lower the capitalization rate even\nthough the disposable income of private individuals somehow remains un-\nchanged\u2014provided, of course, we accept a productivity\" theory of capitaliza-\ntion rate determination.\n\nNevertheless it may be possible that a reduction of personal income taxes\n(and an increase of transfer payments) in combination with the imposition\nof a general excise tax will have the effect on asset earnings and the capital-\nization rate which Buchanan asserts. I would not be dogmatic about the point.\nIf Buchanan should be correct, then all I can say is that I made an unhappy\nchoice of a *compensating variation\"; and that Buchanan's interpretation of\nthe particular combination of fiscal acts I used may be a better one than mine.\nHowever, had I used some other *compensating variation\"\u2014like the reduction\nof a hypothetical poll tax\u2014to by-pass the deflationary impact of excise taxes,\nmy analysis of the capitalization effects of excise taxes would have been the\nsame. But had I done so, Buchanan no doubt would have \"demonstrated\"\nthat my \"neutral\" poll tax was not neutral after all.\n\nYet it is not clear that Buchanan himself really believes that personal in-\ncome taxes (and transfer payments) directly affect the capitalization rate and\nasset earnings relevant for individual behavior toward assets. Rather, his\nassertions about this substantive issue seem to be his way of *demonstrating\"\nthe superiority of his methodology of tax analysis over mine. The main point\nof his remarks is that it is improper to consider the effects of a given tax as\nsuch independently of an examination of the effects of offsetting government\ndisbursements, including changes in other taxes. The tax analyst must take\naccount of what is done with the proceeds of the given tax he examines. It is\nmy view that it is legitimate to consider the effects of a tax as such, in isola-\ntion from other fiscal acts. I do not feel it necessary to take account of what is\ndone with the money in order to say anything about a given tax. Matters of\nmethodology are often matters of taste, and most of us are inclined to let each\nman go his way. But there is a widespread tendency in the field of government\nfinance for people who belong to the \"what is done with the money?\" school\nto criticize the work of those of us who choose to examine each fiscal act in\nisolation because we do not employ their methodology. I freely plead guilty\nto the charge.\n",

Two problems are\ninvestigated that have not been fully explored before: (a) the effects\nof introducing explicit assumptions about producers! expectations, and\n(b) the problem of the full utilization of the capital goods produced.\n\nThe models studied are the simple model that was introduced by\nHarrod' and the modification of this model that was suggested by\nHicks.\" In the original model, Harrod assumes that consumption de-\npends only upon current income, whereas investment depends upon the\ndifference between current income and last period's income. Accord-\ning to this model, the national income must always grow at a rate that\nHarrod calls the \"warranted\" rate. However, Harrod considers his\nmodel to be very unstable because any departure from the warranted\nrate of growth will be followed by an even greater departure from this\nrate, instead of being followed by a return to the warranted rate. In\nhis explanation of this instability, Harrod is forced to depart from his\noriginal model and consider the role of producers! expectations and the\npossibility of unintended investment.\n\nProducers! expectations modify the analysis in two ways: (1) the\nquantity of goods produced for either consumption or investment pur-\nposes does not depend upon the realized level of current income, but\nrather upon the level of income that is expected when the production\nplans are formulated; (2) there will be unintended investment if pro-\nducers' expectations about the level of current income are not realized.\nIt is then reasonable to assume, with Harrod, that producers will seek\nto compensate for this unintended investment in later periods.

                    "Reply\n\nProfessor Gordon's comments are directed toward two points. The first\nconcerns the nature of the handicap which interrelatedness imposes on an\neconomy. The second involves the causes of the apparent backwardness of\ncertain British industries. Let us take up these points in turn.\n\nIt is Gordon's position that \"sunk costs,\" even accompanied by interre-\nlatedness, cannot be considered a handicap. He contends that if the older\neconomy (A) did replace its obsolete capital, it would be on the same footing\nwith the younger economy (B). Since it chooses not to replace on rational\ngrounds, i.e. since it prefers its present situation, obsolete capital and all,\nthat choice may indicate an advantage over B. Relatedly, the persistence of\ntechnically obsolete equipment may be required by economic efficiency. Where\nthis is so, such equipment must be regarded as an advantage, not a liability.\n\nSidestepping for the moment the question of the significance of interrelated-\nness, these contentions are correct. Indeed, my article says nothing to the\ncontrary. Directly or by implication it recognizes the same points,! and these\npoints are entirely consistent with the main propositions developed in the\narticle.\n\nA restatement of a part of my argument in somewhat di\u00edferent form may\nclear up the trouble. Consider two economies, A and B, identical in all\nrespects but one. A has some rather ancient plant and equipment in use,\nwhile B has no capital stock at all. Is A better off or worse off because of this\ncircumstance? Ordinarily, some equipment, even old equipment, is better than\nnone. Moreover, with technological change A has open to it an alternative\ndenied to B: It can continue with its old equipment, or any portion of it, if\ncost analysis indicates that solution to be the economic one. The presence of\n\n' They are, in part, explicitly recognized in the last paragraph beginning on page 300,\nand in footnote 37, page 311. They are implicit in the development in Part I on innovation\ncriteria. If, by these criteria, it is not profitable to replace, the industry or economy must\nbe better off economically to continue with its old equipment, and this old equipment\n\nmay give it an advantage over another industry or economy which has very little capital\nStock, old or new.\n",

It is clear that in investigations of the pro-\nductivity problems of this industry the issue has usually not been explicitly\nraised, and in some cases, the opposite has been assumed.!? In a world where,\non the one hand, the low-wage countries such as India and Japan are\ndominating the export market in cotton textiles, and where, on the other\nhand, the British shipbuilding industry, for example, is losing orders due to\nlack of facilities and long delivery dates, to give official encouragement to\nthe investment of scarce capital resources in the cotton textile industry may\nrequire some second thoughts.

Just\nas the existence of obsolete equipment in a particular industry may indicate\nan advantage for a region as a whole, so the high-wage difficulties of the\nBritish cotton textile industry indicate the same. In both cases the resources\nhave more productive alternative opportunities.!*\n\nIn the belief that difficulties are caused by obsolete sunk capital due to,\nor together with lack of entrepreneurship, much capital equipment may be\ninvested in faltering industries. There is some evidence that such waste has\nbeen encouraged by official policy toward the British cotton textile industry\nfor example.\" If, instead, the difficulties are the result of a variety of en-\nvironmental factors, wiser policy would dictate a shift of capital and labor\n\n?5 To speak of cotton textiles as a single industry vastly oversimplifies the picture. For\nhigher quality cotton products the situation may be different. But for the greatest part of\nthe 7 billion square yards of cloth that Britain exported in 1913 (out of an output of\n8 billion) her advantage was bound to disappear. Tari\u00ed\u00eds have been another external\nfactor. I am interpreting \"environmental\" as including the configuration of world markets\nand supplies over which a particular region has no control.\n\n\"There is ample evidence that the British cotton textile industry has kept informed\nof technical progress elsewhere. The United States Productivity Team Report on The\nBritish Cotton Industry (London, 1952) concludes: \"Three weeks of mill visits and inter-\nviews convinced us that the cotton industry in Lancashire lacked no technical information\nthat would increase productivity. Reading the reports by, and talking with members of,\nthe British missions which had visited the U. S., India, Japan, Sweden, Italy, and the\nmachinery fairs on the Continent proved to us that they had the world's technical informa-\ntion at hand. Our visit to the Shirley Institute (British Cotton Industry Research Asso-\nciation) showed us that it was equipped to undertake to solve any technical problem\nreferred to it by members of the industry\" (p. 8). The fact that an industry suftering\nfrom a Veblen-type backwardness in mental habits would probably not know or care for\nforeign missions or research institutes suggests that something further may be at stake\nwhen technical information is not applied. While advocating re-equipment the Team\ndid find that: *Hypothetical cases based on assumptions as to rates of depreciation for\nnew Lancashire looms at present-day replacement costs and new automatic looms com-\npared with partially or fully written off Lancashire looms always seemed to come out on\nthe side of retaining the old\" (p. 26).\n\nMoreover, it is not sufficient to show that with best practice there is a margin of profit\navailable for innovation. Management everywhere requires a substantial margin for un-\ncertainties, etc., before making new investments, and in any industry with a large number\nof firms, \"best practice\" by definition will not be attained by all. What must be shown\nis that, faced with roughly the same margin of profitability, the British cotton industry\nhas failed to innovate where another (British or foreign) industry has done so. There is\nno evidence in the Productivity Report that such is the case.\n\n\"The complexity of the cotton textile industry makes it difficult to say with certainty\nthat such is the case. Britain may still have a comparative advantage in exporting particu-\nlar cotton specialties. On the other hand, it may be significant that appeals to the industry\nhave been couched in terms of national rather than individual profitability. In the absence\nof a compensating divergence between marginal private and marginal social profitability\nthis would indicate waste. It is true that the fixed price of foreign exchange probably\nunderstates its social value, but this would not indicate the desirability of investment\nin cotton textiles as opposed to other export industries.\n\nIt may, therefore, be just as well that the price system apparently has been stronger\nthan such exhortations. New capital does not appear to have been invested in the industry\nto the extent of the government's wishes, and management has complained of the \"short-\nage\" of labor due to the attractiveness of other industries.

To begin with, to some extent the \"stagna-\ntion\" of the British economy is an appearance created by comparisons with\nGermany and the United States. Once the industrial techniques had spread\nit was inevitable that the growth of economies with larger populations and/or\nraw material bases would create the illusion that the originally industrialized\ncountry was stagnating.'?\n\nWhile it is no doubt true that particular industries in Britain have actually\nexperienced a decline, the explanation will be found in all probability in the\nenvironmental reasons rather than in the facts of interrelatedness, techno-\nlogical or institutional.'? In the British coal industry, for example, the rela-\ntive lack of rich resources is obviously a fundamental handicap.'* In cotton\ntextiles, the situation is only slightly more complicated. The comparative ad-\nvantage given this British industry during the first half of the nineteenth\ncentury was essentially transient. As Britain entered the upward spiral of\nmore saving, more capital, more income and more saving, she became, for-\ntunately of course, a high-wage economy. But as it turned out, when the\ntechniques had spread, the nature of this industry gave low-wage countries\na comparative advantage. Even in low-income societies there is a large\ndomestic market for textiles. With small capital requirements and little\nskilled labor needed one would hardly expect cotton textiles to be an industry\n\n?' Of course, it could be argued that the gains in a more primitive economy being greater,\nthe risks are less and the capital less hesitant. But this being true for a particular industry\nonly indicates A's over-all advantage, since the same capital resources, as mentioned above,\ncan be devoted to other industries.\n\n\"' Frankel, I am sure, would not deny the significance of the environmental factor as\na partial explanation of the British case, although I presume he would object to my\nsuggestion that it is suificient. In this note it can be no more than a suggestion.\n\n?Tt should be unnecessary to point out that German per capita output has not as\nyet surpassed that of Britain despite a resource picture which, if anything, favors the\nformer. In the United States the resource pattern is enormously superior, and we do not\nhave any evidence that over-all per capita output has not been superior since colonial\ntimes,\n\n5 | am fully conscious that the paragraph that follows in the text is no adequate substi-\ntute for serious industry analyses.\n\n^ [ronically, the British themselves seem to believe that dif\u00fcculties in coal stem, at least\nin part, from ine\u00edficiency. Thus it seems to be agreed between the two major parties\nthat nationalization was necessary because the industry was \"inefficient.\" In this, Labour\nprobably claimed too little while the Conservative Party granted too much. \"Inefficiency\"\nas it happens to strike particular industries constitutes a bad argument in favor of a\ngeneral theory of socialization or private enterprise. Surely the fact that this \"inefficiency^\nstruck a signi\u00fccant majority of all coal mines, while it appears to leave unscathed the\nmajority, say, of chemical plants, suggests that something more profound is at work.\n",

Thus the labor skills,\nmanagerial know-how and administrative organization may be adjusted to\nthe old equipment and difficult to change.\n\nA particularly acute form of this blending occurs where the different com-\nponents of an interrelated process have separate owners. In these circum-\nstances, faced with an innovation in one component, the firms have three\nalternatives. They may (1) remain separate but through price adjustments\nbe induced to switch over their equipment; (2) one firm (not necessarily\nthe owner of the obsolete component) may buy out or compete with his\nprevious customers and suppliers; or (3) they may do nothing. Frankel\nsuggests that the first may not occur because the gains must be great to be\nspread, while the risks devolve upon the innovator alone. The second will\nnot usually occur because the potential integrator may be handicapped by\nlack of knowledge, uncertainty, lack of financing or pre-emption of the field\nby others. So Frankel concludes that *not least likely\" is the third case. Since\nthe innovation \"would require solution of problems external to the firm, the\nfirm might justifiably disregard it, just as it disregards all those events to\nwhich it has no power to adjust.\"?\n\nBut the question is not whether in actual fact, with interrelatedness or\nwithout it, innovation is performed by errorless mechanical maximizers in an\neconomy with perfect flexibility of prices and fluidity of labor and capital.\nBy comparison with such models any actual economy operates with institu-\ntional rigidities and want of enterprise. Again, as in the case of sunk costs,\nthe fact that it is easy to imagine a better situation constitutes no valid\nargument for the view that an economy is handicapped. Because Frankel\ndiscusses the diffculties of the mature industrialized economy alone, he\nsuggests this irrelevant comparison. The real question is whether the mature\nindustrial economy is handicapped by comparison with others. Are the insti-\ntutional rigidities that obstruct economic adjustments more effective in a\nmature industrial economy than they would have been if it had continued\nin its previous state? More important, are they more effective than in its\npre-industrial neighbor?\n\nOnce the question is put in this perspective it is probably obvious that\nthe industrialized economy has a substantial institutional advantage. Con-\nsider the older industrialized region A with obsolete plants and patterns of\nownership, and with labor and management resistant like most humans to\ndisturbing changes. But on the other hand, region B perhaps has a largely\npeasant economy with handicraft manufactures controlled by mercantile\ninterests. In these circumstances interrelatedness, particularly that between\nhabits of thought and techniques, is likely to be a much more powerful\nhandicap to innovation in B. Again, A's innovators (perhaps in old estab-\nlished firms) may have difficulty getting sufficient liquid capital from depre-\nciation reserves, or overcoming the doubts of the controllers of the financial\ninstitutions that mobilize the wealth produced by A's early industrialization.\nHowever, surely capital-raising is far more difficult in pre-industrial B with\n",

If the in-\ndustry in region A previously had markets in A, B, and other areas to itself,\nthen the new competition may lower prices, incomes and capital values. The\nregion may lose some of the advantages that it had expected would continue\nand its income may fall to a lower level. But this does not constitute a burden\ndue to earlier industrialization or due to the existence of the obsolete equip-\nment. For had the earlier industrialization not taken place, and were the\nobsolete equipment not in existence, the existing level of real income would\nbe lower still. The burden is the new competitive situation and its causes,\nenvironmental or institutional. Rather than inquire as to why the new com-\npetitive situation has arisen, why the industry originally domiciled in A is\nnow growing in B, and why, therefore, the industry in A has fallen on leaner\ndays, superficial observers may point to the obsolete capital equipment as the\ncause. It is the effect of the difficulty, not the cause.\"\n\nBefore departing from these assumptions, one particular case should be\nindicated in which it would be legitimate to say that a region has suffered\nfrom an early industrial start, and that this hardship is due to interrelated-\nness. As Frankel has thoroughly demonstrated, interrelatedness increases the\nlikely rate of obsolescence. Suppose in a particular case the increased cost due\nto this increased obsolescence was not foreseen at the time the investment\nwas made. Suppose, secondly, that the investment was close enough to the\nmargin of profitability so that, had this increased obsolescence due to inter-\nrelatedness been foreseen, it would have lowered the expected rate of return\nbelow the critical level and caused the investment plans to be abandoned.\nSince in fact this increased obsolescence was not foreseen the investment has\nturned out to be uneconomic. The early industrialization was a handicap in\nthe sense that it wasted capital resources a\u00a3 that time. It is still true that the\nmere existence of the inefficient interrelated equipment at the present time is\nnot a current handicap compared to any other region. Of course, all this is\nonly a logical possibility. In the case of Britain surely the major part of the\ncritical investment during its industrialization was economic despite all sub-\nsequent obsolescence, and this conclusion is strengthened when we consider\nonly the increased obsolescence due to interrelatedness.*\n\nThe second part of Frankel's argument requires that we change our as-\nsumptions. We revert back therefore to the realistic world from the assumption\nof absolute management efficiency. Frankel's argument is that interrelatedness\nmay exist not only among the physical components of the productive process,\nbut also between these physical components on the one hand, and institutional\n\n' By abstracting from new entry in the old region Frankel avoids the really significant\nquestion as to why the old firms have to meet competition from new firms in the foreign\nregion only.\n\n* Except in the highly unlikely case suggested in this paragraph, Frankel's conclusion\nthat interrelatedness \"under usual conditions can have distorting influences upon costs,\nprices, competitive strength, income distribution and future rates of growth . . .\" which\nconstitute a. \"real penalty . . . for . . . early industrial leadership,\" is highly misleading\nas to the true nature of the cost of obsolescence. It would be more accurate to say that\nlike all components of investment cost\u2014like the original labor cost, say, of the equipment\u2014\nobsolescence affects, not distorts, these variables.\n",

Secondly,\nit will suggest the sufficiency of alternative explanation for the phenomenon\nFrankel seeks to explain through interrelatedness.\n\nTo show that \"sunk costs\" even accompanied by interrelatedness cannot be\nconsidered a handicap, let us imagine an old industrialized region, A, along\nwith another region, B, in the very process of industrializing with more\nmodern equipment. To abstract from other effects, let us further imagine\nthat the old, interrelated and technically obsolete industry in region A is con-\ntrolled by an ideally efficient management, and that there are no divergences\nbetween social and private profitability. Now also assume that A's industry\nis obsolete in the sense that if it were to be built today it would be built\ndifferently, but has some economic value since the improvements have not\nbeen sufficient to make it worthwhile to replace. Since if A did replace,\nA and B would clearly be on the same footing, the fact that in our case A\ncould renovate and yet chooses not to on rational grounds, is indicative of her\nrelative advantage. This conclusion follows regardless of interrelatedness.*\n\nSuperficially region A may appear to be in a bad way. If the innovation is\nlabor-saving then output per man-hour in this industry will be less than in\nregion B, and hasty observers of this statistic (for one industry) may be\nexpected to view with alarm. But this obsolete equipment cannot itself be a\nhandicap save in the trivial sense that it would be better if it could be re-\nplaced at no capital cost. For while the industry in A has higher labor costs,\nit has lower capital costs. The capital goods industry which in B is equipping\nthe new industry is available in A for adding equipment (and increasing labor\nproductivity) in other industries. Paradoxical though it may appear, under\nour present assumptions the persistence of the technically obsolete equipment\nwith its lower labor productivity (in that industry) is required by economic\nefficiency and may indicate relative economic advantage. (Of course, it may\nalso indicate a disadvantage for other institutional or environmental\nreasons.)9\n\nIt is also true that the industry in A and possibly the whole of region A\n\n*\"Interrelatedness\" refers to the fact that real capital may be made up of a number\nof components such that they cannot be replaced separately, but only on an all-or-nothing\nbasis.\n\n*[ am presuming that when we speak o\u00ed a \"handicap\" of industrialization, we mean a\nhandicap relative to some other possible situation; either the situation of the same country\nhad it not industrialized or the situation of another nonindustrialized country. An\neconomy is not handicapped in a meaningful sense merely because it is possible to\nimagine a more advantageous situation for it.\n\n*'There is one possible though unlikely qualification to the generalization that existing\nequipment cannot be a handicap. If the old equipment is to be replaced, and if, for some\nreason, it cannot be simply retained or changed over, but must be demolished at a real\ncost; then, in the absence of salvaged materials of some value, it could be truly said that\nthe mere existence of this equipment is a disadvantage. Moreover, this disadvantage may\nbe due to the increased obsolescence caused by interrelatedness.\n",

                    "Obsolescence and Technological Change: Comment'\n\nAn important problem in the general field of economic development is that\ncertain economies or regions, after experiencing a considerable development,\nappear to falter and be overtaken by other economies, even where the latter\ncome from an initially much more backward position. The classic case is the\nsurpassing of the British economy by the United States and Germany in the\nlate 19th and early 20th centuries. The importance of a correct interpretation\nof this type of phenomenon is so great, both for the purposes of historical\ninterpretation and for social policy, that we are indebted to Professor Marvin\nFrankel for his useful classification of causes.? His own analysis, which deals\nwith \"effects attributable to sunk costs . . . ,\"* can be conceived as an attempt\nto reconcile the view held in common by Veblen, some economic historians\nand many financial journalists, that an older country or region is handi-\ncapped by the presence of obsolete capital equipment, with the alternative\nview implicit in orthodox firm theory, that an entrepreneur in an older economy\nis as free to shift to new equipment as in new economies.

On a number of occasions the railroads have attempted to eliminate\nthis overtime provision of the guarantee, but their attempts were futile.\n\nUnterberger's contention that these guarantees are necessary to maintain\na sufficient supply of labor is an interesting one, but I fail to find, in any of\nwage and rules negotiations of the last 35 years, where the railroads have\npleaded to maintain these guarantees or to increase the guarantees. The\nrailroads have attempted in a number of cases, however, to modify these\nguarantees in order to make them less costly. But should the railroads be\nconcerned about incentives to maintain their supply of labor? In 1918 road\nservice employment reached a peak of over 225,000, and then declined to a\nlow of 127,700 in 1933, the depth of the great depression. By 1944 employ-\nment of road service workers reached its wartime peak of 185,300, which\nwas significantly less than in 1918. And by 1955 employment dropped to\n125,600, a decline of 38 per cent. Is it surprising that the railroads are not\nconcerned about wage guarantees to maintain their labor supply?\n\nUnterberger's point concerning the dif\u00fcculties of getting employees to ac-\ncept promotions from the junior to the senior cra\u00edts fails to impress me. The\nexistence of a compulsory promotion rule does not show that wage guarantees\nare necessary; if anything, it shows that there are some serious defects in the\nbasic wage structure of the industry. I iully subscribe to the findings by an\nEmergency Board that \"It should be possible to revise the rate structure\nto increase daily and annual earnings of the employees and yet reduce labor\ncosts per ton mile and per passenger mile. .. . The Board has concluded that\nthere is imperative need in this industry, and specifically in the operating\nclassifications, for a thorough-going review and modernization of the internal\nwage structure. Indeed, such a review and rationalization is long overdue.'?\n\nIn his comment Unterberger has overlooked a number of significant aspects\nof the wage guarantees in the railroad industry. First, he has overlooked the\nfact that unlike most other industries, the railroads are generally precluded\nfrom eliminating the situations that result in the payment of these guarantees.\n'That is, there is practically no way for the railroad to *beat the system\" and\nnot pay the extra compensation called for by the guarantees. Secondly, he\nomits completely the value of leisure time from his conjecture on the amount\nof earnings necessary to xeep a railroad worker on the job. And thirdly, he\ndisregards the monthly mileage limitation rules, which have the most direct\nbearing on road service employees' earnings and which are specifically geared\nto maintain a supply of labor sufficient to meet the general need of the rail-\nroads.\n",

The employees on\nthe 18-mile run between Boston and Waltham and return would earn 14\nhour pay less, but they would be relieved from duty in 774 hours at their\nhome terminal, whereas the other employees would be relieved from duty\nin 8 hours at a foreign terminal. Both trips have advantages and the choice\nis a purely personal one, not based on some one's preconceived criteria\nas to what determines more desirable work.\n\nLet us assume, for the moment, that Unterberger's assertion that the runs\non which the basic daily rate guarantee is paid involve the least desirable\nwork because of the low earnings opportunities. Is a wage guarantee the\nanswer, or is the answer to make the earnings opportunities greater? As\ndiscussed in my article the creation of interdivisional runs would unquestion-\nably permit employees to earn more than the basic daily rate, but the rail-\nroads are not free to establish such runs. The unions have opposed the crea-\ntion of such interdivisional runs because such runs would relieve some crews\nfrom employment. Are these crews the ones that Unterberger is concerned\nwith when he pleads that the guarantees are necessary to maintain a sufficient\nsupply of labor?\n\nThe guarantee of a daily earnings minimum is applicable to employees\nin passenger service when their earnings are less than a certain level above\nthe basic daily rate. But a passenger service assignment may be far from\nundesirable as compared with a higher paying freight service assignment.\nThe basic day for a passenger service engineer is 100 miles or less, 5 hours\nor less, while for a freight service engineer it is 100 miles or less, 8 hours or\nless. Is a 90-mile passenger run, completed in, say, three hours, less desirable\nthan a 90-mile freight run completed in, say, seven hours? Without any of\nthe guarantees there would be about $1.75 differential in earnings in favor\nof the freight service employees, but a four-hour differential in leisure in\nfavor of the passenger service employees. Imposing the guarantee of the\nbasic day's pay widens the differential to about $1.90. If on top of this is\nimposed the guarantee of the daily earnings minimum, the differential is cut\nto about $1.40. Is not four hours more work by the freight engineer worth\nat least $1.90? Or put another way, is not four extra hours of leisure by the\npassenger engineer worth at least $1.90? The choice is a personal one, but\nit would not be unreasonable to contend that the elasticity of demand for\nincome in terms of effort is likely to be less for older workers with high\nseniority than for younger workers with low seniority.\n\nThe guarantee of monthly earnings is applicable to conductors and brake-\nmen on regularly assigned runs in passenger and local freight service and\nthe rule comes into play when monthly earnings minus overtime earnings\nare less than the guarantee. Two factors should be noted. First, by no stretch\nof the imagination can one consider regularly assigned runs in any service,\npassenger or freight, less desirable than the unassigned runs which are most\nirregular in earnings, hours, days and place of rest. And these unassigned\nruns are a significant proportion of all runs. Secondly, if the guarantee were\n",

In addition, there has been a significant\ndownward trend in the employment of road service employees since the second\nworld war, which indicates a surplus of labor and the lack of need to be\nconcerned about a sufficient labor supply.\n\nLet us next examine the evidence Unterberger offers that the guarantees\nare necessary to obtain a sufficient supply of labor. He states that the assign-\nments on which the guarantees are paid generally involve the least desirable\nwork, and usually offer the lowest earnings opportunities or the most onerous\nworking conditions. Also, because of the undesirability of these assignments\nthey go to employees with the least seniority in the job classification. From\nthese two assertions he draws the conclusion that the guarantees are necessary\nto maintain a sufficient supply of labor.\n\nI beg to differ with both assertions. There is no rigid pattern of promotional\nline from one type of service to another. One finds top seniority men in all\nbranches of train and engine service. Some employees prefer foregoing the\nmore lucrative road service assignments in order to take a yard service job,\nwhich has the advantage of giving the worker a regularly scheduled eight-hour\nday with the opportunity of being home every night. Other employees forego\nthe glamour and ease of a passenger train assignment in order to take a local\nfreight assignment where the hours are exceptionally long but the average earn-\nings are higher than in any other branch of service. And still others forego\nthe regularity of yard service and the high earnings of local freight service\nin order to take a passenger train assignment, where the earnings are less\nthan in local freight service but the hours of work are relatively short.\nWhereas the promotional line is generally considered to be from yard service\nto local freight, to through freight, to passenger service, there are numerous\nexceptions. And one should bear in mind that the lowest step in the promo-\ntional ladder is the \"extra board\" where the engineers, firemen, conductors\nand brakemen work on a first-in, first-out rotational system for all types of\nunscheduled and extra runs.\n\nIn my article (p. 854) I listed eight different runs of less than 100 miles\nthat are completed in less than 8 hours for which the employees receive a\nbasic day's pay as a result of the guarantee of the basic daily rate. Do these\nnecessarily involve the least desirable work? Not necessarily, since they may\nhave advantages over other runs that pay no guarantee. Let us take, for\nexample, the 18-mile run from Boston to Waltham and return, assuming that\nthe time consumed is 714 hours, which means that under the guarantee of the\nbasic daily rate the employees are paid for eight hours. Is this run less pref-\nerable, without the guarantee, than a one-way run of 100 miles consuming\n\n' Carriers Exhibit Nos. 21, 22, 29, and 30, presented to the arbitration board in the\n1954 Engineers 3096 Wage Case, clearly show that the choice of service by the top\nseniority is a purely personal one. More top seniority men select passenger service runs,\nbut there are numerous other top seniority men who select yard service and local freight\nruns. And one will also find some of the lowest seniority men in passenger service.\n",

In that\nevent, the judgment that the current guarantees increase the railroads' operat-\ning costs also would be faulty.\n\nThe author's final conclusion is that, \"the generally accepted principle of\ncompensation for services rendered is violated, and these guarantees have\naspects which one may justly conclude are make-work.\" This is strong\nlanguage. If it should turn out that these guarantees or something equally\ncostly are required to secure efficient operators for the assignments on which\nthey are paid, this would raise great question about whether the principle of\ncompensation for services rendered is, in fact, violated.\n\nWhether they involve *make-work\" depends on what the author means\nby that emotionally supercharged term. Regrettably, no clear definition\nis supplied in this article. In a previous article (Jrdustrial and Labor Rela-\ntions Review, Jan. 1955, p. 193), he defined a make-work rule as *'a working\nrule which shifts the supply curve of labor to the left through a reduction\nin the average output per man-hour\" and then elaborated his concept of the\nsupply curve as being **measured in efficiency units, such as man-miles, so\nthat if the employees reduce their average output, the supply curve, with\nno change in the number of workers, shifts to the left.\"\n\nWhat this seems to say is that without the guarantees employees working\non assignments on which the guarantees are now paid would be willing to\noffer the same number of man-miles of work at lower wage rates or would\noffer a larger number of man-miles at the same wage rates. This is making\nquite an assumption about the likely behavior of road service employees.\nWhat evidence does the author have, in his article or elsewhere, to support\nsuch an assumption?\n\n",

                    "Technological Change, Obsolescence and Aggregate\nDemand: A Reformulation\n\nProfessor Hans Brems has called my attention to a slip in the algebraic\nformulation of replacement demand in my recent article. What I did was\nto carry over the assumption that the ratio of 7D (annual replacement de-\nmand) to &D (the capital stock) is equal to 1/a (the reciprocal of the length\nof life of capital), which I had made in equation (1) where g (the rate of\ngrowth of aggregate demand, D) was assumed to be zero, to equation\n(3) where g need not be zero. However, this cannot be correct in an economy\nfully adjusted to a given (\"equilibrium\") rate of growth, for the age dis-\ntribution of capital is then itself a function of the rate of growth. Where g\nis positive, for example, capital assets acquired a years ago were more nu-\nmerous than the capital assets acquired in any single year previous to the\nyear \u2014a, and hence were a greater proportion of the existing capital of that\nyear than is indicated by the ratio 1/a. Therefore, contrary to my original\nequation (3), replacement requirements of the year 0 would be greater than\n1/a times the capital stock of the year \u2014a.\n\nThe particular formulation in my article would apply only to the case of\nan economy which had been growing for (just) a years but which had pre-\nviously been stationary.

The issue came to the\nfore again in the revival of the customs union controversy a\u00edter the\nwar.' It goes deep and affects some fundamental tenets of tariff theory\nand the theory of value itself. The purpose of the present paper is to\nattempt a reconciliation between those who advocate a lowering of\ntarif\u00ed barriers between complementary economies and those who want\nto facilitate trade between competitive economies.\n\nSince the issue is whether a removal of trade barriers is more bene-\nficial if the freed trade is complementary or competitive, it is neces-\nsary to start with a definition of what is meant by complementary and\ncompetitive goods. In this paper Abba Lerner's definition of comple-\nmentarity will be accepted: 'Complementarities can be positive . . .\nwhere the possession or consumption of one good enhances the satis-\nfaction yielded by another, or negative, where the possession or con-\nsumption of one good is a substitute for another good and diminishes\nthe additional satisfaction it can provide.\"?\n\nIn this sense all goods are complementary to one another, but their\ncomplementarity can be either positive or negative. Where their com-\nplementarity is negative, the goods are substitutes or rival or competi-\ntive goods. Below, complementarity will mean positive complemen-\ntarity, unless specially stated. Goods of negative complementarity will\nbe called competitive goods.\n\nApplied to trade, this definition means that trade will increase satis-\nfaction if it is an exchange of goods whereby each party to the trans-\naction acquires a more complementary assortment of goods in place\nof a more competitive assortment of goods.

Alternatively, if there is an oversupply\nof one of the other factors, a positive elasticity of investment with respect to\nthe interest rate will decrease the use of capital. In either event, the con-\nsequent change in the amount of capital employed will require a corresponding\ndeviation of the rate of income growth from the equilibrium value. It is\nclear, then, that only if the rate of investment is perfectly inelastic with\nrespect to the interest rate can the constancy of the capital-ouput ratio be\ncompatible with the existence of a stable equilibrium rate of growth. Con-\nsequently, the usual assumption of a fixed capital-output ratio in growth\ntheories must imply perfect inelasticity of investment with respect to the\ninterest rate.\n",

The issues raised cannot be fairly discussed, or the treat-\nment fairly summarized; both works are hard to describe or classify. Mr.\nLamont is a philosopher (University of Glasgow) but his book lies rather in\nthe field of psychology, economic psychology. That of Professor Glansdorff\n(Free University of Brussels) is emphatically psychological, to begin with,\nrather on the physiological side. Neither work contains any reference to\npsychoanalysis. In professional psychology there are, of course, many schools\nof thought and method, and the tendency in other fields is for everyone to\nbe his own psychologist\u2014notably in economics. Moreover, value theory is\ndisputed territory, between psychology and philosophy, the latter perhaps\nhaving the prior claim.\n\nFirst as to general coverage. The field of values traditionally includes the\nthree main types or species, \"truth, beauty and goodness,\" a division which\ncannot be critically considered here. Lamont says nothing explicitly about\ntruth or objectivity in general. He disposes of esthetics in three pages (14-18)\nin his introduction, with a few observations at other points. Glansdorff says\nsummarily that truth is not a value (pp. 100 ff.), giving reasons which seem\nto me inadequate as well as vague. As suggested by his title, he devotes one\nof three main divisions of his work (a brief 38 pages, 117-155) to Value in\nEsthetics. The main content of both books is an overhauling of economic\npsychology or, with Glansdorff, more broadly, psychological causality in\neconomics. Lamont's view of morals will be noticed later; Glansdorff explic-\nitly omits consideration of this field, *in order to finish the present work\"\n(Introduction, ie, Avertissement, p. 14 admitting that \"application\" to\nmorals is strongly called for, and promising this in a later work (in his final\nsentence). Lamont mentions (p. 296) an earlier book of his on Principles of\nMoral Judgment (which I have not read). At this point I may regretfully\nsay that I cannot place either of these books on a list of *must's\" for Ameri-\ncan economists.

We have witnessed a number\nof fluctuations in consumer spending\u2014some of considerable importance\n\u2014which could not be explained by the level of, or changes in, con-\nsumer incomes. One of the most striking instances was the recession in\ndiscretionary consumer spending in 1951, at a time when personal\nincomes were rising. Another was the sharp increase in the level of\nconsumer spending in the winter of 1954-55 which exceeded the in-\ncrease in personal income occurring at that same time. In the short\nrun at least, autonomous variations in consumer spending do occur.\nThe Economic Behavior Program of the Survey Research Center is\nengaged in research based on the proposition that measurements of\nconsumer attitudes\u2014of people's optimism and confidence\u2014can help to\nexplain and predict variations in consumer spending which cannot be\nexplained by income changes.*\n\nThis proposition can be tested at two levels, the aggregative and the\nindividual. \"Aggregative tests\" start with the construction of time\nseries from the expressed attitudes of representative samples of the\nAmerican population.

Not unlike the Marxist\nwho shrugs off revolutions as \"birthpangs\" of a new society, the\neconomist has tended to consider social and cultural disruptions in\nunderdeveloped countries as the inevitable by-product of growth. But\njust as the nature and course of a revolution profoundly affects the\nsociety that it brings forth, so is the course of a country's development\nintimately conditioned by the manifold tensions which it experiences\nduring its struggle to break away from economic stagnation. Failure\nto include these conflicts in the empirical basis of our analytic\nstructures may mean the loss of important insights. For instance, we\npersist in attempts to view the developmental process as a self-generat-\ning and sel\u00ed-sufficient activity moving along a smooth exponential path,\nwhen any observer of the reality of underdeveloped countries is fully\naware of the ever-present dangers of abortive development and of the\nimportant ways in which progress and backwardness clash and interact.\n\nThis article is an attempt to build some of these interactions into\nthe analysis of development. Its first two sections deal with the con-\nflicting claims and uneven growth of different regions within an under-\ndeveloped, but developing economy. After describing the principal\nmethods of governments in coping with situations of this kind, we pass\nto consider economic problems of a country that has become split into\na developed and an underdeveloped region. The last two sections deal\nwith some structural consequences of the close cohabitation of progress\nand backwardness within the same country, first for the type of in-\ndustrialization and then for the kind of industrial organization that\nare promoted and are likely to prove most effective in this particular\nenvironment,\n",

It occurs because economic development requires a level of\ncapital formation that is difficult for most underdeveloped countries to\nfinance by ordinary means. Investment undertaken by both private\nbusinessmen and government constitutes a demand for domestic out-\nput and/or resources. Even imports of capital goods involve an in-\ndirect demand for domestic resources to the extent that the imports\nare paid for with export proceeds rather than with funds from foreign\nloans or grants.\n\n1f inflation is to be avoided the economy must be willing to limit its\nconsumption spending to the level of output that will remain after the\ninvestment demands are satisfied. Aside from foreign loans or grants,\ntax receipts plus voluntary private saving (7.e., saving forthcoming at\nthe ordinary distribution of income) must at least match government\nexpenditures plus private investment. However, in the underdeveloped\nnation saving is usually meager and the government generally finds it\ndifficult to collect sufficient funds to finance its activities. Consequently\nvoluntary saving and tax proceeds are likely to be insufficient to pre-\nvent a rise in the price level. Inflation performs the task of supple-\nmenting voluntary saving with \"forced saving\"; it does so by reducing\nthe real incomes, and hence consumption, of the less fortunate eco-\nnomic subjects.\n\nBefore presenting an exposition of certain distinctive characteristics\nof inflation in underdeveloped economies, thereby increasing the num-\nber of apparently divergent analyses of inflation, it may be useful to\nindicate what practically all analyses of the phenomenon have in com-\nmon.

Tsiang,\n\"Liquidity Preference and Loanable Funds Theories, Multiplier and Velocity\nAnalyses: A Synthesis,\"' reopens a discussion which has never long been\nabsent from the journals since the publication of Keynes! General Theory.\nIt is unfortunate that, for twenty years, so much time and attention have\nhad to be devoted to the mere mechanics or logic of the relationship between\nliquidity preference and loanable funds forms of statement of interest theory,\nand with results that have frequently been to compound the confusion. Per-\nhaps because of this focus of the discussion too little attention has been\npaid to some real questions of substance raised by Keynes! contributions to\ninterest theory.\n\nNevertheless, a correct understanding of the relationship between the two\nforms of statement of interest theory does probably constitute an essential\nprerequisite to an intelligent discussion of substantive problems. Fortunately,\nTsiang has now shown clearly what is wrong with certain former attempts to\nreconcile the two methods of statement, and has, at least for one specific\nset of period-analysis assumptions, provided a clear reconciliation between\nthe two. It is only to be regretted that his analysis was not more general,\nthat it was not clear on the relationship between equilibrium and disequilib-\nrium (statics and dynamics), and that he did not consider what this author\nbelieves to be some of the more relevant questions of substance.\n\nMore specifically, we shall argue that: (1) Contrary to Tsiang's view,\nliquidity preference and loanable funds theories have different subject matter:\nthe former identifies an asset-holding equilibrium, the latter (unless it is a\nmere trivial rearrangement of the former) deals with what happens in\ndisequilibrium. (2) Tsiang's specific period assumptions cause him to miss the\ncrucial question for loanable funds analysis\u2014at base, an empirical one\u2014\nwhich relates to the speed of the hoarding or dishoarding flows which occur\nwhen stock equilibrium does not exist. (3) Tsiang's apparently unconscious\nassumption that these flows are very rapid means that the speculative ele-\nment must dominate short-run interest rate determination. (4) Tsiang's\n\n!

What he has to say concerns primarily the\nlast two pages of the article, or an implication of the main theme. Vet if\nthe earlier portion still survives\u2014and his remarks do not lead me to believe\notherwise\u2014the necessary modifications for shifts in the functions ought not\nbe hard to find, without departing substantially from the original text.\n\nJunk's basic criticism is that in the case of labor positively responsive to\nreal wages, a supply shift which increases equilibrium employment (as does\nhis S, curve) and a supply shift which decreases employment (his 5;) are\nboth invalid, i.e., inconsistent with the hypothesis of diminishing returns with\ngiven equipment in conditions of rising investment demand. Hence, he argues,\nthe equilibrium employment level must remain unchanged.\n\nI think this proves too much. While the S; curve, with its smaller equilib-\nrium employment can be eliminated as contrary to \"usual\" experience, with-\nout at the moment stopping to analyze it in more detail, the same is not true\nof S,. Conceptually, it is possible for reduced aggregate consumption to go\nalong with higher investment (measured in employment units), higher real\nwages, and higher employment. For example, moving up along the labor-\nsupply (or demand) curve involves higher money wages and higher prices.\nThus through the price rise the income shift from rentiers to profits can\ndiminish aggregate consumption; as I suggested in the earlier article (pp.\n844-45) this income shift was one of the factors tending to support the\nclassical version of the labor-demand curve. In the present case, with higher\ninvestment demand shifting the full labor-demand curve the ensuing income\ndistribution at the higher prices at each money wage is also adverse to the\nreal rentier position and favorable to profits. The cut-back in rentier con-\nsumption through \"forced-savings,\"* together with the higher interest rate?\nand the inroads of the corporate and personal income tax structure which\ncan block an offsetting rise in entrepreneurial consumption, will limit the\nsize of the price rise on consumption goods at each money wage; this thereby\nprovides a margin which helps maintain the real-wage position of labor at\n\n'I have made use of the concept of \"forced-savings\" in an article on \"The Micro-\n\nFoundations of Aggregate Demand and Supply,\" to appear in the Economic Journal. I\nthink the concept has been unduly neglected in recent years.\n\n\"Thus it may be unwise to exclude the effects *of possible changes in relative prices of\nwage goods and nonwage goods.\" (Junk, footnote 8). If we argue that savings come\nlargely from nonwage earners and that the savings are positively responsive to interest,\nthen this would be another factor tending to cut nonwage consumption.\n",

In the quarter-century since\nChamberlin put monopoly and competition together in a single formu-\nlation, economists have stressed the prevalence of monopoly elements\nin markets, but have differed in interpreting this condition, especially\nin its bearing on policy. Commonly they relate it to pre-Chamberlin\nthought regarding the nature and place of competition, and bring a\nputative \"classic\" model, at least implicitly, into their discussion. In\ndoing so they will agree that such a model describes badly how markets\nreally work, but will often disagree as to its normative role. They may\naccept its guidance in defining the necessary working of markets in a\nfree system, and then despair of the future of control through markets\nthat do not and cannot work in that manner. Or, more likely now, they\nmay reject the model as a false guide because our present economy seems\nto do very well without meeting its requirements. As substitutes for it\nthey may rely on theories of \"workable competition\" and \"counter-\nvailing power.\"\n\nThe present contention is that both of these views misrepresent\nearlier analysis when they deduce policy implications from models used\nin static theory. How wrong the deduction can be is apparent when we\nexamine the work of such economists as John Bates Clark and Alfred\nMarshall who brought their theory into the practical realm. Their\nhandling of market problems, running the gamut from static theory to\npolicy proposals, warrants neither the pessimism nor the rejection.\nIndeed it would be more accurate to say that their thinking set a course\n\n* The author is professor of economics at the University of Michigan.\n1 The Scope and.

Important among them\nis the credit-rationing doctrine. Briefly, this is the doctrine that central\nbank operations on the money market affect investment, not mainly\nthrough the cost of credit, but through its availability. When the central\nbank pushes up the yields of short-term government securities, banks\nand nonbank lenders will increase the share of short-term governments\nin their portfolios at the expense of other earning assets. This action\nreduces reserves for the banking system as a whole and causes further\nrestriction of loans to business borrowers. Conversely, when the\ncentral bank pushes down money-market rates, the decreased attractive-\nness of short-term yields, and the increase of reserves, will lead to in-\ncreased availability of loan funds at relatively unchanging cost. In\naddition, it is sometimes argued that banks and nonbank lenders\nconsider probable future movements of intermediate- and long-term\nsecurity prices. The fear of capital losses induced by a rising pattern of\ninterest rates may cause prospective bond purchasers to hold off until\nthey expect no further rise of rates. At the same time, potential bor-\nrowers who expect to need additional credit in the future may become\nfearful of not getting suitable accommodation at a future date, and in\nconsequence restrict their present borrowing and expenditure commit-\nments.\n\n'The foregoing argument implies that, under the credit-rationing\nhypothesis as under the classical interest-cost doctrine, there should be\nan observable negative relation between interest variations and invest-\nment.

But the road\nto a satisfactory quantitative treatment of those variables has been\nblocked by the following dilemma. Some aspects of product quality and\nselling effort are thought of as being nonquantitative. As far as selling\neffort is concerned, this difficulty traditionally has been overcome by\nusing not selling effort itself but selling-effort expenditure, which is\nalways quantitative, as the variable to be optimized. If this were a\nsatisfactory approach, it could obviously be used for nonquantitative\naspects of product quality, too. But it is not a satisfactory approach for\nselling effort any more than for product quality, for selling effort and\nproduct quality are both multidimensional. Moreover, from the point\nof view of demand, alternative dimensions may be substitutional. For\nexample, quantity sold might rise if the input of aluminum were to be\nsubstituted for the input of steel, or if television advertising were sub-\nstituted for magazine advertising. It is not enough, then, to seek the\noptimal total expenditure. Somewhere in the firm, a decision-maker\nmust know exactly how far to go in each particular dimension of quality\nand selling effort.!\n\n* The author is professor of economics at the University of Illinois.

Christ, Sven Dan\u00f3, Robert Dorf-\nman, Wassily Leontief, N\u00f3rregaard Rasmussen, Frederick Williams, and Frederik Zeuthen.\n\n1 Most of the literature fails to answer this question. Chamberlin, in his Monopolistic Com-\npetition, was the first to ask it but felt that the answer would be hampered by the small extent\nto which quality might be reduced to quantitative terms. He now thinks that the extent was\ndefinitely underestimated in Monopolistic Competition; cf. his \"The Product as an Economic\nVariable,\" Quart. Jour. Econ., Feb. 1953, LXVII, 8. Four other prominent contributions have\nassumed either that quality and selling effort are both one-dimensional or that the expendi-\nture on quality variation and selling effort can be taken to represent quality itself or selling\neffort itself, 2.e., H. v. Stackelberg, *\"Theorie der Vertriebspolitik und der Qualit\u00fctsvariation,\"\nSchmollers Jahrbuch, 1939, LXTIT, 43-85; L. Abbott, \"Vertical Equilibrium under Pure Qual-\nity Competition,\" Am.

A refined graphical solution of the substitution prob-\nlem as between different advertising media was offered twenty years ago by Bjrge Barfod,\nReklamen i teorelisk-\u00f3konomisk Belysning (Copenhagen, 1937). Two contributions have solved\nthe substitution problem as between all the dimensions of quality and selling effort, i.e.,\nT.

But empirical demand analysis,\nbeing *'concerned with the statistical application of the theory rather than\nwith the theory itself,\" is regarded by Hicks as outside his field (pp. vi-vii).\nYet, \"econometric application\" is to him an important test, for a theory\nwhich can be used by econometrists is to that extent a better theory than\none which cannot\" (p. 3).\n\nA brief chapter is devoted to the rejection of (even hypothetically) meas-\nurable utility.

In content, it is one of the most hopeful-looking of the long\nseries of policy proposals designed to meet J. M. Clark's celebrated difficulty\nthat labor cost, though an overhead for society, is a variable item for the\nindividual employer. In form, it suggests a widely adaptable linkage of\ncontrol instruments with market mechanisms.\n\nIt is very common to carry on economic-control operations by buying\nand selling on an existing market. But this is a proposal to create both the\nmarket and the commodity it is to deal in, so that the commodity itself\nbecomes an instrumentality of control.\n\nOnce we look at the proposal in this way, we can see that it represents a\nbroad class of control possibilities. Some of these are familiar as academic\nexamples, others as bits of economic history; but something is added when\nwe see them as a class.\n\nTo begin with academic examples, we often present in the classroom cases\nwhere use of market mechanisms might forestall the creation of certain\nSorts of vested interests. Grazing rights in the national forests, for example,\ntend to become vested, and to attach an extra element of value to property\nin ranches which have enjoyed such rights. Since the grazing privilege\nmust be rationed, economists ask, should the rationing not be by price,\nrather than by a procedure which sets up discrimination between a favored\nfew and excluded many? Or in a city concerned with traffic congestion, the\nlimited number of **medallions\" evidencing permission to have taxis on the\nstreets become pieces of transferable property, with a market value exceed-\ning that of a new cab in many cities, recognized as vested in the successors\nof those who had cabs when the number was closed.

Solution must be largely a social undertaking; .e., individual families\nand businesses pursuing their own self-interest will not produce a result\nwhich is best for the public as a whole.\n\nOne part of the solution is to increase available street and off-street park-\ning space. At best, however, any reasonably effective program would take\nmany years, especially in metropolitan areas, and would be incredibly ex-\npensive (in terms of either dollars or the other things that would have to be\nsacrificed\u2014housing, education, clothing, autos, etc.). Another approach,\nand one with conspicuous merit, is to use the pricing mechanism (such as\nhigh parking charges) to help allocate a limited supply.\n\nStill another method seems worth considering\u2014the graduation of annual\nlicense charges by auto length or by length and width combined. The main\nobjective would be to induce the public to buy cars that would use less of\nthe scarce, publicly owned resource which when used by one person is taken\nfrom others. A secondary objective would be an increased contribution to\nthe public treasury from those choosing vehicles that use more public prop-\nerty. To illustrate, assuming that length alone is the basis of graduation,\nthe annual fee might be $1 for each inch of length between 180 and 185\ninches, $3 per inch between 185 and 190 inches, up to, say, $10 per inch of\nlength exceeding 195 inches. Rates might well be less for cars already in\nexistence when the new system became effective. An effective date of 1960\nor thereabouts should give auto manufacturers time to plan for the transi-\ntion.\n\nIn some states auto value might also remain a consideration in setting\nthe fee because of ties to property taxation. However, since streets and\nhighways are now built to carry much heavier loads than the heaviest auto,\nweight is outmoded as a rational basis for graduating charges for passenger\nautos.\n\nTotal dimensions, however, are of great significance. Length and width\nare of concern not only to the owner but also to others who wish to use the\nsame joint facilities (streets), and to taxpayers who may be called upon to\nprovide facilities for which the demand depends partly upon size of vehicle.\nSome of the driving of almost every motorist is in areas where he uses a\nvery scarce resource, urban street space, for which no charge is feasible.\nEconomizing its use is very much in the public interest. With the motiva-\ntions now provided, however, individual actions do not combine to serve\nthe public interest to best advantage. A license system providing strong in-\nducements to use somewhat smaller autos\u2014and exacting a much higher fee\nthan today from those who continue to choose to use more of the scarce\nresource\u2014could contribute to a solution.\n\nIf the average new auto were only a foot shorter, and if 4 million a year\nwere destined for city use, about 800 miles of street-space equivalent would\nbe released. Over a period to, say, 1970, the total would indeed be impres-\nsive even in relation to the new construction planned under the 1956 high-\nway law.

If restrictive policy were overdone, the fact would register it-\nself in a stiffening of the money-pump price, and in reports from business\nthat sales were not rising enough to validate the existing output-inventory\nposition. In this case, a downturn would be in the making. But, for the\nreasons just mentioned, there would be time to diagnose the situation and\nadapt monetary-fiscal policy to it before substantive damage was done. If\nthe adaptation was overdone, furthermore, the inventories accumulated be-\nfore it started would be an anti-inflationary cushion, and their depletion\nwould again give time for a turnaround of policy.\n\nPerhaps Hazelett's scheme is too outlandish ever to have a chance.\nPerhaps its loopholes are broader than they look, and its incidental ill-\neffects deeper. Certainly I would not be willing to testify that it was sound\npractical policy (in case it became of political interest) till these matters\nhad been much more thoroughly thrashed out. Yet the argument just pre-\nsented suggests that such a scheme would have huge advantages. Under\nalmost any other stabilization strategy I have seen suggested,? the inter-\nplay of inventory position, business expectations and employment is ca-\npable of giving a downswing some momentum before the situation is recog-\nnized and corrected. The fear of such a result inhibits stabilization measures\nto check possible inflation in a period of prosperity. The ideal policy would\nbe one so designed that we would always have at the beginning of a down-\nswing what Keynes termed a *breathing-spell\"\u2014a period long enough for\nit to be possible to see clearly that activity was tending to sag, yet not so\nlong that real damage had yet happened, or that the downswing had\ngathered momentum. Hazelett's proposal offers a mechanism that should\nmake such a breathing-spell a regular feature of business peaks.

While \"turn-\nover\" may still be an ugly word, *mobility\" has taken on a favorable\nconnotation, something like *alkalinity\"; and while \"stabilization\" is\nstill a virtue, *immobilization\" is a vice.\n\nIt is said that seniority systems, health and welfare plans and\nnegotiated pensions have chained the worker to his job; that the\nadaptability and flexibility of the labor force are being sacrificed; and\nthat a new industrial feudalism is being built.

Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1958\n\nPublic Law 85-686 marks the eleventh time that the Congress has extended\nthe President's authority to negotiate reciprocal tariff reductions with foreign\ncountries since its original enactment in 1934. Previous extensions had been\nfor 3 years or less; the current one is for 4 years\u2014through June 30, 1962.\nThe President is empowered to reduce tariffs to the lowest rates obtainable by\nany one of three alternative methods: (1) The July 1, 1958 rates may be\nlowered by 20 per cent. The reductions would have to be made gradually:\n10 per cent of the total reduction would generally be the maximum in any one\nyear. (2) The July 1, 1958 rates may be lowered by 2 percentage points. Such\nreductions would also have to be made gradually: no reduction of more than 1\npercentage point would generally be made effective in any one year. This\nalternative authority, which has not been provided for in previous legislation,\nwould be significant in cases where 2 percentage points would permit a larger\nreduction than the maximum reduction obtainable under the first method.\nThus, if the July 1, 1958 tariff rate on a commodity were 5 per cent, the sec-\nond method would permit a reduction to 3 per cent, whereas the first method\nwould permit a reduction to only 4 per cent. (3) The July 1, 1958 rates which\nwere higher than 50 per cent ad valorem may be lowered to that rate. Similar\nauthority was granted in previous trade agreements legislation. Reductions\nunder this method would also have to be made gradually and seriatim. One-\nthird of the total reduction is the maximum that may be made effective in any\none year. This alternative method would be significant in cases where rates\nexceed 62 per cent, for it would permit a greater reduction than that obtain-\nable under the first method.\n\nRegardless of the form of tariff reductions, in no case may there be more\n\n* The author is associate professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe volumes under review [5] [7] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] are staggering in length.\nIf the usefulness of Congressional hearings is not to be further impaired, more effective\nprocedures which economize on testimony will have to be devised.\n"

AY , where AY\n\na\nis the resultant increment of income in response to an autonomous increase of investment\n\nwith the given structure of taxes, while AY, is the hypothetical increment of income in\nthe absence of any income tax. Thus \"\u00ab is the fraction of change in income which is pre-\nvented because of built-in flexibility.\" \"They separate two factors, () the average level of\ntax rates r, and (Z) the income elasticity of taxes, E \u2014 AY T in order to indicate\nthe possibility of increasing a by raising E while maintaining or lowering r. With a cur-\nrent r estimated at about .2, and an E estimated at about 1.5, a is little over one-third\nat the existing (1948) yield levels.\n\nFor limited movements of income from current levels, the marginal tax arrived at by\ntheir methods is satisfactory enough. The estimates for E and r, however, would not be\nsuitable for measuring changes in income-tax revenue for appreciable change in aggregate\nincome even if we could neglect changes wrought by alterations in the income structure.\nFor instance, granted that tax rates remain unaltered, the onset of a mild but persistent\ninflation would shift income earners into successively higher tax brackets with the result\nthat the marginal tax would advance faster than income.\n\n* For instance, J. A. Pechman [4] has calculated the total of personal income taxes which\nthe population would have paid in the years 1948-52 at the 1053 tax rates given the in-\ncome distributions for each of these years.

Economic Theory of the Size of Firms\n\nEconomic theory has little to say about the distribution of firm sizes.\nIn general, we are led to expect a U-shaped long-run cost curve or\nplanning curve for a firm. But the scale corresponding to minimum costs\nneed not be the same for different firms, even in the same industry. If\nwe employ the concept of economic rent, we can say that firms will\nhave the same minimum cost, but varying outputs at this cost [8, pp.\n123-127]. If this is the case, the cost curve yields no prediction about\nthe distribution of firms by size and no explanation as to why the ob-\nserved distributions approximate the Pareto distribution.\n\n*'The authors are professor of administration and graduate fellow, respectively, in the\nGraduate School of Industrial Administration, Carnegie Institute of Technology.

Keynes [12, p. 48] called it *a bit of a miracle.\" Even\nif it is sometimes observed that the pattern of distributive shares shows\nlong-run shifts or short-run fluctuations, the former can be explained\naway and the latter neglected on principle. The residual belief remains\nthat, apart from a slight (and questionable) upward trend and a\ncountercyclical movement, the share of wages in the privately produced\nnational income is unexpectedly stable. Much effort is devoted to ex-\nploiting and explaining this fact.\n\nThe object of this paper is to suggest that, like most miracles, this\none may be an optical illusion. It is not clear what exactly is meant by\nthe phrase: \"The wage share in national income is relatively stable\" or\n* historically almost constant.\" The literature does not abound in pre-\ncise definitions, but obviously literal constancy is not in question. In\nany case, what I want to show is that for one internally consistent de-\nfinition of \"relatively stable,\" the wage share in the United States for\nthe period 1929-1954 (or perhaps longer) has not been relatively stable.\n\nIf this contention is accepted, it is not without some general implica-\ntions for economic theory. Beginning with Ricardo there have been\nsporadic revivals of interest in macroeconomic theories of distribution.\"\nNow it is possible to have an aggregative distribution theory without\nbelieving in the historical constancy of relative shares, but the belief\ncertainly reinforces the desire for such a theory. After all, a powerful\nmacroeconomic fact seems to call for a macroeconomic explanation.\nIt need not have one, but that is beside the point.

However the institutional and political structure of the\nKorean economy has changed markedly since 1954. This paper will consider\nbriefly those changes which, as of August 1957, would modify some of the\nfindings of Campbell and Tullock.\n\nThe institutional framework of aid goods distribution has been drastically\nrevised [10, pp. 3-17]. The Korean government is no longer responsible for\nthe sale of aid goods, and normally it does not set their market prices. The\nKorean government, through its various offices and through the Bank of Korea,\nadministers the allocation and sale of aid dollars under the supervision of the\nInternational Cooperation Administration.\n\nAid expenditures may be broadly classified as *nonspecified end-user\" and\n\"specified end-user.\" In the nonspecified end-user portion of the program,\nspecific quantities of dollars are allocated to the procurement of specific raw\nmaterials and consumer goods. The dollars in each category are then sold\nto the importers who offer the highest local currency downpayment against\nthe purchase cost of the dollars; in case of equal bids buyers are selected by\nlot. The commodities imported may be sold in the open market at the pre-\nvailing market price. Nonspecified end-user dollar sales accounted for about\n\n^A summary of the regulations governing the allocation of nonspecified end-user funds\nthrough the Bank of Korea was drafted by De Alessi and checked by Adams and Elmen-\ndorf of the Office of the Controller, UNC/OEC for Korea. The only change relevant to\nthis paper that they noted as of August 20, 1057, was an increase in compulsory National\nBonds sales from Hyo/20 to Hy\u00e9/30 per dollar purchased.

                    "my assumption that Soviet prices will continue to fall, the tax element for the\npostwar period turns out to be considerably less than that for the prewar\nperiod, and I still believe that this was probably an important factor in the\ndecision to *freeze\" and *discontinue\" the bond sales. A 100-ruble bond\nbought in 1930 had, by 1940, less than 20 rubles of purchasing power in 1940\nprices; a 100-ruble bond bought in 1948, had, by 1958, about 200 rubles of\npurchasing power in 1958 prices.\n\nNow Bornstein argues that prices have been relatively stable since 1954,\nand therefore from the point of view of the bondholder the tax element is\nstill fairly high (though I would argue not as high as in the \"thirties). The\nstate's decision to discontinue the sale of bonds, however, is not based on\nbondholders! expectations but rather on its own plans regarding the consumer-\ngoods price level.' I would anticipate that in the future the Soviets will con-\ntinue to use price cuts as a means of passing on increases in the standard of\nliving while keeping wages and other incomes roughly stable. This has been\ntheir avowed policy since 1928 and has been implemented since 1948 when\ncontrol over incomes made price cuts possible. I regard the cessation of price\ncuts since 1954 as temporary in nature due to: the stepped-up industrializa-\ntion when Khrushchev first took over; the numerous special measures which\nhave been taken in the past few years to adjust relative incomes (increase in\npayments to collective farmers, increase in pensions, increase in minimum\nwages, etc.) ; the stepped-up housing program, a form of consumer service not\nreflected in the price indices; and so forth.?\n\nFinally, I agree with Bornstein that the \"official\" argument concerning the\nfreeze and discontinuation has merit: that with repayments plus debt service\ngradually overtaking receipts, the bond program had become less attractive to\nthe planners. But I think this argument is much more convincing when\nviewed in the perspective of the change from an inflationary to a deflationary\neconomy with its implications for the *tax element.\" I do not believe the\nSoviets would have repudiated (in effect) 260 billion rubles in bonds, equal\nto about one-half year's personal income, just because their net receipts from\nsales of bonds were declining. This is not the kind of action that a govern-\nment, even as centralized and powerful as the USSR, contemplates lightly.\nThe big problem is that repayments today are worth so much more in real\nterms than the original receipts, whereas in the 'thirties they were worth so\nmuch less.\n\nIf inflation were still rampant: (1) It would still pay the Soviets to sell\nbonds today paying back a fraction of their real value sometime in the future.\nBonds, unlike taxes, are an intertemporal fiscal weapon and it makes sense to\nassess their utility over time as well as in relation to problems of the moment.\n\n' The major purpose of my original note was to estimate the tax element from the point\nof view of the bondholder. As the note was about to go to press, the Soviets initiated their\nfreeze. My brief addendum on the freeze which is a major target of Bornstein's, was un-\nfortunately misleading on this point.\n\n?'This point was made in a letter to Problems of Communism accepted for publication\nin January 1958. In Moscow in May 1958, two leading Soviet financial specialists,\nBachurin and D'iachenko, expressed the same opinion to me in private conversation.\n",

Because\nbond subscriptions were compulsory, progressive? and deducted from workers'\npay, they had the same disincentive effect as the personal income tax. Their\nelimination should in turn have the same incentive effect as a cut in personal\nincome taxes, which also has become effective in 1958 [10]. At the same time,\nthe importance of earned income to the Soviet household has increased as a\nresult of the loss of unearned income in the form of bond prizes and redemp-\ntions, on which every Soviet household must have counted to some extent\nbecause of the virtual universality of bond subscriptions. Although the impact\nof an increase in disposable income is of course dependent upon the avail-\nability of consumer goods and their price level, it is likely that the combined\nelimination of new subscriptions and termination of service payments on old\nissues had a favorable (from the viewpoint of the regime) effect on worker\nincentives.\n",

These discussions deal mostly with the issue of\ncapital longevity within the framework of problems of underdeveloped\ncountries. It is not necessary, however, to deal with the longevity prob-\nlem in such a restricted manner; virtually everything that need be said\nabout capital longevity actually holds for any stage of development.\n\nThus W. A. Lewis argues that it is a frequent fault of development\nprograms to build capital structures for an unduly long life and too\nsolidly. These are luxuries which underdeveloped countries can ill\nafford because capital is so scarce for them [8, p. 395]. On the other\nhand, Galenson and Leibenstein hold that long-lived capital offers to\nunderdeveloped areas the great advantage of a longer period during\nwhich no replacement has to be made. This in turn, makes possible\na greater net output and greater reinvestment per man, which may be\ncrucial for overcoming a critical early stage in the development process\n[4, p. 362]:\n\nNeisser, commenting on the Galenson-Leibenstein article and con-\nsidering the issues of lesser cost of short-lived equipment versus the\ngain of postponed replacement of more durable equipment, states:\n\"I do not know of a criterion for weighing the advantages of a more\nrapid initial growth of operating capital against the disadvantages of\nan earlier temporary interruption\" [10, p. 646].\n\n* The author is assistant professor in the department of economics, Northwestern Uni-\nversity. He is greatly indebted to Fred Westfield for highly lucid suggestions and\n\ncriticisms and for the appended mathematical note. Robert Eisner, Karl de Schweinitz,\nRobert Strotz and Stefan Valavanis have also provided stimulating ideas.\n\n'Galenson and Leibenstein cite Domar's calculations which show, for example, that\nwith a rate of growth of gross investment of 5 per cent per year and an average length\nof life of capital of 4 years, the equilibrium ratio of replacement to gross investment will\nbe 82 per cent per year. If the average length of life of capital should be 10 years, the\nratio of replacement to gross investment drops to 61 per cent; and if the average length\nof life of capital is 30 years the ratio of replacement to gross investment would be\nmerely 22 per cent per year [2, p. 8]. Domar, however, makes it quite clear that more\nlong-lived equipment, while it has the agreeable quality of postponed replacement, also\nhas the disagreeable quality of being more expensive; he states explicitly: \"There is no\ndoubt that beyond a certain range greater capital longevity becomes very expensive . . .\"\n[2, p. 7].

It seems appropriate\nto investigate the relationship of a production ceiling to the turning-\npoint of 1920 because demand forces were extremely strong and sharp\nprice rises also occurred.\n\nThe basic argument is that the production ceiling is normally en-\ncountered first in the investment-goods industries. Thereafter further\ngrowth in demand for consumption-goods output depends largely upon\nlagged expenditures generated by the multiplier. Since these do not\ngenerate sufficient consumption, however, induced investment falls off\nand shortly consumption also declines.' This explanation of the causal\nfactors in an economic turning-point seems unsatisfactory for 1919-20,\nbecause production of consumer goods reached its peak in November\n1919, before that of investment goods, and began to decline markedly\nin February 1920, although prices and real consumption expenditures\nwere still rising. Moreover, demand for investment goods, as reflected\nin new and unfilled orders, in many industries continued to rise for\nsome months after production of consumption goods began to decline.\n\nThe data appear consistent, however, with a second type of produc-\ntion ceiling which, according to Hicks, may occur on rare occasions,\nprimarily after big wars. At such a time a production ceiling may be\nencountered first in consumption-goods industries, and lack of adequate\ncapacity in these industries then leads to further increases in produc-\ntion in the investment-goods industries. Under such circumstances\ninflation generally sets in before the check to the growth in consumption\nis able to exercise its customary restraint on investment.\"\n\nI.

It\nwould be difficult to find a recent cycle or growth model of which it is not a\ncornerstone. Uncontroversial though the z04iom of a consumption function\nhas become, about its mathematical form there is much less agreement. Yet\nthe study of macroeconomic models has shown that the exact shape of the\nconsumption function has a considerable influence on the stability properties\nof the model.\n\nTwo questions about the consumption function are of particular impor-\ntance. The first is whether consumption is proportional to income, so that the\naverage and marginal propensities to consume coincide; Keynes himself had\nsuggested that the average propensity would normally exceed the marginal\npropensity. The second question is whether income should be regarded as\npast, current or expected, or as some combination of the three.\n\nMuch empirical research has been devoted to these questions, especially to\nthe first one. At first family budget surveys were the chief source of informa-\ntion, and the consumption functions derived from them seemed to bear out\nKeynes' postulate of disproportionality.

This conclusion is based primarily on\ninferences drawn from: (1) a comparison between wage changes in basic\nsteel and wage changes in certain less well-organized occupations; (2) a\ncomparison between wage changes in basic steel in the two world-war infla-\ntionary periods; and (3) reports of shortages in both the product and the\nlabor markets of basic steel in the inflationary period following the second\nworld war.\n\nI will consider each of these alleged foundations in turn and will point out\n(a) that in each case the criterion is not a satisfactory one for determining\nwhether or not the steelworkers' union made an independent contribution to\nthe observed increases in the earnings of its members in basic steel, and (b)\nthat in certain instances the empirical evidence presented by Rees, when sup-\nplemented by additional relevant evidence, makes the contrary conclusion at\nleast as plausible as the conclusion that it did not do so. In the latter con-\nnection, it should be noted that Rees at one point merely claimed that \"it is\nequally easy to argue that collective bargaining in the basic steel industry\nduring this period kept wages below the level which they would otherwise\nhave reached, or to argue that it raised wages above such a level.\" However,\nit is elsewhere made abundantly clear that he regarded the first inference as\nmore equal than the second.

On the other\nhand, average hourly earnings have tended to increase more rapidly than\ncontractual rates in this period; this is due in great part to the inclusion of\nan increasing proportion of the work force under incentive pay plans\u2014a\nprocess, incidentally, in which the local unions involved have played a signi-\nficant role.\n\nTable II compares increases in average hourly earnings in basic steel with\nwage increases in some of the lightly organized industrial categories identical\nwith or corresponding closely to those employed by Rees (those for which data\nhave been continuously available) and in all manufacturing. The table reveals\nthat basic steel's standing in the group including itself and the 9 lightly\norganized (in 1946) trades improved markedly between 1948 and 1956. Be-\ntween 1939 and 1948 and between 1945 and 1948, 4 of these trades had ob-\ntained increases in average hourly earnings greater than those secured in basic\nsteel. (Some of the factors contributing to this result were offered in Section I\nabove.) But between 1948 and 1956 only the ice-cream workers received\ngreater increases than the steel workers-\u2014a phenomenon most appropriate to\nthe democracy's cold-war economy.\n\nWe need not repeat our early caveats concerning the interpretation of the\nresults of such comparisons. They are consistent with the hypothesis that\nunionism exerted an independent impact on the level of steel wages in any\nor all or none of the periods considered. However, certain additional infor-\nmation makes plausible the hypothesis that the union probably did exert an\nindependent influence on the level of money wages in basic steel after Septem-\nber 1948. In the first place, while the increase in basic steel production (33\nper cent) over the period 1948-55 was about the same as the increase in\nindustrial and manufacturing production as well as in gross national product\nin 1956 prices (34, 36, and 33 per cent respectively), employment in basic\n\n75 See U.

                    "least as easy to argue to the contrary. In the first place, employers unionized\nat the outset would have to reckon with a higher probability of a strike for\nhigher wages during the period of labor shortage than would nonunion em-\nployers. Thus, if unionized employers wished to secure a future wage rate\nwith which no excess supply of labor would be associated, they would pre-\nsumably have to choose between incurring a strike in good times and in the\nnear future in order to hold wages below the levels at which markets could\ncurrently be cleared, and incurring a strike to reduce wages in some possible\nperiod of future labor surplus. Since the loss of business from a strike would\nbe less and the prospects of their winning would be greater under the latter\nalternative, that alternative would presumably be preferred. Moreover, a\nfirm like U. S. Steel, to which a policy of present restraint probably commended\nitself with particular force under nonunion conditions, found that unionism\neliminated certain exceptional circumstances which had prevailed in the past.\nSince U. S. Steel had traditionally sought to play the role of wage and price\nstabilizer within the industry under nonunion conditions, it lagged behind\nother firms in reducing wages during the downswings of 1920-21 and 1929-32.\nA policy of wage restraint during periods of labor shortage might well have\nappealed to such a \"leader\" under nonunion conditions since it tended to\nminimize its differential losses during ensuing downswings. But once the\nunion was able to inherit the stabilizer's mantle, the dominant firm no longer\nhad such a strong private stake in holding wages below the levels at which\nthey would have cleared the labor markets.\n\nOf course, one need not rely upon the theory of unionism as a price de-\npressant to account for the industry's conservative pricing policies during\nthis period. In the light of the industry leaders! conviction (mentioned above)\nthat postwar operating rates were abnormally high, their consequent reluctance\nto expand capacity in the face of strong public pressure to do so, their fear\nof price controls and their frequent desire to ration in the interests of their\ntraditional customers, wage-price restraint is understandable enough.?*\n\nNow price restraint, whatever its cause, tended to hold down the rate of\nincrease in the demand for production labor in basic steel; thus one need not\nabandon Rees! hypothesis that \"the smaller increase in steel prices\" in\n1939-48, as against 1914-20, was a factor which helped to account for the\nsmaller increase in money wages during the latter period. But if we refuse\nto agree that the 1939-48 price increase would have been greater in the\nabsence of collective bargaining, we are certainly not obliged to conclude that\nthe 1939-48 increase in money wages would also have been greater in the\nabsence of collective bargaining. Rees' data (p. 398) reveal that the rise in\nsteel wages relative to steel prices was much greater in 1939-48 than in\n1914-20; in the earlier period base prices of finished steel rose by 144 per cent\nwhile wages rose 148 per cent, whereas in 1939-48, a price rise of 61 per cent\nwas accompanied by a wage increase of 99 per cent. For reasons presented\nin this section, we regard it as improbable that the union was instrumental in\nholding prices down during the latter period; for reasons presented in Section\n\n\" Loc. cit.; The Iron Age: Jan. 29, 1948; June 10, 1948; Sept. 21, 1948; Oct. 7, 1948.\n",

How, then, do we interpret\nthose reports of local labor shortage? It is possible that they signified merely\nthat, while employers would have been willing to hire more labor than was\navailable to them at the going rate, they would not have been willing to raise\nthe average rate suffciently to pay overtime. Indeed, in this context, it is\neven possible that reports of local shortages might have signified in some\ncases that the employers involved wanted to hire more labor, but only at a\nlower wage rate. For that is what would be implied if their unwillingness to\npay overtime meant that they would also have been unwilling to raise their total\nhourly payroll costs by the amount necessary to defray the additional costs\nof recruitment, selection, training, etc. involved in the expansion of their\nwork forces.\n\nIn any event, the phenomenon of reported local labor shortages combined\nwith employer unwillingness to raise the average rate of pay by as much as the\noffer of time-and-a-half would necessitate is consistent with another hypothesis\nadvanced by Rees as applicable to this problem.?* This hypothesis is that the\nindustry's policy of setting steel prices below the levels at which the product\nmarkets would be cleared depressed the level of demand for its production\nlabor. But now one might question his further claim that the union was in\npart responsible for this price policy.\n\nHolding Down Prices and Wages. We have suggested that, in the pre-union\nera of the basic steel industry, the fear of future unionism (or, as it used to\nbe called, *labor unrest\") led employers to exercise restraint in granting wage\nincreases in response to labor shortages which they believed to be temporary.\nNow, in the postwar period under consideration, the expectation of a future\ntapering off in demand was widely held by the industry's leadership.?? There-\nfore, even if the steel union had been nonexistent in 1946-48, it appears more\nlikely that the industry would have exercised some moral restraint in its wage-\nprice policy than that it would have thrown caution to the winds. Hence one\ncannot easily accept the view that the substance of unionism contributed\nindependently to the restrained behavior of the industry in 1945-48 if the\nsame type of behavior would have been elicited by its shadow.\n\nOf course one might maintain that the threat of unionism would exert a\nlesser degree of influence than the presence of unionism, but it would be at\n\n\" New York Times, Dec. 15, 1945, p. 12; The Iron Age, Aug. 15, 1946, p. 92.

Presumably neither Rees nor we would\ndeny that employers who believe it to be in their short-term interest to raise\nemployee compensation to a given level would hesitate to do so if they could\nsubsequently reduce compensation without fear of employee resistance. We\nmight further agree that workers would tend to oppose an attempt to reduce\ntheir basic rate of pay and that knowledge of this would make employers\nunwilling to raise that basic rate in the first place. But there is more than\none way to skin this cat, and it is available to union as well as to nonunion\nemployers. By paying overtime premiums during transitional periods of worker\nshortage, employers could expand their employment of man-hours (a) without\nhaving to pay a higher rate for the straight-time hours throughout the enter-\nprise, (b) without contravening either the letter or spirit of their fixed-term\nagreements, and (c) without courting the alleged peril of being prevented by\nthe union from reducing average wages in response to a subsequent decrease\nin demand for labor.\n\nRees cites the specific instance of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Com-\npany whose vice-president in charge of industrial relations testified before a\nSenate committee that, in August 1947, his company was short 1,000 workers\nof its normal complement of 24,000 in the Youngstown and Chicago-Gary\nareas.

However, we do know that throughout\nthe period 1946-1948 basic steel was not, in the aggregate, on an overtime\nbasis.

They would be restrained by their fear of \"cheating the expecta-\ntions\" of entrants to the trade. Employers in the U. S. steel industry might\nwell have been similarly motivated in the period between August 1918 and\nAugust 1923 (when the 8-hour day was introduced). With the exception of\nthe depression of 1920-21, this was a period of chronic labor shortage in the\nindustry, unrelieved by the five wage increases which were either too little or\ntoo late to remove the specific shortages which had provoked them.?^ Two\nmonths after the ineffective wage increase of April 1923, The Iron Age\napprovingly quoted an admonition from W. I. King to *Raise wages as little\nas possible, thus avoiding the necessity of severe wage cuts at a later date\";\nand it added, *Advancing wages that must afterward come down causes\ntrouble and it is human nature that it should be so. We are dealing with\nmen as they are, not as they would be if the Golden Rule were their sole\nguide to thought and conduct.\"?:\n\nBoth Hicks and King presumably assumed that the employers whom they\nhad in mind were able to act on their long view; however, the employers\"\nability to do so implies in turn a departure from perfect competition on their\nside of the labor market. This condition, as we have argued, is satisfied in\nthe case of basic steel. But now consider the assumptions underlying the argu-\nment that employers in steel, if there were no union, would set a wage high\nenough to eliminate what they regard as a temporary shortage and without\nregard to a foreseeable future excess supply with which that wage might be\nassociated. This argument assumes either that such employers act irrationally\nin terms of their long-run situation or that the degree of competition among\nthem is so high that they (literally) cannot help themselves. Hence, as in\n\n?See J. R. Hicks, *Economic Foundations of Wage Policy,\" Econ. Jour., Sept. 1955,\nLXV, 401.\n\n?* In 1920 local labor shortages were reported and persisted from April to September;\nthese followed a wage increase in February and were terminated before the next rise in\nwages, which did not occur until May 1921. In 1922, shortages which were reported from\nthe beginning of the year were not responded to by a wage increase until September, and\nthis increase did not have the effect of stopping complaints of labor shortage. Furthermore, a\nwage increase of 11 per cent in April 1923 failed to alleviate a severe and persistent shortage\nof labor; as a result of this U. S. Steel inaugurated the basic 8-hour day in August with a\ncompensating wage rise. The latter move did put an end to the persistent labor shortage,\nincidentally, which clearly reveals the prior effect of the industry's policies with respect to\nhours of work upon its ability to attract and retain native-born labor.\n\n^ The Iron Age: Apr. 15, 1920; Sept. 2, 1920; Jan. 26, 1922; May 4, 1922; June 29,\n1922; Oct. 12, 1922; Nov. 9, 1922; Dec. 28, 1922; May 31, 1923; June 21, 1923.

In this\ncontext, the reporting of \"labor shortage\" might have signified only that\nemployers wished to hire at the union rate more labor than was available at\nthat rate. It did not necessarily signify that multiplant companies would have\nbeen willing to raise the wages of the existing forces in all their mills in an\nattempt to employ additional workers in some mills in those localities where\nlabor was tight at the time, or even that they would have been willing to raise\nthe local basic rate alone.\n\nSome Dynamic Considerations. Even if the wage level at which the local\nmarket could be cleared is assumed to have been above the union wage, it need\nnot follow that, in the absence of collective bargaining, a labor shortage would\nhave resulted in a wage increase. When the dominant employing units expect\nthat the short-run supply curve of labor in the local labor market will shift\nto the right or that the demand for labor will be reduced in the near future,\nit is unlikely that what is regarded as a temporary shortage would touch off\na wage increase. The period July 1946 to at least August 1947 was cited by\nRees as having been characterized by serious local labor shortages in the\nChicago-Gary and Youngstown areas. Now some of these reported labor short-\nages were due to shortages in housing facilities near the plants; in one in-\nstance, it was specifically reported that, *The number of workers recruited\n[from the Pittsburgh region] was limited, apparently, only by the availability\nof housing at the plant site.\"!* And, during the same postwar period, some\nreported shortages were attributed to the availability of unemployment com-\npensation benefits to war-weary civilian workers and returning servicemen;\nwhile the Chicago steel mills were trying to fill about 3,300 jobs (mostly\nunskilled), 135,000 individuals in the area were reported as unemployed \u2014\nand over 50,000 returning servicemen were expected.!?\n\nIf the steel employers had had no union to contend with in 1946-47, would\nthey really have responded to such shortages by raising wages sufficiently to\nhave eliminated them? If not, then the reported existence of shortages under\ncollective bargaining is not sufficient to create the presumption that collective\nbargaining held wages down. Nor can it be held to imply that unionized\nemployers were not paying wages higher than they would have been willing\nto pay in the absence of the union but with all other conditions remaining\nthe same. If we admit that the employer, under nonunion conditions, might\ntolerate some excess demand which he regards as temporary, then we cannot\ntell whether the shortage actually observed under collective bargaining is\n",

S.

Indeed, the contrary assumption appears easier to defend, al-\nthough it is not necessary to do so. Let one merely assume equal difficulty in\nboth periods and then compare the two periods with respect to changes in\nsteel employment\u2014whether in percentage terms or relative to changes in\nthe labor force\u2014as well as changes in wages. Such a comparison might well\nlead one to wonder why the 1939-48 wage change was not smaller than in\nfact it was.\n\nNeedless to say, the rough calculations in the preceding subsection cannot\nbe used to show by how much the steel union was responsible for the increase\nin money wages in 1939-48. For one thing, if we accept the hypothesis that\nunionism was an independent influence on wages, we must also reckon with\nthe possibility that the increase in basic steel employment would have been\ngreater in the absence of the union than it actually was during that period\n(and that this would have reduced the difference between the predicted and\nthe observed wage increases).\n\nIH. Shortages and Expectations\n\nRees would presumably agree that in the absence of the union the increase\nin steel employment would have been greater than it actually was before the\ninflationary peak had been passed in September 1948, but for a quite dif-\nferent reason; he believes that the union helped to choke back the demand\nfor steel labor and thus to prevent both employment and wages from rising as\nrapidly as they would have in the absence of the union. And he refers to\nreports of local labor shortages during the postwar period as evidence that\nwages would have risen more than they did had it not been for collective\nbargaining. Let us now test the third leg of this tripod.\n\nTwo alleged causes of local labor shortage are considered. On the one\nhand, \"wage increases were undoubtedly delayed by fixed-term collective\nagreements\" (p. 402). However, such fixed-term agreements need not have\nresulted in shortages if the periodic negotiations had resulted in wage rates\nsufficiently high to compensate in advance, as it were, for subsequent increases\nin demand. Since it is noted in another connection that \"shortages existed\nsoon after wage increases were negotiated, indicating that negotiated rates\nat these times were probably below those which would have prevailed in the\nabsence of collective bargaining\" (p. 393), one might infer that the existence\nof fixed-term agreements is not regarded as the most important agent of re-\ntardation.\n\nThe more important cause of local labor shortage is alleged to have been\nthe union's contribution to the industry's decision to underprice its product,\nthereby permitting product shortages to develop and also making it unprofit-\nable to raise wages to levels which would have obtained in the absence of\nprice restraint. In part, the union's publicity campaign against price increases\nhelped to hold down steel prices, according to this argument, but more\nimportant was the alleged fact that employers feared to raise prices and wages\nsuffciently to overcome the \"temporary\" shortages in steel and steel labor\n",

It also uses month-to-month link relatives, but is based on the year 1929\nand extends the BLS index for 1923-36 back to 1919. Presumably the difference between the\nlow and the high estimates for 1920 reflects the fact that the sample of firms reporting year-\nto-year changes in employment each month for 1919-20 was different from the sample re-\nporting for the year 1920\u201421.\n\n* The middle estimate (B) for 1920 was obtained by applying an estimated increase of 156.9\nper cent to the Census figure of 1914. This estimate was taken from an \"adjusted employ-\nment index\" constructed by the BLS in 1926 (Mo. Lab. Rev., July 1926, p. 9) which reflects\nchanges in hours of work as well as in the number of employees. However, since the number\nof hours worked declined during this period, this estimate understates the increase in the\nemployment of workers. Like our high estimate, this estimate of the increase in worker em-\nployment for the period 1919-20 takes 1914 as a base and uses the Census figures for 1919\nand the monthly reports on changes in employment compiled by the BLS in deriving the\nestimate of employment for 1920.\n\n* Estimate (C) for 1920 was obtained by applying to monthly Census data on employment\nin steel works, blast furnaces, and rolling mills percentage changes in employment reported\nto the BLS by a sample of employers in \"iron and steel\" for the 9 months, January through\nSeptember. The monthly changes in employment for October through December were omitted\nin this calculation because employment in 1920 was depressed due to the A.F. of L.'s organiz-\ning strike and the reported year-to-year increases averaged greatly in excess of the increases\nreported for the other months. Inclusion of all twelve year-to-year changes would yield an\naverage total of 459.5 thousand production workers in basic steel in 1920.\n\n4 The estimate for 1948 was obtained by multiplying the BLS figure of 536.8 thousand for\n1948 by the ratio of the 1947 item in the Census series to the 1947 item in the BLS series. As\nthe following data show, these proportions show some tendency to decline over the period\n1947-50; hence applying the 1947 ratio tends to overstate 1948 employment in the census\nseries.\n\n(Continued at bottom of next page)\n",

The Two Wartime Increases in. Employment. According to Table I\nemployment in basic steel increased by much more in 1914-20 than it did\nin 1939-48, not only in percentage terms but absolutely as well, and relative\nto total civilian employment and labor force. Thus while steel wages rose\nmore rapidly in 1914-20 than in 1939-48, so did employment in basic steel.\nMoreover, while the per cent increase in average hourly earnings in 1939-48\nwas about .6 as great as that in 1914-20, the per cent increase in basic steel\nemployment in 1939-48 was only about .45 as great as that in 1914-20.\n\nSuppose, for illustrative purposes, that one wished to estimate the percent-\nage increase in hourly earnings in basic steel for 1939-48 on the assumption\nthat it bore the same relationship to the percentage increase in employment\nduring that period as the percentage increase in hourly earnings in 1914-20\nbore to the percentage increase in employment in 1914-20. Then, given the\nlatter ratio and the observed increase in employment in 1939-48, one would\nhave predicted that hourly earnings would have increased about 71, 66, or\n62 per cent in 1939-48, depending upon which estimate of employment for\n1920 is used. This is well below the calculated increase of 87 per cent.\nMoreover, we have not taken into account the fact that, while the increase in\nsteel employment was much smaller in the second period than in the first,\nthe increases in total employment and labor force were much smaller in the\nfirst period. Thus, in 1914-20, basic steel claimed between 149 and 172\nthousand of the 4,315,000 new jobs created in the economy\u2014roughly 315-4\nper cent; whereas in 1939-48, it claimed only about 100 thousand of the\n13,628,000 new jobs created\u2014under 1 per cent.'* In addition, as the table\n\n*\u00bb The example in the text might be altered to make some allowance for differential move-\nments in the labor force as well as in purely inflationary components of the wage increases\nby comparing increases in real wage rates (which. according to Rees' data, amounted to 27\nper cent in 1914-1920 and 13 per cent in 1939-1948) with increases in steel employment\nrelative to civilian labor force. In any event, the example is intended merely to illustrate\nthe possibility that the observed increase in wages during the second period might well have\n",

                    "IL. Comparisons Between Two War Periods\n\nRees presents data which reveal \"that steelworkers made larger percentage\ngains in money and real hourly earnings during the period 1914 to 1920 than\nduring the period 1939 to 1948. In the earlier period steelworkers' money\nearnings increased relative to earnings in all manufacturing, while in the\nmore recent period they decreased\" (p. 400).* However, during the postwar\nperiod 1945-1948 average hourly earnings in steel rose as rapidly as average\nhourly earnings in all manufacturing, and money hourly earnings in both\njust about kept pace with the cost of living. (The annual increases were 33,\n32, and 34 per cent respectively.)?\n\nNow it is evident that interpretation of all these findings must be subject\nto the same class of restrictions which apply in the case of the interindustry\ncomparisons discussed in the preceding section, since no control was explicitly\nestablished for all relevant differences between the two periods apart from\nthe difference in the degree of unionization in steel. Comparing basic steel\nwages relative to wages in all manufacturing in the two periods might be\nconstrued as an attempt to control for other differences; however, it also\neliminates the differences with respect to unionization. For, unionization in\nmanufacturing increased along with unionization in steel during the second\nperiod; by 1946, 69 per cent of the production workers in manufacturing\nwere covered by collective bargaining.\" Manufacturing wages rose less rapidly\nin 1939-1948 than in 1914-1920 (see footnote 14), but this does not warrant\nthe conclusion that unionism in all manufacturing had no effect upon the\nmovement of hourly earnings in manufacturing and upon the cost of living\nduring the second period. Hence, the fact that steel wages fell relative to the\nformer and failed to rise relative to the latter by as much as in 1914-1920\n\n5 The statement concerning the movements in money earnings in basic steel relative to\nthose in manufacturing is supported by computations from data of the National Industrial\nConference Board for 1914-1920 and from data of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for\n1939-1948. Computations from BLS data for the period 1914-1920 indicate that steel\nwages rose no more rapidly than did manufacturing wages in the early period. See foot-\nnote 14 below.\n\n\"Average money hourly earnings in basic steel rose from $1.188 in 1945 to $1.580 in\n1948; in all manufacturing they rose from $1.023 to $1.350. See BLS series published in\nMo. Lab. Rev., Table C-1. The cost-of-living movement is calculated on both the *old\"\nBLS Index of Consumers' Prices and the revised index.\n\n* Mo. Lab.

And it is clearly possible\nthat, in the absence of widespread collective bargaining, steel wages might\nhave lagged more, in percentage terms, relative to the other wages than they\ndid in fact.\n",

In all of these categories, the\nnumber of women employed increased despite the fact that, during the wartime\nperiod, employment of women in higher-paid defense industries expanded\ngreatly. At the same time, the proportion of women workers to the entire\nfemale population 14 years of age and over increased from 26 per cent in\n1940 to a peak of 37 per cent in 1945 and then declined to a level of 29 per\ncent in 1950.* But whether or not increased wages were required to attract\nthese additional female workers to the labor force, it is reasonable to presume\nthat these lower-paid trades were under especially strong market pressure to\nraise wages in order to retain and increase their own female work forces.**\n\nA further element of difference between basic steel and most of the com-\nparison industries consists in the fact that steel was far more \"essential\" to\nthe wartime economy; and it is a matter of common knowledge that wartime\ncontrols on wages were much more effectively imposed on such essential\nindustries than they were on more purely *'civilian\" trades\u2014such as con-\nfectionery, laundries, cleaning and dyeing, retail trade, ice cream, etc.\n\nMoreover, in the subperiod following the removal of wage controls, basic\nsteel's pricing policy tended to retard the increase in its demand for labor.\nRees pointed this out and attributed this phenomenon in part to the existence\nof widespread collective bargaining in basic steel. In Part III below, however,\nwe question this explanation and suggest that the existence of another set of\ncharacteristics, its oligopolistic structure and political sensitivity, sufficed to\naccount for this industry's price behavior\u2014in which respects basic steel\ndiffered notably from all of the other comparison industries with the exception\nof crude petroleum.\n\nIn addition, Rees! method carries the implication that in none of the\nindustries which were lightly organized did unionism exert an impact upon\nthe level of money wages.

Nor can the movements in wages of male wage earners be regarded as independent of\nthe special influences which affected the wages of their female co-workers. If employers\nwere under especially strong market pressure to raise the wages of women in those\nindustries which had heavy concentrations of female labor, considerations of tradition,\nequity, and morale alone, in addition to interchangeability in some occupations, would have\ninduced them to raise the wages of their male employees to a certain extent.

This much is true for the majority of the industries\nin question, but of course it does not imply that, in the absence of a well-\norganized union, wages in basic steel would have risen as much as they ac-\ntually did. The latter inference is implied in the conclusion quoted above\nonly if one could have confidence that, for the purpose at hand, the only\nsignificant difference between basic steel and the comparison industries con-\nsists in their respective degrees of unionization. But no attempt was made\nto control for other differences between basic steel and the other industries\nto which it was compared\u2014such as di\u00edferential changes in employment and\nproductivity and differences in market structure or in original level of earn-\nings. Other writers believed such differences to be significantly associated\nwith variations in relative wages, and some of them attempted to make allow-\nance for them in assessing the impact of unionism per se.?\n\nFor example, apart from the difference in the degree of unionization, basic\nstecl differed from most of Rees! comparison industries with respect to certain\ncharacteristics which tended to hold wages in basic steel down relative to\nwages in the comparison group in the early wartime subperiod, and with\nrespect to other characteristics which tended to exert the same effect in the\nsubperiod between the suspension of controls and the onset of recession in\nlate 1948.\n\nIn the first place, the original level of earnings in basic steel greatly\nexceeded that in all other categories except crude petroleum. (See Table II\nbelow.) Since, in wartime the labor markets in essential industries were char-\nacterized by widespread substitution of less skilled and lower-paid labor for\nmore highly skilled and higher-paid workers, one would expect greater per-\ncentage, as well as absolute, increases in earnings in industries which originally\nemployed relatively high proportions of low-paid workers and which sought\nsubsequently to retain them.?* This point is related to another element of dif-\nference between basic steel and most of the highly organized industries with\nwhich it was compared. Over the decade 1940-1950 (which includes the period\nunder discussion), women comprised a high and in some cases an increasing\nproportion of the work force in certain occupational groupings which are\nrelevant to 7 of Rees 12 comparison industries: textile-mill products, in\n\n*See especially J.

Econ., May 1950, LXIV, 254-305.\n\n^ Another methodological issue is related to the failure of Rees! paper to control for\ndifferences in original levels of earnings. Levinson's study does compare groups of highly\norganized industries with groups of lightly organized industries in the same classes of\noriginal earnings; and the author finds that the former did not secure greater wage increases\nthan the latter during the period 1941-47. But a comparison among large groups at once\nraises the possibility that wage movements in the nonunion sector might be affected by wage\nmovements in the unionized sector. Levinson calls attention to the fact that part of the\nwage increases in the union sector might have been due to \"union pressure\" and that \"this\ngreater increase might then have been transmitted to the nonunion workers through sym-\npathetic pressure.\" H.

The Interindustry Wage Comparisons\n\nFrom a comparison between percentage increases in average hourly earn-\nings in basic steel and in selected industries characterized by much less\ncomplete unionization than prevailed in steel, Rees concludes that, for the\nperiods 1939-1948 and 1945-1948, \"the efforts of the United Steelworkers\nwere not enough to offset the forces working toward relatively larger increases\n\n!

Reply; but Ulman wishes it to be clear that agreement with other aspects of the\nReply is not necessarily implied.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to challenge the interesting conclusion by\nAlbert Rees! that the steelworkers' union did not raise wages appreciably\nabove the levels which would have been reached in its absence during the\nwar-and-postwar inflationary period. This conclusion is based primarily on\ninferences drawn from: (1) a comparison between wage changes in basic\nsteel and wage changes in certain less well-organized occupations; (2) a\ncomparison between wage changes in basic steel in the two world-war infla-\ntionary periods; and (3) reports of shortages in both the product and the\nlabor markets of basic steel in the inflationary period following the second\nworld war.\n\nI will consider each of these alleged foundations in turn and will point out\n(a) that in each case the criterion is not a satisfactory one for determining\nwhether or not the steelworkers' union made an independent contribution to\nthe observed increases in the earnings of its members in basic steel, and (b)\nthat in certain instances the empirical evidence presented by Rees, when sup-\nplemented by additional relevant evidence, makes the contrary conclusion at\nleast as plausible as the conclusion that it did not do so. In the latter con-\nnection, it should be noted that Rees at one point merely claimed that \"it is\nequally easy to argue that collective bargaining in the basic steel industry\nduring this period kept wages below the level which they would otherwise\nhave reached, or to argue that it raised wages above such a level.\" However,\nit is elsewhere made abundantly clear that he regarded the first inference as\nmore equal than the second.

That is not\nour position. Our proposed equation of demand for money explicitly provides\nfor varying rates of substitutability between money and other financial assets,\nboth direct and indirect.\n\nThird, he interprets our suggestion to mean that we would not be concerned\nwith effects of the changing composition of direct debt on excess money\n(pp. 129, 130). We have repudiated this interpretation at an earlier juncture\nin the present paper. In fact, we consider public-debt management, held in\nhigh esteem by Culbertson, to be a prime illustration of the case we are\nmaking\u2014and of the case that Culbertson is condemning\u2014for financial con-\ntrols in addition to monetary control. Replacement of Treasury bonds with\nTreasury bills tends to reduce demand for money, and complements easy-\nmoney policy. Funding does the reverse, and complements tight-money policy.\nIt mystifies us that Culbertson should write so fondly of public-debt manage-\nment and, at the same time, regard with horror the notion that management\ntechniques should be applied to other assets than Treasury bills that displace\nmoney in some degree (pp. 120, 121).\n\nIt may be appropriate, in connection with this discussion of debt manage-\nment, to suggest that Culbertson is astride two theoretical horses in his essay\nand is riding rapidly in opposite directions. Through his page 124, a Treasury\nbill would not partake of the uniqueness of money. It would resemble a time\ndeposit or a savings and loan share as a savings medium, with its volume\noutstanding depending on demand by savers. As a vehicle for matching\nplanned saving with planned investment, it would be noninflationary in\ncharacter. Since the public gives up money to get a Treasury bill, bill issue\nwould be contingent on a private act of saving, a private act of abstention\nfrom demand for goods. On the first set of principles enunciated by Culbert-\nson, bill issue should be as free of management as issues of all other assets\nthat do not qualify as money in the sense of means of payment.\n\nCulbertson mounts his second steed on page 125. Henceforth savers save\nby Aolding money as well as other financial assets. And money, no longer\nunique, differs from other assets only in the degree of its liquidity. Its\n*]iquidity-enhancing services\" (p. 128) place it at an extreme of the liquidity\nspectrum of assets, but this position is not so distinctive that such fairly\nclose substitutes as Treasury bills should escape the network of financial con-\ntrol. For Culbertson remounted, financial intermediaries create close money-\nsubstitutes (p. 129). And now he would *want to keep account\" of changes in\nthe volume of these substitutes and of the possible need for regulating them\nnot only by public-debt management but by other devices as well. This is\nthe horse that we too are riding. We welcome Culbertson aboard.\n\nJouwN G. GunLEv\nE. S.

It worries Culbertson that his logic deprives\nthe market for money of a demand schedule, but he does not retract the view\nthat banks are unique in being able to create as much money as they like.\n\nIt worries Culbertson, too, that his contrasts between banks and other\nintermediaries deprive the market for the latter's debt of a supply schedule.\nAfter stating categorically that intermediaries \"cannot control the volume of\ntheir outstanding obligations,\" he adds, although they can influence their\nsales, by altering quality of service, intensity of advertising, or profit margins\"\n(p. 00). If this means anything, it means that the volume of debt produced\nby these intermediaries is determined by a supply as well as by a demand\nfunction and that the intermediaries are not, after all, mere taps to be turned\non or off by the saving public.\n\nThe supply function, then, is not wholly determining on the money market.\nThe demand function is not wholly determining on the market for indirect\nfinancial assets. Moreover, Culbertson concedes, the latter assets can be\nsubstitutes for money (note 7 and p. 129), and their creation can result in ex-\ncess money. When Culbertson has finished with these concessions, what re-\nmains of his view that the banking system is unique and that our conception\nof the banking system is \"radical\"?\n\nA decade ago, when stabilization of long-term interest rates was the goal\nof monetary policy, it was frequently said that the Federal Reserve had \"lost\ncontrol\" of the money supply. But it loses control in precisely the same way\nwhen it pursues a policy of price or output or employment stabilization. The\nmoney supply is a \"tap\" issue, adapted to a policy goal and to the demand\nfor money in a way compatible with that goal. If the monetary system is\nunique, the reason cannot be that its output is independent of demand while\nthe output of other intermediaries is controlled by demand.\n\n5. Under present financial arrangements, banks are subject to a form of\ncontrol that is not applied, in peacetime, to other industries, financial or\nnonfinancial. One raw material, reserves,\" is rationed or allocated to the\nbanking system. The input coefficient relating reserves to money output is\nspecified, as a reserve requirement. These direct controls define production\ncapacity which, the assumption goes, is always short of output that the banks\nwould wish to produce: the banks are a *disequilibrium system.\" Such con-\ntrols may be familiar to the banking system alone in peacetime, but few\nindustries escape them under wartime conditions.\n\nWe have suggested that comparable direct controls should be applied to\nthe supply function of other financial intermediaries. In some degree, the\ndebt they create is a substitute for money. In some degree, hence, their\nexpansion results in excess money. Perhaps such expansion can and should\nbe restrained\u2014by rationing of reserves and stipulation of a reserve require-\nment, so that the entire brunt of protecting bond and commodity markets\nagainst excess demands will not be borne by the monetary system.\n\nCulbertson does not approve this suggestion. First, he interprets it to mean\nthat we would exempt the banks from control, lifting the harness of direct\ncontrols onto other intermediaries (pp. 124, 131). That is not our position. The\n",

Savers do not want money, and investors want it only\nto pay it out on the commodity markets. In short, there is no demand for\nmoney, and all money is excess money. In their own distinctive ways, J. B.\nSay and J. M. Culbertson have wrought havoc with the money-demand func-\ntion. Say would have savers content with any amount of real balances. Cul-\nbertson would have savers demand no real balances. According to the earlier\nof these landmarks of monetary theorizing, the price level is indeterminate:\naccording to the latter, money is desired by neither savers nor investors, there\nis no demand for money, money is valueless, and the price level is infinite.\n\nThe profession of economics has two conceptions of the saving-investment\nprocess. In income and employment theory, savings are a difference between\nincome and consumption, a rise in savers! net worth, a gain in their net finan-\ncial assets. The net financial assets are tickets of participation in investment,\nsupplied to savers by investors. On this definition, savings may take the form\npartly or wholly of increases in money balances (one variety of ticket for\nsavers to accumulate), and the monetary system as an intermediary transmits\nreal purchasing power over current output (o\u00a3 money balances) from savers\nto investors. This is the conception of saving-investment that Culbertson, with\nus in mind, dismisses as \"their terminology\" (p. 122). In Culbertson's \"existing\nbanking theory,\" savings are decreases in money balances of savers and in-\ncreases in savers' nonmonetary financial assets, and the monetary system has\nunlimited power to enlarge the flow of money to investment. In the former\nview, savings are always equal to investment ex Post, and there may be\nequality ex ante when the money supply is rising, falling, or unchanged. In\nthe latter, savings are equal to investment only when the money supply is\nvalueless. Existing banking theory,\" one gathers, has not been touched by\ndevelopments in income and employment theory these past twenty years\nand more. For so long as savings are interpreted by (financial) economists\nas increases in any asset but money, and by (income-employment) economists\nas the margin between income and consumption, little progress can be expected\nin relating the world of finance to the world of goods.\n\nCulbertson offers a second reason for thinking that the banks are unique.\nThey are not inhibited by \"the public's decisions about holding demand de-\nposits\" (p. 123). True intermediaries, on the contrary, \"cannot control the\nvolume of their outstanding obligations\" (p. 120), and the total of their debt\nis determined for them by savers. In short, there is no relevant demand\nfunction for money and no relevant supply function for other indirect financial\nassets.\n\nAs a monetary economist, Culbertson is impelled to qualify the dictum\nthat demand for balances is irrelevant to the money supply. It is not relevant\nin a way that is \"direct\" or immediate\" or \"natural,\" and it is not determin-\ning unless the central bank is *omniscient\" (p. 123). \"In a sense,\" the au-\nthority's choice of a price level and the public's choice of balances at that\nprice level inhibit the banks, but then the *mechanism\" of inhibition is not\nthe same as that to which other intermediaries are subject.

Culbertson claims that commercial banks are unique among financial\ninstitutions in several ways. First, they create money. We have to agree with\nthat. Second, they create loanable funds, while other financial intermediaries\nare mere middlemen in this respect. As Culbertson defines loanable funds,\nwe also have to agree with that. His account of how banks create loanable\nfunds\u2014\"acquiring additional debt by creating demand deposits\" (p. 121)\u2014\nis only a reiteration of the first point above, that banks create money. What-\never the combination of words one uses to make the point, banks do create\nmoney.\n\nBut something more than semantics is involved here. Culbertson considers\nit a piece of whimsy on our part that we define loanable funds as savings, in\nthe sense of income earned and not spent on consumption, of an increase in\nSavers! net worth and of an increase in their net financial assets. He prefers\nthe conception that loanable funds are payments of money to investors in\ncapital goods. These payments, for which investors issue direct debt, derive\nfrom two sources. One is \"private act[s] of saving\" (p. 122), and money flow-\ning from this source may flow directly from saver to ultimate borrower or\nindirectly through nonmonetary financial intermediaries and bank time-\ndeposit departments. The second source of moneyflows to investment is money\ncreation by the banking system, through its demand-deposit departments,\non its own initiative and with no by-your-leave to any saver. This definition,\nCulbertson indicates, is a piece of *existing banking theory\" (p. 122), and we\nregret that he is probably quite right in thinking so.\n\nIn Culbertson's image of the saving-investment process, saving is the act\nof paying out money, and savings are decreases in money balances accom-\npanied by accretions of nonmonetary assets. One saves by getting rid of\nmoney, and moncy rejected by savers ?/4s money created by banks are the\nloanable funds that finance investment.\n\nIf we interpret Culbertson correctly, that the saving process which finances\ninvestment consists of replacing money balances with *nonmonetary debt\"\n(pp. 121, 122), it must be concluded that his views on saving are disastrous for\nmonetary theory and are incompatible with income and employment theory.\nOn his rule that savers repel money, holdings of money can be no part of\n\nmoney balances over to the savings and loan associations, receiving in return $10 in\nshares. The public's demand for bonds is not changed; the banks' demand for bonds is\nnot changed; but the savings and loan associations express a demand of $10 for bonds\n(assuming the associations wish no reserves) that is excess demand at the initial bond\nrate of interest. The market for shares is continuously in partial equilibrium, but it\n\"originates\" a general disturbance in markets for money, bonds, and possibly goods.\n\n* Culbertson advances a third line of attack against our views on interest theory by\ncomparing our interpretation of interest-rate behavior in 1915-1921 with a \"more orthodox\nexplanation\" (p. 130). The rise in rates over these years he attributes to \"the unusually\nrapid increase in the volume of outstanding debt.\" We are wondering how this version\nof \"orthodoxy\" would account for the fall in rates during 1940-1045 when the volume\nof outstanding debt rose even more rapidly. For a monetary economist, Culbertson is\nremarkably reticent about the role of monetary policy as it a\u00edfected interest rates in\n1915-1921.\n",

If one\nis interested in explaining the growth of all financial intermediaries including\nthe monetary system, as real growth generates direct debt, our tripartite\nframework is useful whatever the relationships among the three assets. Cul-\nbertson is wrong, then, in saying, \"In order to justify using the concepts of\n*direct debt\" and 'indirect debt,\" then, the authors must show that all types of\nobligations of [nonmonetary] intermediaries substitute for money to a greater\ndegree than do all types of 'direct debt.'\" If this special relationship did\nhold, it would mean one thing for the growth of the monetary system and\nof other financial intermediaries. Other possible relationships, including\ncomplementarity between money and nonmonetary indirect debt, would yield\nother results. The usefulness of the analytical framework does not depend\non any particular set of relationships, as we attempted to point out in Aspects\"\n(pp. 528-29).\n\n3. Culbertson offers two criticisms of our comments on the theory of\ninterest. To make these clear, suppose that there are four goods in the econ-\nomy, commodities (4), direct debt (B), money (C) and nonmonetary indirect\ndebt (.D). Interest theory bears on the price of B. Culbertson's first argument\nis that the 4-B-C-D framework is unrealistic because the composition and\naverage liquidity of B and D change over time, and these changes cannot be\ntaken into account within our framework. Since we have taken them into\naccount in our published work, though no doubt imperfectly, and since Cul-\nbertson is aware of the fact in some degree (note 18), we turn to his second\nargument.*\n\nThe second argument is that shifts in demand schedules for D, or changes\nin amounts demanded as a result of shifts in supply schedules, cannot lead\nto excess demands or supplies at prevailing yields in B and C unless the market\nfor D moves into disequilibrium (p. 130). And since issues of D are apparently\ntap issues, this market cannot be in disequilibrium. Hence changes in amount\nof D demanded cannot affect the rate of interest on B\u2014-or the price level on\nA. This argument misses the point that an increase in demand for D may be\npartly at the expense of money and so create an excess supply of money (and\nan excess demand for direct debt, as nonmonetary intermediaries bid for it),\neven though the market for D is in equilibrium.?

                    "Our classification implies that we are interested in relative supplies of direct\nand (monetary and nonmonetary) indirect debt and in the public's choice\nbetween these financial assets. On what basis is this choice made? With a\nfew reservations (e.g., \"irrational behavior\"), Culbertson believes that it is\nmade solely on the liquidity-illiquidity basis. We disagree. The term liquidity\npreference suggests that allocations of funds to money balances are determined\nby the marginal advantage of liquidity over illiquidity. But in highly differ-\nentiated security markets, this is only a part of the story. As we have used\nthe term, diversification (which is \"portfolio balance\" for others) is meant\nto call attention to the fact that money is not desired just because it is more\nliquid than something else, and other financial assets are not desired simply\nbecause their illiquidity has been overcome by the bond rate of interest.\nRather, a particular stock of money is wanted because the marginal dollar\nin money balances provides more utility, in terms of liquidity, than the same\nmarginal dollar would provide, when invested in other financial assets, in\nterms of income, liquidity, corporate control, patriotic satisfaction, insurance,\nor dozens of other portfolio attributes. Liquidity preference does not do justice\nto the complexities of choice between money and more or less highly differ-\nentiated financial assets.\n\nAfter all, economists do not reason so narrowly when it comes to the\nallocation of funds in other ways. They do not have an \"intoxication-prefer-\nence\" theory of liquor; a dollar may be allocated to liquor because of its\ncapacity to intoxicate, but if instead the dollar is allocated to clothing it is not\nbecause the price of clothing has overcome the lesser ability of clothing to\nintoxicate. Intoxication preference\" would not do justice to the intricacies of\nconsumer choice in allocating the consumption budget, and by the same token\nliquidity preference falls short of explaining how much money is desired in\nfinancial portfolios.\n\nWe group financial assets to fit our problems and then explain the public's\nChoices on the basis of the many attributes\u2014liquidity being only one\u2014that\nhighly differentiated financial assets have. Direct debt may become more\nor less attractive, for many reasons, relative to monetary or nonmonetary\nindirect debt. A changing mixture of direct debt hence can affect demands\nfor indirect debt and so the growth of financial intermediaries. That we have\ntaken this into account is both acknowledged and denied by Culbertson\n(pp. 129, 130 and note 18). Moreover, the usefulness of our framework, for\nstudying the conformation of financial growth, does not require, as Culbertson\ninsists, that the public think in terms of \"direct\" or \"indirect\" assets. People\nchoose between assets according to their (explicit and imputed) yields and\nprices and, accordingly as this choice favors assets we choose to call indirect,\nfinancial intermediaries experience relatively rapid growth. Culbertson credits\nliquidity-preference analysis with \"definite logic,\" though he would hardly\nbe prepared to allege that the terminology of liquidity-preference analysis\nwas taken over by economists intact from the market place.\n\nWhen indirect debt is broken into its monetary and nonmonetary com-\nponents, it is clear that the public's choices between direct and indirect assets\nhave significant consequences not only for financial intermediaries generally\nbut also for the monetary system.

                    "Culbertson's main points appear to be: (1) we fail to treat money as a\nunique financial asset; (2) our concepts of direct debt and monetary and\nnonmonetary indirect debt are unrealistic, theoretically inept, and inferior\nto the concepts of liquidity and illiquidity; (3) our theory of interest rests\non the objectionable division of assets and debt into direct and indirect forms,\nand it assumes disequilibrium positions, which rarely appear, in the market\nfor the obligations of nonmonetary financial intermediaries; (4) we do not\nappreciate the unique position of commercial banks among financial institu-\ntions; and (5) in view of the above \u00edailings, our suggestion for extending\ncontrols over indirect debt generally is unsound. Our comments follow this\norder.\n\n1. Money is unique in the sense that no other financial asset is exactly like\nit. But as much, or rather as little, could be said for any financial asset. The\nimportant consideration here for monetary, interest, and price-level theory\nis how the demand for money is affected by demand for and terms of supply\nof other financial assets. And on this point we share the general belief with\nCulbertson that money has many close substitutes. He cites as examples\ntreasury bills, time deposits, savings bonds, and savings and loan shares. To\nthe extent that such substitutes are available, then, the demand for money\nis less than it otherwise would be. This is the essential point: the \"uniqueness\nof money\" is a red herring.\n\n2. The manner in which financial assets are to be grouped or ranked de-\npends on the problem. A way of grouping financial assets that is appropriate\nfor one array of problems does not preclude other ways that bear on different\nproblems. Our main interests are in analyzing the relationship between real\ngrowth and financial growth, in isolating the function of intermediation for\nspecial study, and in considering the relative roles during the growth process\nof monetary and nonmonetary intermediaries. Since the accumulation of\ndirect (or primary) debt almost inevitably accompanies real growth, and\nsince a principal function of the monetary system and other financial inter-\nmediaries is to purchase direct debt from and issue indirect debt to non-\nfinancial spending units, the framework of direct and indirect debt seems\nadmirably suited to our interests.\n\nWe do not object to other schemes for classifying financial assets. The\ndifference between equity and debt, ambiguous though it is, can be useful in\nstudying business organization, business incentive and motivation, or stability\nof business income and spending. The difference between short-term and long-\nterm securities, arbitrary as it is, is relevant to study of the interest-rate\nstructure. A ranking of financial assets along a liquidity spectrum may be\nuseful in explaining asset-holders' behavior on the commodity markets, which\nmay or may not be the problem Culbertson has in mind (he never says) when\nhe advocates such a procedure. All of these methods can be useful, but to\nimply, as Culbertson does, that one has to settle once and for all on money-\nbonds, liquidity-illiquidity, direct-indirect, or some fourth or nth grouping\nand stick with it through thick or thin without stipulating the purpose for\nwhich it is used, is to miss the mark completely.\n",

While this diminution of farm\nlabor inputs has mitigated the problem of low incomes per farm worker,\nthere nonetheless continues to be a wide gap in average agricultural\nincomes between high farm-income areas such as Iowa and a low farm-\nincome area such as the Mississippi delta. Some students look upon this\npersistent income differential over the last 19 years as testimony to the\nfailure of migration in achieving regional equalization of farm incomes.\nWhile emigration of farm population cannot alone solve the farm pov-\nerty problem, any solution to this problem which implies a reduction\nof farm labor inputs necessarily bears upon the problem of farm labor\nredundance. This is true whether the solution envisaged involves part-\ntime farming, employment in local nonagricultural industries, or actual\nresidential change through migration.\n\nThe present paper is concerned with the effectiveness of farm-labor\nmigration in diminishing regional differentials in agricultural incomes.\nA comparative study has been made of two areas: Iowa, and a 24-\ncounty case-study area around Memphis.'

No\nincrease in reserve requirements was undertaken; long-term bonds were not\nissued by the Treasury between the summer of 1955 and the fall of 1957; the\ndiscount rate was raised in a series of small steps; and the Federal Reserve\nsystem did not initiate a continuous deflationary open-market policy\u2014the\nholdings of securities by the system were practically as large at the end of\n1956 as at the end of 1954. In short the monetary authorities were reluctant\nto initiate a vigorous restrictive monetary policy to compensate for the rise in\nthe velocity of money during this period [1, p. 38]. Under these conditions, a\ncost-inflationary bias was injected into the economy because the monetary\nauthorities were unwilling to control the volume of bank credit.\n\nTn times of full employment, it is the action of monetary authorities which\ndetermines the stability of the price level. And a qualified wage-price inflation\nthesis that only emphasizes federal spending is inadequate. Excessive money-\nwage-rate changes can be compensated for by a rise in the quantity of money\nor its velocity. It is precisely the willingness of the monetary authorities in\nmost countries to feed the stream of monetary demand sufficiently to accom-\nmodate excessive money-wage-rate increases that enables the wage-push proc-\ness to operate; or alternatively, the unwillingness of the authorities to counter-\nact the more active use of the existing stock of money induced by cost in-\ncreases or mild credit restraints.\n\nWhether trade union leaders believe that the unemployment resulting from\nexcessive wage rate increases will be compensated for by federal contracyclical\npolicies is irrelevant. (It is hard to believe that any American trade union\nleader believes this, especially in light of both Democratic and Republican\nadministration reluctance to use such policies since the passage of the Employ-\nment Act of 1946.) Union leaders only have to be aware of the fact that wage-\nrate increases do not cause continuous unemployment; given this empirical\nobservation, they will reintensify their upward pressure on wage rates. What\nis needed is to include in the Employment Act of 1946 the goal of reasonable\nstability of prices. If the control authorities were to feel as keenly about this\nas they do in regard to production and employment levels, the wage-push-\ninflationary thesis might become only of interest to economic historians.\n\nDuprrv W.

Experi-\nence in the recessions of 1948-49, 1953-54, and 1957-58, indicates that un-\nemployment, irrespective of its cause (cost-induced or otherwise), was not\ncounteracted by governmental contracyclical policies. Thus the increased fed-\neral government expenditures ^. . . resulted from factors exogeneous to the\nmoney-wage-rate employment-level relationship . . .\" [2, p. 971]; this pre-\nsumably means the economy did not have a cost-inflationary bias.\n\nIn this note I shall argue that Gallaway's interpretation of the qualified\nwage-push inflation thesis is too narrow for two reasons: first, he ignores the\nbehavior of monetary policy; secondly, trade union leaders do not have to\nbelieve that *. . . any unemployment effects resulting from excessive money-\nwage-rate-increases will be compensated for by government contracyclical\npolicies . . .\"[2, p. 968] in order for a cost-inflationary bias to be present in an\neconomy.\n\nAn economy can have a cost inflationary bias even though there is no pre-\nsumption that federal spending will eliminate any unemployment resulting\nfrom excessive money-wage-rate increases. Given the government's commit-\nment to the goals contained in the Employment Act of 1946, the Federal Re-\nserve authorities may be expected to pursue a policy of monetary restraint\ncautiously. Otherwise the application of strong doses of monetary restraint\nwill bring on the very decline of aggregate economic activity which it is the\nresponsibility of the federal government to prevent.\n\nIn 1955 production expanded at a record rate. The index of industrial pro-\nduction, at 123 in August 1954, rose to 130 by December, and to 144 by De-\ncember 1955. The gross national product rose in 1955, 1956, and the first 9\nmonths in 1957. The consumer price index did not commence to rise until the\nbeginning of 1956, and wholesale prices until mid-1955. Although the money\nsupply (the total of paper currency plus demand deposits) expanded little\nfrom the first quarter in 1955 to the fourth quarter in 1957 (the expansion\nwas $2.8 billion), a substantial rise in the velocity of money occurred. The\nrate of turnover in the money supply increased by approximately 15 per cent\nfrom the first quarter of 1955 through the fourth quarter of 1957. This is\nequivalent to a 15 per cent rise in the money supply with a constant velocity.\n\nThese velocity changes simply reflect an increase in the supply of close\nsubstitutes for money. The public was substituting savings deposits and short-\nterm government securities for checking deposits; for this period, the level of\ntime deposits expanded from $75.6 billion to $88 billion; balances in savings\nand loan associations increased from $27.9 billion to $41 billion; and the pub-\nlic's holdings in short-term government securities rose from $25.6 billion to\n$37 billion. The public found it advantageous to economize on its holdings of\ncash, and financial institutions which gained these funds loaned them out\npromptly to spenders. As a result, the turnover of the money supply was ac-\ncelerated causing trouble for monetary policy [3, p. 180].\n\nTo be sure the government moved rather promptly to curb the inflationary\nforces generated during 1955. But if these anti-inflationary policies are viewed\n",

Regardless of what\nthe total quantity of capital is to be at some particular future point in time,\nsay at \u00a3 \u2014 T (and what this amount is to be is, of course, itself to be de-\ntermined), so that the sum of the capital additions for all periods from say\nt \u2014 Lto\u00a3 \u2014 T is specified, it must be impossible to raise what Leontief refers\nto as the \"level of welfare,\" ie., ordinal utility, by increasing capital for-\nmation at any one point in time and reducing it by the same amount at any\nother point in time. For instance, in the plan illustrated by Leontief's Figure\nl, consider the capital stock at \u00a3 \u2014 3 specified at the stationary level de-\ntermined by him. Since the capital stock at \u00a3 \u2014 1 is given, the total capital\nformation over the interval from 1 to 3 is determined. The crucial test is:\nReshuffle (arbitrage) the total investment between the first two time periods;\nincrease capital formation by a unit at 4 \u2014 1 and decrease it by a unit at\nt \u2014 2, or vice versa; this must not increase total utility. Leontief's solution\nfails this test.\n\n'The issue is clarified and dramatized if we associate some numbers with\nLeontief's example given in his Figures 1 and 2. We select a utility index so\nthat each indifference curve has associated with it the utility:\n\nU \u2014 21n Ci t 1n Yia\n\nwhere C; stands for the consumption scheduled for \u00a3 \u2014 i (measured on the\nhorizontal axis in his Figure 1) and Y;.,, for the perpetuity of income com-\nmencing at \u00a3 \u2014 i -- 1 (measured on the vertical axis). These are seen to be\nindifference curves with the conventional diminishing marginal rates of sub-\nstitution (MUc/MUy \u2014 .2Yi,1/Ci), and the marginal utilities are diminish-\ning. As production function (Leontief's Figure 2) we choose for simplicity the\nsegmented linear function:!\n\nY \u2014.8K 0cK\u00ab8\nY \u2014 64 4-6 (K \u2014 8) 8\u00abK \u00ab14755\nY \u2014 10.454 - .35 (K \u2014 14.755) 14.755 \u00ab K \u00ab 16\n\nY \u2014 10.889 4- .2 (K \u2014 16) 16\u00ab K\n\nwhere K is the capital stock (measured on the horizontal axis of Figure 2).\nThe coefficients of K are, of course, the marginal physical products of capital\n(MPP), and these are seen to diminish by steps as the capital stock grows.\nWe suppose that the given initial capital stock, K, \u2014 9. This is seen to imply\nan initial income, Y, \u2014 7.\n\nBy careful plotting or by applying Leontief's fundamental equations the\ncapital-investment-consumption-income allocation through time can be ob-\ntained (see part A of Table 1). This is Leontief's solution. As in his own\n\n'For the smooth production function illustrated by Leontief in Figure 2 (but not in\nFigure 1) it is logically impossible for his stationary state to be reached in three time\nperiods. This state can be approached only in the limit as the number of time periods\nbecomes infinite.

                    "It is the purpose of this brief note to demonstrate that, much like Hayek\n[3] [2, Ch. 17-18] before him, Leontief has in fact not succeeded in solving\nthe problem. Because he overlooks some crucial intertemporal relationships,\nhis time paths of economic development do not have the maximizing proper-\nties claimed for them.\n\nLeontief's graphical solution of how much to consume and how much to add\nto the capital stock at each point in time can be represented by what I will call\nLeontief's fundamental equations:\n\n(2) MU.,! \u2014 MPP'MU,! \u00a323,2,...\n\nThe term on the left is the marginal utility from consumption at time \u00a3. The\nfirst factor on the right is the marginal physical product from investment at \u00a3\nin the production of perpetuities of income commencing at \u00a3 -- 1. This is pos-\ntulated to diminish with increases in the capital stock. The second factor on\nthe right is the marginal utility derived from the claim to such a perpetuity\ncommencing at / 4- 1. Given an initial capital stock at / \u2014 1, an income for\nthis point in time is determined by the production function. As long as all\nthe income is consumed\u2014no more, no less\u2014the capital stock remains un-\nchanged and the same constant income will be produced. But how much\nshould be consumed and how much added to the capital stock in order to\nmaximize the satisfaction of the decision-maker? The first equation in the set\n(1) says that the income at \u00a3 \u2014 1 should be divided between current con-\nsumption and additions to the capital stock so that an extra unit of income\nwill give the same extra utility if consumed at \u00a3 \u2014 1 as will the claim to the\nMPP* units of perpetuity that can alternatively be produced with such an\nextra unit of income. This determines consumption and capital formation at\nt \u2014 1. It also specifies the capital stock at 4 \u2014 2 and hence income for \u00a3 \u2014 2.\nSimilarly the solution of the second of Leontief's fundamental equations\ndetermines the allocation of income for \u00a3 \u2014 2 between consumption and invest-\nment; and so on for succeeding time periods. Of course, we need not write any\nof the equations once the stationary state in which all of the income is consumed\nis reached, since the solution for every one of these is identical.\n\nThe clue suggesting that the plan sketched out by Leontief's process fails\nto maximize the utility function of the decision-maker is provided by the char-\nacteristic that decisions are made seriatim. The consumption-investment\nchoice for \u00a3 \u2014 1 is made without regard to and quite independently of the al-\nlocation of the output at subsequent points in time. Similarly for the alloca-\ntions at \u00a3 \u2014 2, 3. . . . Thus, the amount to be added to the capital stock at\nt \u2014 2 is the same whether beginning with 7 \u2014 3 a// income each year is to be\nconsumed or only 20 per cent each year is to be consumed. Surely it is im-\npossible to decide how much output at each point is to be allocated to con-\nsumption and capital formation without taking explicit account of how high\nthe marginal utility of consumption and the marginal productivity of capital\nwill be at each later date. After all, each one of these decisions determines how\nlarge the capital stock and consumption at each of these time points will be.\nIt almost seems as if Leontief's solution is a plan which determines consump-\ntion for each day under the assumption that on the following day a/] income\n",

According to the equation of exchange, an\nincrease in P with little change in O will produce an adjustment in either the\nquantity of money (M) or its velocity (V). As Johnson points out, in the\nperiod 1955-57 the adjustment took the form of an increase in the velocity of\nmoney. While a possible case can be made for the increased expenditures\nresulting from cost increases, it seems highly unlikely that a rise in costs re-\nsulting from excessive money-wage-rate increases would stimulate an $18 bil-\nlion rise in gross investment expenditures and a $10 billion increase in govern-\nment purchases of goods and services.?\n\nIn summary, the period 1955-1957 was characterized by excessive aggre-\ngate demand which put pressure on the money supply (MV) through an in-\ncrease in the velocity of money. This increase in velocity then permitted the\npressures from the aggregate demand side to exert their impact on the price\nlevel. This pattern of events illustrates rather aptly the weaknesses of monetary\npolicy (even at levels of full employment).

Coupled with the multiplier, it can\nbe made to yield a series of self-generating cycles, provided that the\nphenomenon of excess capacity is ignored, as in Paul Samuelson's\nclassic model [12]. Even when discarded as the usual cause of the\nupturn, as it was by J. R. Hicks [6], the accelerator remains the\ncrucial factor on the downturn, because it is used to explain an endog-\nenous lead of investment over national output. The principle derives\nits peculiar power and its attraction, in other words, from the proposi-\ntion that a mere retardation in the rate of increase of real national\nincome during a cyclical expansion may cause an absolute decline of\ninvestment and hence of production.\n\nI propose to show that it is unnecessary to invoke the accelerator to\nexplain how a downturn of aggregate investment may occur when\naggregate output retards (decelerates), that it is substantially incorrect\nto do so, and that more than token weight must be given to other\ndeterminants of investment decisions which acceleration theorists\nthemselves recognize are of some, though not \"fundamental\" im-\nportance. The negative aspect of my argument consists principally of\nthe demonstration that fixed investment in the bulk of manufacturing\nindustries is more nearly a function of the level of output than its rate\nof change, together with tentative evidence that accelerator-induced\ninventory investment may play a minor role in business downturns.\nThe positive contribution is to emphasize the fact that a business\nexpansion becomes less widely diffused over the economy as aggregate\nactivity retards, and to show how the individual production declines\n\n* The author is a member of the senior research staff of the Brookings Institution.\nHis thanks are due to Moses Abramovitz and W.

Under his permanent income\nhypothesis, both actual consumption and actual income are broken\nup, at least conceptually, into permanent and transitory components.\nThe permanent component of income is that portion of an individual\nunit's income that the unit regards, consciously or behaviorally, as\npermanent. The transitory component, which may be either positive\nor negative, is that part of income produced by influences that the\nindividual unit regards as random.

The study, which is financed by a grant from the Ford\nFoundation, is based largely on the 1950 survey of the Bureau of Labor Statistics of 12,500\nfamilies in 91 representative cities. The principal purpose of this survey was the revision\nof expenditure weights in the Consumer Price Index. 1500 items of budget information\nhave been tabulated in 18 volumes of statistical tables. The data are believed to be more\nreliable for middle-income than for the very lowest and the very highest, and for wages\nand salaries than for other types of income. In any statistical investigation, there are sam-\npling, reporting, and processing errors. Hence analytical results, parameter estimates, and\nderived relationships must be interpreted cautiously.

                    "The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance, and the\nTheory of Investment: Reply\n\nIn this reply to the two preceding comments, we shall concentrate on certain\nissues raised by David Durand. To J. R. Rose we can only apologize for\nhaving led him astray by our failure to adjust explicitly the definition of a\n\"class\" [3, p. 266, par. 2] when we introduced debt financing (Sec. I.B). We\nshould have said more clearly, in the very beginning perhaps, that what\ndetermines membership in a class is the stream generated by the assets held\nby the firm, not the stream accruing to the shares. The two streams, of course,\nhappen to be completely equivalent in our first special case of no borrowing,\nbut only in that case. We hope the above emendation plus a study of Durand's\nnumerical parable of Petrolease, Leverfund and Closecorp will clear up the\nmisunderstanding.\n\nWe do not propose to go over Durand's comment point by point partly for\nreasons of space, and partly because on many issues we have little to add to\n(or retract from) what we originally wrote. There are, however, four issues\nwhere Durand's comments (plus correspondence we have had with many\nothers) have led us to believe that some further elaboration of our model and\nour approach to the empirical problems might serve a useful purpose.\n\nBefore proceeding to this task, however, we should like to remind readers\nof the considerable areas of agreement between Durand and us which are\neasy to overlook in critical exchanges of this kind. Despite his sternly critical\ntone, he agrees (1) that our conclusions, which \"contradict widely accepted\nbeliefs\" can be regarded as valid at least \"in their own properly limited\ntheoretical context\" (see p. 640) ; and (2) that for all the attention that lever-\nage has received in the literature of finance \"the influence, if any, of leverage\non the cost of capital has so far escaped detection\" (p. 652).

In terms of rational profit-seeking\nbehavior, what made sense for General Foods made no sense for A and PF.\nThis suggests a closer look at Lanzillotti's evidence.

The second observation is not.\n\nIt would take a more intensive analysis than is possible here of the reasons\nthe various companies offered for using different methods of pursuing different\nproximate goals in their pricing to support this contention that the ultimate\nobjectives might none the less have been the same. A few citations must\nsuffice. The discussion of the strategy of the big meat packers, where price\npolicy on the buying side is directed primarily at preserving market shares\n[4, pp. 46-47], runs clearly in terms of rational oligopsony.!* The necessity\nfor Standard of Indiana to abandon its hitherto rigid formula pricing methods\nafter 1948, in order to preserve its shrunken market against competitive in-\nroads, again hardly requires complex or novel explanation, any more than\ndoes the consistent price-following policy of Gulf Oil and National Steel. The\nfact that American Can aims at a fixed margin above the cost of tinplate,\npreferring to compete primarily on the basis of service; that Kennecott, by\nfar the largest seller of copper to independent fabricators [4, p. 179], tries to\nstabilize market price; that companies with large shares of their market try\nto avoid price cutting as a competitive strategy except where demand appears\nto be very elastic\u2014these various policies hardly vitiate, on the contrary\nthey seem explicable primarily in terms of, the assumption of profit maxi-\nmization. That the goal calls for different strategies and suggests different\nrule-of-thumb procedures in different market contexts does not disprove the\nuniformity of objective.\n\nThe fact that oligopolists usually refrain from increasing published prices\nexcept in response to increases in direct costs is often cited as evidence of a\nfailure to maximize. It may indeed be, except in some rather attenuated, long-\nrun sense. However, it is not difficult to reconcile such behavior with pure\nmarginalism: if the degree of monopoly power (ie., the inelasticity of de-\nmand) is (or seems to the oligopolist) unchanged, the market will in fact\nbear (or seem to bear) a fixed percentage mark-up over marginal costs. The\nprofit-maximizing price will therefore change only with changes in direct\ncosts and not with changes in demand, so long as marginal costs are constant\nwithin the relevant range [8, p. 459]. Hence cost-plus pricing, which tends to\nproduce price stability and the appearance\u2014indeed, it can hardly be doubted,\nat times like 1946-48 an actuality\u2014of charging less than the traffic will bear,\nis not necessarily inconsistent with even short-run profit maximization.5\n\n\" Conceivably, as Lanzillotti points out [5, p. 934, n. 13], the long-run investment\npolicies that must also be explained if one is to explain the long-run stability of market\nShares are irrational; but the monograph offers no evidence on this score.\n\n? [t is not clear how heroic are the assumptions required to equate short-period profit\nmaximization with cost-plus pricing in this fashion. However the two crucial assumptions\n\u2014that marginal costs be constant and the elasticity of demand unchanging (at least so far\nas business men can tell or it is feasible for them to tell) within the relevant range\u2014seer\nrealistic for manufacturing. The discussion of American Can in the Brookings study\nseems to illustrate some such situation, emphasizing as it does the importance of direct raw\nmaterial cost in the final price of the cans, and the reported lack of interest of canners\nin the absolute level of can prices. So the authors refer to American Can as the \"trans-\nmission belt for passing material and labor cost on to consumers with an inelastic demand\"\n",

Other Pricing Formulae\n\nApart from the prevalence of full-cost pricing in one form or another, the\nauthors tend to reject the assumption of maximization because of the variety\nof pricing methods different companies employ. It is difficult to disagree with\nLanzillotti's conclusion that \"no single motivational hypothesis such as profit-\nmaximization . . . is likely to impose an unambiguous course of action . . .\"\n[5, pp. 938-39]. But it does not follow, as he suggests, that pricing policies\nare in almost every case equivalent to a . . . choice from among competing\nobjectives rather than policies tested by any simple concept of profits maxi-\nmization\" [p. 939, stress supplied]. The one statement merely recognizes\ndifferent possible methods for achieving the goal of maximization; the other\ndemotes the goal itself to one among a host of competing objectives.\" The\nfirst observation seems clearly justified by Lanzillott's summary of the\nBrookings studies, to the effect that *one company will prefer stability, an-\nother will seek to expand its market share, or to engage in continuous dis-\n\n?]t is here that maximizing considerations stand out most explicitly in his own discus-\n\nSion as not merely the primary but virtually the exclusive determinant [see 5, pp. 930-31,\nincluding note 10].\n",

In this event, it is a reasonable ques-\ntion whether the low price policy on ingot might not have reflected a decline\nin the company's monopoly power and the prohibition by antitrust decree of\nthe kind of margin-squeezing promotional pricing described above [see 4,\npp. 30, 142-43], just as Wallace had advocated long before [9, p. 395].\n\nIt is precisely in the case of new or distinctive products, where, according\nto the authors, companies have the widest discretion and are most apt to\nresort to formula methods in general and target-return pricing in particular\n[5, p. 930], that profit maximization stands out most clearly in these studies.\nOne final illustration is General Electric's description of the considerations\nthat went into pricing its new portable dishwasher: its unwillingness to use\nprice as a selling point because it believed demand inelastic at the outset; its\nexpenditure of \"another $5.00 . . . on streamlining and in embellishment\"\nwhich \"made it look like another $30 to the customer\" [4, pp. 59-60]. It\nis here that Lanzillotti's emphasis on the nonmaximizing characteristics of\ntarget-return pricing, with \"fairness\" and \"reasonableness\" as its prime de-\nterminant, seems most clearly inappropriate.!*\n\n5. These contentions derive some indirect support, finally, from Lanzillotti's\nobservation that investment policy is itself a vital long-range aspect and\ndeterminant of short-run price policy [5, p. 940]. The rates of return pricing\ncan seek and hope to elicit are themselves conditioned by the relationship of\ncapacity to demand; and the choice among investment projects that give rise\nto production capacity is concededly made primarily on the basis of the re-\nSpective rates of return promised. Even the biggest, price-leading companies\nprofess to be powerless to do more than seek out what the market will take\u2014\nan admission that is in any event clearly in conflict with the \"public utility\"\npricing analogy; but what the market will take is itself heavily influenced by\nthe investment decisions of the firms enjoying access to it.\n",

The company's explanation of\nthe postwar pricing history of nylon [4, pp. 105-7] runs in terms of in-\ncreasing production costs and inelastic demand (except for instances when,\nin time of extreme shortage, the company refrained from charging anything\nlike what the grey market was paying); research and development costs are\nnot mentioned. The one deliberate price reduction mentioned was for 840\ndenier yarn, used in tire cord, a cut \"aimed at further penetration of this\nmarket at the expense of rayon\" [4, p. 107]. Again, the authors can explain\ndu Pont's apparently more aggressive price reductions in the corresponding\nearly history of cellophane only in terms of differences in their respective\ncosts and price elasticities of demand; the former are not defined to include\nresearch costs [4, p. 254]. And of course the company's own statement of\npolicy, quoted above, can similarly be interpreted in marginalist terms: the\nvalue of the \"achievement\" is, clearly, defined largely in terms of elasticity\nof demand. In the end, after once again implying that research expenses must\nbe allocated among products and so enter their prices on some \"fair share\"\nbasis (which may well be true as a matter of accounting procedure), the au-\nthors conclude *'the company comes close to charging, over the long run, what\nthe traffic will bear\" [4, pp. 154, 155]: research cost-plus pricing is not\nmentioned.!?\n\nThere are other instances in the monograph where alleged nonmaximizing\nconsiderations in fixing prices would have been irrational and seem moreover\nto be refuted by the evidence. For example, Alcoa officials asserted that the\ncompany's \"pricing of aluminum ingot, the pivotal price for aluminum prod-\nucts, has been based on promotion of the use of aluminum,\" and that in so\ndoing the company \"has consistently refrained from charging all the traffic\nwill bear\" in this market. [4, pp. 31-32]. Surely, first, a rational monopolist\nseeking to promote the use of aluminum could better strike the profit-maxi-\nmizing balance in the light of varying elasticities of demand for different\naluminum products not by taking a low price on all sales, but, instead, by\nholding up the price of ingot on sales to fabricators, and, integrating forward\ninto the price-elastic lines, accepting low nominal fabricating margins in those\nlines. Second, Wallace concludes that profits at the monopolistic ingot level\nwere much higher than at the competitive fabricating levels, and high also in\ncomparison with American industry generally, for the very reason indicated\n[9, Ch. 11]. The Alcoa statement quoted above refers, it is true, mainly to\n\nrepeats Judge Ryan's figure of $45 million spent on research as an example of the \"sub-\nstantial investment at considerable risk\" required for innovation today), Willard E.\nMueller's devastating analysis of what the Company's own president referred to as a\n*$27,000,000 gamble\" [7, p. 84] should be required reading for economists. Mueller shows\nthat only about $787,000, spent on rescarch, really involved \"the big gamble\"; another\n$391,000 went into the pilot plant. All the additional millions of dollars were for construct-\ning a commercial plant, after the technical and commercial attractiveness of nylon had\nbeen clearly established.\n\n? As this conclusion indicates, the authors are themselves skeptical that du Pont really\nprices new products to any significant extent on the basis of research and developmental\ncosts plus a reasonable return. They nowhere state that it does.\n",

In many situations, target-return pricing simply does not make sense\nexcept as an ex post rationalization of profit-maximization. Explications of the\nmethod by company officials tend irresistibly to proffer \"good\" rather than\n\"real\" reasons-\u2014although considerations of fairness, or defensibility before\nCongressional investigating committees (or against wage demands) undoubt-\nedly play some role in pricing decisions, in some companies more than others.\n\nFor example, the policy sometimes proclaimed by du Pont officials of de-\ntermining the prices of new products with reference to the research and devel-\nopmental expenses they have involved would actually be an irrational means\nof recouping those expenses. Here is the company's avowed explanation:\n\nIf our contribution of an improved new product is an exceptional\nachievement because of long and expensive research and development\nand a high permanent investment hazard, and if it affords profitable\nopportunities to consumers or converters, we feel we are entitled to an\nexceptionally good return and we ask a corresponding price for it. If\nour contribution has been only a moderate one, then we determine upon\na price that will give us a profit consistent with our work, effort, and\nrisk [5, p. 153].\n\nThe statement is equivocal; yet clearly, among other things, it implies that\nthe *value of the contribution\" that helps determine price is determined in\nlarge measure by its cost, including the risks it has entailed. But it makes no\nsense to try to recoup research costs by charging a cost-based price that either\nexceeds or falls short of the profit-maximizing level. Sunk costs may be used\nto justify a price embodying a high mark-up over out-of-pocket expenses,\nfor public relations purposes; but it cannot explain it, unless the responsible\nofficials have thrown rationality to the winds. The only connection in which\nthey might intelligently relate price to sunk costs ex ante would be if they\nreduced or voluntarily accepted less than a profit-maximizing price that\nthreatened to recoup too much (by standards of reasonableness or whatever)\n\u2014never if they increased or exceeded a profit-maximizing price that threat-\nened to recoup too little. So, references to heavy research and developmental\nexpenses are not convincing as explanations of high prices and profit margins;\nand that is what they are usually adduced to explain.\n\nThat du Pont does not in fact behave in this irrational manner is sug-\ngested by the monograph's story of nylon-pricing\u2014an account the authors\npreface with the (irrelevant) statement that research in developing the fiber\n\"cost the company $6 million,\"'* and with the implication that this fact had\n\n?

The authors add that \"21 million was spent on manufacturing facilities before com-\nmercial operations and sales began\" [4, p. 103]. Since the financial dimensions of du Pont's\nrisks in the development of nylon have become part of the folklore on the relationship\nbetween business size, patent protection and innovation (for example, the Report of the\nAttorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws [10, p. 225, n. 8]\n",

Rationality of pricing policy, as the economist has traditionally defined\nit, is suggested also in the divergences of actual company returns from their\nrespective targets\u2014above it for extended periods of time, where the market\npermits; below it where the market requires. As for the latter instances, the\ntarget evidently represents a mixture of expectation and hope: the case\nstudies abound with instances of companies accepting less where they had to,\nwith pricing on a virtual incremental cost basis if necessary.? International\nHarvester's failure to achieve even the modest 10 per cent goal in the 1947-55\nperiod (its actual average return was 8.9 per cent) suggests that the modesty\nof the target was an evidence not of restraint on profit maximization but real-\nism; and that the company must have been trying to get all it could. More\nsignificant in the present context is the persistence of actual returns markedly\nabove the target. General Motors has shown no tendency to alter its pricing\n\nitself a reflection of the inhospitality of meat markets to this kind of pricing. So the fact\nthat some companies can and others find they cannot base pricing on full-cost or that\nSome products permit it and others do not is itself a reflection of what the market will\nallow in the way of a profit-maximizing policy. See, e.g., Kaplan's explanation of why\nthat kind of pricing is impossible in fresh meats, possible in automobiles, possible for\nAlcoa, decreasingly so for Standard of Indiana, and impossible for Kennecott [4, pp. 47,\n86-91, 131, 142, 176-77, 185]. See also the discussion in section II below.\n\n*]t is difficult to be certain how meaningful is Lanzillotti's observation that \"individual\nproducts, markets, and pricing are not considered in isolation . . . . pricing is frequently\ndone for product groups with an eye to the over-all profit position of the company\"\n[5, p. 939]. If this means anything in the context of our present discussion, it must be that\ncompanies will typically charge on their high-margin lines only enough to raise aggregate\ncompany profits to the target level, This would be difficult to prove in the case of du Pont,\nSince that company specifes no over-all target; targets evidently are set product by\nproduct only, and all together produced an average return of 25.9 per cent after taxes in\n1947-55. If instead my points (1) and (2) are correct, Lanzillotti should have gone on\nas follows: *However, individual products and markets contribute to that over-all profit\nlargely on the basis of their varying elasticities of demand, and the aggregate profit itself\nseems closely attuned to what in fact the company finds it can stably earn.\"\n\nIt appears from the context in which the foregoing statement appears, however, that\nLanzillotti may mean only that costs and revenues for individual products and markets\ncan seldom be meaningfully estimated in isolation, because of the prevalence of joint costs\nand benefits. This is of course quite true. For example, Johns-Manville and International\nHarvester are forced by their desire to offer a full line into accepting returns well below\nthe target on certain products [5, p. 160]. Vet if the two companies! faith in the full\nline is justified, the returns on the \"line-filling\" items are only nominally low; and failure\nto drop them may well reflect the maximizing calculation that the incremental costs of\ncarrying them are lower than their fully allocated costs, and the incremental revenue\nlosses from dropping them greater than their nominal returns. The authors specifically\npoint this out in the case of International Harvester [4, pp. 73, 76-77].\n\n? For examples of the latter practice, see the cases of International Harvester, just cited,\nand of Esso Standard [4, p. 82].\n",

Vet\nthe authors offer us no reason to believe that the decision-makers of Inter-\nnational Harvester (who aim at 10 per cent on investment after taxes) are\nmore public-spirited than those of General Motors (who aim at 20 per cent) ;\nof Alcoa (about 10 per cent), than du Pont (no specific figure given, but the\ncompany averaged 25.9 per cent in the period 1947-55) ; of U.S. Steel (8 per\ncent), than General Electric (20 per cent); the compilation of these targets\nand actual profits data by Lanzillotti [5, pp. 924-27] is extremely illuminat-\ning. It would seem that what is \"fair and reasonable\" varies from industry\nto industry. The most plausible explanation of the differences is to be found\nin the divergent objective facts of the market place which determine what the\ntraffic will bear\u2014in particular the ease of entry, number of sellers, indepen-\ndence of competitive action, standardization of products, degree of patent\nprotection, and so on.5\n\n2. The maximization hypothesis seems even more clearly supported by the\nwidely varying investment-return components of these companies! prices on\ndifferent products. Wide variations in what the market will bear frequently\nproduce corresponding divergent \"target\" as well as actual rates of return,\nsome above, some below the company-wide target;? in some instances, the\ncosts of joint products are themselves allocated on the basis of what the\nmarket will allow.\" When, therefore, in discussing the tendency of these com-\n\nto 'maximize' profits on a year-to-year basis. Moreover, to construe the actual profit rates\n(as against target rates) as evidence of a long-run maximization policy would require the\ndemonstration that the prices charged were based not upon the targets but on what the\nfirms believed they could get as a maximum. In any event, for this sample of firms and\nfor this time period, there are limitations upon profit maximization as an adequate explana-\ntion of the relationships between profit targets and actual profit rates.\" I have no serious\nquarrel with the doubts he expresses about maximization *on a ycar-to-year basis.\" But,\nas will appear, I do submit that the divergences between target and actual rates are\nindications of a policy of profit-maximization; and deny that the target rates are set\nprimarily, as in the case of public utilities (see note 3 above), on the basis of considerations\nof fairness or reasonableness [cf. 4, p. 931].\n\nIn his review of the Kaplan, Dirlam and Lanzillotti book [6] Jesse Markham makes\nmuch the same observations as follow here as points 2 and 3. The discussion here, orig-\ninally prepared before the Markham reviewed appeared, has been compressed to avoid\nundue repetition of his analysis.\n\n\"For an exposition of full-cost pricing in which the allowance for net profit added to\nstandard cost is explicitly related to what the market will allow, see Andrews [1, pp.\n163-80]. And of course Bain [2, Ch. 7] has done pioneer work in statistically verifying\nthe relationship between profitability on the one hand and concentration and barriers to\nentry on the other.\n\n* See, for example, the cases of Alcoa [4, p. 31], International Harvester [4, pp. 72-74],\nUnion Carbide [4, pp. 112-13; compare here particularly the pricing of ethylene glycol,\nthe raw material, and Prestone, pp. 116-17, 265], and du Pont [4, p. 151]\u2014all companies\navowedly pricing on the basis of cost plus a target rate of return.

It is possible of course to answer the question affirmatively by\nstretching the concepts of *maximization\" and \"profit\" so wide in time, space\nand content as to say no more than that the community of managers and\nowners does act, and in so doing presumably tries to serve what it somehow\nconceives to be its best collective interests. The information in the Brookings\nmonograph, I suggest, lends support to a much narrower and more workable\nconclusion: that these large corporations typically price to maximize mone-\ntary profits\u2014not day-by-day, to be sure, but to a large extent year-by-year\nand certainly over a fairly brief period of years. The evidence does not, I\nsuggest, justify Lanzillotti's generalization that \"these corporations tend\nto behave more and more like public utilities\" [5, p. 940], if one refers not\nto pricing formulas, techniques or retrospective rationalizations, but to \"pric-\ning objectives,\" which are the subject of his article.'\n\nI.

The prevalence of this phenomenon, which is\nreally an aspect of full-cost pricing,? provides their principal evidence against\nprofitmaximization in general? and the marginalist description thereof in\nparticular. The misconstruction is in confusing procedures with *goals.\" Ac-\ntually, the target return seems above all to reflect what the executives think\nthe company can get; and to the extent actual earnings diverge from the\ntarget, it is because the market turns out to allow more or less.*\n\n1. This interpretation is supported first by the differences between the tar-\ngets set by the various companies interviewed. The first and most frequently\n\n\"The difference between our interpretations is one of degree and emphasis only; but\nthe difference is important, to economics and to public policy.\n\n*See the excellent analysis and survey of the literature by Heflebower [3, particularly\np. 364]. In the sale of consumer durables, like appliances and automobiles, where com-\npetition year-by-year takes the form largely of changes in product design, the procedure\nis to some extent better characterized as \"price-minus costing\" than \"cost-plus pricing.\"\nAn acceptable consumer price\u2014say $299.50 for a standard washing machine\u2014is first\ndetermined, and the manufacturer then decides what \"features\" it can a\u00edford to build\ninto the product.

In point of fact, however, the problems of internal control, the\n\"banker mentality\" (liquidity-solvency motives) of large firms and the fear\nof temporary financial embarrassment or inability to expand as rapidly as\nmanagement feels necessary, outweigh the profits-maximization problem for the\nlarge corporation in the determination of price policy.

They\nvastly prefer to use standard cost methods\u2014 systems which they feel provide\nthem with more security and stability\u2014and, annually, or semiannually, revi-\nsions can be made in these standards in the light of actual experience.?\n\nIn effect, while some of the findings on pricing objectives might be recon-\nciled with some variant of the profits-maximization hypothesis, this does not\nmean that they are not also consistent with my position that profits maximiza-\ntion is not the dominant motive of the firm, particularly the large corporate\noligopoly. Given empirical findings are likely to be consistent with, or at least\npartially reconcilable with, many hypotheses. The essential question is:\nwhich hypotheses are likely to yield the most useful and reliable short-run\nand long-run predictions for such issues as the effects of fiscal policy on the\nrate of change in prices and the effects of wage-rate increases on the general\nlevel of prices? The strength of the profits-maximization hypothesis, and per-\nhaps the reason why economists have held on to it so tenaciously for all mar-\nket structures is that, granted its heroic assumptions, it yields unique predic-\ntions with respect to many variables. The essential strength of the target-\nreturn thesis is that it has a much higher degree of plausibility and realism in a\nworld where large firms have (a) such strong asset positions; (b) limited\nknowledge with respect to the possible cost and revenue alternatives created\nby (c) wide diversity of product lines, and the nature of multiprocess multi-\nplant operations; (d) uncertainty regarding the shape and possible shifts in\nthe short-period price-quantity function; plus (e) strongly entrenched market\nposition, with all this entails by way of oligopolistic interdependence, anti-\ntrust pressures, and Congressional inquiry. Under these circumstances the\nshort-run price will, I believe, be determined by some feasible /ong-rum ob-\njective such as a predetermined target rate of return on invested capital and/or\ntarget market share. These firms do not appear to be forced by their objective\nenvironmental circumstances to attempt to maximize profits in the monetary\n\n? Kahn is correct in stating that there is some investigation of demand for new prod-\nucts. I do not believe there is any real disagreement here; my position is that companies\ninsist on the prescribed return before production is undertaken; Kahn is referring to\npricing afterward. The attention given to elasticity of demand appears to vary primarily\naccording to type and age of product and structure of the market. On established products,\ndemand is considered mostly in terms of projections of total sales, or sales targets, with\npredominant emphasis on determining where the market is and forecasting secular growth.\nIn the case of products subject to model changes, or new products, some effort is made to\ndetermine demand elasticity at different price levels. In general, however, total demand\nis taken for granted and not much consideration is given to alternative sets of small or\nlarge price changes. A similar picture exists on cost data. Actual costs appear to have\nlittle influence on the current structure of prices. Even in companies where the most\ndetailed cost data are available to pricing officials, the typical practice is to base prices\non \"standard cost\" at some long-run *normal\" output rate. Of course, standard costs will\nreflect actual cost changes over time, but at any given time, and over the short period of\nprice theory, prices will not bear any necessary or direct relationship to actual, full, direct,\nor incremental costs in any meaningful sense [10, pp. 446-47].\n",

Steel was inefficient (just as many,\nperhaps most, firms have various kinds of inefficiencies that persist), and by\neliminating them (via the Ford, Bacon and Davis report) the corporation's\nprofits were increased. Was U.S. Steel maximizing in the Kahn sense before?\nIs it now? Moreover, using Kahn's concept, is it possible to predict where\nGeneral Motors will set its prices, and once established, how and on what basis\nprices are revised? To a limited extent this is possible by considering the\nprevious price, knowledge about the cost of style changes, and the company's\nstandard cost and target return\u2014in other words, the procedures.\n\nThus, while Kahn is correct in stating that the subject of my article is\npricing objectives and not procedures, objectives and procedures are very\nclosely interrelated; and in some companies, in fact, procedures to a large ex-\ntent determine price policy [9, p. 932]. I believe this is due largely to the prob-\nlems of internal control; but whatever the reasons, the pricing executives in\nsome of the companies studied seldom look beyond the particular formulae on\n\n*In response to the suggestion that in view of G.M.'s very high rate of return in 1955\nsome of the gains from that year's exceptionally high volume might have been passed on\nto buyers in the form of lower prices, G.M. President Curtice replied: \"They [our car\nprices] are as low as they can be and still produce the indicated return on the net worth\nat the standard volume. We can never be sure whether we are going to exceed the\nstandard volume or whether the market place will be such that we will sell less than the\nstandard volume\" (italics added) [17, p. 3609]. In effect, G.M. had to get its target\nreturn on net worth.\n",

                    "agement statements unquestionably should be taken as rationalizations, as my\narticle indicates, especially those made in connection with *meeting or match-\ning competition\" (if any doubts still remain on this subject) and the ad-\nministration of prices through price leadership *as a means of approximating\nmarket equilibrium\" [9, pp. 922, 934-35, and 937-38]. However, I do not clas-\nsify profits targets and market-share targets as mere rationalizations. These\nobjectives provide management with a set of meaningful, useful, and rational\nyardsticks.*\n\nSecond, it seems essential to emphasize that the basic issue here concerns\nthe determinants of sAort-run pricing decisions of oligopolistic corporations.\nKahn has attempted to integrate, or at least to relate in some meaningful\nmanner, the pursuit of target return and other long-run pricing objectives\nwith his concept of profits maximization. It is not enough, however, to state\nthat the objectives of management are ex Post rationalizations or self-justifying\nexplanations of price behavior; nor does it suffice to argue that the pricing\nobjectives, whatever management states, amount to what the pricing execu-\ntives believe the objective circumstances of the market will bear. Pricing de-\ncisions made on the basis of the company objectives cited can be related to\nthe well-being or \"utility\" of the corporation, the long-run collective inter-\nests of management and stockholders, or some level of satisfactory profits\n(e.g., \u00e0 specific target rate of return), but Kahn has not shown us how they\nare related specifically to \u00bbonetary profits maximization. In order to reconcile\nthe pricing objectives of the firms studied with even Kahn's attenuated form\nof the profits-maximization assumption, it is essential to demonstrate a func-\ntional relationship between maximum profits in the Kahn sense and various\ndegrees of realization of the specific objectives cited. Reconciliation of target\nreturn with profits maximization requires, among other things, some rather\nstringent assumptions regarding costs and demand elasticity, as well as proof\nthat firms were driving for maximum profits with full knowledge. If one wishes\nto assume that marginal costs remain constant and that the demand curves\nfacing the firms are iso-elastic, secularly and cyclically, perhaps profits maxi-\nmization can be reconciled with profits targets, stable margins, and other ob-\njectives; but this is genuinely Pickwickian.\n\nKahn has demonstrated that one can make even his modified profits-maxi-\nmization concept so plastic that it is difficult to imagine any behavior which\nis not consistent with his hypothesis, thus making it incapable of refutation.\nHe is not disarmed by anything; no event is inconsistent with his theory. In\nshort, Kahn's main point is that variability in rates of return demonstrates\nprofits maximization and that differences in rates of return merely reflect dif-\nferences in charging what the traffic will bear. But what predictive value does\nsuch an hypothesis have for the types of corporate enterprises in question?\nKahn nowhere argues that such an assumption would permit him to predict\n\n\"These objectives promise \"reasonably satisfactory profits in the long run and a maxi-\nmum of stability in [the firm's] relations with customers, suppliers, and competitors, These\nconditions suggest that many businessmen are likely . . . to substitute the principle of sat-\nisfactory profits for that of profits-maximization\" [7, p. 271], see also [6, pp. 142-74].\n",

Pricing Objectives and the Profits-Maximization Hypothesis\n\nKahn has cast his net over a rather wide range of topics; his comments are\ndirected in significant part at various sections and conclusions of the Brookings\nbook Pricing in Big Business, as well as my article on pricing objectives. I\nshall limit my reply primarily to specific questions Kahn raises about the\nanalysis and interpretations in my article, but inevitably must touch on some\nof the other issues he raises. In doing this I wish to make clear that I am not\nin a position to speak for Dirlam and Kaplan, and I cannot necessarily expect\nthem to support my personal views on the varied comments Kahn makes.\n\nAs I understand Kahn, he believes the data set forth in my article are con-\nsistent with profits maximization\u2014not the conventional profits maximization\nof marginal price theory, but what he calls a more *workable\" hypothesis:\n*, . . that these large corporations typically price to maximize monetary\nprofits\u2014not day-by-day, to be sure, but to a large extent year-by-year and\ncertainly over a fairly brief period of years.\" On the other hand, in footnote 4,\nKahn states *. . . I have no serious quarrel with the doubts he expresses about\nmaximization on a year-to-year basis.\" It seems to me that Kahn should (1)\ndefine with greater specificity his own modified *workable\" concept of profits\nmaximization, and (2) if the definitions are substantively different, he should\nindicate whether his profits maximization concept will perform the same func-\ntion as the classical one. If he can draw a meaningful, and certainly a more\nprecise, distinction between his concept and that of marginal theory, we are\nprobably not very far apart in our thinking. But, if Kahn does not draw that\ndistinction and, in effect, is at one with traditional marginal price theory, the\ntask of reconciling his position with the empirical evidence becomes difficult\nindeed.\n\nMy position, in brief, is that whatever profits maximization may be con-\nstrued to mean, it does not prove helpful in understanding pricing policies of\nlarge corporations. The concepts of target return and target market share do\nseem useful both to an understanding of pricing policies and for predicting the\nprice behavior of these types of enterprises. Thus, the issue at hand is essen-\ntially whether by stating that target return is really another name for profits\nmaximization Kahn has explained anything about the pricing policies of large\ncorporations.\n\n\"Two points need to be clarified before proceeding further. First, some man-\n\nbehavior, the most likely pattern of *'competition' would indicate less activity, less virility.\"\nAlso, *General Foods was in a position to maintain its share of the market, both national\nand western, if it chose to do so. This conclusion holds true with or without price discrim-\nination though, of course, price discrimination would make things easier and more\nprofitable\" [11, pp. 693 and 696].\n",

But, even granting (a) there is evidence that some\nof A & P's losses were forced upon the company, and (b) the difficulty of at-\ntributing the demise of competitors or the maintenance or increase in A & P's\nmarket share to a single causal factor (indeed, this is diff\u00fccult even in the\n\"obvious\" cases of the old predatory monopolies such as the Standard Oil\ntrust), the numerous instances of A & P officials threatening or attempting to\ndrive specific rivals out of business, provide a reasonable basis for the con-\nclusion that A & P employed predatory tactics. In the instances cited, A & P\nofficials were consciously reducing prices below levels they thought desirable\nOr had set as a norm\u2014otherwise, why the necessity of requesting permission\nfrom headquarters to sell below cost (however defined) for specific periods of\ntime? It seems to me that in these instances \u00c0 & P had a deliberate price\npolicy; it was not simply \"meeting competition.\"\n\nFinally, there is Adelman's statement: *In theory, because of easy entry\nand numerous competitors, reasonable profit-seeking men would not consider\nan impossible policy of *preventing competition, except in the popular sense\nthat continuous low prices are an 'unfair' preventive.\" Evidently A & P offi-\ncials' concept of business behavior does not coincide with Adelman's explana-\ntion of rational action. Moreover, what may seem like **easy entry and numer-\nous competitors\" from the Olympian heights of an economist fails to appear\nin this context at the level where a few months is the long run, and stores do\nfail. Economists call this pure competition, but the *running-in-the-red\" policy\nof A & P was of great concern to the position of individual firms immediately,\nand not-so-immediately involved. This is not to deny that A & P's policy might\nbe characterized, broadly, as one of attempting to achieve large volume\nthrough low prices; but this is irrelevant for my conclusion \"It seems also\nthat in some cases the companies are not simply meeting competition\u2014they\nare preventing it\" [9, p. 935 ].5\n\nwhich headquarters investments could have earned even though not integrated with retail-\ning, non-intezrated competitors were being subjected to unfair competitive pressures unre-\nlated either to the relative inefficiency of their retailing or to the superior efficiency of\nintegrated operations\" [3, p. 213].\n\n\"Similar practices, including permission to units to sell with abnormally low or non-\nexistent gross-profit rates and use of A & P employees to buy up \"specials\" of competitors,\nwere followed in other cities in the New England division; in Birmingham and Dallas of\nthe southern division; in Buffalo, Columbus, Youngstown, Oberlin, Monongahela, and\nAltoona of the central division; in Scranton, Washington, Endicott, Kingston, and Strouds-\nburg of the Atlantic division; and Murphysboro in the middle western division.

The best ex-\nample of this practice concerns a store in the Pittsburgh unit in 1939:\n\n. . . \u00c0 & P lowered the gross profit rate in markets adjacent to the\nStreamline Markets, recouping losses with profits from other division\nmarkets not in proximity to Streamline and from profits passed on from\nheadquarters. An attorney brought this to the attention of John Hart-\nford, threatening suit if it continued, saying: *On Friday, Mr. King,\nVice President of your company called on two executives of the Stream-\nline Markets, in one of their new stores . . . and in a loud voice, publicly,\nbefore the employees and customers, threatened to commence a cam-\npaign to bring about the financial ruin of Streamline Markets'; that\nKing boasted of (past achievement of financial ruin! to other competi-\ntors; and said that he was going to cut the meat and produce to cost in\nA & P stores nearest the Streamline Markets; that he would 'put a\nstore in Kittanning that will take care of that store of yours. I will put\none in Butler right opposite your store that will finish that store. I am\ngoing to turn all my guns on you.' Rezoning followed, *In the case of\nStreamline we set up a special price zone called zone *M'. We zoned all\nof the Streamline points, every one of them, and the prices in the zone\n*M? were lower than in any of our regular supermarket zones! [13,\np. 667].*\n\nThe two pages cited from the Government Brief [15, pp. 909 and 931],\nwhich Adelman states: \"say nothing about selective price reductions against a\nnew store,\" do say a good deal about how those selective price cuts were made\npossible, namely, the company's *subsidy\" practice.*\n\n* In 1936 it was decided that all units in the [Central Western] division should operate\nwith a profit except Detroit, which was permitted to plan operations at a loss of $3,000\nper week for 20 weeks. . . . The policy was expressed by [John A.] Hartford [President\nand Chairman of Divisional presidents] and [J.

A & P's Pricing Policies and Practices\n\nAdelman contends that my article on pricing objectives in large companies:\n(1) makes two inconsistent statements concerning A & P's pricing policy and\npractices; (2) has \"repeated and enlarged an error of the District Court,\"\nand (3) offers scant evidence to support the conclusions on A & P's pricing\npractices.\n\nRegarding point (1), the difference between the two statements is the dif-\nference between over-al] policy and selective policy. The first reference to\nA & P [9, p. 922] is included in a general description of the importance of the\ntwenty companies in their respective industries and the extent to which they\n\"dominate a whole industry and are price leaders.\" The second reference [9,\np. 935] has to do with the pricing practices in specific markets of several\ncompanies, including A & P. In the first context, it is my position that A & P\ndoes not dominate nor make decisions for a whole industry in the sense that\nU. S. Steel does. However, the District Court decision is replete with evidence\nof how A & P brought its absolute resources to bear against actual and poten-\ntial competitors in particular localities\u2014a pattern of behavior which A & P\nhas rationalized as *meeting competition.\"\n\nOn the issue of the A & P case in question, Adelman is rolling a rusty hoop.\nIf, as Adelman asserts, A & P's objective in operating unprofitably for sev-\neral weeks was purely and simply to reduce its \"expense rate,\" one is en-\ntitled to inquire: Why was this effort to reduce expense rates not undertaken\nearlier? Was it mere coincidence that A & P's prices were lowered t4e day\nbefore the opening of a Giant Fagle store in Pittsburgh, that six weeks fol-\nLlowing the opening of a Food Fair store in Richmond a \"special competitive\ncompaign\" was inaugurated by A & P, and that \"special programs\" were set\nup \u00a3Aree weeks ahead of the opening of other Food Fair stores (see below)?\n\nThe A & P cases and Adelman's defense of A & P have been so widely read\nand extensively reviewed [1] [2] [3] [4] [5], that it seemed unnecessary to\nevaluate once again the facts and evidence upon which the District Court\nbased its decision, upon which the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the de-\ncision, and upon which A & P had to make its determination not to appeal\nfurther. However, since Adelman's observations would leave the impression\nwith the reader that I had only very skimpy evidence for my conclusions on\nA & P's practices, some of the numerous examples of A & P's policy of selec-\ntive price cutting, ?lanned losses, and subsidy policy must be mentioncd.\nMany examples could be cited, but because of space limitations I am not able\nto provide all of the relevant quotations from the decisions of the courts.\n\nMany units of the company operated at a loss over extended periods of time\n[13, pp. 664-69], e.g., Boston and Providence from 1934 through 1941;!\n\n' Even after all credits, the Boston and Springfield units lost money for five years in\nsuccession, and the Los Angeles unit lost $1,406,194 over the 1932-1940 period [4, p. 18].\n",

My discussion here will therefore\nbe brief and tentative, perhaps no more than suggesting the directions in\nwhich study might go. I hope to atone for present negligence by going into\nthe issues more thoroughly in the monograph on Soviet industrial production I\nam now struggling to complete.\n\nIt must be said first of all that my comparisons of Soviet and American\nindustrial growth were based on three different indexes of Soviet industrial\ngrowth, each with two weight bases [2, p. 408]. The indexes of industrial\nmaterials, which show a growth more or less midway between extremes, were\nchosen to represent the Soviet Union on a graph comparing Soviet and Ameri-\ncan industrial growth. But they were used only \"for this broad look\" [2, p.\n407, n. 11], which was immediately supplemented by a table that presented\nthe ranges of Soviet growth rates derived from all the indexes presented in the\npaper, and compared those ranges with growth rates derived from my index of\nindustrial production in the United States.\n\nMy general attitude about the indexes for Soviet industry was briefly, and\nperhaps elliptically, put as follows [2, pp. 398 and 402]:\n\n. in my judgment, the best indexes [of Soviet industrial growth] that\ncan be constructed fall far short of the reliability we have come to\nexpect from Western indexes; and, on balance, they tend to exaggerate\nSoviet industrial growth.\n",

Buchanan, Director for the Social Sciences at the Foundation, took in the plan-\nning of the project.]\n\nRecent years have seen important new explorations along the bound-\naries between economics and psychology. For the economist, the im-\nmediate question about these developments is whether they include\nnew advances in psychology that can fruitfully be applied to economics.\nBut the psychologist will also raise the converse question\u2014whether\nthere are developments in economic theory and observation that have\nimplications for the central core of psychology. If economics is able to\nfind verifiable and verified generalizations about human economic be-\nhavior, then these generalizations must have a place in the more gen-\neral theories of human behavior to which psychology and sociology\naspire. Influence will run both ways.'\n\nI. How Much Psychology Does Economics Need?\n\nHow have psychology and economics gotten along with little rela-\ntion in the past?

It is conducive to clarity of thinking to treat causation more\nprecisely, and to distinguish three cases of population growth.\n\nTwo of these relate to low-income (peasant) societies. In such so-\ncieties, crude birth rates are virtually everywhere above 40 per thou-\nsand. Although higher birth rates are biologically possible, rates of 45\nper thousand are close to the practical maximum. Historically, death\nrates have been almost as high. Where population growth occurs in such\nsocieties, it occurs because death rates fall. One cause of falling death\nrates is the introduction of modern public health and other preventive\nmedical measures. I shall term the resulting fall in death rates exog-\nenous. The fall in death rates is followed only after a lag of unde-\ntermined but considerable length by a fall in birth rates. In the interval\nthe rate of population growth rises.\n\nA second cause, marking the second case treated here, is a rise in\nper capita income.* Historically, there have been two major causes of\nrise in aggregate income, the opening up of new territories and techno-\nlogical progress.

Since Quetelet and Galton emphasized how many hu-\nman characteristics were normally distributed, the contrasting skewness\nof the income distribution has presented something of a problem. Vet,\nas Tinbergen put it, ^no generally accepted interpretation of the statis-\ntical regularities seems to exist. . . . This is the more remarkable since\nthe inequality in the income distribution is at the bottom of some of the\nmost important problems of economic policy\" [38, p. 156].\n\nWe have not, of course, lacked for explanations. Some stipulate com-\nponent distributions which, joined together by one analyst, may not be\ntorn asunder by any other. Some invoke a mysterious necessity that\ninheres in the Pareto coefficient. Many rely on the theory of noncom-\npeting groups. Few explanations are without merit; few without some\nrelevance to the way in which income is distributed in the United States\ntoday. But a closer examination suggests that most explanations fail to\nexplain. Some are too effective. They describe with equal facility, and\nby identical functions and parameters, the distribution among Prussian\ntaxpayers in 1852 and American families in 1958. Others explain only\npart of the distribution\u2014the part most readily fitting a particular\nmathematical function. Some premise social or economic structures that\ndiffer massively from those that surround us. Others report an economy\nseen only by the light that never shone on land or sea.\n\nThe present paper reviews some of these theories, looks to the pres-\nent facts on the distribution of income in the United States today.

As he put it, \"the annual revenue of every so-\nciety is always precisely equal to the exchangeable value of the whole\nannual produce of its industry, or rather is precisely the same thing\nwith that exchangeable value\" [26, p. 423]. The way to maximize it\nis to let individuals maximize their own income in their own way. He\nrecognized, of course, that no individual is primarily concerned with\npromoting the general welfare. Of this he said,\n\nBy preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, [every\nindividual] intends only his own security; and by directing that industry\nin such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends\nonly his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an\ninvisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention\n[26, p. 423].\n\nPromotion of the general welfare is a proper goal of statesmen, and\nthey can achieve it by the abolition of all needless restrictions on eco-\nnomic activity. As Smith put it,\nAll systems either of preference or of restraint, therefore, being thus\ncompletely taken away, the obvious and simple system of natural liberty\nestablishes itself of its own accord.

Clearly if by \"full cost\" the Report has in mind the\nmarginal cost plus some pro rata share of fixed expenses, the Commission\nmust make estimates of volume changes. But even with marginal cost, the\nvolume is a significant determinant. In the first place, when considering\nmarginal cost, the unit to be considered marginal is a function of the volume\nof the particular traffic offered, with the costs assignable rising as the volume\nrises because of the extra equipment and other expenses involved. That is,\nif 100 pounds per day of a certain commodity is offered, it can probably be\nplaced in a partly filled box car in a train already made up and the additional\ncost incurred might be quite minor. If a carload of such a commodity is\noffered, an additional box car will have to be added to the train which entails\ngreater additional cost (though not in proportion to the tonnage increment) ;\nand, finally, if the volume offered is very great perhaps a special train will\nhave to be made up and thus additional costs are involved. The costs per\n100 pounds will decline with these volume increases but more cost items\nbecome specifically assignable to the marginal units as we move from less-\nthan-carload to carload and trainload lots.\n\nFurthermore, the behavior of out-of-pocket cost for any traffic depends\npartly on the relative importance of such traffic to the total. Eastman has\npointed out that *out-of-pocket expense tends to increase disproportionately\nas this fraction [ie ratio of the particular traffic involved to total traffic]\nincreases in size\" [1, pp. 127-28].\n\nThere is also a time dimension which must be considered in discussions of\nthe nature of marginal costs. If a particular kind of traffic represents a once-\nfor-all movement, the directly assignable costs may be greater than if the\ntraffic is offered with regularity over time. In the latter case it will be possible\nto develop specialized and more efficient handling of the traffic, especially\nif it is important to the carrier, thereby permitting certain economies in its\ntransportation. A good example of this is the permission granted by the\nI.C.C. on a few occasions for a lower rate per 100 pounds for shipment in\nmulticarload or trainload lots. Such permission has not generally been granted\nbecause it tends to favor large shippers. There is little doubt, however, that\ncosts per 100 pounds on per ton-mile may be reduced significantly for multi-\nple-car shipments. Indeed, the Report recognizes this when it recommends\n*volume rates . . . based on cost differences\" [8, p. 14].\n\nSince costs are in large part a function of volume, the I.C.C. cannot avoid\nconsidering *the effect of the [proposed] rates on the movement of traffic.\"\nThe significance of this inconsistency can scarcely be over-emphasized. It\nunderscores the extreme complexity of cost finding (both theoretical and\npractical) in transportation. Economists such as A. C. Pigou, Donald Wallace\nand J. M. Clark have done excellent work in analyzing joint and fixed costs\nin transportation but they have neglected, or left unresolved, many of the\n",

                    "useful information on the degree of competitiveness of transportation we\nrequire elaborate information on the needs and technical alternatives of the\nvarious users of transport facilities and the available supply in particular\nareas. Until we know much more about these things we not only are unjusti-\nfied in asserting that transportation in general is highly competitive but we\ncannot know how things would work out should regulation be reduced or\neliminated. General statements concerning the changed nature of the transport\nmarket do not permit us to assume iso facto that the outcome of greater or\ncomplete reliance upon competition will be similar to that postulated by com-\npetitive models.\n\nQuite aside from the problems of assessing the pervasiveness and strength\nof competitive elements and assuming that more competition would in fact be\ndesirable, we immediately come upon a basic inconsistency hitherto over-\nlooked in the Weeks Report. The Report argues in favor of excess capacity in\nthe common carrier segments of transportation in the interests of national\ndefense [8, p. 5]. Now it is clear that if this excess capacity is held out of\ncommercial competition no problem emerges. But this is not the tenor of the\nargument. Thus the aim of the Report is to have excess capacity available\nin the event of war, a profitable common carrier industry, and at the same\ntime vigorous rate competition. These would not necessarily be inconsistent\nobjectives if no rates were permitted to fall below average total cost, but the\nReport is clear that rates may fall as low as marginal cost (short-run or\nlong-run?). Thus, in the interest of national defense we need excess supply\nand a strong common carrier industry but we cannot have both under vigorous\nprice competition since, of course, the function of price competition is to\neliminate excess supply [7]. Furthermore, since the dominant medium, rail-\nways, is subject to increasing returns, especially when excess capacity exists,\nrates based on marginal cost will necessarily be below average total cost. If\ncompetition is as pervasive as the Weeks Report implies, this can only result\nin substantial financial losses to the railways; scarcely a sensible way to\nmaintain a strong, profitable, privately owned common carrier industry!\n\nA second inconsistency is the policy recommendation [8, p. 11] that the\nInterstate Commerce Commission be permitted to prescribe just and reason-\nable maximum and minimum rates. A just and reasonable minimum is\ndefined as a rate at least equal to or above \"the direct ascertainable cost\"\nand a just and reasonable maximum which the Commission can specify must\nexceed or equal \"the full cost of performing the services to which such rates\napply.\" In other words, the rate minimum would be marginal cost and the\nrate maximum would be equal to or above average total cost. Coupled with\nthe retention of such powers by the Commission, however, is the recommenda-\ntion to repeal *one of the most objectionable features of rate regulation,\nnamely, the necessity that the Commission substitute its own judgment for\nthat of carrier management as to 'the effect of the [proposed] rates on the\nmovement of traffic by the carrier or carriers for which the rates are pre-\nscribed'\" [8, p. 11]. Regardless of one's judgment of the merits of these\nrecommendations the point is that they are inconsistent. That is, both the\n",

                    "The Weeks Report Revisited\n\nIn his review of the Weeks Report [8] J. C. Nelson points out that the\n\"Committee has not tackled some fundamental questions concerning regula-\ntion and its effects\" [4, p. 917]. I would like to go further and suggest that\nthe Presidential Advisory Committee (or Weeks) Report shows a striking\nlack of general economic intelligence which involves it in at least two basic\ninconsistencies. If the issues to be raised here were outdated there would of\ncourse be no reason to subject the Weeks Report to further scrutiny at this\ntime. However, the basic inconsistencies continue to permeate discussions of\nnational transportation policy to such an extent that it is important to bring\nthem out into the open.\n\nAs is well known, increased reliance on competitive forces in transportation\nis the major general recommendation of the Weeks Report and one which\nhas received fairly widespread support. It is unquestionably true that the\nmonopoly position of the railways is much weaker than before 1920 but to\nargue that the entire transportation industry operates under the checks and\nbalances of vigorous and pervasive competition is going a bit too far. Those\nwho talk in these terms are moving in the direction of identification of the\ntransport market as a whole with perfect or, at least, monopolistic competi-\ntion. For example, the Weeks Report argues that the *net result [of the\n*transport revolution] is a competitive system of transportation that for all\npractical purposes has eliminated the monopoly element which characterized\nthis segment of our economy some thirty years ago\" [8, p. 1]. Though not\ngoing quite so far, many economists have emphasized the strength and\nubiquity of competitive elements in transportation [4, p. 918] [5, pp. 26-28].\n\nBut economists have also frequently pointed out the complexities of the\ntransport market [3, p. 83] [6, p. 245], complexities which are largely\ninconsistent with competitive models. Transportation service is supplied by\nhighly diverse enterprises operating under widely different technical, economic\nand market conditions. The unit of output is much more complex than an\nalleged homogeneous ton-mile. It involves considerations of speed, flexibility,\nsafety, and dependability, all of which differ substantially among the various\nmedia. Thus in the transport market we have naturally heterogeneous products\nemanating from the different competitiors and vast differences among the\ncompetitors themselves with respect to production costs (the level, structure\nand shape of the cost functions) and physical facilities. Depending upon the\nparticular needs or preferences of various shippers, these differences engender\nvastly different elasticities of demand for the services of a particular medium\nin the various segments of the market, and hence varying degrees of monopoly\npower even on those route segments where a variety of transport forms of all\ntypes are available. But in fact both the availability of forms of transport\nand numbers of firms differ substantially throughout the country.\n\nThese complexities on both the supply and demand side of the various\nmarket segments render transportation a hodgepodge running the gamut\nfrom conditions of nearly perfect competition to near monopoly.

The postwar era in Europe has seldom been faced with this problem.\nIt is therefore hardly surprising that, with the Keynesian problem of unem-\nployment largely solved, a chief means of increasing output should be to\nimprove the allocation of resources. Thus \u00edar it is difficult to disagree with\nEgon Sohmen [2]. However, his main thesis\u2014that the rapid growth achieved\nin the West German economy can be attributed firstly to the degree of\ncompetitiveness achieved by virtue of Allied \"trust busting\" and secondly\nto the orthodox monetary policies pursued by West German governments\u2014is\nmuch more difficult to accept.\n\nIn view of all the clamor about the German \"miracle\" of postwar growth,\nit would be well to keep this achievement in proper perspective. The few\nfigures in Table 1 suggest that, swift as the growth in real gross national\nproduct was, it is not relatively so striking when allowances are made for\nincreases in population and working force.*\n\n'The third column indicates how much of industrial growth was not attrib-\nutable to the increase in the labor force. Here Germany's performance appears\nmuch less spectacular, and on this basis she ranks lower than Austria, France\nand Italy.\n\nIn Sohmen's judgment the linkage of greater \"competition\" with *more\nefficient resource allocation\" and hence with growth, is quite firm.\n\nMonocausal explanations of unusual phenomena are always suspect, and\n\n'! Reliable figures are available only from 1950 onward. As Sohmen notes, the antitrust\nand anticartel policies are rapidly fading, and so 1957 was chosen as the terminal year. The\nimportant years 1948-49 are not included, whereas the Korean boom period is, but this\nspan seems to be the most suitable one. All growth rates are compound ones.\n",

                    "Competition and Growth\u2014The Lesson of West Germany:\nComment\n\nSohmen explains the German growth by reference to the forces of competi-\ntion. Few would deny that competition may spur growth. But Sohmen's\ndismissal of another\u2014and some would argue more powerful\u2014factor cannot\nbe left unchallenged. This is simply the very high ratio of capital formation\nto gross national product in the Federal Republic. If the United Kingdom\nand the Federal Republic are taken as two economies in similar stages of\neconomic development, the difference is striking. Over the years 1950 to\n1958 inclusive, gross domestic fixed capital formation (in machinery and\nequipment) took 8.4 per cent of the United Kingdom's gross national product\nat factor cost in 1954 prices, and no less than 13.1 per cent of that of the\nFederal Republic. It would be surprising if this factor alone did not account\nfor most, if not all, of the difference between the rates of growth in the two\ncountries.\n\nThese figures conceal the really important ones, viz. the amounts of re-\nsources devoted to et investment. One would expect that the ratio of replace-\nment investment to gross investment would be much lower in Germany than\nin the United Kingdom since the war, simply because of much greater de-\nstruction and dismantling of existing equipment during and immediately after\nthe war. The data support this view. In the years 1954 to 1958, the propor-\ntion of replacement investment in gross investment in Germany averaged 42\nper cent, and in the United Kingdom 54 per cent [2] [3]. Thus a given vol-\nume of real resources devoted to fixed capital formation in these years pro-\nduced a much larger addition to existing production facilities in Germany than\nin the United Kingdom. One would guess that this was an even stronger\ntendency in the earlier years of the 1950's.\n\nHow was it done? One can conveniently distinguish between the factors\nthat caused this high rate of capital formation, and those that permitted it.\nThe former are obvious\u2014the need to reconstruct, the desire to satisfy the\ncompelling export demand for the sort of goods Germany can supply, the com-\nmon urge of businessmen to control larger rather than smaller units, and so on.\n\n! Sohmen's implied refutation of this view by taking Norway as an example of a country\nwith an even higher rate of capital formation but a lower rate of economic expansion, of\ncourse, fails. As a matter of policy, the Norwegian authorities, faced with an economy\npossessing limited natural resources, have deliberately promoted investment in shipbuilding\nand public utilities, both with a high capital-output ratio. If there had been other more\n\"profitable\" outlets, they would doubtless have been preferred. The German economy was\nfortunate in possessing such outlets at a time when world markets, especially in Europe\nitself, were clamoring for just such products as Germany had always produced.\n",

This\nis not to deny the merits of my critics, nor to assert that this exchange will\nsettle the complex issues involved. The present discussion should amplify and\ndarify a number of points that could only be inadequately discussed in the\nlimited space of a journal article.\n\n1. A remarkable human tendency to explain what happened ex ost facto as\nhaving been bound to happen under the given circumstances frequently makes\npeople advance certain factors as causes of the high German growth rate\nwhich before and during the event were almost unanimously accepted as\nformidable obstacles to its realization. It seems at least as natural to assume\nthat the millions of destitute refugees were, on balance, as much a drain upon\nas a gain to the German economy, and to hold that their urgent needs should\nhave made the achievement of a high rate of investment, a prerequisite for\ntheir useful employment in an economy starved of capital, considerably\nmore difficult.\n\nApart from the fact stressed by MacBean and Shepherd (Table 1) that\npart of the increase in industrial production was due to the growth of the\nlabor force, the more modest, but still remarkable, increase of labor pro-\nductivity in industry\u2014an average of 5 per cent per year from 1950 to 1957\u2014\nalso reveals that the explanation of the German growth rate on the basis of\nthe \"special buoyancies of a genuine reconstruction\" (p. 1020) is not as well\nfounded as commonly believed, at least for the years after 1950. While they\nstress the growth of the total labor force, MacBean and Shepherd fail to\nadd that one of the main reasons for their result is the much faster relative\ngrowth rate of employment in industry at the expense of other sectors.!

Some scholars (e.g., J\u00fcrgen Kuczynski)\nbelieve Marx proved that the real wage would fall and claim by empirical\nstatistical observation to verify this law of immiserization of the proletariat;\nother scholars (such as Maurice Dobb, perhaps?) seem to argue that, with ex-\nceptions, this was Marx's view about competitive capitalism but that it came\nto be falsified by historical reality primarily because of the growth in political\nand economic powers of trade unions and the working class; still other schol-\nars (notably Thomas Sowell in the March 1960 issue of this Review) argue\nwith considerable persuasiveness that in his major economic writings, Marx\ndid not conclude that the real wage per hour or day would decline under com-\npetitive capitalism. I claim no competence or interest in such doctrinal history.\n",

(Capital, Vol. III, p. 256; my\nitalics)\n\nMore fundamental to this discussion, however, is the question: Did Marx\nactually hold to a fixed coefficients of production model? Samuelson answers\n(pp. 906-7):\n\nPerhaps Karl Marx really had such a technology in mind. Perhaps not\n\n. .. he speaks again and again of alternative techniques. While many of\n\nthese clearly depict technological change in the production function rather\n\nthan movement within one function, the fact that the old methods are\nstill known along with the new shows that Marx and Ricardo definitely\nenvisage the existence of more than one technique.\n\nMarx was obscure in his discussion of this matter. In Marx's analysis of the\nrate of profit however, one finds \"averaging\" of organic compositions of capital\nin a specific sphere of production\u2014thereby implying the presence of variable\ncoefficients (Capital, Vol. III, pp. 182-85). So Samuelson's assumption of fixed\ncoefficients of production is not always warranted.\n\n4. Concluding Remarks. Samuelson's exposition attributes assumptions to\nMarx (e.g., the rate of profit is a function of time; the market economy is\ncharacterized by instantaneous price adjustments; foresight is perfect; and\ncoeffcients of production are fixed) which differ more or less from those to\nwhich Marx seemed to adhere. Samuelson's findings, though quite valid on the\npremises postulated, are not accurately descriptive of Marx's system.\n\nFnrED M.

                    "old technology, since 7\" is a sequel to recourse to the new technique. If both\nthe new and old techniques are available, and uniform prices are assumed, the\nold technique is no longer profitable, since the price of the product has fallen\nwith the introduction of the new technique. Therefore, in Samuelson's ex-\nample, if the old technique is used labor is \u00bbo\u00a3 better off; it may even be in\na less favorable position. If one incorporates in the above equation the Marx-\nian assumption that r is a function of the state of applied technology one may\nselect certain values for the variables in the equation which permit falling\nrates of profit and falling real wages to be compatible. If r were determined\nby some exogenous factor (e.g., time or *ripening\") Samuelson's assumption\nwould be legitimate. Such assumptions, however, lie outside the framework of\nMarxian theory.\n\n3. Changing Factor Proportions and Prices. Samuelson describes what may\nhappen to factor prices and factor shares when their relative supplies (or\nrates of growth) change, given a situation in which the technical coefficients\nof production are rigidly fixed. He writes (p. 900):\n\nIn this case where capital goods have ceased growing as fast as labor, the\nrate of profit has risen to become all of the product. So bizarre a result\ncame from the bizarre assumption of fixed coefficients.\n\nOn the following page he adds (p. 901):\n\nThe Marxian model with fixed coefficients presents some quite pathologi-\ncal features. For if the attempt to accumulate were to cause physical ma-\nchines K to grow relative to fixed labor L, the machines would become\nredundant in supply and their rents would fall immediately to zero.\n\nMarx would have objected to such statements of the matter. In the Marxian\nmodel, the growth rates of K and L depend upon relative factor prices. If K\nincreases more rapidly than L (Samuelson's example), wages increase concur-\nrently with the decline in the price of capital. The total effect of the price\nchange, however, is not instantaneous or as great as Samuelson assumes. Price\nchanges of L and K, in the Marxian system, induce qualitative changes in\ninnovations, and these ultimately counteract the initial price changes. For\nexample, suppose that, compatibly with the Marxian model, K becomes super-\nfluous. Capitalists would obviously switch to more capital-using techniques of\nproduction. 'This *deepening\" of capital would make K more scarce (increasing\nthe price of K) and L relatively more abundant (decreasing the price of L,\nLe., wages). Thus Marx explained the more rapid introduction of machinery\ninto the American than into the English economy (Capital, Vol. I, pp. 429-30).\nElsewhere he writes:\n\nA momentary excess of the surplus-capital over the laboring population\ncontrolled by it would have a twofold effect. It would, on the one hand,\nmitigate the conditions, which decimate the offspring of the laboring class\nand would facilitate marriages among them, by raising wages. Tris would\ntend to increase the laboring population. On the other hand, it would em-\nploy the methods by which relative surplus-value is created (introduc-\n",

                    "Samuelson states, *A technical improvement must be an improvement or it\nwill not be introduced into a perfect-competition market economy . . .\" (p.\n894). By improvement he means a change resulting in either an increase in\nreal wages or in the rate of profit. Thus, he suggests that a rational capitalist\nwould not employ a technique that depresses r, or, that in a labor-dominated\neconomy, labor would not select a technique that diminishes (w/5;) real\nwages.\n\nMarx's market economy, however, differs from Samuelson's. Marx assumes\nthe presence of temporary monopoloid market structures. These structures are\na prerequisite to innovation, the means through which greater profits (Marx's\n\"surplus profits\") may be earned. It is this possibility of realizing surplus\nprofits (monopoly profits) that induces capitalists to innovate. These surplus\nprofits, however, do not persist. Competition, in the Marxian model, compels\ncapitalists to adopt available innovations, hence supplies increase and their\nprice falls to a lower equilibrium (cost of production) level. As a result sur-\nplus profits are eliminated; only surplus value, attained by the \"exploitation\nof labor-power,\" remains. Since Marx assumes that the employment of labor-\npower decreases with the introduction of new techniques, the amount of sur-\nplus value realized may be less with the new than with the older technique. So\nMarx, in Volume III of Cafital, attempts to resolve the \"paradox\" or \"rid-\ndle\" of capitalist production, namely that the capitalist's quest for higher\nprofit rates results in diminished rates of profit. Only by assuming temporary\nmonopoly conditions in the market economy does Marx arrive at this seem-\ningly paradoxical conclusion, and its corollary that capitalists do not revert\nto the old technique of production, even if it had formerly been more reward-\ning, because the now prevailing (lowered) price no longer permits the higher\nprofits formerly associated with use of the old technique. The new position,\nthough less favorable than the old, still is the best to be had.\n\nSamuelson \"proves\" the incompatibility of falling profits and falling real\nwages through recourse to the new theorem. First, he sets down the reciprocal\nof his equation (6) to show that, with specified values for a, a; and 5, 5;\n(the labor and capital coefficients), a decline in the rate of profit (r) must\nproduce an increase in real wages (2/52) :\n\n[7 1\u2014 b(1-4r)\n\nf\u00bb a4 n[t \u2014 bY(1-- 7] Tay rb 4 r7)\nHowever, as Samuelson notes, Marx, by introducing technological change,\nmakes necessary a relaxation of the assumption of fixed ai, a; and 5i, b;. Yet,\n\neven with changing coef\u00fccients, Samuelson asserts, the incompatibility con-\ntinues to prevail (p. 894):\n\nRemember that in a perfectly competitive market it really doesn't matter\nwho hires whom: so have labor hire \"capital,\" paying the new market\nrate of interest 7' \u00ab 7; then labor could always use the old technology\nand paying less than r get better than the old real wage.\n\nIn Samuelson's example the old technology is assumed to yield the new\nrate 7\".

Time, in the sense of a process of *ripening,\" is nowhere found\nin Marxian price theory. Samuelson, however, suggests the presence, as a rule,\nof such a process in Marx's model. He writes (p. 887):\n\nOnly under special, and unrealistic, market assumptions can the competi-\ntive supply and demand relations be expected to ignore these timing rela-\ntions. . ..\n\nHe develops Marx's rate of profit on the basis of the difference between\nripened and unripened products (p. 887):\n\nThe fundamental factor relating unripened product today to ripened prod-\nuct one period from now is the market interest rate r (or what Ricardo\nand Marx would call the rate of profit, a pure percentage per period).\n\n'This \"ripening\" time, though present in Samuelson's Marxian model, does\nnot appear in any guise in the model Marx endeavored to use.\n\n2. Profits and Wages. Prefacing his discussion on the incompatibility of\nfalling profits and falling real wages, Samuelson writes (p. 892):\n\n. . we must tackle directly the question of what accumulation will tend\nto do to r, basing ourselves on the actual behavior equations of competi-\ntive capitalism.\n\nBut the question arises: do Samuelson's \"actual\" behavior equations accu-\nrately represent the behavior equations employed by Marx?? The answer\nseems to be in the negative. The contrast between Marx's and Samuclson's\nequations stand out in the latter's formulation of a new theorem respecting\ntechnological change under perfect competition.\n\n'Samuelson uses the following symbols: Y and K, output in consumer and capital\n\u00a3oods industries; (a;b:) (a\u00bbb:), labor and capital coefficients of production in capital\nand consumer goods industries; f,\u00bb cost of production of capital and consumer goods;\nLjL:; the quantity of labor employed in capital and consumer goods industries; w,\nthe wage-rate; and r, the rate of profit. Equation (4) represents national income expressed\nin terms of labor; equation (5) represents the cost of production of consumer and\ncapital goods, and equation (6), the explicit solutions for (5) in terms of a:bias br.\n\n(4 Y 2-\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 L K-\n\n(3) pi Goa 4r ibi) (A 4 7) f\u00bb \u2014 (was dr pbi) (A 7n)\n(6) h\u00e0 ^ adc) B\u00ed a0 DU \u2014 bh n0] d aL 3 nb t 7)\n\nwo l-\u2014b\u00fc-cr) [7 1\u2014b(104 r7)\n\n* Marx considered the distinction he drew between the \"labor-power\" going into produc-\ntion and the \"product of labor\" resulting from the labor process as his greatest contribu-\ntion to value theory.

They are funda-\nmentally different commodities, composed of different factors of production. It is this\ndifference that allows for surplus-value.\n\n",

But if the tariff proceeds are redistributed and\nspent like marginal income, the effect (at initial prices) of the tariff on\ncountry j's balance of payments is \u2014 7;oI;od- mjoIo, where the second term\nis the product of country O's marginal propensity to import from country\nj and the initial quantity of country O's imports and represents the effect\nof the expenditure of the tax proceeds. The expenditure of the tariff proceeds\nintroduces a positive term to be weighed against the negative term of the\nformer case.\n\nTo determine the net effect on country j's balance, it is necessary to\nbreak the elasticity term down into its substitution and income com-\nponents. It is here that Mundell made his mistake, for he writes his income\nterm as \"tjoI jo, which is less than mjoIo, and concludes that the sign of the\neffect on j's balance is indeterminate. But jol;o is the income term for a\nrise in the price of the j'th good only, whereas the tariff has raised the price\nof all imports relative to the domestic good, so that the income term should\nbe mjolo. This exactly cancels out the effect of the expenditure of redis-\ntributed tariff revenue, leaving the effect on country j's balance as \u20142'joLjo\n(the prime indicating a compensated elasticity); this is necessarily negative\nby the gross substitutes assumption, so that j's balance (at initial prices) is\nworsened and the equilibrium terms of trade of the tariff-imposing country\nnecessarily improved. The effect of a tariff whose proceeds are redistributed\nis therefore the same in the many-country many-good case as in the two-\ncountry two-good case?\n\nTn conclusion it may be helpful to make explicit three possibly important\npoints implicit in Mundell's argument. A good may be a \"'Giffen good\" in\naggregate demand without being inferior in any individual's consumption\n[1, p. 75]. The necessity of an inelastic foreign demand if growth is to reduce\nreal income is limited to the complete-specialization model [1, p. 85]. When\ndomestic demand for imports is inelastic a tariff whose expenditure is biased\ntowards imports may turn the imposing country's terms of trade against it\n|1, p. 86 and passim].\n\nIT.onov\u00ed(i^ Tnmrcnmsk*\n",

The Federal Reserve authori-\n\u00fcies have encountered a number of difficulties, but, on the whole, have\nbeen able to limit the rate of growth of member-bank reserves, and to\na lesser extent member-bank credit. Member-bank credit, however, is\nonly one of many types of credit. The Federal Reserve has little control\nover credit which is not based upon the issuance of new money. Non-\nmonetary credit has increased at a rapid rate since the accord.\n\nThe recent growth of credit extended by financial institutions other\nthan commercial banks appears to be an intensification of a long-term\ntrend. Goldsmith's pioneering study shows a relative decline of com-\nmercial-bank credit between 1900 and 1949 [3]. Gurley and Shaw have\nconsidered some of the theoretical and policy implications of the rapid\ngrowth of \"financial intermediaries\" in a path-breaking analysis, and\nhave suggested a \"financial control\" over the assets created by these\ninstitutions [4]. The nature of such control, however, is not indicated\nother than by a suggestion that the assets held by particular types of\ninstitutions might be directly regulated. There does not appear to be\nany unified control system which could serve to regulate such diverse\ninstitutions as savings and loan associations and private pension funds,\nboth of which are included within the general category of \"financial\nintermediaries.\"\n\nThe proposal presented here is far from global. It is limited to an\nextension of legal reserve requirements and Federal Reserve control to\nthose institutions issuing liabilities that may be classified as savings de-\nposits. The credit extended by such institutions represents a substantial\nproportion of the volume of institutional credit outside of Federal Re-\nserve control and has been growing at a very rapid rate. In fact, credit\nbased upon savings deposits now exceeds credit based upon demand de-\nposits. Savings and demand deposits are close asset substitutes, and a\nlack of control or an inadequate control over the institutions issuing\nsavings deposits has raised serious problems regarding both the effec-\ntiveness and the equity of Federal Reserve policy.\n\n* The author is associate professor of economics, University of Minnesota.\n"

But the elaboration of this theory\nto include multiple-product firms has made little progress since the\nfamous Pigou-Taussig controversy in 1912-1913 [3]. Since most of the\nfirms dealt with by the applied economist produce a number of com-\nmodities or services, he has much difficulty in applying the theory to the\ndata (see, for example [1, p. 339 ]). One particularly acute difficulty arises\nfrom the allocation of joint costs.

                    "A Regional Countermeasure to National Wage Standardization\n\nEconomists have, almost without exception, discussed policy questions from\nthe point of view of national governments. Political reality indicates that even\nwithin a single government's over-all policy program internally conflicting and\noffsetting measures are often encountered. Even more likely is it that, when\ntwo or more independently organized and overlapping governmental units\nenact economic policy measures simultaneously over the domain of the same\neconomy, the separate governmental units may have sharply conflicting policy\nobjectives as well as different constitutionally determined powers of action. In\npolitical federalism, conflicts between the national government and the state or\nregional government units seem certain to occur. In such a political setting, the\neconomist's tools may be quite helpful in suggesting ways and means through\nwhich a separate governmental unit may take action to offset or negate the\neffects of policy measures taken by an overlapping jurisdiction. The possibility\nthat action taken by the separate states may serve to offset national govern-\nment policy which is contrary to the interest of the national economy, has not\nbeen adequately considered. This paper attempts to examine a particular case\nof this sort.\n\nWe assume a closed economy extending over a wide geographical area. The\neconomic order is competitive, and the legal structure includes institutions\nwhich effectively enforce competitive norms except where specific exemption is\ngranted. The national government also enforces the employment of a common\ncurrency unit throughout the economy. Suppose now that the national govern-\nment imposes a legal minimum wage, higher than the lowest wage that would\notherwise prevail. This wage is standardized for the whole economy and its\ncoverage extends over a significant number of the employed workers, but not\nover all workers. No account is taken of differing labor-market conditions in\nthe separate regions. We also assume specifically that there is a national policy\nof exempting labor organizations from the legal sanctions against restraint of\ntrade.

I\nagree with many of his statements, but I view his facts in a perspective differ-\nent from his.\n\n1. I agree that my model would correspond to reality more fully if availa-\nbility of birth control had been included as a variable. The Japanese case is a\nhighly pertinent one. Still further, the differential desires of men and of women\nare pertinent, and the psychic costs of birth control methods might well be\nanalyzed separately from their impact on births. If a method of birth control at\nlow psychic and economic cost were readily available to women, I do not doubt\nthat the lag between decline in death rates and that in birth rates would be\ngreatly reduced. However, the model would be greatly complicated by such\nconsiderations.\n\nThe facts that the rate of population declined in the United Kingdom after\n1869-1879, in France after 1855-1865, and in Russia after 1870-1885 are not,\nI suspect, explained by increasing availability of birth control, and the per-\nsistence today of high population growth rates in many countries where death\nrates were cut sharply ten or fifteen years ago indicates that birth control is\nnot apt to spread rapidly everywhere today. Hence I think that the simpler\nmodel is of analytical importance.\n\nMoreover, I do think that psychological attitudes, as distinguished from\navailability of birth control methods, are very important. But there is no point\nin arguing this further here. I regret that I did not discuss the possible influence\nof birth control textually.\n",

Let us conservatively assume that the\npopulation of the United States grows in the future at no more than a 1.3 per\ncent rate (the top of Hagen's range). I doubt if I would get widespread support\nfor a proposal to invite the entire present world population to come live in the\nUnited States.

I take it that Hagen offers his hypothesis regarding inculcations before\nsix in an effort to explain the observed lag between the fall in death and birth\nrates. I very much doubt whether a satisfactory explanation of the lag is possi-\nble unless the availability of birth control and abortion is brought into the\npicture\u2014though this will o\u00a3 provide a full explanation and in fact is itself in\nneed of ultimate explanation. I shall cite only three bits of evidence. The birth\nrate first declined among those with higher income, who obviously were among\nthe first with access to birth control information. Secondly, the great reduction\nin the differential between the birth rates of those with high and low incomes\nthat has recently taken place coincides with evidence from a recent sample\nsurvey that 90 per cent of fertile white married couples now use some form of\nbirth control. And, thirdly, the fact that very large families\u2014five children and\nover\u2014have declined all through the sharp postwar rise in birth rates appears\nonly capable of explanation in terms of increasing availability of birth control.\n\n3. It seems unfair to Malthus to suggest that his model implies that the\n*birth rate is not influenced by the level of income\" (p. 322). Surely Malthus\nwould not have denied the impact of income on birth rates under conditions\nsuch as presently prevail in Japan. If he reached a different conclusion, it was\nonly because he was prepared to allow income\u2014or anything else\u2014to influence\nbirth rates only by encouraging continence or postponing marriage. With the\npossible exception of postponed marriage in Ireland, is there any evidence that,\nif these are the only acceptable techniques, he was wrong?\n\n4. Hagen suggests that birth rates are likely to fall to a level close to that of\ndeath rates, yielding a \"fairly low\" positive rate of increase varying between\n.5 and 1.3 per cent per year. He quotes Notestein to the effect that \"Western\nEurope and the English-speaking countries\" are tending toward a birth rate\n'115 per cent above the secular minimum\" with \"the conspicuous exception of\nfive countries\" where the rate is considerably higher (p. 324). I wish Hagen\nhad devoted more time to a discussion of the probable future behavior of birth\nrates. Keep in mind that what he brands \"exceptions\" include perhaps four-\nffths of all English-speaking people and perhaps 40 per cent of the total\npopulation in question.? Particularly if we continue to have enough illegitimate\nchildren to provide infertile couples with two or three children via adoption,\nan average three-child family involves substantial population growth and an\naverage four-child family very rapid growth. It seems to me that, for a con-\nsiderable period, the private benefits of having a third or even a fourth child\nare likely to exceed the private cost. Further, if Hagen's expectations regarding\ntechnological progress are realized, it seems likely that the rate of population\ngrowth of the \"exceptions,\" where income is higher and expanding more\nrapidly than in the rest of the area, may well come to be the \"rule\" for the\nentire area. In short, there seems no certainty that in the future the rate of\nincrease of developed areas will be \"fairly low.\" Nor do I see any reason for\n\n3T have taken \"Western Europe\" to mean non-iron-curtain Europe excluding Greece and\nYugoslavia.\n",

If one took his\nhypothesis literally, birth rates could only be lowered by reducing death rates\nand then waiting a generation for changing subconscious inculcations to reduce\nbirth rates. Actually, even if we accept his formulation for \"wanted\" children,\nso long as unwanted\" children are being born birth rates can be lowered as\nrapidly as birth control or abortion can be made available. Perhaps the propor-\ntion of *unwanted\" pregnancies in Japan is higher than it will be found to be\nin other areas. But no one (so far as I know) foresaw a halving of the Japa-\nnese birth rate in a decade. It seems quite likely that, without any change in\nthe inculcations distinguished by Hagen, drastic declines in birth rates in\n\n? Population and Economic Growth,\" Am. Econ.

But there is serious\ncause for dispute when, apart from all theoretical argument, the empirical fit\nof such a function turns out to be poor.\n\nIn an article in the June 1959 issue, Stanley Lebergott suggests that a\nsymmetrical curve, in particular the normal curve of error, is at the heart of\nthe income-size distribution. Lebergott argues that the relevant U.S. income\ndistribution shows less skewness than we are accustomed to think and that\nsuch skewness as does exist can be attributed to \"credit rationing\" to the self-\nemployed. Thus, citing Current Population Reports statistics for a population\nof males, age 25-64, he finds that the income distribution is remarkably like\nthe normal gaussian, remarkably unlike the usual skewed distribution\"\n(p. 344).\n\nIf the notion of a symmetrical, or even normal, income distribution had\nempirical basis, a traditional view of long standing would be overthrown.

From this propo-\nsition at least two important classes of inferences have been derived.\n\n1. A lag of wages behind prices as a result of inflation produces ex-\ntraordinarily large business profits. These swollen profits generate a high\nrate of capital formation. In this role, the wage-lag axiom constitutes\nthe foundation of a theory of industrial development.\n\n2. The lag of wages behind prices caused by inflation accentuates\noscillations in the general level of economic activity. The failure of\nwages to keep pace with prices reinforces disequilibrating movements\nin the general level of economic activity. In this capacity, the wage-lag\naxiom functions as an integral part of both overinvestment and under-\nconsumption business cycle theories [14, p. 137 and ff.].\n\nThe contention that inflation causes real wages to fall appears fre-\nquently in the literature of economics. Those who make this contention\nargue in effect that inflation produces a negative correlation between\nreal wages on the one hand and money wages and prices on the other.\nAs a practical matter, it is extremely difficult to employ this idea as a\ntool of analysis for understanding observed movements of time series\nof wages and prices. This difficulty stems from the fact that, as almost\neveryone would agree, the level of real wages can be affected by such\nreal forces as the relative supplies of labor and capital, the quality of\nthe labor force, the pattern of final demands in the economy, and the\nstate of the arts. Furthermore, increases in the general price level can\nbe produced by changes in the real stock of goods, e.g., by droughts,\nplagues, wars, etc., even with a fixed money stock.

General Theory of Employment Interest and Money\nappeared in 1936, economists have been tempted to show that it is not quite\nso general and to fit it into a really general theory. The latest attempt, and the\nmost grandiose, is one by Professor Sidney Weintraub [5].\n\nThe practical problem sparking Weintraub's work appears to be the very\nimportant one of sellers! inflation (although he does not use this term). While\nbuyers' inflation is caused by too much spending, i.e., by buyers trying to buy\nmore goods than are available and thereby bidding up prices, sellers! inflation\nis caused by sellers raising prices even in the face of a deficiency of spending.\nA failure to distinguish between the two types of inflation aggravates a prob-\nlem which has become a serious threat to democratic society.\n\n\"The appropriate treatment for buyers' inflation is to cut down the excessive\nspending that causes it. This may be done by a restrictive monetary or fiscal\npolicy. But if restrictive monetary or fiscal policy is used against sellers' infla-\ntion, spending is reduced when it is o\u00a3 excessive, so that we get a deficiency of\ndemand, depression and unemployment. The inflation will continue, however,\nunless the induced depression is severe enough to destroy the power of sellers\nto raise their prices. This may call for more depression than the authorities\nare prepared to impose or the public willing to suffer. We then get insufficient\ndepression to stop the inflation and we suffer from both evils at the same time.\nIn 1958 we seem to have had sufficient depression to stop the inflation, at\nleast temporarily, but this remedy involved a loss of output estimated at some\n$30 billion per annum and it severely reduced our rate of economic growth.\n\nGalbraith has suggested [1, Ch. 13, 21] that we are rich enough to pay this\n\nprice for price stability. But it is not simply a matter of a reduction in our stand-\nard of living; we are involved in a competition with communism for the planet.\nThe failure to provide full employment is a serious handicap in this race. The\nloss of the $30 billion may be responsible for a fatal economizing in our expen-\nditure on defense. We have a good chance of winning the uncommitted nations\nto the democratic side by contributing a major share of the cost of a develop-\nment program which could make their economic development relatively pain-\nless; but the loss of the $30 billion may make us feel we cannot afford it. And\nthe reduction in our rate of growth can make it relatively easy for the com-\nmunists to realize their dream of \"catching up with and surpassing\" the U.S.\neconomy.\n\n* The author is professor of economics at Michigan State University.\n"

Bach and Ando estimated the distributional burden\nof inflation by measuring the monetary assets and liabilities of various income\ngroups. They have shown that while the government sector is the most im-\nportant net debtor, the household sector is a net creditor. This is true about\nthe sector as a whole and about each income group within this sector. How-\never, different income groups were discovered to have different ratios of mone-\ntary assets to liabilities. The closer this ratio is to unity, the smaller is said\nto be the loss caused by inflation.\n\nThe conclusion that everybody loses by inflation in proportion to his net\n1oney assets is not fully satisfactory, because it rests on the implicit assump-\ntion that the alternative to the burden of inflation is no burden at all. Actually,\nthe real alternative facing the public is whether to bear the cost of inflation\nor the cost of some economic policy designed to achieve equilibrium through\nother means: direct controls, or monetary policy, or fiscal policy, or some\ncombination of all. Even if inflation originated completely with the consumer\nand thus could be prevented by the use of self-restraint, the burden of the\nadditional self-restraint needed to prevent inflation would have to be taken\ninto consideration.\n\nIn this paper I shall compare the distributional burden of inflation with the\ndistributional burden of taxation. Three types of taxes will be considered:\n(a) income tax, (b) sales tax with food not taxable, and (c) sales tax with\nfood taxable.

The sets come in pairs, each of the two treat-\ning the same topics though in slightly different wording.*\n\nIn preparing the questions, the attempt was made to apply the following\nprinciples: (1) to use ordinary language rather than technical terms, and to\navoid both catch questions and self-evident propositions; (2) to make the\nstatements analytical rather than factual\u2014though there are some exceptions,\ndealing with topics like rates of growth, distribution of income, banking prac-\n\n'The origin of the survey was in the 1953-55 \"self-study\" of New York University\nfinanced by the Carnegie Foundation.

In 1954-56 it was tried at more than twenty colleges, and in 1958-59 at\nseveral more. The survey did not draw on the Carnegie grant.\n\n? A few of the questions selected in 1954 and 1955 were those of other writers, taken or\nadapted from teaching manuals, Other questions are undoubtedly almost identical with ones\nused elsewhere.

                    "in productive capacity is that it does away with replacement per se. Even\nwhen they continue to make the same product, firms do not purchase, at the\nend of a machine's lifetime, a machine identical to that which wore out. And\nthe significant nature of productive capacity as a requisite for current income\n(or net national product) is that it provides the shifting and altering bundle\nof goods and services which consumers demand. Economists frequently suggest\nreplacement cost as a basis for figuring aggregate capital consumption al-\nlowances, but this overlooks the basic fact that replacement rarely takes place.\nTn fact, our present capital consumption allowances are imperfect not because\ndepreciation allowances based on original cost do not match replacement costs,\nbut because our concept demands that the entire capital structure, not just\nthat which wears out in the current year, should be revalued each year in\nterms of its potential to satisfy current tastes and preferences. In 1958, $28\nbillion, or 88 per cent of the total funds invested by corporations, was spent\non plant and equipment. There are no data to divide these expenditures into\nreplacement, expanded capacity, or wholly new forms of capital. Any attempt\nto do so requires an impossible definition\u2014that of the word new.\" But leading\nfirms take pride in their sales of products which did not exist a decade ago,\nand the growth in productivity is attributed to technological change and\nnew capital equipment.\n\nConsequently, let us abolish the notion that depreciation has anything to\ndo with replacement. From a welfare point of view, we should not want our\ncapital replaced from year to year. Rather, we want it changed as our prefer-\nences change. From a productivity point of view, we want our capital im-\nproved, not replaced. And from the point of view of describing the accounting\npractices of individual firms, we are contradicting the express pronouncements\nof the accountants themselves.\n",

                    "structed indices to deflate current dollar figures have been argued at length.\nThe consensus seems to be [4], reflecting the accountants' reliance on the\nprinciple of complete disclosure, that attempts to explain the effects of price\nchanges are indeed worthy, but that such explanations should, for now at least,\nremain supplementary. Conventional accounting statements record the dollars\nand cents of transactions which have in fact occurred. No one interpretation,\nstemming from the problem of price changes or from any other single problem,\nshould be allowed to supplant these basic data.\n\nThe economist has a perennial concern with real, as opposed to money,\nvalues, and a current concern with the influence of changing price levels upon\ncapital investment. But the emphasis on depreciation charges as a means of\nreplacement of plant and equipment within the firm leads to a misleading\nanalysis of the capital consumption allowances, based on business depreciation\nfigures, which are deducted from the gross national product.\n\nNational income or output can be estimated to measure welfare or to meas-\nure productivity, and some of the differences implied in the two concepts have\nbeen explored at length. From a welfare point of view (if you believe in free-\ndom of consumer's choice) government expenditures on goods and services\ndiffer from business or consumption expenditures because consumers are not\nfree to choose, by money votes, what government services will be produced,\nand because taxes must be paid. From the productivity angle, government\nproduct equals government purchases of goods and services because no market\nprice exists for the output of government. The same problem arises in estimat-\ning the amount of capital consumed in any one time-period.\n\nConceptually, it is easy to say that current net national product consists of\nthe goods and services currently available for consumption and investment\nafter providing for the maintenance of capacity required to produce the\namount of net national product. *Capital consumption\" therefore would be\nthe current loss in productive capacity of currently valued capital goods. The\nmajor difficulty in measuring this amount, as in measuring the product of gov-\nernment, is that no market prices exist, and hence current dollar figures cannot\nbe used. The textbooks are careful to point out that the \"capital consumption\nallowances\" of the Department of Commerce do not coincide with the concept\nnoted above. For example: *Over a longer period of time, the NNP would be\na better representation of the economy's productivity, if accurate data could\nbe obtained for depreciation and obsolescence allowances\" [9, p. 282]. \"In\nprinciple we must look at some current production of buildings, machinery,\nand so forth as simply the replacement of wear and tear on the outfit we use in\nproduction. . . . Unfortunately, however, our measures of capital consumption\n(the technical term for the using up of durable producers! goods and buildings)\nare very crude\" [6. p. 424].\n\nThe emphasis on replacement, coupled with the incorrect notion that busi-\nness depreciation accounting provides for replacement, allows no concern for\nthe welfare implications of capital consumption allowances, which are worth\nmore stress. Students come to economics convinced of the power of tech-\nnological change in our land, and they find it reiterated throughout any con-\ntemporary introduction to economics. But the essence of technological change\n",

                    "cumulated?\" If, in fact, the previous condition of making a profit or not mak-\ning losses in excess of depreciation charges has been met, revenues to the firm\nwill provide a ten-year stream of money capital amounting to $1,000 a year.\nThis money capital may be invested in inventories, accounts receivable,\nfixed plant, or the reduction of liabilities. If the firm is profitable, this new\nmoney capital presumably earns income, and at the end of ten years, therefore,\nthe firm will be better off not only by the $1,000 generated yearly, but also\nby the profits earned on this sum during the ten years, so that considerably\nmore than $10,000 will accrue. At only 8 per cent per year, for example, the\nten-year proceeds will amount to $14,487. Furthermore, it seems unrealistic\nto assume that the price doubling took place entirely within the tenth year,\nso that we may expect the firm's management, in expending this yearly $1,000\nof new capital, to have notice of current cost increases, and, presumably, use\nthese in justification of price increases by the firm.!\n\nTextwriters can find some support, of course, in the criticisms of original\ncost depreciation given by business executives. A typical statement from man-\nagement, in answer to a questionnaire from the Journal of Accountancy, reads,\n^I believe most everyone agrees that the increased cost of almost everything\nhas made the provision for depreciation . . . inadequate to serve the purpose\nfor which it was intended; namely, to provide funds for the replacement of\nplant and equipment\" [2, p. 78]. DuPont Vice-President T. Crawley Davis\nwas quoted recently urging the recovery, through depreciation allowances, of\n*the original investment in terms of current purchasing power\" [5, p. 2]. In\n1947 the management of United States Steel, without the approval of their\nindependent auditors, charged extra depreciation expense, beyond that based\non original cost, in order *'to give some recognition to increased replacement\ncosts\" [14]. What chiefly concerns business executives, however, is not the\nabstract problem of analyzing inflation, but the concrete possibility of secur-\ning more favorable tax treatment by altering the definition of allowable de-\npreciation. As Jones points out, *When businessmen say that depreciation is\ninadequate because it does not provide for replacements, they are simply\ntaking an easy short-cut which avoids the complications of a full explanation\"\n[8, p. 81]. The short-cut presents an impressive argument for altering the base\nof the corporation income tax; but such a proposal must be considered on\ngrounds of equity of tax treatment and administrative possibilities, rather than\nbeing adopted because of a misunderstanding of the nature of depreciation.?\nThe elementary texts do not provide the student with an accurate explanation\nof the accounting technique, and they infer rather careless ignorance on the\npart of the accounting profession.\n\nThe problem of how to treat changing price levels in accounting statements\nhas been debated fervently and brilliantly for many years within the account-\ning profession. The advantages of a general price index and specially con-\n\n? Cf. detailed calculations of the effects of depreciation charges in a period of rising prices,\nwith given assumptions as to the rate of profit and of price chances [12].\n\n? The report of a symposium conducted by the Tax Institute [15], illustrates clearly that\nthe present concern over depreciation methods in times of inflation reflects the 52 per cent\n\ncorporation tax rate. It should be remembered that depreciation accounting was generally\naccepted by U.S. business only after the income tax provided a financial incentive to do so.\n",

Indeed, during the postwar years, corporate business as a whole\nraised more money in this way than it did through the sales of stocks and\nbonds\" [13, p. 134]. *Depreciation reserves against relatively new equipment\nbecome available for current use. . . . The tremendous size of modern deprecia-\ntion allowances means that the business community . . . may greatly increase\nits productive capacity without ever tapping new outside savings\" [1, p. 180].\n\nBut nowhere in an elementary discussion have I seen reference to the\nobvious but vital fact that it is revenues, not charges, which provide money\ncapital, and that depreciation accounting generates \"internal\" funds only when\nthe firm is making profits, or when its losses do not exceed depreciation ex-\npense. As a result, many students rightfully wonder where, if \"depreciation is\nonly a bookkeeping entry\" and depreciation reserves **do not consist of a pool\nof cash,\" the money does come from, when replacement time rolls around.\n\n\"The 1958 depreciation charges of $34.7 billion amounted to 50 per cent of\ngross private savings, a proportion which has fluctuated in recent years. Of the\ntotal funds available to corporations, $19.6 billion or more than half was\nattributed to depreciation. Another $6.0 billion represented retained profits. As\nfunds to be spent by the firms, both these sums consist of money payments\nby purchasers for the output of corporations. Business prices, and sales, were\n$25.6 billion higher than they would have been if depreciation costs had not\nbeen figured and if the firms had not made profits. The accounting technique\nof charging depreciation is no more responsible for the firm's revenues than\nis the necessity of paying for labor or material. The total funds available for\ninvestment by corporations, some $30 billion, were used to acquire physical\nand financial assets, and to reduce liabilities. But there is no necessary cor-\nrespondence between any one form of investment and any one source of the\nfunds thus spent. Any part of retained profits, or borrowed capital, or money\nacquired through new issues of securities, or the difference between revenues\nand out-of-pocket expenditures which represents depreciation charges, may be\nspent on one or many uses. Replacement of worn-out or obsolete equipment is\nonly one kind of possible capital expenditure, and the means of financing such\nexpenditures bear no relationship to the means of recording the cost of pre-\nvious expenditures. Perhaps the easiest way of emphasizing the lack of cor-\nrespondence would be to review the years during the 30's and during the\nsecond world war, when depreciation charges exceeded expenditures for new\nplant and equipment. In the first period, depreciation charges did not provide\nfunds for replacement because firms made losses, and their revenues did not\ncover the amount of the depreciation charges. In the second period, funds\nwere provided, not by depreciation accounting but by higher wartime sales,\nyet these funds could not be spent on plant and equipment.\n\n'This disregard of the process of generating funds leads the text writers,\nwhen discussing price changes, to overstate woefully the effect of original cost\nin depreciation accounting. For example, *Suppose the price of a piece of\nequipment costing $10,000 has doubled by the time it wears out. If a reserve\nhad been accumulated at the rate of $1,000 a year, when the machine had to\nbe replaced at the end of ten years the accumulated $10,000 would be only\nhalf enough to replace it\" [6, p. 93].

                    "Elementary Economics and Depreciation Accounting\n\nMost introductory courses in economics describe depreciation, a technical\naccounting concept with far-reaching implications for economics, in extremely\nmisleading terms. Students are confused by depreciation in abbreviated ex-\nplanations of business financial statements or in discussions of national income\naccounts. Kuhlman and Skinner, in a recent text, are typical of the first.\n* Businesses, like consumers, save by not spending all of their income. They\nmay set aside depreciation and obsolescence allowances in order to be able to\nreplace plant and equipment\" [9, p. 180]. The explanation does not jibe with\nPaton and Littleton on corporate accounting standards: \"Under accrual ac-\ncounting, depreciation is not a valuation process nor a means of capturing re-\nplacement prices from customers\" [11, p. 17]. Jome, in a text on money and\nbanking, states that Good accounting policy seems to dictate that the purpose\nof the depreciation charge, after all, is to recover the money paid for an asset\nalready constructed\" [7, p. 429]. But the accountant May denies this policy:\n\"Tt is a gross error to assume that it is a part of the function of accounting\nto insure by depreciation charges or otherwise, the return of the investment\nthat has been made in the entity\" [10, p. 24].\n\nThe basic problem here is that economists are using a word which has a\n\"dictionary\" or layman's meaning, but which also has a technical definition in\nthe field of accounting. If economics insists on precise definitions for its own\npurposes of such common words as investment, capital, labor, profit, and\ncompetition, then should it not also recognize this practice in other fields?\nAccountants draw a clear distinction between Webster's definition of depreci-\nation and their technical one, which they describe as an artificial convention.\nThe American Institute of Accountants has formulated a standard expression\nfor this arbitrary or conventional usage which can be duplicated by reference to\nleading authorities in the field of accounting. *Depreciation accounting [is] a\nsystem of accounting which aims to distribute the cost or other basic value of\ntangible capital assets, less salvage (if any), over the estimated useful life\nof the assets in a systematic and rational manner. It is a process of allocation\nand not valuation\" [3, p. 76].\n\nThe outlook of accounting records is to the past. Depreciation charges refer\nto an expenditure which has taken place, and are merely a special method of\nwriting history. Depreciation accounting enables the business firm to make\nseveral ledger entries, instead of one, when a capital expenditure occurs. The\nproblem of replacement, which is not the purpose of depreciation, requires an\noutlook to the future. Sunk costs, expenditures which have already taken\nplace, have no relevance to present or future investment opportunities. The\naccountants' use of depreciation\u2014merely a method of recording a cost\u2014en-\nsures that no backward glance to a past expenditure which is over and done\nwith can influence the rational consideration of a new decision on capital\ninvestment.\n\nSome text-writers, fascinated by the role of \"internal\" funds in expanding\nbusiness capacity, discuss depreciation charges as a source\" of money capital.\n*Among the various sources of capital, depreciation charges are extremely\n",

Will the brightest students be the ones to think of the qualifications to\na simple proposition, and hence be more confused than others as to whether\nto call it true or false? To test this objection, the scores of the 182 whose\ngrades on Set A had been 76 or above, out of the first 1,136 male students to\ntake the set (after either the full or half-year course), were compared with\nthe averages for all 1,136. On every question the 182 averaged significantly\nbetter than the rest. The closest the two groups came was on Nos. 49 and 50,\nfor which the 182 made 86 and 88 per cent as many errors per man, respec-\ntively, as the other 954 students. On average, they made only 59 per cent as\nmany errors.\n\n2. Is reasoning power tested in true-and-false questions, or do the students\nmerely guess? The answer is that the individual student may often guess, but\nthat it is statistically impossible for every class to have improved its average\ngrade, as has been the case, without an increase in understanding.\n\nIn one class, the students were given only 25 questions and were asked to\nstate in a single sentence the reason for each answer. A good reason for a cor-\nrect answer received 3 points credit, a weak reason one point, and an illogical\nreason nothing. Between the beginning and the end of the course, this class\nincreased its average score by 9.3 points; while the computed average validity\nof the reasons on correct answers improved by 8.6 points.

On money and banking, and public finance, there was no\nsignificant difference in the scores of the two groups. On international eco-\nnomics, the full-year students gained 8 percentage points and on production,\ncost and business organization 11 points, more than the one-semester students.\nThe largest single difference, 20 points, occurred in No. 4, on economies of\nscale, and No. 41, on the tariff.\n\nFailure of the course at particular institutions to cover important areas\nthoroughly is also revealed by the tests. To cite one example, the several\nhundred students at one college averaged only 65 at the end of the full-year\ncourse on question 2 of Set A, whereas at all others the scores were between\n80 and 95. Apparently the course at this college skimped cost analysis (it\nranked lowest on question 4 also).\n\nIV. Purposes of the Survey and Possible Objections\n\n1. The first aim has been to test whether the course is achieving generally\nsatisfactory results. When classes score 55 at the start of the course and only\n65 at the end, it is hard to boast. Possibly the advanced courses which empha-\nsize institutions do better. One teacher reports having tried the same experi-\nment in his 20-student course in marketing. The class averaged 36 right out\n",

                    "On 8 of the 50 questions in Set A, the course improved the average knowl-\nedge of male students by 49 per cent or more of the difference between the\nbeginning mark and 100. A brief comment on each of these follows:\n\nNo. 1. 49 per cent of potential gain achieved. Good progress was evidently\nmade in learning that productivity is related to capital investment, innova-\ntion and similar factors.\n\nNo. 3. 61 per cent. The law of diminishing returns was grasped at the end\nof the course by three-fifths of the students who had not sensed it at the start.\n\nNo. 8. 64 per cent. The difference between elastic and inelastic demand was\nwell taught.\n\nNo. 15. 50 per cent. Three-quarters of the students already knew that the\ngold standard does not ensure price stability, and this was learned by half\nthe remaining students.\n\nNo. 17. 54 per cent. More than half the students who had not already\nknown it learned the fundamental principle of multiple bank expansion on\nadditions to reserves.\n\nNo. 20. 50 per cent. More than 70 per cent of the students realized already\nthat easing bank reserves facilitates lending, and half the rest learned this\nduring the course.\n\nNo. 41. 61 per cent. Very good progress was made on the tariff questions of\nall sets, as on this question from Set A. On a \"protariff\" question, No. 40,\nprogress was less (37 per cent) than on this \"'antitariff\" question, No. 41. The\nantiprotection position of textbooks and teachers is known to all.\n\nNo. 47. 67 per cent. Almost 80 per cent of students thought at the start of\nthe course that it would be foolish to try to pay off the public debt at once;\nand two-thirds of the rest learned this during the course. *Prodebt\" proposi-\ntions were well taught in the course, as appears in several of the question sets.5\n\nIt can hardly be said that there was real success on the other 42 questions,\nwhere progress toward the score of 100 was 47 per cent or less. On 8 of them,\nthere was retrogression\u2014though if more students had taken the test, it would\nprobably appear that several decreases in scores were not statistically signifi\ncant.\n\nNo. 11. Both at the beginning and the end of the course, guesses as to the\neffects of speculation went about fifty-fifty. Speculation would seem to be an\nimportant enough subject for students to be given an idea of its fundamental\nnature and consequences\u2014though not of its technical details.\n\nNo. 18. It is perhaps surprising that on so complex a banking question two-\nthirds of the students should have known, sensed or guessed the answer at\nthe start. The apparent decrease in knowledge during the course may prove\nnot to be statistically significant, although perhaps students became confused\nby attempting to undertake a complex chain of reasoning.\n\nNo. 25. There was a substantial decline in realization that dividends have\nan impact on consumption different from that of building up working capi-\n\n51Tt could be argued that students had merely learned the instructor's views, both on this\nand the tariff question, and given back on the test what they thought he wanted. This might\nor might not be true as to the tariff, but the fact that 79 per cent of students took a *pro-\ndebt? attitude at the start on No. 47 supports the inference that most answers at the end\n\nwere sincere.\n",

To use hypothetical examples, *Public debt is always bad\" and\n\"Public debt is never dangerous\" are false, though **Economists see no reason\nwhy public debt should not be made the vehicle of economic expansion\" would\ndraw divergent answers, and therefore would be unusable.\n\nThe 50 questions are answered in 25 minutes, 100 questions\u2014when used\u2014\nin 50 minutes. Scoring is on the scale of 100, with 2 points for each correct\nanswer and no penalty for wrong guesses. Since guessing would, on average,\nyield a score of 50, this is the equivalent of zero. It implies that a student has\nas many false as true notions about the questions being answered.?\n\nII. General Results of the Test\n\nScores recorded on the six sets used through June 1959 are summarized in\nTable 1. The average of all grades before the course, for the different sets of\nquestions, has been between 52 and 58; and the average after it, between 61\nand 68. The widest spread among men's colleges on a single set was from 60.6\nto 71.0; and among women's colleges, from 56.6 to 70.1 (both were Set E,\nafter the course). The spread was usually much smaller: thus on Set A, for\nmen, it was from 56.6 to 58.2 at the start and from 63.6 to 71.9 at the end.\n\nMale students have begun with a slightly greater knowledge of the subject,\nand have usually maintained or improved that advantage. At 12 coeducational\ncolleges, the unweighted arithmetic mean of the male advantage was 1.9 points\nbefore, and 2.7 points after the course.*\n\n* One 12-year old boy asked to take the test. Scoring 58 on Set A, he proceeded confidently\nto B, where his mark proved to be 42. It took 100 questions\u2014but only 100\u2014to reveal his\ntrue knowledge of economics! Though the score of a single student on 50 or even 100\nquestions may be misleading, the law of averages has emerged whenever 20 or 25 took the\ntest.\n\n* Numbers of colleges and students taking the tests:\n\nBeginning of Course End of Full-Year Course\nTest Men Women Men Women\nSets\nColleges | Students | Colleges | Students || Colleges | Students | Colleges | Students\nA 4 1,123 3 296 7 978 4 163\nB 3 71 3 265 5 581 6 184\nC 5 784 3 189 6 513 4 52\nD 3 284 3 99 5 392 4 126\nE 3 42 3 206 6 921 6 235\n\n",

                    "I. The Questions Used\n\nEight sets of 50 questions have been used, each containing 5 propositions on\nproduction, cost and business organization; 8 each on price, money and bank-\ning, income and employment, distribution of income, and international eco-\nnomics; and 5 on public finance. The sets come in pairs, each of the two treat-\ning the same topics though in slightly different wording.*\n\nIn preparing the questions, the attempt was made to apply the following\nprinciples: (1) to use ordinary language rather than technical terms, and to\navoid both catch questions and self-evident propositions; (2) to make the\nstatements analytical rather than factual\u2014though there are some exceptions,\ndealing with topics like rates of growth, distribution of income, banking prac-\n\n'The origin of the survey was in the 1953-55 \"self-study\" of New York University\nfinanced by the Carnegie Foundation. All faculty members were asked for suggestions as to\nhow academic work could be evaluated; and this method occurred to the writer as an obvious\nway of doing it. In 1954-56 it was tried at more than twenty colleges, and in 1958-59 at\nseveral more. The survey did not draw on the Carnegie grant.\n\n? A few of the questions selected in 1954 and 1955 were those of other writers, taken or\nadapted from teaching manuals, Other questions are undoubtedly almost identical with ones\nused elsewhere. The writer does not claim that, where they differ, his own are superior to\nthose developed by others.\n",

The work in the high school field\nof the Joint Council on Economic Education reflects this feeling, as does the\nsearch at various colleges for some new approach.\n\nThe purpose of this communication is to present the findings to date of a\nsurvey of the success of the elementary course. Identical or closely similar sets\nof true-and-false questions have been administered\u2014when possible both before\nand after the course.! The experiment has revealed (1) an unsatisfactory rate\nof progress generally, and (2) particular fields in which students have learned\nlittle or nothing.\n\nT o m n o. T? 3\n",
