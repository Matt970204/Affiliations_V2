                    "Reply\n\nMy differences with Professor Fellner may be focussed on a single issue of\ncentral importance. Fellner maintains, in both his Tables I and II, that upward\ncross-elasticities must be zero between any two firms in atomistic competition\n(pure or differentiated) ; and he holds, similarly, that positive upward cross-\nelasticities necessarily imply oligopolistic interdependence. It is my view that\ncross-elasticities (upward and downward) may be positive, and indeed very\nlarge, without implying oligopoly. Specifically, cross-elasticities will be high\nbetween any two members of a large-number group when the products of the\nrival firms are sufficiently near the homogeneity pole. Fellner's conclusion\n(usually without the upward-downward distinction) has been the instinctively\nplausible one to many people.* Hence it is all the more important to emphasize\nthe grounds for my different view. I do so by means of a numerical example.\n\nImagine 1,000,001 suppliers of physically comparable but very, very slightly\ndifferentiated products. Assume that the firms are all charging equal prices and\nselling equal quantities. Assume, furthermore, that if the ith firm's price is\nraised very slightly (with all other prices constant), all but a negligible frac-\ntion of the business lost by that firm is transferred, in equal amounts, to the\n1,000,000 other firms in the group. This means that the change in g; will be\n(approximately) 1,000,000 times the opposite change in any other group\nmember's g;\u2014in both absolute and percentage terms. For example, if 5; is\nincreased so that g; declines by 1 per cent, each q; will increase by (approxi-\nmately) .000,001 per cent. This is the negligible impact of one atomistically\ncompetitive firm on its fellows. I propose to show that it does not necessarily\nimply a \"zero\" or negligibly \"small\" cross-elasticity.\n\nSuppose, now, that the ith firm's own elasticity E;; (up or down) is\n\u20141,000,000,000. To reduce g; by 1 per cent, 5; need be raised by only\nabout .000,000,001 per cent. Hence the cross-elasticity Ej; is approximately\n1,000, since the .000,001 per cent increase of g; is 1,000 times the initiating\npercentage increase of 5;.\n\nNow I beg the reader who sits in judgment to contemplate: (1) this very\nlarge number of firms; (2) this enormous own elasticity, implying a remark-\nably close approach to product homogeneity; and (3) this very high cross-\nelasticity! Is this situation oligopolistic or not? If it is not, let us be rid once\nand for all of the tempting but quite erroneous preconception that high cross-\n\n* Still another example of this view comes from R. L. Hall and C. J.

It falls to zero, say Fellner,\nbecause \"in the event of the least differentiation the sales-increment of the price-reducing\nfirm can be made smaller than azy finite magnitude provided that the price reduction\nbecomes small enough.\" This remarkable argument implies that every finite derivative and\nelasticity is zero.

                    "A fundamental logical trouble that has a\u00edflicted cross-elasticity pronounce-\nments from the very beginning is that two kinds of limit are involved: (1) if\nown elasticities are constant and finite (because the product is not strictly\nhomogeneous), a steady increase in the number of firms in the group does\nimply a steady decrease of cross-elasticities toward zero as a limit (never\nactually reached) ; and (2) if the number of firms is constant, an approach to\nproduct homogeneity implies a steady increase in cross-elasticities toward\ninfinity as a limit. Fellner's mistake, as I see it, is in supposing that the\nnumber-of-firms limit (which cannot be reached) must be dominant over the\nproduct-homogeneity limit (which can). If bot of these limiting processes are\noperating simultaneously, no one can say iz general how the cross-elasticities\nwill behave.

It all depends on the number\nof firms relative to the degree of product homogeneity (as reflected specifically\nin the own elasticities).\n\nIn the context of Table II, Fellner relaxes his requirement that there must\nbe an \"infinite number\" of firms for atomistic competition; but now he insists\nthat cross-elasticities must be based on *'ad /oc selected finite price changes.\"\nHe also specifies the treatment of *subjectively unnoticed ('negligible') quan-\ntities as zeros.\" When products are homogeneous (absolutely or practically)\nand firms are many as in my opening example, a negligible increase of 5i\nhas a negligible effect on g;.

                    "There is a world of difference between such microscopic, passive reactions\nand oligopolistic interdependence. The typical oligopolistic reaction to a price\ncut is not just passive, but retaliatory. That is, it is designed to discourage such\nprice cutting in the first place, even at the immediate cost of the retaliator's\nhurting himself even as he seeks to discipline the aggressor. Oligopolistic col-\nlusion, explicit or tacit, accordingly implies a reluctance to make certain\naggressive moves solely because of an expected or feared reaction from one or\nmore rivals. Hence an oligopolistic *equilibrium\" typically implies that the\nfirms are at positions significantly different from those that would be implied\nif the firms were to make their business decisions on an assumption of negligible\nreactions from rivals.\n\nThe likelihood that collusion will be attempted\u2014and if attempted, success-\nful\u2014depends not only on the mere perceptibility of the effects of one firm's\nactions on another, but on the magnitude of those effects and the character\nand magnitude of the reactions. Least of all can the likelihood of oligopolistic\nbehavior be prejudged simply on grounds that the analyst chooses to use\npoint elasticities (or arc elasticities that are based on very small finite price\nchanges). I confess I am somewhat surprised to have to rebut a view that the\nprinciples of Competition Among the Few are now automatically applicable\nto \"competition among the few million\" simply because the author used point\nelasticities.\n\nI also have misgivings about Fellner's use of the concept of an \"infinite\nnumber\" of firms. Some limits can be reached (e.g., an absolutely homogene-\nous product). Others cannot (e.g., an \"infinite number\" of firms). \"Infinity,\"\nin this context, is not a number\" but simply an implication that there is no\nfinite limit. In Fellner's Table I, point cross-elasticities (upward and down-\nward) are infinite when identical products are supplied by any finite number\nof firms. But he also believes that, with an \"infinite number\" of firms, the\nupward cross-elasticities will be uniquely zero. Now if this is to mean anything\nat all, it must mean that the upward cross-elasticities apfroach zero as the\nnumber of firms grows indefinitely large. But this they do not do, on the\ntestimony of Fellner's own Table I. With strictly- homogeneous products, the\nleap from infinite to zero cross-elasticity takes place only in a never-never\nland of *infinite numbers\" of firms. Hence it is not consistent with the basic\nprinciples of taking a limit.\"\n\nProvided that there is a very large number of producers of a homogeneous product, I\nalso think that either the Cournot model or the Bertrand model is quite acceptable (again\ncf. Fellner's n. 12). These two models then give approximately the same results, They give\nsignificantly different results, and are both unacceptable, only when the number of firms is\nsmall. In other words, neither Cournot nor Bertrand had a satisfactory theory of oligopoly;\nbut they both did have satisfactory theories of competition.\n\n\"In the foregoing paragraph I have willingly repressed my own misgivings about the\ndeterminacy of cross-elasticities when there are three or more suppliers of absolutely\nhomogeneous products (of. cit., pp. 793-94). I am willing to follow the convention that\nFellner seems to accept\u2014namely, that any change in q, will affect oppositely, to at least\nsome extent, every other q; in the group. Then the cross-elasticities within the homo-\ngeneous-product group are all infinite no matter what the number of firms\u2014just as the\ncross-elasticities approach infinity when product homogeneity is merely approached, for\nany given number of firms.\n",

My reason for that choice is that the analogy to the number\nof firms in a well-defined, symmetrical group is intuitively meaningful.

For example, if all the members of a purely competitive group have fixed\nsupplies, the relevant demand facing the ;th firm has an elasticity equal to z times the\nindustry-demand elasticity, where z; is the ratio of industry quantity to the ith firm's\nquantity (cf. op. cit., p. 795, esp. n. 26). With variable supplies (upward-sloping marginal\nCosts), the relevant elasticity is even higher; for a given increase of q., lowering price very\nslightly, will then reduce all the q;'s microscopically, and so cause price to fall even less\nthan in the case of fixed supplies (05. cit., p. 797, n. 28).\n\nAlthough \"negligible\" and \"imperceptible\" are often used loosely as synonyms, I feel\nthat it is neither necessary nor desirable to make atomistic behavior depend on the myopia\nor the \"limited sensitivity\" of the firms, as Fellner would have it (p. 904, esp. n. 12).

This does not require that the change of that firm's output will have\nliterally no effect on the outputs of the other firms, but only that the reactions\nof those other firms must not be such as to destroy the approximate hori-\nzontality of the relevant demand facing the one firm.* The main point is this:\nif the negligible impact of any one firm on its fellows gives rise to only micro-\nScopic, \"passive\" reactions, there can be no significant degree of oligopolistic\ninterdependence.

Point elasticities are convenient\nbecause of their lack of ambiguity. Specifically, they characterize a firm's\nsituation with respect to even the smallest conceivable price-quantity change;\nand they also reflect, approximately, the implications of small, finite changes.?\nThe underlying conception of smoothly continuous demand functions is, of\ncourse, an \"idealization\"\u2014but again one that is familiar, convenient, and often\n(though not always) a defensible approximation of discrete reality. My basic\ndisagreement with Fellner concerns his view that there is some tying clause\nin the theorist's contract that necessarily links this idealization with another\nquite different one\u2014namely, an insistence that atomistic competition cannot\nexist with anything short of an \"infinite number\" of firms.\n\nIn the context of Table I, Fellner uses point cross-elasticities but refuses to\nclassify a situation as atomistically competitive unless there is an \"infinite\nnumber\" of rival firms. He would thus classify my numerical example, above,\nas an instance of \"differentiated oligopoly.\" As long as Fellner remains within\nthe context of his Table I, a million suppliers of perfect or near-perfect substi-\ntute products are just a million oligopolists.

Fellner maintains, in both his Tables I and II, that upward\ncross-elasticities must be zero between any two firms in atomistic competition\n(pure or differentiated) ; and he holds, similarly, that positive upward cross-\nelasticities necessarily imply oligopolistic interdependence. It is my view that\ncross-elasticities (upward and downward) may be positive, and indeed very\nlarge, without implying oligopoly. Specifically, cross-elasticities will be high\nbetween any two members of a large-number group when the products of the\nrival firms are sufficiently near the homogeneity pole. Fellner's conclusion\n(usually without the upward-downward distinction) has been the instinctively\nplausible one to many people.* Hence it is all the more important to emphasize\nthe grounds for my different view. I do so by means of a numerical example.\n\nImagine 1,000,001 suppliers of physically comparable but very, very slightly\ndifferentiated products. Assume that the firms are all charging equal prices and\nselling equal quantities. Assume, furthermore, that if the ith firm's price is\nraised very slightly (with all other prices constant), all but a negligible frac-\ntion of the business lost by that firm is transferred, in equal amounts, to the\n1,000,000 other firms in the group. This means that the change in g; will be\n(approximately) 1,000,000 times the opposite change in any other group\nmember's g;\u2014in both absolute and percentage terms. For example, if 5; is\nincreased so that g; declines by 1 per cent, each q; will increase by (approxi-\nmately) .000,001 per cent. This is the negligible impact of one atomistically\ncompetitive firm on its fellows.

                    "political and journalistic heat has seemed greater than its capacity to\nfurnish the basic fuel for the American industrial economy. In the\npolicy controversies of the war and postwar years there was an apprecia-\ntion of the national importance of the bituminous coal industry, but\nthere was not always an equal recognition of its peculiar economic char-\nacteristics. The public press often attributed the operating pattern of\nthe industry to the personalities of particular individuals without much\nallowance for the physical fact that coal mining is an industry of vary-\ning seams, faults, shafts, strips and product volatility. Numerous\nactions for dealing with strikes in this industry, and indeed in others,\nwere taken; and the cry of national emergency\" whenever a stoppage\nwas threatened became a clich\u00e9 without much specific meaning.\n\nIt is the purpose of this article to develop a theory of the impact of\ndisputes on production particularly applicable to the bituminous coal\nindustry, but which may also outline some features that are of broader\nsignificance. Such a theory will not furnish a solution for national\nemergency strikes, but it may furnish guidance for determining when\nan emergency is present. In social as in medical science, it might be\nwell for diagnosis to precede surgery. Even complete success in micro-\nscopic measurement of the influence of labor disputes upon coal produc-\ntion in the eighteen years, 1933-1950, will do no more than create a\n\"small window that looketh out upon a great world.\" That window will\nhave more than one opaque pane, and some mullions badly fitted, wait-\ning for other more skillful efforts with better tools and more nearly\npure materials to present a clearer view.*\n",

He\nlived in a nation where two great problems, inflation and free trade, gave\ndirection and significance to economics. And now, 130 years after his death,\nhe is as fortunate as ever: he has been befriended by Sraffa\u2014who has been\nbefriended by Dobb.\n\nKeynes told us, in 1933, that Sraf\u00edfa, *from whom nothing is hid,\" would\ngive us the full works of Ricardo within the year.?

This\nis desirable as well as inevitable: it would be high tragedy if Ricardo had\nbeen forced to wait more than a century before revealing his ideas. Moreover,\nthere is little point in the conventional \"estimates\" of past economists. One\ncan indeed debate the desirability of the influence Ricardo exerted on eco-\nnomics, but his vast influence is undeniable and the debate serves no clear\npurpose beyond exciting his heirs and intellectual assignees. I doubt whether\ndead professors should be graded\u2014 but for those who must have grades, I\nthink Ricardo's policy recommendations were profoundly good but his theory\nwas not of the highest quality.?\n\nBe that as it may, I shall restrict my comments to three subjects: the\nquality of the edition; Mill's influence on Ricardo; and Ricardo and Malthus\non Say's Law.\n\n* The author is professor of economics at Columbia University.\n\n!

From this he concluded that **. . .\nthe phenomenon of growth places on shaky ground those who would argue that\ndepreciation allowances are insufficient to meet replacement requirements.\"?\nEisner is literally correct in this conclusion, but it appears that he meant by\n\"those who would argue\" the many businessmen and accountants who contend\nthat depreciation allowances are too low, for at the start of his paper he stated\nthat their argument *'. . . declares that the cost of replacing expiring equipment\n[thereafter referred to in his paper as replacement requirements] in today's\ninflated market is actually much greater than current depreciation charges,\nwhich are related to original cost of assets.\"* The inference is that the business-\nmen and accountants who contend that depreciation allowances are too low\nmay be wrong under their own measurement criteria.\n\nBefore examining the validity of this inference, it is advisable to note the\nfollowing concepts: (1) The calculation of depreciation involves the establish-\nment of both a cost basis and an allocation basis. (2) Conventional accounting\npractice is the straight-line allocation of historical cost. (3) Eisner used the\nterm \"replacement requirements\" to mean the allocation of replacement cost\nto the year of retirement.\n\nEisner was mistaken in his impression that the critics of conventional ac-\ncounting practice advocate replacement requirements for the measurement of\ndepreciation. Although some popular discussions of the subject do use the word\n\"replacement\" rather loosely, to my knowledge use of replacement require-\nments has not been advocated for calculating depreciation. Indeed, a survey\nof the literature reveals that all that has been advocated and discussed is a\nchange in the cost basis, i.e., the substitution for historical cost of either re-\nplacement cost or current purchasing power of historical cost.* Under either of\n\n!

It will hold for all values of the coeffi-\ncients which are consistent with the basic assumptions underlying the third\ncase. (2) Given this behavior for receipts, any change in the life of the asset,\neither by rotating the receipts curve around its intercept with the vertical axis\nor by shifting that curve, will not materially influence the form of the deprecia-\ntion curve. (3) If the rate of discount is low, the depreciation curve will fall\ncontinuously at an increasing rate, as shown in Figure 1. However, if the rate\nis high, the depreciation curve will first rise and then fall, with all but the last\nfew years close to the value for straight-line allocation. To illustrate this,\nassume a 25 per cent rate of discount and a receipts function of\n\nC, \u2014 50 \u2014 30(1 4 .015)*7\n\nin which case the asset has a useful life of 24 years and a cost of $51.13. The\nstraight-line depreciation is $2.13, and the economic life depreciation rises and\nfalls in the interval between $2.00 and $2.50 during the first nineteen years\nand then falls to zero.\n\nIn conclusion, if economic life is a valid measure of depreciation and if the\nassumptions of the third case are, in fact, a reasonable basis for predicting the\nbehavior of an asset's receipts, then straight-line allocation is superior to pro-\nductive capacity as a measure of depreciation. However, if the fall in an asset's\nreceipts parallels the fall in its productive capacity, the superiority of straight-\nline allocation does not hold as the values of the parameters become relatively\nlarge.\n\nFinally, there has been considerable dissatisfaction on the part of many\nbusinessmen, economists, and accountants with the two principal accounting\nconventions\u2014historical cost and straight-line allocation. It is hoped that this\ncomment may prove useful in the evaluation of the latter convention.\n\nMvnoN J.

Hence, as either or both of these parameters are increased, economic\nlife moves closer to productive capacity.\n\nIt may be noted that some accounting texts, when discussing alternative\nmathematical rules for the allocation of cost, mention an annuity method,\nwhich in reality is our economic life method. However, in illustrating the\nmethod they assume, as with an annuity, that receipts are constant over time,\nand the inevitable consequence is a depreciation charge which increases over\ntime.

The latter is widely\nused solely because it is simple and objective; the accounting profession ra-\ntionalizes the practice with the view that depreciation is *. . . a process of\nallocation, not of valuation.\" Similarly, there is no a ?riori reason why the\nmaintenance of productive capacity should result in the correct determination\nof income. Therefore, comparison of the two methods requires the establish-\nment of a standard of comparison, a third method that is theoretically valid.\n\nSuch a criterion is to be found in neoclassical theory, where an asset's in-\ncome is defined as the periodic payment in perpetuity that has a present value\nequal to the present value of the asset's expected future receipts.\" Since\ndepreciation is simply the difference between receipts and income, it follows\nthat a definition of depreciation is implicit in the above. This definition can be\nstated directly as the present value of the future receipts at the start of the\nperiod less the present value of the future receipts at the end of the period with\nthe period's actual receipts excluded from the latter quantity. Or, restated in\nthe language of accountancy, the cost (of depreciable assets) incurred in\nrealizing a period's revenue is the expiration in present value of the assets\nexpected future receipts. If this measure of depreciation, termed here the\n*economic life method,\" is accepted as valid, straight-line allocation and\nexpiration of productive capacity may be compared for accuracy by determin-\ning how closely each approximates economic life depreciation. Such a com-\nparison is made below through three illustrative cases, each of which assumes\na different path for an asset's receipts over its life.\n\nBefore going into these cases, two points should be noted: (1) The cost\nbasis of valuation is a fundamental postulate of accounting, and this postulate\nwill not be violated. Specifically, although the expected receipts at time of\npurchase will be used to determine that portion of an asset's cost to be charged\nas depreciation in each year of its life changes in expected receipts over the\nasset's life will not modify its cost or the depreciation charge.

                    "Depreciation Allowances, Replacement Requirements and\nGrowth: A Comment\n\nIn his recent article,' Profesor Eisner demonstrated that, when price changes\nare ignored, *Depreciation allowances exceed replacement requirements in\ngrowing economies or growing firms\"; and that *. . . only when prices increase\nsomewhat faster than real investment do replacement requirements approach\nthe magnitude of depreciation allowances.\"? From this he concluded that **. . .\nthe phenomenon of growth places on shaky ground those who would argue that\ndepreciation allowances are insufficient to meet replacement requirements.\"?\nEisner is literally correct in this conclusion, but it appears that he meant by\n\"those who would argue\" the many businessmen and accountants who contend\nthat depreciation allowances are too low, for at the start of his paper he stated\nthat their argument *'. . . declares that the cost of replacing expiring equipment\n[thereafter referred to in his paper as replacement requirements] in today's\ninflated market is actually much greater than current depreciation charges,\nwhich are related to original cost of assets.\"* The inference is that the business-\nmen and accountants who contend that depreciation allowances are too low\nmay be wrong under their own measurement criteria.\n\nBefore examining the validity of this inference, it is advisable to note the\nfollowing concepts: (1) The calculation of depreciation involves the establish-\nment of both a cost basis and an allocation basis. (2) Conventional accounting\npractice is the straight-line allocation of historical cost. (3) Eisner used the\nterm \"replacement requirements\" to mean the allocation of replacement cost\nto the year of retirement.\n\nEisner was mistaken in his impression that the critics of conventional ac-\ncounting practice advocate replacement requirements for the measurement of\ndepreciation. Although some popular discussions of the subject do use the word\n\"replacement\" rather loosely, to my knowledge use of replacement require-\nments has not been advocated for calculating depreciation. Indeed, a survey\nof the literature reveals that all that has been advocated and discussed is a\nchange in the cost basis, i.e., the substitution for historical cost of either re-\nplacement cost or current purchasing power of historical cost.* Under either of\n\n!

Orthodox marginalism can offer an\nexplanation of a failure to increase output and therefore can at least partially explain why\nat any one time some firms are and some are not producing beyond \"capacity.\" It is not\nthe purpose of this note, however, to disparage the usefulness of the questionnaire results,\nper se, but rather to criticize the implications the authors draw therefrom, even if the\nsurvey is taken at face value.\n\n* The author is assistant professor of economics at Michigan State College.\n"

                    "Comment\n\nHow unfortunate that the exotic and pugnacious pleasures of windmill-\ntilting have led Professor W. J. Eiteman to assert that the results of his un-\nusually intelligent and unloaded questionnaire on the imagined shape of\naverage cost curves constitute empirical refutation of something called\n\"marginalism,\" an old enemy of his.\n\nHis results do overthrow the conventional U-shaped cost curves of con-\nventional textbooks! and conventional review articles. Amen, and so much\nthe better. But the U-shaped curves are not marginalism; they are merely\npretty pictures, just as the hourglass figure is not the human female but the\n\"foundation garment.\" We like our cost curves parabolic (i.e., U-shaped)\nbecause it is so easy for the rudimentary mathematician to derive and visualize\naverage-marginal relations from this particular shape. But marginalism as\nsuch assumes no curve types\u2014U or V or W or any other. All are grist to the\nmill. Any of Eiteman's eight curve types is just as marginal (or just as anti-\nmarginal) as any other. His error lies in treating certain curve types as\n\"supporting\" and others as \"not supporting\" the *marginalist hypothesis.\"\n(References?) Strange things result. This writer, for example, considers him-\nself a marginalist of sorts, albeit lukewarm and long-run.? Yet in classroom\npresentation, he likes to work with curves of the two types (6-7) found most\nrealistic by Eiteman\u2014and labelled *antimarginalist\"! (What, in particular, is\n\"antimarginalist\" about the U-shaped type 6?)\n\nThe issue between marginalists and averagists in cost and price theory is a\nreal one. Marginalism is not pure tautology, despite some unguarded state-\nments by overenthusiastic proponents; it is perfectly possible for businessmen\nto act in an antimarginalist manner. Whether they do so act or not depends\nnot on curve types but on whether they do (or should) base their price and\noutput policies on marginal rather than average cost considerations, wien\nmarginal and average costs diverge materially. On this topic, the researches of\nEiteman and Guthrie tell us little or nothing. And necessarily so, as a glance\n\n* Among the notable exceptions is Lorie Tarshis' Elements of Economics (Boston 1046).\nIs Tarshis an antimarginalist because he foresook the U-shaped cost curve in favor of\nsomething like a beaver's front tooth?\n\n* M.

His treatment of my handling of the interwar Jewish\nproblem in Poland is particularly objectionable because he clearly implies that\nI was at least sympathetic with the anti-Semitism of that period. I should\nlike to make it quite clear that any such implication is entirely unfounded.\nMandel charges that, in my book, Everybody, from the United States to\nHitler and Stalin, is blamed for Poland's sorry plight, except the Poles them-\nselves; but more than anybody else\u2014the Jews\" (p. 32). But on the page of\nmy book to which he refers, I listed six different sets of circumstances which\ncomplicated the handling of the basic economic problems of interwar Poland;\nand the Jewish problem, one of the six, received no particular stress as com-\npared with the other five. There is no basis whatever for the charge that I\nblamed the Jews for anything. What I did say, on page 103 (the other\nreference which Mandel gave), was:\n\nSome industries were almost completely dominated by Jews, for example,\n94.7 per cent of the textile industry and 95.6 per cent of the leather and\nfur industry. The typical economic position of the Polish Jew was that\nof the small entrepreneur, and the concentration of two-thirds of the\nJewish population within the cities presented a difficult problem in a\ncountry which had over 60 per cent of its total population engaged in\nagriculture, since the position of Jews in commerce and handicratts\nblocked the natural channels of economic expansion of the non-Jew.\n",

Unfortunately this is not all that marginal\nanalysis implies, for the theory suggests also a technique for maximizing\nprofits. It would be foolhardy to deny that businessmen desire maximum\nprofits. My argument is that the techniques they employ do not work towards\nthis goal even when their actual cost curve is U-shaped. Given a U-shaped\ncost curve and a relatively elastic average revenue curve, the most profitable\npoint of operation is admittedly that scale of operations where marginal costs\nequals marginal revenue. However, in the world of reality, businessmen are\nnot given \"cost and revenue curves,\" and if they believe that their least\ncost point is at capacity when it is not, then the equilibrium point towards\nwhich they bend their productive efforts is capacity and not the point of\nequilibrium of conventional theory.\n\n'Thirdly, one critic admits that businessmen are not guided by considera-\ntions of marginal revenue and costs but he contends that the theory, when\nproperly understood, explains business behavior nevertheless. In those cases\nin which the \"guiding principles\" of businessmen happen to lead to the same\nresult as conventional theory suggests, the explanation offered by conventional\ntheory does not conflict with facts. However, in those cases in which the\n\"guiding principles\" of businessmen lead to a different result than conven-\ntional theory, the theory does not jibe with reality nor explain managerial\nbehavior.\n\nFurthermore, it must be remembered that theory is used to predict be-\nhavior as well as to explain it. For example, the question of the probable\neffect of a state income tax was raised recently in Michigan. The corporations\nsaid, \"We will pass the tax on to the consumer in the form of higher prices\";\na well-known economist said, *an income tax cannot be shifted.\"* Without\nentering into the merits of his argument, it will be recalled that the pro-\nposition that an income tax cannot be shifted rests upon an assumption that\nthe sales price set by a manufacturer for his product is on the demand curve\n(it is the maximum price that could be charged for that quantity of the\nproduct). In theory no businessman would sell for less; in practice they do.\nIt is dangerous to attempt to predict what businessmen will do by reasoning\nfrom theories that are based upon what businessmen do not do.*\n\nIn conclusion, the objective of an economist is not to draw pretty pictures\n\n?A person wlio \"does not understand\" is obviously anyone who happens to comment\non the discrepancy between theory and the facts of life.\n\n*'fhe president of one of America's largest corporations is convinced that his firm has\nalways shifted the income tax to its customers.\n\n* Marginalists seem to obtain a great deal of comfort from the fact that businessmen\noccasionally engage in marginal type thinking. For example, a firm manufacturing 9,500,000\nproducts might weigh the cost of sufficient advertising to sell another 500,000 products\nagainst the profit to be obtained from the additional sales, before deciding upon the ad-\nvertising expenditure. However, this is something quite different from setting prices and\nproduction schedules on such considerations.\n",

The present article is intended as a further contribution in\nthis direction, but it aims at synthesis as well as innovation.\n\nThe first section restates the static theory for an economy with a\ngovernment and with foreign trade, and in order to achieve consistency\nwith the social accounting approach makes a sharp distinction between\nfirms and households. This involves a clear separation of business sav-\ning from personal saving, a good example of useful *disaggregation.\"\nSection II analyses the effects on national income of changes in gov-\nernment spending and taxation without being confined to one type of\ntax and one type of spending. It is shown that the theorem that a\nbalanced budget-increase has a multiplier of unity is a very special\ncase, Section ITI, which uses a pure Stockholm School approach, demon-\nstrates how the relationship between saving and investment ex post\nand ex ante can only be understood if, consonantly with the division\nbetween households and firms, the markets for factors and for goods\nare distinguished. It is also shown that since saving (7.e., not-spending)\nis a derived concept, analysis in terms of spending is preferable because\nof its directness.\n",

Such\nrestrictions limit the number of \"buyers\" of higher education. Second, buyers\nare not usually asked to pay the full costs of an education. The effect of \"sales\"\nbelow cost is to increase numbers seeking a college education, though the net\neffect here is not so great as is commonly supposed (except in medical schools,\nwhere a tuition of about $700 per year is to be set against a cost per year of\nabout four times the tuition). For private institutions, the \"subsidies\" per year\namount to about $120 and for public institutions about $260, or an average of\nalmost $200. These sums are large in relation to educational costs (one-third\nof educational costs for private institutions, two-thirds for public), but much\nless relative to the $1,000 to $2,000 total cost in private IHL and a minimum of\n$1,000 for in-students at state IHL, plus in each instance the income foregone.\nCosts for nonresidents are less.! Education below cost is offered despite the fact\nthat a college graduate can look forward to an income of $100,000 more than\na noncollege graduate and a medical school graduate, $300,000 to $400,000\nmore.?\n\n* The author is professor of economics at Harvard University.\n\n!

                    "A Note on the Relationships of Bank Capital to the Lending Ability\nof the Commercial Banks\n\nThere has been published in recent months a spate of articles, pamphlets\nand monographs which have discussed the problems of bank capital.!' Most of\nthese take note of the very low ratio of capital accounts to assets or deposit\nliabilities.? In the samples which have come to my attention this is universally\nregarded as an unfavorable development from the standpoint of the longer-\nterm interests of the bankers, their customers and patrons. The authors point\nwith alarm to the fact that inadequate bank capital creates a condition inimi-\ncal to the maintenance of depositor confidence, to the ability of the banks to\nabsorb losses and still maintain their solvency\u2014and lastly, that inadequate\nbank capital curtails the ability of the banks to supply their business customers\nwith needed credit.\n\nIt is with this last \"function\" of bank capital that issue is here taken.\nJudged by the many variants of statements concerning the relationships of\nbank capital to the lending ability of the banks, the belief is apparently widely\nheld that the capital accounts constitute a source of loan-funds; that com-\nmercial banks loan out the savings of the banks' owners.\n\nSuch statements are common and are to be expected in the trade journals,\nbut when they appear in the more scholarly publications, or are authored by\nprofessional economists, they should not be allowed to go unchallenged. Four\nsuch statements have been selected for examination here.?\n\nIntroduction to Economics (New York, McGraw-Hill, 1930), Ch. 1x. Index numbers of\nthe elements of the equation of exchange for the United States for the period 1919-1947,\nquarterly and annually, are given in a paper, \"Index Numbers of the Elements of the\nEquation of Exchange,\" presented by the writer at a joint meeting of the Econometric\nSociety and the American Statistical Association, December 28, 1948 (available in mimeo-\ngraphed form; abstract published in Econometrica, Apr. 1949, XVII, 176).\n\n! The terms capital and capital accounts are used synonymously. As so used they include\nthe aggregate of capital stock, surplus, undivided profits and all net worth reserves.\n\n? Bank capital as a percentage of total liabilities has declined, with minor reversals of the\ntrend, for the past seventy-five years; from a percentage of approximately 35 in 1875 to\nabout 7 as of the present time. The series is characterized by a number of sharp declines\nin the capital ratios with connected plateaus of relative stability. In the 1880's, for example\nthe level was about 30 per cent as compared with about 20 per cent during the 1900-1910\nperiod, and about 12 per cent in the 1920's. In the course of World War II, the ratio fell\ndecisively below the 10 per cent level, traditionally regarded as a minimum for safety.\nSince the end of the war the capital ratios have tended upward, largely due to an expan-\nsion of bank capital accounts. This in turn is almost entirely attributable to retention of\nearnings.\n\n* The Increased Dependence of Business on the Commercial Banks, Bull.

It referred to the progressive acquisi-\ntion of wealth by the debtor class or enterpreneurs from creditors and rentiers that occurs\nin an inflationary period as a result of the decline in purchasing power of money.

Because\nthese preconditions were not even approximately realized during his lifetime,\nWicksell found it necessary to agitate for political reforms to make them pos-\nsible, and to support progressive income and property taxes. Although the\nlatter were not a perfect answer to his quest for justice in taxation, they tended\nat least to remove the worst injustices perpetrated under the tax systems of\nhis day. Those systems relied almost exclusively on indirect taxes enacted by\nparliamentarian majorities representing mainly the propertied classes because,\nuntil the close of World War I, the franchise was generally denied to the prop-\nertyless.\n\nWicksell's advocacy of the *confiscation principle\" of taxation to obtain the\ndesired revision of the distribution of wealth, was mainly intended (a) to elimi-\nnate all forms of rent from the category of private income and (b) to make\nrestitution for and prevent the recurrence of the \"capitalistic bolshevism\"^\nthat affects the distribution of wealth when the value of money is undergoing\nsubstantial change, especially during periods of inflation.\n\nTo the extent possible, Wicksell wanted to eliminate rent from private in-\ncome by taxation, because income of this type can presumably be taken from\nindividuals by the state without impairing their production incentives and\nwithout reducing the output of goods and services. Then the state in turn\nought to use the corresponding revenues for a secondary distribution of social\nreal income to all citizens in the form of an increasing variety and quantity\nof useful public or social services, especially in the fields of education and\npublic health, for expansion of these services would provide greater equality\nof opportunity for all citizens, and they would also contribute both directly and\nindirectly to an increase in general productivity.\n\nIn order to reinforce the foregoing long-run aim by appropriate short-run\naction, Wicksell held that the pervasive changes in the distribution of wealth\nwhich are a byproduct of significant changes in the value of money should, so\nfar as possible, be prevented.

Koontz offers no direct evidence at this point.\n\n\"There is, at any rate, still further room for question of his hypothesis: The\nimportance of having the high traffic density pairs of cities on a carrier's routes\ncannot be overestimated. Heavy travel brings favorable load factors, particu-\nlarly where aircraft can be scheduled nonstop between the high traffic generat-\ning pairs of cities.\"!* The exceptions to this proposition, as he indicates,\" are\nTWA, National, and Western, which carriers served the so-called productive\nmarkets but did not get their *prorated share\" as calculated in Table VI.!*\nThat failure to get the *prorated share\" is ascribed to equipment shortages,!?\nor in other words, a shortage on the supply side. If failure to get the *prorated\nshare\" of the market were due to such supply shortages, we would expect to\nfind such supply as was available to be fully utilized.

If output, measured in revenue ton miles, changes, one would\nexpect an alert management to be able to change its costs in the same direc-\ntion, although, of course, not necessarily proportionately. Thus if traffic de-\nclines, management, at least within the limits imposed by the indivisibility of\nthe productive unit, the aircraft, should succeed in making some cost reduc-\ntions; and likewise, above the minimum size, one would expect management to\nhave to increase its costs somewhat when traffic rises. On heavily travelled\nroutes the qualification of indivisibility may become unimportant.\n\nA leading trade paper, American Aviation, publishes monthly data on air\nline traffic and expenses, taken from reports of the carriers filed currently with\nthe Civil Aeronautics Board. During the period of relative price stability be-\ntween January 1947 and the outbreak of the Korean War, carriers! cost figures\ncan be used without the clear-cut necessity of a deflator, so that simple corre-\nlations of total operating expenses, in unadjusted dollars, and total revenue\nton miles can be made for individual carriers. As just indicated, one would\nexpect the well-managed carrier to show a positive relation between changes\nin revenue traffic and changes in total cost. For the period for which I have\nscrutinized the data, January 1947 to May 1950, twenty-nine observations or\ntwenty-eight intermonthly periods, tightly managed and profitable Eastern\nhad such a positive relation 20 times, and negative only 8. United had 17\npositive relations and 11 negative. TWA, least profitable of the large carriers,\nhad a positive only 13 times, and negative 15 times. Thus it was more often\nthan not the experience for TWA, at least during those 29 months, to spend\nmore when traffic declined and to cut expenditures when traffic rose. I think it\ncan be said that differences of this magnitude in managements' responses to\nchanged conditions may well be sufficient to account for the differences in\nprofitability, at least as between the particular carriers mentioned. That dif-\nference in profitability had been substantial.\n\nKoontz then suggests that load factor is the most important factor in finan-\ncial self-sufficiency, and that high load factors may be obtained by serving\nmajor markets.'* This may be another way of saying the aircraft in conven-\ntional use are too large for the market they serve at the existing price level.\nBut let us examine a moment the first proposition: that high load factors mean\nprofitability. Koontz' Table V, showing, for 1949 and 1950 for each trunk\ncarrier, actual load factor and net operating income adjusted by his method,\nthat is, by charging passenger fares to the mail load, is the basis for his asser-\ntion that improved load factors are the solution. He points out that most lines\ncould have operated profitably, even after mail pay adjustment, if they had\nhad the load factor of American, United, or TWA, about 58 per cent in 1949\nand a few points higher in 1950. But he ignores his figures which indicate that\nEastern operated profitably on a 46 per cent load factor in 1949; and 53 per\ncent in 1950. For 1949, the lines with higher load factors than Eastern's, but\nnevertheless with losses after mail pay adjustment, represent nine of the twelve\nother trunk carriers, though in 1950 only two were clearly inconsistent with\nhis position.

Koontz,\nhowever, regards 1949 as more normal than 1950,* even though most economic\ntime series show a dip for the earlier year. It is this evidence of poor financial\nperformance\u2014that is, what would have been poor financial performance if\npassenger fares had been paid for the carriage of mail\u2014that leads Koontz to\nsearch out its causes (other than his own assumptions) and make his policy\nrecommendations.\n\nThere follows a section in which Koontz demonstrates that there are not\nsubstantial differences in the average cost per available ton mile of the sixteen\ncarriers.? Available ton miles represent total transport capacity, some of which\nwill be utilized, and some left to perish through underutilization. Presumably,\nhowever, air line management is producing revenue transportation rather than\npotential transportation, so that a more relevant calculation might have been\naverage cost per revenue ton mile. But because the average cost per available\nton mile does not show great variations between carriers, Koontz concludes\nthat economies of scale are absent, although he points out later that it is\nvariations in the load factor!? which essentially account for the less favorable\nearnings in the commercial market of the smaller carriers.!* This implies that\nperhaps a smaller proportion of seats are occupied on the smaller lines, which\nstill further implies that possibly the unit is too large. I submit that the match-\ning of the size of the productive unit, in this case the plane, to the size of the\nmarket, is one of the problems generally comprehended among those of econo-\nmies of scale. It is also true, and the industry has shown considerable concern\nthereon, that no small modern aircraft, suitable to lightly trafficked routes, are\navailable from American manufacturers. Smaller air lines thus are largely\nforced to employ units larger than can be filled by their traffic. But no amount\nof corporate merger will solve the technical problem of providing small, fast,\nand cheap aircraft for thinly trafficked routes.\n\nKoontz then turns to variations in the effectiveness of management as a\npossible explanation for the variations of profits between carriers. He explains\nthe profitability of Eastern and American as resulting, in part, from the offer-\ning of a high volume of frequently scheduled service.'? If the profits of these\ntwo carriers are due to the size of their output, this hardly seems consistent\nwith his statement on the preceding page: When only the nine largest carriers\nare considered, evidence of any economies of scale virtually disappears.\"!*\n\nKoontz indicates that although there are wide differences in managerial\neffectiveness, such differences are insufficient to explain the differences in\nprofitability. While that may sometimes be true, there may be other cases in\nwhich differences in managerial ability are important. For example, a simple\ntest of managerial ability would seem to be its response to changes in the\n\n* Review, p. 108.\n\n? Review, pp. 108-14; Jouraal, pp. 133-40.\n\n?

The passenger\nservice is sold in a mass market, in which, although there is often but one\nseller of the air line service, there is a broad group of buyers who choose air\nservice as only one of several competing means of transport. In such a market,\nconventional pricing concepts are applicable. Mail, however, is transported\nunder conditions approaching those of bilateral monopoly, with a single buyer\nof the service, the Post Office, and often a single seller, the air line serving the\npair of cities involved. Nor is there even any relation between the postage\nrates which Congress establishes for the Post Office to charge the users of the\nair mail service and the rates which the Civil Aeronautics Board establishes\nfor the Post Office to pay for the carriage of its mail. The price elasticity of\ndemand for the carriage of air mail may well be zero. It is hard for me to see\nwhy passenger rates, an average of coach and first-class fares in continually\nvariable proportions, even assuming that existing passenger fares represent\noptimum pricing in the various passenger markets being served, should some-\nhow represent a norm for mail rates, which would appear to be a completely\ndifferent market. In a bilateral monopoly situation, such as the relation be-\ntween the Post Office and the air lines, there will be no market price in the\nusual sense, and price will be determined by bargaining.

In each case a parallel valuation in terms of Soviet prices of 1926-27\nis given, and the final structure of national income, as it emerges from Jasny's\ncalculations, is entirely based on these prices.\n\nSerious as this error may be, it does not, I think, materially affect the valid-\nity or relevance of my observations concerning the danger of using *esoteric\"\nprice structures in Soviet national income analysis.

First is the purpose of measurement,\nsecond is the process by which one measures something, z.e., assigns\nnumerical values to some aspect of an entity, and the third is the\narbitrariness, or uniqueness, of the set of numerical values inherent\nin the purpose and process. In the first part of this paper we briefly\nexplore the idea of arbitrariness or uniqueness of numbers assigned by\na measurement process. In Part II we state some purposes of utility\nmeasurement. In Part III we examine a method of measuring utility,\nthe purpose of the measurement and the extent to which the measure-\nment is unique.

Ta-Chung\nand Ching-Gwan Chang argue that the price level should be introduced into\nthe consumption and investment equations. In justification of this it is argued\nthat, though this procedure gives *about an equally good\" fit for the prewar\nperiod it gives a better fit for the three postwar years for which data are\navailable.\n\nThis argument, however, is open to the following criticism. Both the con-\nsumption equations, the one using and the other ignoring the price term,\nunderestimate the actual data for the postwar years; this is only as it should\nbe, for during this period the data were influenced by a special factor, the\npent-up war demand. In order to derive the true relationship, one would have\nto subtract this factor from the actual data, and since we do not know how\nlarge this factor is, we cannot say that the equation coming closer to the actual\ndata (in a linear way only, for there are points of inflexion in neither the\ndata nor the estimating equations for these years) gives a better indication of\nthe true relationship. This consideration is enhanced by the fact that a small\ndifference in the estimation of the pent-up demand would destroy the signifi-\ncance of the price term, for the differences between the equation using the\nprice term and the equation ignoring it are 1/10, 1/8 and 1/3 (for 1946, 1947\nand 1948 respectively) of the pent-up demand as measured by the difference\nbetween the actual data and the better fitting of the two equations. Thus the\nonly evidence to show that the equation using the price term is superior is that\nof 1948, when the pent-up demand must have been of less importance than in\nthe two preceding years. To argue from the evidence of one year is obviously\nmost tenuous. \u00c0 similar consideration throws grave doubt upon the estimated\nvalue of the price parameter, the calculated value of the price elasticity and\nalso on the introduction of a price term in the investment equation.\n\n'THoMAs Mavzn*\n* The author is an economic analyst in the office of the chief economist, Bureau of\n\nMines.

The authors\nsuggest that \"the failure of the postwar investment expenditures to come up\nto the levels estimated from the prewar investment function may perhaps be\nexplained partially by the feeling of uncertainty which existed in the minds of\nthe entrepreneurs as regards the possible course of the developments of the\nAmerican economy\" (p. 574). The hypothesis that the depressing effect of\n*uncertainty\" on investment was \"greater\" during three years of uninter-\nrupted high level prosperity (with a backlog of investment demand due to\nwartime disinvestment in many lines) than during the most depressed decade\nin U.S. history seems, at best, novel.\n",

The Investment Function\n\nThe stated rationale of the Liu-Chang investment function (I \u2014 dY -- eF\n-F i, where d, e, and i are parameters) is that income is a measure of the\n\"evel of economic activities which generate demands for capital goods,\" while\ncorporate profits after taxes \"indicate the magnitude of the incentive for\nactually making the investment at a given level of demand\" (p. 568).\n\nNote that F\u2014corporate profits after taxes\u2014is considered exogenous. This\nin itself makes prediction on the basis of the function impossible, in that\ncurrent corporate profits are obviously related to the level of current income.\nMore important (given the authors' limited aims), a high degree of colline-\narity between Y and F renders the two parameters *e\" and \"d\" virtually\nmeaningless.\n\nIt is difficult to find justification for this sort of an investment function. The\nfact that no lags are intrinsic to annual data does not make the function any\nmore useful: no meaningful hypothesis as to the behavior of the individual\ninvestor is being tested.\n\nThe dismissal of the \"so-called 'acceleration principle! \" for lack of any\nevidence (p. 568), seems somewhat rash. Presumably Liu and Chang were\n\n*T am fully cognizant of the difficulties these distinctions involve, but they are not ot\nessence in the present argument.\n\n?'

There is a good fit between C and Y, hence we\nhave \u00a3he (?) consumption function. Their defense against criticism on this\ncount is based on calculations indicating that disposable income is a good\nlinear function of gross national product and that: \"projections from the\nrelation between the two during the prewar decade yield figures for postwar\n*disposable income! extremely close to the actual figures\" (p. 570).\n\nIf the \"institutional\" relationship between Y4 and Y has not changed as\nbetween prewar and postwar, it no doubt follows that an apparent re-establish-\nment of the prewar (derived) relationship between C and Y is good evidence\nthat the behavioristic relationship between C and Y, is the same as before the\nwar. It is important to note, however, that the usefulness of the Liu-Chang\nstudy is severely limited, a fact not sufficiently emphasized by their own\narticle. Their so-called consumption function cannot be used either for pre-\ndiction or for testing hypotheses of consumer behavior. It is not invariant with\nrespect to changes in the Y vs. Y, relationship, hence variations in tax struc-\nture, transfers, corporate savings, etc., will invalidate it.\n\nThe only positive justification the authors provide for the use of VY is that\nit simplifies the system.

Unlike the use of lags, the use of Y instead of Y, is not just a simpli-\nfication. The function, as it stands, does not provide us with a testable hy-\npothesis of behavior.\n\nThere are three possible methods of approach to \"the\" consumption func-\ntion:\n\n1.

But where the two periods under consideration differ in P as much as do the\npostwar and prewar, we must be wary of such approximations.\n\n\"It could be argued that implicit in the exclusive use of current magnitudes is a pre-\nsumption that the elasticity of expectations is unity; that in fact people expect the\nparameters relevant to their decisions not to change.

Their first argument, that a function based on *money illusion\" better\nconforms to theory than one which relates real consumption to real income, is\nambiguous. What are the \"theoretical grounds\" on which we should expect\nthe absolute price level to play a part in consumption decisions? The authors\ndo not specify. If narrowly defined, the use of the term *money illusion\" would\nindicate that they are suggesting \"irrationality\"? on the part of consumers.\nYet, since the implication that a hypothesis of systematic \"irrationality\" is\nsubject to \u00a3eoretical proof is patently unacceptable, it is more likely that Liu\nand Chang are thinking in terms of \"rationality\" in a dynamic world. Either\ninelastic price expectations or '\"Pigou effects\" could induce \"rational\" be-\nhavior which would appear (to an observer with a static frame of reference)\nlike money-illusion \"irrationality.\"*\n\nBy accepting the importance of such dynamic effects, however, the authors\nundermine the logical foundations of their own function. If current prices and\nincomes are the sole variables relevant to consumption decisions, then the\nform of the consumption function cannot be governed by tacit consideration\nof other variables (expectations, nonequity assets, etc.).* If prices and in-\ncomes are really the only things that belong on the right-hand side, then it\nfollows that only \"irrational\" behavior can validate an undeflated function.\nNo empirical evidence is cited in favor of such \"irrationality\" and I, for one,\nam loath to give up the assumption of \"*rationality\" for a model based on\nsystematic \"irrationality.\"\n\nThe authors! second argument, that the indices available for deflation are\nof tenuous applicability, though correct in itself, is irrelevant. The technical\nfaults of currently used deflating procedures provide excellent reason for\ncautious interpretation of so-called \"real\" figures: they do not validate unde-\nflated figures.\n\nSuffice it to conclude:* (1) that most prewar studies suggest that deflated\n\n*'[rrational\" is a poor word for the intended concept but its analogous place in the\nvocabulary of price theory and the lack of an obvious substitute perhaps justify its use.\nNote, however, that it must be very narrowly defined as implying nonmaximizing behavior\nin terms of a specified frame of reference.

Further, the inflow of foreign capital\nduring the first part of this period would raise the optimum rate of growth for\nthat period.

Ta-Chung\nand Ching-Gwan Chang argue that the price level should be introduced into\nthe consumption and investment equations. In justification of this it is argued\nthat, though this procedure gives *about an equally good\" fit for the prewar\nperiod it gives a better fit for the three postwar years for which data are\navailable.\n\nThis argument, however, is open to the following criticism. Both the con-\nsumption equations, the one using and the other ignoring the price term,\nunderestimate the actual data for the postwar years; this is only as it should\nbe, for during this period the data were influenced by a special factor, the\npent-up war demand. In order to derive the true relationship, one would have\nto subtract this factor from the actual data, and since we do not know how\nlarge this factor is, we cannot say that the equation coming closer to the actual\ndata (in a linear way only, for there are points of inflexion in neither the\ndata nor the estimating equations for these years) gives a better indication of\nthe true relationship. This consideration is enhanced by the fact that a small\ndifference in the estimation of the pent-up demand would destroy the signifi-\ncance of the price term, for the differences between the equation using the\nprice term and the equation ignoring it are 1/10, 1/8 and 1/3 (for 1946, 1947\nand 1948 respectively) of the pent-up demand as measured by the difference\nbetween the actual data and the better fitting of the two equations. Thus the\nonly evidence to show that the equation using the price term is superior is that\nof 1948, when the pent-up demand must have been of less importance than in\nthe two preceding years. To argue from the evidence of one year is obviously\nmost tenuous. \u00c0 similar consideration throws grave doubt upon the estimated\nvalue of the price parameter, the calculated value of the price elasticity and\nalso on the introduction of a price term in the investment equation.\n\n'THoMAs Mavzn*\n* The author is an economic analyst in the office of the chief economist, Bureau of\n\nMines.

Since these re-enumerations help to empha-\nsize the professed narrow scope and the highly tentative nature of the paper,\n\nthey are entirely welcome.\n\"qT'u fO.

                    "actual size of *pent-up demands,\" we can not say that the equation coming\ncloser to the actual data (;.e., equation 1) is a better indication of the con-\nsumption function than equation 4 when the influences of the *pent-up de-\nmands\" are removed from the relationship. An assumption implicit in the\noriginal paper is of course that the liquidation of *pent-up demands\" was\nsomewhat smaller than the total postwar *excesses\" in consumption, a hypoth-\nesis admittedly impossible to establish by any statistical effort at the present\ntime.\n\nIn the discussion of the consumption function in Sections I and II in Mr.\nBator's comments, he suggests that there are three possible grounds on which\nthe absolute price level might be introduced into the consumption function:\ninelastic price expectations, the *Pigou effects\" and \"irrationality\" on the part\nof the consumers. Since he believes that \"the implication that a hypothesis of\nsystematic \"irrationality' is subject to theoretical proof* is patently unaccept-\nable,\" he attributes the introduction of the price level into our equation (1) to\nthe first two factors and then proceeds to criticise the equation on this basis.\nThe \"money illusion\" implied in equation (1), however, is of the \"irrational\"\ntype.? The criticism, therefore, is not relevant.\n\nBator believes that *no meaningful hypothesis as to the behavior of the\nindividual investor is being tested\" in connection with our investment func-\ntion, equation 2, which has gross product and profits after taxes as independ-\nent variables. If profit incentive as an explanatory variable for investment \"is\nnot grounded on a micro-economic hypothesis,\" one is at a loss to find another\nthat is.? A serious omission occurred in the original paper in not having pointed\nout profits as a major source of supply of capital for investment? which would\nfurther reinforce the desirability of introducing profits as an independent\nvariable in the function. The authors may perhaps be excused for their \"*dis-\nmissal\" of the \"so-called 'acceleration principle,' \" as any statistica] attempt\nto find the \"acceleration principle\" in a rigid, quantitative form, not neces-\nsarily linear and for whatever time-unit (annual, quarterly, etc.), is a dead\nanimal unworthy of revival. On the other hand, the level of output must have\ninfluences on the demand for investment as a result of a host of reasons,? of\nwhich the \"acceleration principle\" is but one underlying consideration. It is\nof course extremely difficult to determine on a friori grounds the net result of\n\n* Equation (1) represents of course an empirical attempt to see whether \"money illusion\"\nexisted.\n\n5'The *money income illusion\" is of the \"irrational\" type, as a proportional fall in both\nincome and price will leave real income unchanged but will increase the real value of\nrnoney holdings.\n\n* Bator also criticizes our investment function on the ground that we failed to \"assign\na role to expectations (directly, or via lags, rates of change, etc., indirectly).\" One has yet\nto invent a method by which expectations can be included in a statistical function directly.\nIndirectly speaking, it is not necessarily true that expectations must be associated with\nlags or rates of change. Expectations can be formed on the basis of current values alone.\n\n? See the discussion of this point in S. C. Tsiang, \"Accelerator, Theory of the Firm and\nthe Business Cycle,\" Quart. Jour. Econ.

Our equa-\ntion yields money income illusion\" but *money price illusion in reverse\";\nwhereas any equation which gives *\u00abmoney price illusion\" would yield *money\nincome illusion in reverse.\" There is little doubt that people know what their\nincomes and prices are in money terms better than in real terms;? hence both\ntypes of illusion could exist.\n\nNo claim was made in the original paper that the \"amount\" of *money\nillusion\" implied in equation (1) is large; at the same time, no test of its\nstatistical significance was made. Whether \"money illusion\" existed signifi-\ncantly in the statistical sense depends entirely upon whether the constant term\nin equation (1), i.e., \u2014 3.06, is significantly different from zero. The standard\nerror of that constant is 1.66 which, for eight degrees of freedom, means\nroughly one chance in twelve that a constant term as large as 3.06 (in absolute\nvalue) or larger would be obtained in the absence of a \"money illusion.\" This\nis not clearly statistically significant, but the probability is small enough to be\nsuggestive.\n\nWhether on the basis of our equation (1) or (4), the estimated consumption\nfigures were lower than the actual values in postwar years. It must for the\ntime being remain a matter of personal opinion how much of these \"*excesses\"\nof actual over estimated values represented a more or less permanent\" upward\nshift of the consumption function on account of the great increase in the\nliquidity of the individuals, as Means seems to believe, and how much was due\nto the liquidation of *pent-up demands.\" The absence of a continuous \"'taper-\ning off? tendency in the *excesses\" obtained from equation (1) would tend to\ncast doubt, as pointed out by both Means and Mayer, on the interpretation of\nthese *excesses\" as reflecting the liquidation of \"pent-up demands\"; even\nthough it is difficult to believe, on a riori grounds, that the fulfillment of\nsuch demands did not play a r\u00f3le in postwar consumption. In any case, the\nlack of any discussion of the liquidity factor was undoubtedly a serious error\nof omission in the original paper.\n\nThe essence of Mr. Mayer's criticism is that, since we do not know the\n\n* The \"absurd\" result obtainable from equation (1) mentioned by Means (7.e., consumers\nwould \"stop spending entirely if the price level were sufficiently low\") is interesting but\nunimportant; as all statistical functions, when carried far beyond their relevant ranges,\nare likely to yield economically absurd results.\n\n*'This was one of the reasons why the consumption function in the original paper was\nset up in money values, instead of in real terms.\n",
