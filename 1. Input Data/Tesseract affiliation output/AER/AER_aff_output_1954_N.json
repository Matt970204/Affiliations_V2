In connection with his argument that if exchange\nrates were set free to find their equilibrium levels and countries pursued\ninternal stabilization policies, balances of payments would be quickly\nequilibrated without great changes in the terms of trade, Haberler re-\nfers to the \"burdens\" of such adjustments. He refers to a primary bur-\nden, which arises from the fact that an import surplus provides a coun-\ntry with a net amount of goods available for domestic use in excess of\nits own production. If we use the term standard of living to refer to the\nreal amount of goods available for domestic use (including consumption,\ninvestment, and the provision of government services), the primary\nburden will be a reduction in the standard of living by an amount equal\nto the real deficit in the balance of payments. However, the depreciation?\nof the exchange that would be involved in adjusting the balance of pay-\nments would ordinarily affect the country's terms of trade, and this\nchange in the terms of trade would also affect the country's standard of\nliving. Exchange depreciation may either worsen or improve a country's\nterms of trade. If it worsens the terms of trade, there will be a secondary\nburden in terms of reduced standard of living to be added to the primary\nburden mentioned above. On the other hand, if depreciation improves\nthe terms of trade, there will be a secondary benefit which will at least\npartially offset the primary burden.\n\n\"These ideas can perhaps be made clearer by means of a simple numer-\n\n* The author is assistant professor of economics at the University of Virginia.\n\n1 G.

Accordingly, many have\nlooked upon the recent (apparent) acceleration in the rate of technological\nchange as a harbinger of stable full employment, or at least as an important\nbulwark against future depression. Presumably this opinion rests on either or\nboth of two assumptions: (1) that technological change increases the demand\nfor capital, or (2) that it raises the consumption function.\n\nThat rapid technological change is a favorable factor in the economic out-\nlook is a recurrent theme in the Economic Report of the President for 1954.\nThis report states, for example (p. 61): *Research and development activities\nof industry, nonprofit institutions and Government are steadily enlarging the\nopportunities for new investment.\" This argument is buttressed by a special\nappendix presenting estimates of expenditures for research and development\nin recent years.

But because\nall slums cannot be cleared out at once or because the problems of the aged\nand of those with subnormal incomes cannot be solved at once, it does not\nfollow that a frontal attack should not be made on the financing and organiza-\ntion of medicine. I make this point because the AMA has so often contended\nthat the road to improved health lies in better housing, higher incomes, better\nnutrition, etc.; in their view, improvements in these directions are needed,\nnot reforms in the methods of organizing and financing of medicine. I am\nafraid that Ginzberg's presentation implies an agreement with the AMA\nposition.\n\nWhat is wrong with medicine is inadequacy of resources; their maldistribu-\ntion; the inadequate mechanisms for pooling resources on an insurance prin-\nciple; the excessive weight given to payment on the fees principle, with un-\nfortunate delays in seeking help; the shortages of important personnel and\nfacilities. It is possible to channel more resources into medicine and achieve a\nbetter distribution, and probably with a resultant rise of income several times\nthe additional costs. It is no more anti-free enterprise to use the taxing power\nto cut down the consumption of tobacco and alcohol in order to increase the\nconsumption of medicine (as the British have done) than it is anti-free enter-\nprise to use the general property tax to finance the major part of a $7 billion\neducational bill. How much would we be spending on elementary and high\nschool education today if the same organized pressures had prevailed a century\nago in education as now prevail in medicine to keep down expenditures both\npublic and private?\n\nWhat every economist should know about medicine is that at our standard\nof living we ought to spend more money on medicine and ought to obtain an\nimproved distribution.

The opposition of medical societies, such as\nthe New York State Medical Society, expressed both in state legislation,\nwhich frequently makes the formation of such plans impossible, and in perse-\ncution of physician-members is in no small part the explanation of the snail's\npace at which comprehensive prepayment plans have advanced.\n\nShort of the solution of compulsory national health insurance (NHI), the\nacceptable way out is prepayment comprehensive health insurance. This is the\ncrucial conclusion of the Magnuson Committee. (The Ives-Flanders Bill in\nthe Senate, which the sponsors recently withdrew under pressure from the\nadministration, embodied provisions similar to those recommended by the\nMagnuson Committee.) But financial subsidies are needed: especially for\ninitial organizing expenses, construction of health centers, and direct subsi-\ndies to various comprehensive plans approved by the states, in order to make\npossible rates low enough for most people to join, or else subsidies to indi-\nviduals with low incomes which would make possible their participation. This\nis the approach of the Commission.\n\nComprehensive plans seem to the writer a healthy compromise between\nNHI, so effectively disposed of by the AMA for the time being, and /aissez-\nfaire in medicine. Ginzberg is critical of the Commission for suggesting an\noutlay of $750 million by the federal government (and a similar one for state\ngovernments) to expedite a comprehensive insurance program. In fact,\nthroughout his review Ginzberg seems greatly concerned over the financial\ncosts to government of all facets of medical costs. Yet may not one contend\nthat a $367 billion economy that can reduce taxes by 10 to 13 billion dollars\ncan also afford an ultimate increase of $1 billion for medicine and education?\n\nIndeed an outlay of $1.5 billion (one-half to be paid by federal govern-\nment) to stimulate the growth of comprehensive insurance may not solve all\nthe problems, as Ginzberg contends\u2014and there is need for allowing time for\nfacilities to grow. Perhaps the Commission merits criticism for urging too rapid\na development of comprehensive insurance. In an independent estimate which\nI presented to the Senate Labor Committee on April 22, 1954 in its hearings\non the Eisenhower Health Program, I proposed a governmental outlay of\n$2,150 million (shared by federal, state, and local governments), this figure\nto be reached only after ten years. Part of the costs of comprehensive insur-\nance would be met by employers and employees through social security con-\ntributions, with government subsidies of $100 for incomes below $1,000 and\ndeclining to $20 for incomes above $4,000. This would start us well on our\nway towards an adequate program. This would not wholly solve the problems\nof chronic illness, though the suggested added grants by the federal govern-\nment would help greatly.

Despite the phenomenal rise of Blue Cross and Blue\nShield, prepayment health insurance is still a relatively small factor in Ameri-\ncan medicine: all prepayment plans provide but $1.5 billion of the more than\n$10 billion of private costs of medicine. Group practice is still in a primitive\nstate. The crucial issue is, why is this so?\n\nThe reviewer of the Magnuson report contended that group medicine has\nmade so little progress primarily not because of the opposition of medical\nsocieties and lack of finance but because American physicians are individual-\nists and do not like group practice. I am unable to accept this interpretation.\nThe medical societies ruthlessly fight prepayment programs, in part because\nthey believe that the net effect is likely to be reduced revenues for the profes-\nsion. Indeed, they support Blue Cross, in part because the net effect is to\nchannel more money into medicine; but Blue Shield insurance is restricted to\nlow or moderate income groups. In other words, the doctors are given the\nfreedom to charge what the tra\u00edfic will bear in the case of patients with\nincomes above, say, $5,000, and are given additional protection in the case of\npatients with lower incomes through insurance and a spreading practice of\ninflating charges when the insurance agency pays the bill or a major part of\nit. Indeed Ginzberg is right when he says that doctors want independence.\nBut every producer wants freedom from control by the consumer. Medicine\nis surely a unique market in that the consumer is denied any control over the\nservice and price, and doctors are allowed to organize in professional societies\nwhich, to some extent, determine pricing and service practices. Group medi-\ncine is in part an attempt to protect the consumer against one-sided control\nof the market. The spectacle of a New York physician, head of a unit of the\nHealth Insurance Plan of New York, being persecuted by the New York\nMedical Society for advertising for new members to join this plan, is distress-\ning.\n\nIt is a striking fact that comprehensive prepayment insurance covers but\n3 per cent of the population; and there are few of these plans that allow free\nentry. Why have they not made more progress? Ginzberg does not believe that\nopposition of medical societies is a decisive factor. Yet the New York Times\nand Herald Tribune each year publish vigorous attacks by the societies on\nthe famous Health Insurance Plan of New York, a comprehensive plan with\n400,000 members.'? This plan has survived so far in part because of the help\n\n71 See, for example, various statements before the Wolverton Committee, Congressional\nRecord, App., Jan. 20, 1954, pp. A368, 371. For example, in Michigan one group that\nraised its fees in order to get full coverage for surgical expenses found that one result\nwas an average charge by the surgeon of $20 more per identical service rendered than for\nmembers of another group that did not raise its fees. The surgeon seemed to increase his\ncharge merely because the insured was more nearly covered.\n\n\"* See editorials in the New York Herald Tribune, January 16, 1954 and May 16, 1954,\nand New York Times, May 15, 1954 in reply to attacks made by medical societies. \"County\nmedical societies ought not to have the power to prevent a legitimate health insurance plan\nfrom telling its story through advertisements, or from carrying on any ethical activities\"\n\n(Herald Tribune, January 16, 1954). After defending fee-splitting, the New York State\nMedical Society voted against the practice of paying salaries to doctors *and voted changes\nin the code of medical ethics aimed directly at the destruction of a vast number of voluntary\nprepayment medical care plans\" (ibid., May 16, 1954).\n",

But performance under this act depends upon appropria-\ntions; and the present administration appropriated $50 million for 1954-55.\nThe Connnission itself would add but $77 million per year to the construction\nprogram as of 1952 (Vol. I, p. 79). I can only conclude that Ginzberg's figures\nare highly inflated\u2014even if, despite a stabilization of prices since March 1951,\nwe allow for an inflation of construction costs of 5 to 10 per cent since 1949-\n50. (Actually construction costs were stabilized in 1951 and 1952 and hos-\npital construction costs in 1951 were 7 per cent in excess of those for 1948-\n50.)*\n\nI cannot leave this discussion of hospitals without commenting on another\nof Ginzberg's statements. Again, I do not find support for this generalization:\n\"Further, since the recent advances in medicine have given most persons a\ngood chance of staying out of hospitals from the time they are born until\nthey begin to undergo the decrepitude which accompanies senescence\u2014uwith\nthe possible exception of a day or two for a tonsillectomy or a week or so\nfor an appendectomy\u2014the exclusion of patients with long-term illness from a\nplan for financing health involves a major restriction. Every general hospital\nin the country is aware of the fact that it is being transformed from an insti-\ntution concerned with the treatment of acute conditions to one primarily con-\ncerned with caring for the multiple complaints of the aged\" (p. 117). In this\nconnection, note the following:\n\n1. From 1935 to 1952, there was *'a decrease in the length of patient stay\nby 32 per cent in non-federal hospitals.\"* Is this consistent with the increased\nand almost exclusive use of hospitals for chronic illness?\n\n2. In 1951, 89 per cent of total beds were in short-term hospitals and 11 per\ncent in long-term hospitals, with average length of stay being 8.3 and 114\ndays, respectively.\"\n\n3. **On the basis of diagnosis, chronic diseases account for probably 25 to\n50 per cent of the days of hospitalization of all general hospitals, 7.e., exclu-\nsive of mental and tuberculosis hospitals.\"*\n\n4. How much care for chronic long-term patients is provided by short-term\ngeneral hospitals is difficult to say. Under the Blue Cross Plan in 1948, 2.8\nper cent of the cases paid for had a stay of 30 days or longer; these cases\nentailed 16.4 per cent of the total days of care paid for by the plan.? Other\nstudies of Blue Cross suggest that chronic diseases were responsible for 28 to\n34 per cent of all hospital days.!?\n\nPerhaps my main differences with Ginzberg revolve around the problems of\n\n* Survey of Current Business and Magnuson Report, Vol. IV, p. 274.\n\n* Financing Hospital Care in the United States: Recommendations of the Commission\non Financing of Hospital Care (Chicago, Ill., 1954), p. 37.

In\nfact, hospital building under the Hill-Burton Act over several years has not\nreduced the deficiency. The original deficiency under the Hill-Burton formula\nwas 800,000 beds with existing capacity at 1 million: the President's undocu-\nmented estimate in 1954 was 600,000; the actual provision over several years\nof building under the Hill-Burton formula has been about 100,000 with clos-\ning of federal hospitals, obsolescence and growth of population more than\noffsetting this gain of 100,000. In fact, total beds were down from 1,739,000\nin 1945 to 1,530,000 in 1951, with the decline of government beds exceeding\nthe total decline.* Deficiencies are especially serious for mental and chronic\nillnesses. In the case of the latter, for example, the deficincy at the end of the\nwar was almost 3 times the current capacity; but in June 1952 the deficiency\nwas 6 times current capacity. Chronic beds accounted for more than 30 per\ncent of the total deficiency and yet accounted for but 4 per cent of the projects\n(dollar value) under the Hill-Burton Act until June 1952.\n\nGinzberg's estimates of costs of construction of hospitals seem very high.\nHe estimates the cost of the Commission program for construction of general\nhospitals at $4.5 billion, and of mental hospitals at $5 billion. But on the\nbasis of the costs of construction under the Hill-Burton program (this program\nfinanced construction beginning in 1948), I obtain the following (Vol. IV,\np. 279):\n\nMocunuu P. m.s] fF.\n",

My criticism of the Commission would be not that they\nexaggerate the shortage but that they underestimate it. It is of some relevance\nthat there were substantially fewer physicians in relation to population in\n1950 than in 1900 or 1850 and a smaller number (absolute) graduating from\nall medical schools in 1950 than in 1905. Surely the large rise of physicians'\nincomes also points to shortages of personnel.'\n\nOn the issue of subsidies to medical education as a means of increasing the\nsupply of physicians, Ginzberg is critical of the Commission for not dealing\nwith the financial problems of the Institutions of Higher Learning (IHL).\nBut as one who served on the financial panel of the Commission and also\nsummarized for the Commission the discussion of what I thought was an\nexcellent two-day seminar by leading experts on financial problems, I am sure\nthat the Commission was aware of the problems of the IHL. Thus, Dr. Ward\nDarley, dean of the medical school and vice-president of the University of\nColorado, pointed out to the Commission orally and in writing that transfers\nto medical schools from university funds had risen from 7 to 34 per cent of\nmedical school income over a period of eight years. \"This is creating serious\nfinancial problems for many universities\" (Vol. IV, p. 94). Ginzberg also\ncontends that there are inadequate applicants for medical schools, in part\nbecause the peak of veterans! enrollment has been reached. But he surely\nmust be aware that in 1954 we reach the minimum of numbers in the college-\nage group and by 1960 there will be 20 per cent additional population of\ncollege age, and by 1970 about 70 per cent additional. Responsible estimates\nput IHL enrollment at 3 to 4 million by 1970 as against 2 million currently.?\n\nGinzberg also writes: *Nor did the Commission sense that an increasing\nnumber of deans of medical schools would be claiming in 1953 that they were\nfacing a shortage of promising applicants\" (p. 109). Aside from the relevance\nof the fact that increasing college enrollments are to be anticipated, I refer\nagain to a statement by Darley: *Most medical educators believe that if\nsufficient funds for all medical schools could be made available, continuing\nincreases in their enrollments, consistent with high quality education will\nrapidly catch up with the need. . . .\" (Vol. III, p. 98).\n\nPerhaps, as Ginzberg contends, a $100 million subsidy will not solve the\nproblem of the medical schools. But as long as it costs $3,000 per year to\neducate a medical student who pays about $500, the medical schools are going\nto find expansion most difficult. A subsidy of $1,000 per new (additional)\nstudent and $500 for existing enrollment, which was provided in a Congres-\nsional bill that came close to passage, would help greatly.

                    "What Every Economist Should Know about\nHealth and Medicine: Comment\n\nIn the March 1954 issue of the American Economic Review, Professor Eli\nGinzberg, in a review article entitled *What Every Economist Should Know\nabout Health and Medicine,\" assesses the Magnuson Report (Building\nAmerica's Health, A Report to the President by the President's Commission\non the Health Needs of the Nation, Washington, 1953). Since the Magnuson\nvolumes are undoubtedly the most important study of the financing and\norganization of medicine since the famous reports of the Committee on the\nCosts of Medical Care more than twenty years ago, it might be well to\npresent to economists another version of What Every Economist Should\nKnow about Medicine.\"\n\nLet me say at the outset that Ginzberg makes many wise and penetrating\nremarks about the economics of medicine and about the Report under discus-\nsion. As Ginzberg contends, there is little use of pumping more money into\nmedicine unless an attack on shortages of personnel, equipment, and facilities\nis also made. Otherwise the effect is likely to be inflation rather than improve-\nment of service. But this is a principle well known in Washington. Even in\nthe presentation of its program of National Health Insurance (NHI) the\nTruman administration time and again stressed the need of limiting addi-\ntional demands on services to those markets where they were equal to the\nstrain. No one conversant with recent British experience could be blind to\nthe danger of a hasty expansion of services offered not offset by an adequate\nprovision of future supplies. Nor was the Commission blind to this considera-\ntion.\n\nGinzberg raises questions concerning the shortage of personnel, an issue on\nwhich the Commission is eloquent. The application of doctor-population ratios\nin rich states to the nation necessarily reveals a shortage of physicians. This\napproach, credited to the Commission, is faulty, as Ginzberg contends.\n(Though this is not the only approach used\u2014see Vol. I, p. 13.) Ginzberg\nreally seems to believe that there is no shortage of physicians. He should\ncompare each of the following variables for 1900 and 1950: the supply of\ndoctors, the number of annual medical graduates, per capita national income,\npopulation, the demands put upon the medical profession by increasing births\nand the proportion of the aged in the population, the additional needs related\nto improved financing and organization, the requirements (present and\nprospective) set by the cold war, the scarcities of psychiatrists and the in-\ncreased need for them, the increased complexities of medicine, the maldistri-\nbution of personnel both geographically and occupationally (inclusive of an\nexcessive number of specialists relative to practitioners). Against these factors\nall pointing to additional needs (often unmet because of financial obstacles to\nseeking medical care), we can only weigh the improved quality of the doctor,\nthe greater ease of getting around, and, as the American Medical Association\nso frequently points out, improved teamwork. (Nurses complain bitterly, how-\never, of the unwillingness of physicians to allow them to assume responsibili-\nties of which they are capable.) On the issue of teamwork, it might be said\n",

The causes of trade\nusually mentioned are differences between the two countries in their\nnatural resources, in the tastes and abilities of their populations, and\nin their capital stocks. But it is obvious that the last of these three is of\na very different order of permanence from that of the other two. The\nsupply of land may usually be taken as fixed for all time, and, so far as\nthe economist is concerned, a datum. Population changes and differences\nin the rates of change between two countries will have profound effects\non trade, but these variations are nowadays also taken to be, at least\nin some measure, independent of economic processes. But accumulation\nis a purely economic sequence, and the student of trade who neglects\nit is neglecting part of his subject. The ideal dynamic theory of trade\nwould no doubt cope with both population change and changes in the\ncapital stock simultaneously. But can it be doubted that such a theory\nwould be of a most advanced and difficult kind, and that the simpler\nstarting point is accumulation without population change?\n\nWhat follows is an attempt to construct an extremely simple dynamic\nmodel of trade between two countries which are similar and unchanging\nin all respects except their capital stocks. As a starting point we sup-\npose first that neither has any fixed capital at all. Then we start accumu-\nlation going in one and watch what happens, assuming land plentiful\nand labor supplies constant.\n\nA long series of assumptions of the most formidable kind has to be\nmade before the argument can be reduced to any degree of simplicity\nand precision. They yield a caricature of reality which, except for being\ndynamic, is much cruder than that embodied in even elementary statics.\nBut this extra crudity seems to be the unavoidable price to be paid for\n\n* The author is visiting Nuffield College, Oxford University.\n"

Black-market and bar-\nter transactions which, along with trading at fixed prices under ration-\ning and allocation controls, had characterized Germany's exchange\neconomy in the early postwar years, disappeared overnight; and a\nhomogeneous price system re-emerged. Most important, the cancella-\ntion of a large proportion of the monetary *overhang,\" that was a leg-\nacy of the war, created incentives to work and to save. Production,\nwhich prior to the reform had been running at very low levels, made\nspectacular advances. In short, the reform brought about what has be-\ncome known as the \"miracle of the D-mark.\"\n\nThis miracle, however, could not have been performed, and could\nnot have had more than passing effects, without strong initial injec-\ntions of United States aid and the adoption by Germany of well-con-\nsidered economic and fiscal policies. First, most of the wartime controls,\nsuch as price controls and rationing, which had been continued under\nthe occupation, were abolished with a view to restoring a high degree\nof laissez faire. Secondly, the tax system was overhauled so as to en-\ncourage investments and exports rather than consumption.

The proofs of these results, however, assume\nthe existence of perfectly competitive pricing throughout the economic\nsystem.' This paper explores the nature of the burdens and benefits of\nexcise taxes in an economy where some, and perhaps most, of the\nmarkets are other than perfectly competitive.\n\nClassical theory did not recognize the possibility of excise tax\nbenefits. The traditional conclusion was that a partial excise tax, by\naltering the allocation of resources and hence the composition of final\noutput, imposes on consumers an excess burden which a general excise\nor income tax does not carry.? Excise tax benefits are also ignored in the\ncontemporary extension of classical doctrine to include general excise\nand income taxes. The extended argument points out that all excise and\nincome taxes alter the price of leisure and thereby distort the work-\nleisure choice. The conclusion reached is that an income tax may inflict\na greater burden than a partial excise tax if its distortion of the work-\nleisure choice is sufficiently greater than that produced by the excise\ntax?\n\n* The author, assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley,\n\nis indebted to Professors Howard S.

Hence analysis of the probable economic effects\nof any proposed change in the rate schedule involves consideration of\nthe way in which the progressiveness of the tax will be affected. For\nchanges in the progressiveness of the tax are likely to affect the distribu-\ntion of income, and thus not only involve equity considerations but\nalso have an impact upon the propensity to consume and the level of\nincome itself.\n\nIt might at first sight appear a simple matter to measure the way in\nwhich a given change in the income-tax rate-structure would affect the\nprogressiveness of the tax; but in fact it is quite complex, since much\nmore is involved than a simple comparison of two schedules of legis-\nlatively established rates.

                    "since 1949 have been very nearly stable, but the extent to which they have\nbeen unstable has not been consistently related to changes in size of armed\nforces.\n\nIf we take only the civilian labor force and compare it with the eligible\nnoninstitutional nonmilitary population we find the 1949-1952 labor-force\nparticipation rate even more stable than the conventional measure of participa-\ntion for these years. But this also justifies no generalization about any appar-\nently well-established stability in labor-force participation. A glance at the\nfigures for 1940 in Table II shows all the pertinent ratios to be considerably\nbelow their postwar counterparts. Long would argue, of course, that any over-\nall rate of only about 3 percentage points below the postwar high amounts to\nstability. But as was noted above, such a statement involves relegating to un-\nimportance total plus and minus variations of from 5.1 to 7.7 per cent of the\n1952 labor force and total plus and minus variations in the 1952 GNP of\nfrom $11.4 billion to $17.1 billion. No economic policy-maker could very well\nsubsume such large changes under the heading of \"stability.\"\n\nBut even if one were inclined to accept this criterion as a guide\u2014to accept\nalso the contention of long-run labor-force stability\u2014we cannot permit this\nto obscure certain changes that have been occurring over the years in the\ncomposition of the labor force. These, viewed in light of Long's assertion of a\nclose correlation between armed-forces withdrawals and female entry into the\nlabor force, raise additional doubts about the adequacy of the claimed rela-\ntionship. For example, there was an over 5 percentage point, or over 17 per\ncent, difference between the prewar and postwar participation rates. The post-\nwar increase is too substantial to dismiss as being either random or of no\nimportance, and it cannot easily be attributed entirely to the growth of armed\nforces. It is the female rate that has been responsible for the greater than\nnatural increase in the postwar labor force. But because women constitute only\nabout a third of the total labor force, relatively large increases in their par-\nticipation rates create comparatively small changes in aggregate labor force\nstatistics. A 17 per cent increase in the labor-force participation rate for a\ngiven group during a short ten-year period when other groups changed very\nlittle is a remarkably high figure, irrespective of the numerical size of the\ngroup or its proportion of the general category from which it is drawn. Long\nobviously does not overlook or deny that a significant change has occurred\nhere. But on the one hand in submerging this fact by limiting his correlations\nto over-all labor-force figures and on the other, urging a close direct relation-\nship between armed-forces expansion and female entry into the labor market,\nhe fails to test one conclusion against the other. The two are not consistent.\nWhile this does not mean that under conditions of high military mobilization\nLong's conclusions are incorrect, it does mean that at least in respect to com-\nparatively small changes in the size of armed forces no prediction is justified\none way or the other about the resultant changes in female labor-force partici-\npation, and that over the long pull female labor-force participation rates have\nbeen influenced more by nonmilitary changes that have been occurring in our\nsociety than Long's correlations and conclusions seem to indicate.\n\nIn sum, it can be said that while Professor Long's inferences about the long-\nrun stability of the over-all labor-force participation rate may be entirely cor-\n",

                    "\"The fact that there was substantial unemployment in 1940 is not likely to have\ninfluenced the results since there is now wide agreement, and Long's studies certainly\nsupport the view, that the existence of widespread unemployment has no discernible effect\non the labor-force participation rate.\n",

In connection with female labor-force participation, on the\nother hand, a 34,000 armed-forces increase was accompanied by a .7 per-\ncentage point rise in labor-force participation; in the next year the 1,448,000\nexpansion of armed forces was accompanied by the same percentage point but\na lower percentage increase in female labor-force participation, and in 1951-\n1952, when armed forces increased 512,000, female labor-force participation\nincreased by only .1 percentage point.\n\nIn light of these figures it is doubtful that Long's simple postwar correla-\ntion of .589 for total labor force and armed forces has very much short-run\npredictive value. However, since the 1950-1952 draft emphasized young, un-\nmarried men to a greater degree than the 1940-1945 draft, it might be argued\nthat this would tend to explain in part the lag in the female participation rate\nfor the later years and the anomalous results noted in the preceding paragraph,\nparticularly in respect to female participation rates. While a priori this would\nseem to be true, a perhaps more legitimate test of Long's proposition is pro-\nvided by comparing changes in armed-forces withdrawals and female labor-\nforce participation in 1940 (when the draft emphasized young, unmarried men\nin the same degree as in the 1950's) and in the 1950s. Thus while the actual\ndifference between the 1940 and the 1950 armed forces was about as great as\nthe 1950-1951 difference, the latter was accompanied by a female participation\nrate increase of only .7 percentage points as against the former increase of 4.9\npoints. This would tend to confirm the inadequacy of the claims of a close\ndirect relationship between these variables.!?\n\nIt might also be contended that my selection of 1949-52 as a basis for test-\ning Long's 1946-52 correlations may have introduced a selective bias in favor\nof the case against Long's conclusions. But this is doubtful since his is a corre-\nlation analysis based on the entire seven-year range while mine is a simple\narithmetic year-to-year comparison of changes between the pertinent variables.\nIn view of this difference in method it cannot easily be argued that the selec-\ntion of a different time span is particularly important. The point here is not so\nmuch that we are comparing different ranges of time, but that we are employ-\ning different methods. What is important is that the correlation method hides\na great deal of significant information about the actual year-to-year changes\noccurring between allegedly related variables.\n\nFurthermore, while Long holds to the existence of a close and direct positive\nrelation between armed-forces variation and female labor-force participation,\nTable II also indicates that the relation between female labor-force participa-\ntion and size of armed forces, at least during \"relative\" peacetime, appears to\njustify no correlation presumption of any degree of confidence one way or the\nother.

                    "there are occasional wide divergences from the so-called normal participation-\nrate patterns, Long argues that these are attributable almost exclusively to\narmed-forces withdrawals. He notes, to be sure, that a conclusion to the effect\nthat size of armed forces was the only significant determinant of the labor\nforce during, for example, World War II \"should be drawn only with great\ncare.\"5 Elsewhere he points to the failure of Germany's wartime participation\nrate to have risen as rapidly as those of the Allied nations as evidence that the\nincrease is not automatically a function of size of armed forces but is condi-\ntioned by the economic pressures which force women to become breadwinners.?\nStill he shows that *the correlation between labor force and armed forces was\nthe strongest of the various relationships\"? that he tested. He therefore con-\ncludes that armed-forces expansion provides the most meaningful explanation\nof swollen participation rates, pointing particularly to the great influx of\nwomen into the wartime labor market as additional supporting evidence.\n\nHe obtained a wartime simple correlation for labor force and armed forces\nof .956, higher than any other simple correlation included in his series. Multi-\nple correlations including unemployment and various measures of per worker\nincome and hourly earnings failed to yield significantly better results. For the\npostwar years 1946-52 the simple correlation is .589, with multiple correla-\ntions being somewhat, but not a great deal, better. He suggests that while the\npostwar correlations are distinctly weaker, they do not invalidate the conclu-\nsion of a close direct association between the two variables. Two possible\nexplanations are offered for the weaker postwar correlations: One is that\npowerful patriotic and other moral forces reinforce the impact of all-out\nmobilization on labor supply. The other is that the underlying estimates of\nlabor force\u2014furnished by the census\u2014are exposed to sampling errors that are\nminor in relation to the huge wartime variations but play a more prominent\nrole in the moderate postwar changes.\" Thus, in spite of the comparatively\nsmall changes in the postwar armed forces, Long seems to suggest that even\nfor these minor variations his conclusions about the close relationship between\narmed-forces size and labor-force participation still hold. The question to\nwhich we now address ourselves is whether other measures of this relationship\nduring the postwar period support such a thesis.\n\nTable II may be consulted for a cursory statistical examination of the extent\nto which this thesis can be generalized. The labor-force participation rate for\nthe years 1949-52 appears to have been quite stable indeed, ranging between\n58.0 and 58.8 per cent. The rate for men was even more stable, being for the\nfour respective years 84.5, 84.4, 84.8, and 84.6 per cent. But at the same time\nwe find some rather interesting changes in the relation between size and growth\nof armed forces and total and female participation rates which tend to chal-\nlenge the predictive value of Long's correlation results. It will be seen that\nwith an armed-forces increase of 34,000 in 1950 there was a .3 percentage point\n",

[prior to and]\nuntil the Korean outbreak, the over-all proportion [of persons in the labor\nforce to the noninstitutional population of fourteen years and older] remained\nhighly stable in each of the three nations [United States, Great Britain, and\nCanada], its maximum range of variation having been 1.5 per cent of popula-\ntion fourteen and older\u2014half to a third of what normally occurs in this coun-\ntry and Canada from one season to another within the same year.\"*\n\nLong thus seems to suggest that the long-run labor-force participation rate\nmay fluctuate within the entire range of normal seasonal fluctuations without\nviolating his criterion of stability. This means that a total plus and minus\nfluctuation of from 3 to 4.5 per cent in the participation rate is not inconsist-\nent with the concept of stability. In 1948 he suggested a similar conclusion,\nand added that \"If further research supports this stability, then economists\nand economic policy-makers may proceed more confidently in their theoretical\nspeculations and practical plans.\"5 It may be assumed therefore that repetition\nof the 1948 conclusions in 1953, the latter being based on further research,\nindicates satisfaction with the earlier statement, even though the 1953 criterion\nis stated in a more casual manner than Long would undoubtedly be satisfied\nwith in a more elaborate discussion of the problem.\n\nAs Long's criterion presently stands, however, it is doubtful whether, with-\nout some rather detailed statement of its limitations, it is a particularly useful\nguide for economic policy-makers. An indication of such limitations is pro-\nvided in Table I which shows the magnitude of labor-force and gross-national-\nproduct variations which would be allowed under this criterion. For example,\nan assumed 3 per cent range of variation in labor-force participation would\nhave allowed in 1952 a total labor-force variation of approximately 3.4 million\npersons. An assumed 4.5 per cent range of variation would have allowed a total\nlabor-force variation of approximately 5.1 million persons. On the basis of the\naverage adjusted increase in gross national product attributable to each worker\nparticipating in the labor-force expansion that occurred between 1951 and\n1952, this would have permitted at the outside a variation in the 1952 gross\nnational product of from $11.4 to $17.1 billion (in 1947-49 dollars).\n\nSuch highly elastic results suggest that Long's criterion seriously mini-\nmizes the importance of apparently minor variations in labor-force participa-\ntion rates. Small variations are deceptive. Using his criterion it would be possi-\nble for the labor force to vary by as much as 7.7 per cent and gross national\nproduct by as much as 5.6 per cent with \"stable\" participation rates.9 It\nwould seem, therefore, that the employment of seasonal participation-rate\nchanges (and \"other important economic magnitudes\") as criteria for indi-\n\n* Ibid., p. 461.\n\n* Long, \"The Labor Force and Economic Change,\" in Insights Into Labor Issues, edited\nby R.

After allowance for capital con-\nsumption undergone to produce the period's gross product, national\nincome at factor cost would equal the net value of that product.

The\ncombined effect of the taxing-spending policy is to transfer the use of resource services\nfrom private to government purposes. The wedge between total spending and the value\nof the total product on the one hand; and the value of productive services which produce\nthe total product on the other hand, nevertheless remains. If the government does not spend\nthe tax proceeds, aggregate demand falls and resource earnings fall further.\n\nIn analyzing the income effect, or who bears it, it is convenient to separate out either\nthe impact of government spending or the deflationary effect when tax proceeds are im-\n\npounded.

The origin\nof the production block, O, traces out a locus of points which Meade calls\na trade indifference curve, denoted \u00a3, in Figure 4. Next, place the production\nblock so that it is tangent to the next higher consumption indifference curve\nand trace out the next higher trade indifference curve. In this manner a\nfamily of trade indifference curves can be traced out for country I. After\nsuch a family has been constructed, country I's offer curve is defined by the\npoints of tangency between country I's trade indifference curves and exchange\nlines rotated around the origin, O. Country I's offer curve is shown in Figure\n4 by the line OI. Similarly, an offer curve, O/I, is derived for country II.\nTo avoid clutter Figure 4 shows only one trade and one consumption in-\ndifference curve for country II, whose relative preferences and cost relation-\nships for X and Y are assumed to be depicted in the third quadrant (Y'OX).\n\nThe intersection of O7 and OII at T denotes the point of free-trade\nequilibrium, To determine what country I's production and consumption are\nat this point, the production possibilities block is placed so that its origin\ncoincides with point T. Because of the way in which the trade indifference\ncurves have been constructed, the production block is tangent to consumption\nindifference curve i\u00bb, corresponding to \u00a3\u00bb, the trade indifference curve passing\nthrough T. At the point of tangency, P;, the slopes of the consumption in-\ndifference curve and the production block are the same as the slope of f,\nat T.? Therefore, at point P, consumption and production are adjusted\nto the exchange ratio OT. Country I consumes OH of X and OJ of Y, but\nproduces TE of X and TG of Y. Country I has, therefore, a surplus\n\n' (London, 1952).\n\n*In his rather extensive exposition of this new tool, however, Meade did not criticize\nprevious forms of diagrammatical representation nor indicate in what way his technique\nis an improvement.\n\n* Meade, o. cit., pp. 13-14.\n",

                    "Constructional Limitations of Box Diagram Analysis\n\nWhen drawn as in Figure 3 the box diagram strikingly illustrates the\nclassical conclusion that total welfare is enhanced by unimpeded interna-\ntional trade and specialization. The diagram also shows that in the absence\nof retaliation one nation can improve its welfare at the expense of the other.\nIf, by means of a tariff, country I alters its offer curve, O,/, in Figure 3 so\nas to intersect O,/I somewhere between L and S, e.g., M, country I attains\na higher level of welfare than under free trade, for M must lie on a higher\nconsumption indifference curve than Z5, which passes through the equilibrium\nfree-trade point, S.*\n\nThe use of the box diagram in this argument implies that the imposition\nof a tariif does not alter the pattern of production in either country, i.e.,\nthat each country continues to specialize. Were the imposition of the tariff\nto alter the foreign and domestic exchange ratios for X and Y so as to induce\neither or both countries to cease specializing, Figure 3 would cease to be\nmeaningful. As demonstrated in the above comparison of Figures 2 and 3,\nthe quantities of X and Y produced by the two countries determine the\ndimensions of the box and any change in these quantities alters the dimensions\nof the box and the positions of the offer curves and contract curve.\n\nUnder the assumption of constant costs it is not unreasonable to conclude\nthat the imposition of a tariff would not easily alter the pattern of production.*\nIn Figure 3 the terms of trade could vary between O,B and O,B' without\neither country finding it advantageous to cease specializing. If, however, in-\ncreasing costs are assumed to prevail, every change in the terms of trade\nresults in a changed pattern of production? and for each pattern of produc-\ntion the box diagram has different dimensions. Furthermore, with increasing\ncosts the offer curves cannot be defined within the framework of the box,\nfor with each change in the exchange ratio the initial distribution of X and Y\nbetween countries I and II alters, and the origin of the curves shifts.\n\nThe box-diagram exposition is valid only under the classical assumptions\nthat constant costs prevail and that each country specializes as if in free-trade\n\n' This argument has been set forth diagrammatically \u2014 Nicholas Kaldor, *A Note on\nTariffs and the Terms of Trade,\" Economica (Nov. 19040), VII, 377-80 and Scitovsky,\n0p. cit., pp. 372-77, and is summarized here only for the purpose of introducing into the\nargument qualifications that are inherent in the box diagram.\n\n* Kaldor, o5. cit., and Scitovsky, of. cit., state no assumptions about the nature of costs\nunderlying their diagrams.\n\n\"Increasing costs are represented by production curves concave toward the origin.\nExchange lines representing various ratios of exchange between X and Y do not touch the\nproduction curve all at one point as in the case with constant costs, but rather are tangent\nat different points throughout the range of the curve; each point of tangency defines a\ndifferent composition of output of X and Y.

The O,P and O,P' parts of the\noffer curves are not relevant for the trade-equilibrium solution, because neither\ncountry would specialize and then exchange its product so as to be worse\noff than if it produced both products in isolation.\n\nWhereas Figure 2 shows only the gain from trade that comes from ex-\nploitation of exchange possibilities, Figure 3 also shows the gain achieved\nthrough specialization. The east-west length of the box in Figure 2 is equal\nto OX, plus O'X^,. It is apparent from Figure 3 that OX, plus O\"X^, is less\nthan OO, or O'F, the total quantity of X produced by country I when\nspecializing.

Marsh, of. cit., pp. 277-79. When using the\nLeontief-type diagram, Marsh rotates the exchange lines around the point of intersection\nof the production possibilities curve and the appropriate axis, but when using the box\ndiagram, it is clear that he rotates the exchange lines around such a point as O,; in Figure 2.\n\n* The error in Figure 2 lies, of course, in the too literal application of the barter diagram\nto the classical international trade model. It is clear that Marshall's offer curves were\ndrawn on the assumption that each country was specializing, for in his \"Note on Mill's\nTreatment of an Exceptional Case\" in The Pure Theory of Foreign Trade, pp. 15-16, he\ndrew a diagram (Figure 6 in that work) in which he indicated that the point of isolated\nproduction would be somewhere up the offer curve from the origin. The origin could not\nbe, therefore, the point of isolated production as in Figure 2. An error in Edgeworth's\ndiagrams in *\"The Theory of International Values,\" oj. cit, pp. 425, 623, resulted in\nmisinterpretation, for these diagrams resemble that part of Figure 2 contained in quadrant\nYO,X, yet are constructed on a different principle.

To be consistent with the principle of maximization,\nthe offer curves must be drawn as in the Leontief-type diagram, for only\nthen do they denote points of equilibria at which productive resources as well\nas exchange opportunities have been exploited to the fullest extent.\n\nIt is apparent, however, that Figure 2 cannot be made meaningful by\ndrawing the offer curves in such a way that they originate at 4 and A\". If the\ncurves originated at these points, the intersection of the offer curves would\nbe devoid of its usual significance. The exchange lines, by means of which\nthe offer curves are derived, would not originate from the same point, and\nthe intersection of the offer curves at T would not define a ratio of exchange\nbetween X and Y that would be the same for both countries. The equilibrium\ncondition that the terms of trade be the same for both countries would not\nbe satisfied. Further, the point of intersection would not lie on the contract\ncurve. Since the exchange lines which are tangent to the respective consump-\ntion indifference curves at the point of intersection of the offer curves would\ndiffer in slope, the consumption indifference curves would not share a common\ntangent and therefore would not be tangent to one another at this point.\n\nThe conclusion that each country continues to produce a\u00edter the opening\nof trade as it did before is certainly alien to the classical model. Under the\nassumption of constant costs the well-known conclusion of the classical model\nis that when trade is opened each country shifts its productive resources so\nas to specialize in the product in which it holds the comparative advantage.\nThe box diagram in Figure 2 does not and can not show this shift in\nproduction.*\n",

The use of this diagram has been justified by the analogy\nbetween the classical model of trade between two countries and barter between\ntwo individuals. There are limits to this analogy which render ambiguous the\napplication of the barter diagram to the two-country, two-commodity analysis.\nAn important limitation lies in the difficulty of defining unique sets of com-\nmunity consumption indi\u00edference curves for the two countries. Other limita-\ntions are posed by the question of how meaningful is an analysis in terms of\ntwo countries acting as individuals when, in fact, the trading world it seeks\nto analyze is made up of many individuals in many countries trading many\ncommodities. Disregarding these quite fundamental limitations, the following\ndiscussion seeks to show that the box diagram is not appropriate for use in\ninternational trade theory because of constructional limitations which are\nusually ignored.\n",

                    "A Note on Corporate Concentration and Turnover\n\nCorporate concentration is usually measured by applying some kind of\ndistribution concept: for example, by the share of the largest x firms in the\nassets or employment (or other variables) of all firms. The trend of concen-\ntration over time is measured by comparing the size of this share at two or\nmore successive dates. The basic data are very imperfect, and there are also\ndifficulties with the concept itself. A different measure of changes in size\nStructure was suggested some years ago,* and has recently been applied on a\nlarge scale.? It is obtained by drawing up a list of the largest x firms at various\ndates, and then counting the number of firms which have dropped out of the\nlist and have been replaced by other firms.

As recently as five years ago it\nwas widely assumed that this policy would be discontinued as soon as\nthe psychological transition to peacetime conditions had been completed\nand the opposition of some intransigent friends of the so-called *high and\nrigid\" supports had been overcome. The policy can no longer be viewed\nas temporary. It has won the advocacy of a body of legislators of both\nparties who are formidable both in numbers and power. They clearly\nhave on their side an important sector of farm opinion despite the\nformal opposition, so far, of two of the three national farm organiza-\ntions During the presidential campaign of 1952 both candidates\ncommitted themselves, for the immediate future, to price supports at\npresent levels and to the extension of protection to products not now\ncovered.

Only the smaller and more regional\nFarmers! Union supports the policy. However, it has been evident for some time that the\nFarm Bureau, especially in the South, does not have the full concurrence of its state units\non this issue, and presidents of State Federations have appeared before Congressional\ncommittees in opposition to the position taken by the national organization.\n\n? In his first press conference, in what may not have been the happiest choice of words,\nSecretary Benson expressed the belief that price supports should be used only to protect the\nfarmer from \"undue disaster.\" Amplifying this later at St. Paul, he said, \"Price supports\nshould provide insurance against disaster and help stabilize national food supplies.

If one considers a market\nfor services or a market for perishable goods, it is fairly clear what is\nmeant by the familiar statement that \"price tends to be established at a\nlevel which equates supply and demand.\" If price were greater than the\n\"equilibrium\" level, buyers would be confronted, in effect, with a\n*queue\" of willing sellers; since some sellers would accept a lower price\nin order to avoid inconvenience (and loss) associated with *queuing,\"\nprice would tend to fall. If price were less than the equilibrium level,\nsellers would be confronted, in effect, with a queue\" of willing buyers;\nsince some buyers would offer a higher price rather than \"wait their\nturn,\" price would tend to rise.\n\nIf one considers a market for durable goods, matters are rather\ndifferent. In this case it is usual to argue that if price were above the\nlevel which equates supply and demand, commodity stocks would ac-\ncumulate; since some sellers would accept a lower price to avoid holding\nundesired stocks, price would tend to fall. A similar argument is used\nto show that if price were set temporarily below the equilibrium level,\nforces would be set in motion which would tend to make price rise.\nThe difficulty in these cases is that it seems equally plausible to argue\nthat if price lies above the equilibrium level, this may be because some\nindividuals wan\u00a3 to accumulate stocks. Otherwise the phenomenon of\ninvestment would be incomprehensible. But does the mere process of\ninvestment in stocks imply a tendency for price to fall? Similarly, if\nprice is below the equilibrium level so that demand exceeds supply,\nit is reasonable to argue that some individuals wan to disinvest.

Two-thirds of the observations fall within the rather consider-\nable range 3.57 shillings to 5.50 shillings to the dollar (or within the range\n\u00a31 \u2014 $3.64 to $5.60).\n\nThese results are not presented as a great puzzle; an explanation of a sort\ncan be provided. For one thing, it must be noted that British publishers own\nthe primary copyright on some of these books, while American publishers\nown it on others. However, this fact would at best lead us to expect two dif-\nferent ratios, and not the scattering of values actually found. Secondly, wage\nrates in the printing industry are not uniform in the United States, since\nthere is a North-South differential. But this is believed to be a factor of limited\nsignificance for the matter considered here. The most important explanation\nseems to be that the patterns of mark-up are quite different in the two coun-\ntries. A British publisher evidently sets a rather low mark-up on one title and\na higher one on another, while his American counterpart reverses the rule\nand establishes a higher mark-up on the former title than on the latter.\nWhether it is sensible to link these international differences in the patterns\nof mark-ups to variations in the British and American structures of demand\nand its elasticity can not be considered here.\n\nIn any case it does seem evident that in international trade theory an im-\nportant place must be reserved for such phenomena as differences in mark-up\npatterns in the various countries.

Thus a recently published title sells for\n$6.00 in this country, and 25 shillings in Britain; the number of shillings to\nthe dollar as implied by this comparison comes to 4.17.\n\nNow these books are corresponding products, and if the printer at work\non title A does not draw more pay than the printer on B, the pattern of\nmoney costs for the various titles would be the same in both countries. If at\nthe same time the pattern of mark-ups is the same in both countries, then\na calculation prepared for each title like that above should give the same\nresult in terms of the number of shillings to the dollar, since this means no\nmore than that the price ratios are the same.\n\nHowever, when this was done it was found that instead of a clustering of\nthe results around a central value, or two of them, they were in fact widely\ndispersed. The following summarizes our findings:\n",

                    "International Price Ratios and International Trade Theory\n\nIn the absence of trade, or when the obstacles to trade in the form of tariffs\nand costs of transport are significant, the price structure in one country would\nnot be expected to duplicate the price structure in another. Differences in factor\nendowments in the various countries would normally lead to a wide difference\n\naP4 yP4\nand (or to put this differently, between\nzP, B yP, B yP. A\n\nbetween the ratios\n\nand Pr where P is the price of A4, Ps the price of B, and the subscripts\nyPs\n\nx and y refer to the two countries X and Y. This is the familiar basis of inter-\n\nnational trade theory, and it is commonly employed to account for the composi-\n\ntion of trade.\n\nIn theory too, when trade is unhampered and costless these differences in\nprice ratios disappear. If such differences can still be observed after trade is\nopened, they are taken to reflect the existence of transport costs, tariffs, or\nother expenses of trade. To explain trade, then, we must first account for such\ndifferences in price structure as would exist were trade impossible; and in\norder to explain the observed differences in price structures once trade is\nopen, we must look for various costs of transfer.\n\nAn explanation along these lines is generally put forward when we seek to\nshow why, for instance, Canada sells us wood pulp, while she buys automo-\nbile parts from us. The two products differ so greatly that we may reasonably\nhope to explain, in terms of the different factor endowments of the two coun-\ntries, why the ratio of the Canadian price of wood pulp to the U.S. price of\nthe same product would, in the absence of trade, be much lower than the\ncomparable ratio for automobile parts. We would have looked, until recently\nat any rate, for the Canadian price (in the absence of trade) to be especially\nlow for that product which required for its production a relatively large\namount of the factor which Canada possesses in relatively (to the United\nStates) ample supply.* Finally such price discrepancies as are seen to exist, are\nsupposed to reflect tariffs and other costs of transfer, and they would not be\nexpected to exceed these transfer costs.\n\nWithin certain classes of products, however, we should have no obvious\nreason to expect different price ratios, despite the different factor endowments\n\n? But recent work on both the theoretical and statistical basis for this view shows that\nit may not be correct; see for example, S. F. James and I. F. Pearce: \"The Factor Price\nEqualisation Myth,\" Rev. Econ. Stud., 1951-1952, XIX(2), 111-20; and Wassily Leontief,\n\"Domestic Production and Foreign Trade: The American Capital Position Re-examined,\"\nProceedings Am. Phil.

Conclusions\n\nIf a fixed tax is imposed on a perfectly competitive industry where the\nfirm's indifference curves are parallel, (1) production, sales and price will\nremain constant as long as no financial shortage prevents the attainment of\noptimum output and (2) output will fall, market price will rise, and sales will\nlikely fall, if production is limited by a money shortage. Where lower indiffer-\nence curves are flatter output generally will fall!5 as a result of the tax and\n(1) sales rise and price falls if no money shortage limits production and (2) if\noutput is limited by financial shortage, sales may either rise or fall and price\neither fall or rise.!*\n\nIf a tax is imposed on each unit of product sold by a monopoly faced with\nconstant marginal cost, sales and output will decline by the same amount\nand price will rise. But sales and output will not fall as much as Boulding\nindicates and the price rises more than in Boulding's solution.\n\nIf a variable tax is levied on the output of a perfectly competitive industry,\nboth output and sales fall and market price rises if the marginal rate of\nsubstitution of money for commodity is invariant with respect to money\nholdings. If the indifference curves become flatter at lower money holdings,\n\n\"One exception would be where marginal cost is constant and the firm is able to\nattain the peak of the utility hill both before and after the tax.\n\n? For an exception see the second case in n. 9.\n\n\"Only in very unusual circumstances here would the industry supply curve remain\nconstant and hence the market price and the firm's sales remain unaffected by the imposi-\ntion of fixed tax.\n",

But output will decline except in unusual cases.!*\n\nWhen the variable tax is industry-wide, the same analysis applies except\nthat the effect on market price must be considered. With parallel indifference\ncurves, both output and sales will tend to fall. In addition market price will\ntend to rise because of the negative shift of the firm and hence industry supply\nSchedules. (With the new total cost curve, the volume of the firm's sales at\neach price will tend to be smaller and hence also the industry supply to the\nmarket.) With the higher price, the investment in inventory will also tend to\nfall. But with flatter indi\u00edference curves at lower money holdings, the firm's\nsales may increase even though production falls (as outlined above) and hence\nthe industry's supply schedule may shift to the right and a /ower market price\nprevail after the tax. Thus in Figure 3 the firm will be faced finally with ex-\nchange path P;K;, produce Q;P; and sell S;P,. If the tax is very steep and the\nslope of the lower indifference curves doesn't fall greatly, however, sales are\nlikely to fall and hence the industry supply schedule to shift negatively and\nmarket price to rise.

                    "Sales and Output Taxes\n\nThe application of K. E. Boulding's asset-indifference technique! to taxation\nproblems is of particular importance? to economists interested in public policy\nbecause the results occasionally differ markedly from those obtained from the\ncustomary analysis based on the assumption that production always equals\nsales. The purpose of this note is to re-examine two of the tax cases Boulding\ntakes up and then to analyze briefly a third important case. A more meaningful\nand realistic result is obtained in Boulding's first case when an important\nassumption of his is removed and his analysis extended. A serious error in\nreasoning is discovered in his second case.\n\nSince Boulding's asset-indifference apparatus is perhaps not, as yet, well\nknown, a short preliminary explanation of this technique seems in order. Its\nbasic assumption is that firms aim at preferred holdings of goods and other\nassets at a point of time rather than mere profit maximization over a period of\ntime. The initial asset position of the firm is depicted by P, in Figure 1. The\nordinate of P, shows the firm's initial money stock and the abscissa the original\ncommodity stock. P,R,P, is the firm's *production opportunity line\" or total\ncost curve showing the possible combinations of money and commodity attain-\nable by producion. P,R, represents the total fixed cost and R,P, the total vari-\nable cost in the present period. If the firm does not produce in this period, its\nmoney stocks will simply fall by P,R, and the firm's new asset position will\nbe R,. The marginal cost of production, the slope of R, P, is assumed in this\ndiagram to increase as output increases.\n\nP,K;, the firm's *exchange path,\" shows the amount of money obtainable\nby selling the commodity in the market. Since a perfect market is assumed\nin Figure 1, total revenue increases at a constant rate. Thus the slope of P,K,\nis constant and its absolute value equals the market price. The firm will ex-\nchange commodity for money until it has reached the highest indifference curve\ntouching its exchange path. It is readily seen from the diagram that, to get as\nhigh up the utility surface as possible, this perfectly competitive firm will move\nalong its production opportunity line, P,R,P;, to that point where an exchange\npath is just tangential to it and then will proceed along that exchange path to\nK, where an indifference curve is tangential to it. Optimum output is then\nQiP,, optimum sales P,S,, and optimum inventory accumulation S,Q,.\n\nL A Fixed Tax on a Perfectly Competitive Firm\nBoulding concludes that a fixed tax on a perfectly competitive firm (1) will\nnot affect production, sales or price if the marginal rate of substitution is\ninvariant with respect to the amount of money and (2) will affect sales but\nneither production nor price if the indifference curves are not parallel. The\nsecond conclusion seems faulty* since it is incorrect to assume the market price\n* K, E. Boulding, A. Reconstruction of Economics (New York, 1950), Ch. 6.\n\n^In this application Boulding uses \"the asset-indifference apparatus to produce some\nmoderately significant new results\" (W. Vickrey, Am.

                    "Comment\n\nI am grateful to Mr. Malach for pointing out these errors, which I am\nglad to have corrected. I have only one point of dissent. The case of the tax\nlaid on one firm or on a few firms in a competitive industry is by no means\nas trivial as he seems to think. AII local taxation tends to be of this nature\u2014\nic., the tax does not affect the long-run price of the product because\nthere are plenty of firms outside the local area which are not affected. Even\nnational taxation where the product is produced for a world market may be\nregarded as a \"local\" tax in the sense that in so far as it is not universal\nthe world price will not be affected. There are interesting problems when the\ntax covers a large part but not the whole of the market: here the effect would\nseem to depend on the elasticity of supply in the nontaxed area. If supply\nis very elastic even taxes which cover a large part of the total industry will\nnot affect the market price, as the untaxed part will expand to take care of\nany decline in sales in the taxed part. Mr. Malach's conclusions however\nimpress me as being correct when the tax is universal.\n\nK. E. BourpiNc*\n\n* The author is professor of economics at the University of Michigan.\n"
