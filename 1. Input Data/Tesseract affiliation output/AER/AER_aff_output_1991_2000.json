Moreover, much of this trade involves\ngoods with similar factor intensities. Expla-\nnations for these now-familiar observations\nabound. Increasing returns to scale can account\nfor trade in goods that are technologically alike\nbut differentiated in the eyes of consumers (e.g.,\nPaul R. Krugman, 1979). Oligopolistic compe-\ntition can account for two-way trade in identical\nproducts under certain assumptions about oli-\ngopolistic conduct (e.g., James A. Brander,\n1991). Small technological differences across\ncountries can account for high volumes of trade\nin goods with similar factor intensities when\nfactor endowment ratios are similar and there\nare more goods than factors (Donald Davis,\n1995).\n\nBut all of these explanations share the impli-\ncation that the pattern of trade is essentially\narbitrary. If trade is motivated by scale econo-\nmies, theory predicts the number of varieties\nexported by each country, but not which ones.

If trade is generated\nby small technological differences, the pattern\nof such differences inevitably will be difficult to\npredict.\n\nYet it seems that there are systematic differ-\nences in the trading patterns of, say, the United\nStates and Japan, or Germany and Italy. Japan\ntends to excel in industries requiring care and\nprecision in a long sequence of production\nstages. Its exports include many sophisticated\nconsumer goods, such as automobiles and high-\nend consumer electronics. Whereas the United\nStates exports many goods and services whose\nvalue reflects disproportionately the input of a\nfew very talented individuals. Its highly suc-\ncessful software industry is an example of this.\nSo too are some of the financial services ema-\nnating from Wall Street. Similar to Japan, Ger-\nmany's comparative advantage resides in its\nmanufacturing sector; it exports passenger cars,\nindustrial equipment, and chemicals. Again,\nquality control plays a large part in explaining\nits success in these sectors. For Italy, like the\nUnited States, international competitiveness of-\nten reflects the outstanding performance of one\nor a few persons. Italy is known, for example,\nfor its innovative furniture styles, its fashion\ndesigns, and its movies.\n\nIn this paper we argue that not only aggregate\nfactor endowments but also the distribution of\nthose factors (especially human capital) across a\nnation's population matters for the pattern of\n"

            "found": "This paper investigates the Bayesian deci-\nsion-theoretic foundations of the popular Wall\nStreet refrain that \"timing is everything.\" I ex-\nplore the purely informational motives for trade\ntiming: If public information is being released\nover time, when is a financially and informa-\ntionally small and partially informed trader's\n\"informational edge\" over the market at its ze-\nnith? In other words, if a trader will not affect\nthe price by his transaction, and he has a fixed\ninvestment budget, when should he invest?\n\nOne might think that with no strategic or\nother reasons to time his trade, and so long as all\ninformation is conditionally independent, he\nwishes to act at once on any private informa-\ntion\u2014 because delay sees only its depreciation.\nThis paper questions this intuition by exploring\nan informational difference between the calcu-\nlus of prices and their reciprocals, returns. The\npaper builds on a timing irrelevance result for\nArrow securities, to deduce economically inter-\npretable sufficient conditions for timing impa-\ntience of general securities.\n\nInvestors trade among themselves because\nthey have either different information or pref-\nerences, usually diverse risk-sharing needs. The\nmost important and interesting problems in fi-\nnancial timing concern how this drama unfolds\nin an equilibrium setting, where markets recog-\n\n* Department of Economics, University of Michigan,\nAnn Arbor, MI 48109 (e-mail and web page: econ-\ntheoristG earthling.net and www.umich.edu/\u2014 lones/). This\npaper is a renaming and radical revision of a March 1995\nmimeo, \"On the Irrelevance of Trade Timing.\" I owe special\nthanks to Max Amarante for reasoning that led me to the\ncurrent Jensen proof, to Susan Athey for kindly showing me\nhow to use her theorem, and to Terry Tao (UCLA) for help\nwith some correlation notions.

I\nacknowledge the National Science Foundation for financial\nsupport. Any errors and opinions expressed are mine alone.\n\n1012\n\nnize the informational content in the order flow.\nOne thread of research, as exemplified by Jiang\nWang (1994), takes inspiration from the asym-\nmetric information rational expectation pricing\nliterature. More recently, strategic effects have\nreceived the lion's share of attention. A se-\nquence of papers starting with Albert S. Kyle\n(1985) have investigated trade timing given a\nfew large agents; in these settings, trade volume\nconveys private information about the asset's\nvalue, and thereby affects current and future\nprices. Prime examples of this work insofar as it\naffects timing include: the analyses with many\ninformed insiders in Douglas Foster and S.\nViswanathan (1996), or timing for purely risk-\nsharing reasons in Dimitri Vayanos (1999), or\nby uninformed investors in Anat Admati and\nPaul Pfleiderer (1988).\n\nIt is in the context of such advanced and\nincreasingly applied equilibrium analyses that I\nask a very simple and idealized timing question.\nAbsent any price effects, when is it best to\nspend a dollar? Properly understanding this\npurely decision theory question may possibly\nallow deeper insight into equilibrium timing\nquestions still unresolved: for instance, the\nspeed that private information actually gets im-\npounded into prices, or the incentives to engage\nin technical (uninformed) trading.\n\nOptimal financial timing is often associated\nwith the added complexity of American over\nEuropean style put or call options. There, the\nproblem is when to sell or buy a share, in\nadvance of a given date. This paper in essence\nattacks the dual problem of when to spend a\ndollar. It thus concerns the calculus of returns,\nrather than share prices. Moreover, the interac-\ntion between private and public information has\nbeen a nonissue in the option pricing literature,\nbut is the central focus of this paper.\n\nTo motivate the question I examine, consider\nthe following purely illustrative scenario. An\nemployee of a biotech firm has gotten wind of\nan announcement next Friday of the unexpected\nFDA approval of his firm's soon-to-be major\ndrug. The insider wishes to profit from this\n"

Eichenbaum (1989) introduces\nunobserved cost shocks that generate simultaneous expan-\nsions in production and inventory investment.

With a finite maximum for the skill distribution, the\noptimal marginal tax rate at the income level of the top skill is\nzero (Efraim Sadka, 1976; Jesus K. Seade, 1977). If individ-\nuals choose to work, a zero optimal marginal tax rate is also\nobtained at the income level of the bottom skill (Seade, 1977).\n\n? In Mirrlees' pioneering simulations, optimal marginal\ntaxes decline with income. Since the shape was close to\nlinearity, this point was stressed neither by Mirrlees nor by\nother authors citing his work. A more recent paper that uses\nalso a lognormal distribution and shows a declining pattern\nof marginal two-bracket linear tax rates is Joel Slemrod et\nal. (1994). Note that these results were obtained under the\nassumption that income is certain. With income uncertainty,\nsimulations show that optimal taxes rise with income. Hal\nR. Varian (1980) and Strawczynski (1998) provide exam-\nples where differences in income are due to \"luck.\" Matti\nTuomala (1984b) provides an example that introduces labor\nincome uncertainty to the classical model of skills.\n"

In 1995, the last\nyear for which the U.S. Department of Labor\nhas released definitive data, 401(k) contribu-\ntions amounted to $87.4 billion, or 55 percent of\nall contributions to employer-sponsored pension\nplans. The level of contributions, and their share\nof all pension contributions, is probably signifi-\ncantly higher today.\n\nThe spread of 401(k) plans is the most\nimportant indicator of the move to personal\nretirement saving. In 1980, almost 92 percent\nof pension-plan contributions were to tradi-\ntional employer-provided plans, and about\n64 percent of these contributions were to\nconventional defined-benefit plans. Today,\nalmost 60 percent of contributions are to\npersonal retirement accounts, including 401(k),\nIRA, and Keogh plans. Including employer-\nprovided, non-401(k) defined-contribution\nplans, over 76 percent of contributions are to\nplans that are controlled in large measure by\nindividuals. These individuals make partici-\npation, contribution, asset-allocation, and\nwithdrawal decisions.\n\nIn this paper, we describe the likely impor-\ntance of 401(k) assets for future older Ameri-\ncans and the effect of investment decisions on\nasset accumulation. We also examine the extent\nto which retirement assets may be affected by\nseveral decisions: preretirement withdrawals,\nmanagement fees and expenses, contribution\nrates, and early retirement.

We are grateful to Laurence Kotlikoff for helpful\ncomments, and to the National Institute on Aging and the\nNational Science Foundation (Poterba) for research support.\n\n297\n\nWe have developed an algorithm for project-\ning the 401(k) balances at retirement for future\ncohorts of retirees. This algorithm is described\nin detail in our earlier papers (Poterba et al.,\n1998a, 1999). The algorithm uses information\non past 401(k) participation rates by age and\nincome decile, and information on 401(k)\ncontribution rates, to project future 4O01(k)\nbalances.\n\nThe starting point of the projection algorithm\nis a set of \"pseudo-earnings histories\" of Health\nand Retirement Survey (HRS) respondents, be-\nginning at age 25. We have divided the HRS\nhouseholds into deciles according to their 1992\nearnings. In principle, the Social Security earn-\nings histories of the HRS respondents can be\nused to determine lifetime earnings by age\nwithin each decile. There is one important lim-\nitation to this method, however. Historical earn-\nings are reported only up to the Social Security\nearnings limit, while actual earnings in the top\none or two deciles may be substantially higher\nthan Social Security reported earnings. Thus we\nrely on information in the annual March Current\nPopulation Survey (CPS) data files, which re-\nport earnings well above the Social Security\nmaximum (see Venti and Wise, 1997).\n\nWe use the March CPS data to calculate\nearnings deciles by age for the years 1964\u2014\n1991. We extrapolate this series back to 1956\nusing published data from the March CPS on\nmedian earnings prior to 1964. This yields a set\nof earnings histories by decile for the years\n1956-1991. Finally, we assign each HRS\nhousehold to a CPS \"lifetime earnings\" decile\naccording to the household's 1992 earnings de-\ncile, assuming that households are in the same\ndecile in all years. This assumption understates\nthe volatility of earnings and overstates differ-\nences across income groups in their 401(k) sav-\ning. We assume that our estimated earnings\n"

This point is neatly seen in the transition path dynamics\ndisplayed by Robert G. King et al. (1988), where the speed\nof adjustment to the steady state is largely determined by the\n\n921\n\nconsequence, at the plant level one may see peri-\nods of low investment activity followed by bursts\nof investment activity, ie., investment spikes.\nMoreover, to the extent that these periods of high\nactivity are not smoothed by aggregation, the non-\nconvex cost of adjustment model may have inter-\nesting aggregate implications? In particular, the\nbehavior of aggregate investment can be highly\ndependent on the cross-sectional distribution of\nthe age of the capital stock.\n\nAs documented further below, there are two\n\ncurvature of the utility function. Andrew B. Abel (1990)\nprovides a synthesis of the neoclassical investment model\nwith convex adjustment costs. Abel and Janice C. Eberly\n(1994) model the investment choice at the firm level allow-\ning for fixed costs in the adjustment process in a stochastic\nenvironment. They provide conditions for inaction on in-\nvestment due to these fixed costs of adjustment. Our em-\nphasis is on the timing of discrete investment relative to the\nbusiness cycle and the aggregation of discrete choices.\n\n? For macroeconomists, this is a critical point. Giuseppe\nBertola and Ricardo J. Caballero (1990) discuss the role of\naggregate shocks in creating synchronization of discrete\ndecisions, while Cooper and Haltiwanger (1992) stress the\nrole of aggregate complementarities.\n"

In the theoretical framework here, there is an equilib-\nrium path of the unemployment rate corresponding to the\neconomy's present (initial) state. In this paper and my\nlatest papers generally, I take the present natural rate to be\nthe unemployment rate on this path at the present time. If\nthere are hiring-cost frictions slowing the adjustment of\nemployment to current condition, one may think of the\npresent natural rate as its value on the equilibrium path a\nyear or so ahead, when most of the adjustment to present\nconditions will have been made.\n\n?1 would add that, beginning sometime in the mid-\n1980's if not earlier (after 15 years of tax hikes on labor\nand some 10 years under the great productivity slow-\ndown), workers must have found their assets at a level\nrelative to posttax paycheck that was higher than they\nwanted to sustain. \u00c1s they sought to slow their accumu-\nlation of assets, their real assets as a ratio to their aftertax\npay ought to have been declining. The corresponding de-\ncline in the imputed and pecuniary income from these as-\nsets would reduce quitting, shirking, and related\nbehaviors, and thus add another downward pull on the\nnatural rate. Households do indeed appear to be trying to\nsave less in this period, although the rise in real asset\nprices has prevented any fall in the value of their assets \u2014\ntheir real wealth. But it is not clear that asset prices have\nthe same significance for employee behavior as the ser-\nvices of houses, cars, and other consumer durables.\n"

As has been noted most forcefully\nby Jack Wennberg and colleagues (see Cen-\nter for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences\n[CECS], 1998), the regional variation in\nMedicare outlays is enormous. In 1997,\nMedicare payments across metropolitan sta-\ntistical areas (MSA's) averaged $5,182, with\na standard deviation of $897 (N \u2014 315). Put\nanother way, if all areas in the United States\nhad the level of spending prevailing at the 10th\npercentile from a ranking of MSA's by Med-\nicare spending, Medicare spending would fall\nby almost 30 percent. This type of reduction\nin the level of Medicare spending could sub-\nstantially reduce the funding problem for\nMedicare (Jonathan Skinner and Elliott\nFisher, 1997).\n\n* Cutler: Department of Economics, Harvard Univer-\nsity, Cambridge, MA 02138, and National Bureau of\nEconomic Research (e-mail: dcutler 9 fas.harvard.edu );\nSheiner: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Sys-\ntem, Mail Stop 83, Washington, DC 20551 (e-mail:\nIsheiner Qfrb.gov). We are extremely grateful to\nJonathan Skinner for providing us with data and for nu-\nmerous helpful discussions. The views expressed in this\npaper represent those of the authors and should not be\nattributed to the staff or members of the Federal Reserve.\n\n228\n\nThree theories have been proposed to ex-\nplain the wide regional variation in medical\ncosts. The first theory proposes that the vari-\nation reflects differences in illness. Illness\ndifferences may be due to short-term bad\nluck or long-term behavioral, environmen-\ntal, or genetic factors. The second theory\nstresses differential demand for medical care\nconditional on illness. Demographic factors\nsuch as race and income, for example, are\nknown to influence medical spending in con-\ntrolled experiments (Joseph P. Newhouse et\nal., 1993). Insurance coverage might also af-\nfect medical spending, by altering demand\nor supply.\n\nThe third theory is that exogenous differ-\nences in the structure of medical-care markets\naffect costs. Medical care is unlike other goods\nin that patients rely on physicians both to pro-\nvide services and to recommend the services\nthey need. As a result, physicians might have\nfinancial (or nonfinancial) incentives to rec-\nommend certain courses of treatment. For ex-\nample, specialists might be more prone to\nrecommend intensive treatments than gener-\nalists (Sheldon Greenfield et al., 1992). Dif-\nferences in the training of physicians across\nregions might also affect treatment intensity.\n\nWe test these theories using data from the\n1998 Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care (CECS,\n1998).

            "found": "This paper considers whether the paucity of\nbank branches in heavily African-American\ncommunities and the lack of a robust African-\nAmerican banking sector may be among the\nfactors impeding these communities\" eco-\nnomic development. While activists often\nclaim that these factors reduce credit flows in\nAfrican-American communities, there are rea-\nsons to think that such claims may lack merit.\nFor one thing, technological advances have\npermitted banks to make loans geographically\ndistant from their branch offices and also have\nallowed many nonbanks to enter credit mar-\nkets. Further, many immigrants, especially\nfrom East Asia, have succeeded on the basis\nof informal financial arrangements nurtured in\nethnic enclaves. Therefore, informal intra-\nethnic resources, not banks per se, may be the\nkey to ethnic groups' access to credit and\ncapital.\n\nEthnic enclaves are of undoubted historical\nimportance for many ethnic groups, but they\nmay no longer be an important form of social\norganization (Roger Waldinger, 1993).\nTimothy Bates (1997), in turn, has shown that\nsuccessful Asian-American small businesses\nrely more on equity capital and formal finan-\ncial institutions' credit than on family or\nlending-circle funds.\n\nAre formal banking structures important in\nminorities\" access to credit? This question is\nanswered here by examining recent experience\n\n* Discussants: Robert Avery, Federal Reserve Board;\nElijah Brewster, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago; Darryl\nGetter, U.S. Naval Academy; Sonya Williams Stanton,\nOhio State University.\n\n* Department of Economics, University of California,\nRiverside, California, 92521.

Los Angeles has\nseen a sizable inflow of Asian immigrants,\nwho no longer cluster in the inner city but have\nbeen expanding into suburban communities.\nSeveral Asian ''ethnoburbs'\"' (Wei Li, 1997)\nhave arisen, in part due to the formal economic\ninstitutions spawned by ethnic business net-\nworks, including many Asian- American banks\n( Yu Zhou, 1996). Dymski et al. (1998) sug-\ngest the term ethnobank to denote banks that\nare owned or controlled by members of ethnic\nminority groups and which primarily provide\nfinancial services to ethnic businesses and\nresidents. :\n\nWhy might ethnobanks play a special role in\nethnic communities! economic activities? Until\nthe Civil Rights era, ethnic banks fell into two\ncategories: African-American banks focused on\ncustomers left unserved because of segregation\nand racial discrimination (Lisa Ammons, 1996)\nwhile Asian-American banks supported export\u2014\nimport activities (Peter Kwong, 1987). Civil-\nrights laws and desegregation made mainstream\nbanks more accessible to minority customers.\nBefore deregulation and the information-\nprocessing revolution, banks delivered credit\nand other financial services through multipur-\npose branches; these solved the principal\u2014-agent\nproblems inherent in credit contracts by building\nup localized knowledge rooted in sustained\nbank-customer relationships. But banks have\nincreasingly established centralized loan-\ndecision processes emphasizing standardized\npublic information, not informal private\ninformation.\n\nFor many banks, bank branches are now pri-\nmarily venues for selling financial products,\nnot hubs for gathering information and making\nloan decisions. Consequently, banks now open\nand maintain branches in what Angela Chang\net al. (1997) term *'rational herding\"' patterns;\n"

There are interesting exceptions\u2014 most people de-\nmurely say they are not in the very top decile or quintile,\nbut merely above average; for many traits, women are less\noptimistic than men (and even overly pessimistic; e.g.,\nEleanor E. Maccoby and Carol N. Jacklin, 1974); and\nclinically depressed patients are not optimistic (e.g.,\nLauren B. Alloy and Anthony H. Ahrens, 1987). The lat-\nter finding calls into question the common psychiatric pre-\nsumption that \"realistic\" people are well adjusted and\nhappy, and also raises the question of whether unreal\u00edstic\noptimism might be evolutionarily adaptive (e.g., Lionel\nTiger, 1979) or socially beneficial (Giovanni Dosi and\nLovallo, 1997).

We\nthank three anonymous referees for numerous valuable\ncomments.\n\n! The following quotation makes this point: *'Critics\nmaintain that high campaign costs force candidates to de-\nvote an inordinate amount of time to raising money. They\nalso hold that special interest groups seeking to exercise\ninfluence by satisfying the candidates' need for campaign\nfunds threaten the integrity of the election and govern-\nmental processes.\" (Herbert E. Alexander and Monica\nBauer, 1991 pp. 1\u20142.)\n\n? The empirical evidence of a link between campaign\ncontributions and roll-call votes in the House of Repre-\nsentatives and Senate is mixed (Levitt, 1995). There is\nevidence that lobbyists' influence is felt before legislation\nreaches the floor, however. Richard L. Hall and Frank W.\nWayman (1990) examined committees of the House of\nRepresentatives, finding a significant relationship between\ncampaign contributions and members' efforts to shape\nlegislation at the committee stage. Thomas Romer and\nJames M. Snyder, Jr. (1994) found a significant relation-\nship between committee assignments and political action\ncommittee (PAC) contributions. In particular, they found\nthat seniority is rewarded, suggesting that contributors tar-\nget influential members. John R. Wright (1990) studied\ncommittee voting and found that campaign contributions\nfacilitate subsequent lobbying.\n"

Thus, the\nasset allocation in a defined contribution plan\nplays a critical role in the adequacy of retire-\nment income.\n\nWhile sponsor investment choices for de-\nfined benefit plans have been studied exten-\nsively (see Papke [1992] for a review), only\nrecently has research turned to the asset\nchoices of participants in defined contribution\nplans. The issue has been prevalent in the pop-\nular press, however, as reporters have sounded\nalarms about ''excessively conservative\" in-\nvestments by participants in 401(k) plans,\nespecially by female participants (Mary\nRowland, 1995), and general participant in-\nsecurity about investment choices. Findings\nfrom recent econometric studies differ with re-\ngard to systematic gender differences in asset\nchoices (see James M. Poterba and David\nWise, 1996; Vickie L. Bajtelsmit and Jack L.\nVanDerhei, 1997; Richard P. Hinz et al.,\n1997). Since conservative investments histor-\nically earn lower rates of return than riskier\nassets, a persistent gender difference in asset\nchoices could create pension benefit differ-\nences even between similarly situated partici-\npants. But there has been no research to date\nthat examines the effect of asset choice as well\nas gender on investment patterns.

I thank\nDenise Takahashi Heidt for excellent research assistance.\n\n212\n\nTo estimate the effect of gender and partic-\nipant direction on DC plan assets, I use the\n1992 National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of\nMature Women, an ongoing survey that began\nin 1967 with 5,083 women ages 30\u201444 (3,094\nwere included in the latest survey). In addition\nto detailed demographic data on the respon-\ndent and her household, supplementary ques-\ntions on her and her spouse's pension\neligibility and benefits from current/past em-\nployers or from other pension sources (e.g.,\npersonal plans) were included in the 1979,\n1982, 1986, and 1989 questionnaires. The\n1992 questionnaire expanded the set of pen-\nsion questions to include multiple pension\ncoverage from (i) future pensions from cur-\nrent employers; (ii) current pensions from pre-\nvious employers; and (iii) future pensions\nfrom previous employers.\n\nInformation on DC plans includes the\ntype(s) of plan (e.g., thrift/savings, 401(k),\nprofit-sharing, stock purchase, or other), dollar\namounts that both employer and respondent\ncontributed, and the employee's contribution\npercentage, account balance, and how the dol-\nlars were invested. Specifically, respondents\nwere asked: Were you able to choose how the\nmoney in your account is invested? How is the\nmoney in this account invested? Is it mostly in\nstocks, mostly in interest-earning assets, is it\nsplit evenly between these, or what? The three\nresponses are mostly (51 percent) or all stocks;\nmostly (51 percent) or all interest-earning as-\nsets; and split evenly between the two (see\nPapke [1997] for a detailed description).\n\nI restrict the sample to participants in DC\nplans. There are 232 participants in such plans\n"

This statement would be much\ntoo superficial from a historian's point of view. But as | said,\n| am not going to try to write the history of econometrics.\nThe status of general economics was more or less as\nfollows. There were lots of deep thoughts, but a lack of\nquantitative results. Even in simple cases where it can be\nsaid that some economic magnitude is influenced by only\none causal factor, the question of how strong is the influence\nstill remains. It is usually not of very great practical or even\nscientific interest to know whether the influence is positive or\nnegative, if one does not know anything about the strength.\nBut much worse is the situation when an economic magni-\ntude to be studied is determined by many different factors at\nthe same time, some factors working in one direction, others\nin the opposite directions. One could write long papers\nabout so-called tendencies explaining how this factor might\nwork, how that factor might work and so on. But what is the\nanswer to the question of the total net effect of all the\nfactors? This question cannot be answered without mea-\nsures of the strength with which the various factors work in\ntheir directions. The fathers of modern econometrics, led by\nthe giant brains of Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen, had the\n",

DIFFICULTIES\n\nThere were many scholars, first of all Ragnar Frisch, who\nbegan to see dangerous pitfalls in the attempts to draw\ninformation about economic interrelationships from ob-\nserved data. The most formidable among these difficulties\nwere connected with the old-time enemy of statisticians; the\nphenomenon of so-called spurious correlation. This expres-\nsion refers to the danger of drawing hasty conclusions about\ncause and effect from observed connections between two\nor more economic variables. Ragnar Frish used to imprint\nhis warnings on this point upon his students by giving the\nfollowing horrifying illustration. It can be observed that there\nis a high positive intercorrelation between the number of flies\non the western coast of Norway and the number of tourists\nvisiting that region. From this observation it is probably not\na very good idea to try to promote tourism by breeding more\nflles. But the phenomenon of spurious correlation has a\nmore intricate form which is often much harder to discover.\nIf we have what we think is a good and reasonably well-\nfounded theory of some interrelation within a group of\neconomic variables, and the observed facts do not seem to\ncontradict such a theory, we may still be misled, because\nthe same apparent interrelation may often be produced by\nmany different models of economic structures.\n\nOn this basis Ragnar Frisch was also to some extent\ncritical of Jan Tinbergens extensive numerical work. Person-\nally, | think Tinbergen saw most of the pitfalls and avoided\nthem in his actual work, while perhaps he did not write so\nmuch about the subject in a general way as did Ragnar\nFrisch.\n\nFor my own part | was lucky enough to be able to visit the\nUnited States in 1939 on a scholarship. (For reasons beyond\nmy control the visit lasted for about 7 years, but that is\nanother story.) | then had the privilege of studying with the\nworld famous statistician Jerzy Neyman in California for a\ncouple of months. At that time, young and naive, | thought I\n",

Their program was to use avail-\nable statistical material in order to extract information about\nhow an economy works. Only in this way could one get\nbeyond the state of affairs where talk of tendencies was\nabout all one could have as a result from even the greatest\nbrains in the science of economics.\n\nThe work of quantifying economic interrelations was taken\nup with great enthusiasm and the volume of quantitative\nresults grew very rapidly.\n\nThere could be no doubt that the future of economic\nscience depended in a most important way upon the pos-\nsibilities of such measurements as I have briefly indicated. I\nmay mention that another prize winner, Paul Samuelson, has\nmade this extremely clear although approaching the matter\nfrom a different angle. He has showed that we need quan-\ntitative information, not only to predict a possible state of\naffairs of an economic community, but also to be able to say\nsomething about whether such a possible state of affairs\nwould remain stable over time.\n\n| hope this brief sketch, although highly inadequate, may\nServe as a background for the next chapter of econometrics\n| am going to touch upon.\n",

INTRODUCTION\n\nSome of you here in this distinguished audience, and\nperhaps many of my colleagues who are not present, might\nsay that the title | have chosen for this lecture is a strange\nand artificial construction. What has the abstract topic of\neconometrics to do with the very practical problems con-\nnected with the operation of a welfare state? In the course of\nthis presentation | shall try to the best of my ability to\ndemonstrate why I think it is not too farfetched to see some\nconnection between the two fields.\n\nTo do this | have, unfortunately, to take you on a detour\ninto the evolution of econometrics. | do this not in order to\nwrite the history of econometrics, but in the hope of giving\nsome weight to the conclusions that I will draw towards the\nend of this lecture.\n\nThis detour may have a by-product which may be of some\ninterest. | have often been asked, even by scholars on a very\nhigh level, whether econometrics is not a rather abstract and\ndry branch peripheral to the science of economics in gen-\neral. | think | have a fairly convincing negative answer to such\na question. At least five of those scholars who have previ-\nously received the prize for which | am now here, have made\nit a central part of their research to show that without\neconometrics in the center of economic research, the sci-\nence of economics might not have reached beyond the\nstage of general talk, without really useful results. | shall get\nback to this in the course of my lecture.\n\n| should perhaps make a final introductory remark before\n| go on with my presentation. In the following | shall often use\nthe word \"|\" instead of \"we\". | should really use \"we\"\nbecause | certainly do not have any exclusive claims on\nresults that | may mention in this lecture. When I say \"'I\" it is\nto protect my fellow econometricians from being responsi-\nble for what | may say in the way of presenting results or for\nthe, perhaps subjective, judgments | am going to offer.\n",

The three pillars on\nwhich an analysis of society ought to rest are studies of\neconomic, socio-demographic and environmental phenom-\nena. Naturally enough, accounting ideas are most devel-\noped in the economic context, and it is to this that | shall\ndevote much of my time, but they are equally applicable in\nthe other two fields. By organising our data in the form of\naccounts we can obtain a coherent picture of the stocks and\nflows, incomings and outgoings of whatever variables we\nare interested in, whether these be goods and services,\nhuman beings or natural resources, and thence proceed to\nanalyse the system of which they form part. The function of\nthe national accounts in this process can perhaps be better\nunderstood if ! illustrate it with a diagram.\n\nIn the first box of diagram 1 we have our facts, organised\nas far as possible into a coherent set of accounts. Given this\nquantitative framework, we can formulate some hypotheses,\nor theories, about the technical and behavioural relation-\nships that connect them. By combining facts and theories\nwe can construct a model which when translated into\nquantitative terms will give us an idea of how the system\nunder investigation actually works. Since no system works\n",

This implies formulating some aims, and by\nintroducing these aims into our descriptive model we can\nsketch out a policy. But for practical purposes this is not the\nend. The policy model needs to be combined with a set of\ncontrols which specify the way in which we propose to\nrealise the policy, thus enabling us to draw up a plan. This\nplanning model can now be run through the computer to\nshow us the probable repercussions of the intended\nchanges throughout the system. But since no model-builder\nhowever sagacious can think of everything and no model\nhowever detailed can reflect all the complexities of the real\nworld, it is likely that when the plan is actually put into\npractice, events will reveal its deficiencies. This experience\nwill lead us to reconsider the facts we took into account and\nour methods of recording and measuring them, the theories\nwe used in relating them, the precise aims we thought\ndesirable, and the controls to be used in achieving these\naims. As experience feeds back to modify facts, theories,\naims and controls, so the whole picture will change and\nhopefully we shall get a better model, a better policy and a\nbetter plan.\n\nThe process ! have described is not just the concern of the\nscientist. He is involved in collecting and ordering facts, in\nformulating theories and in building models. But aims and\npolicies are primarily the concern of the politician, and\ncontrols and plans are primarily the concern of the admin-\nistrator. It is not easy for these three to understand each\nother and there is a pressing need to diminish the difficulties\nof communication between them.\n\nDiagram 1 brings out the ultimate purpose of the work\nwhich is my main concern in this lecture and is represented\nby the box labelled *facts'.

The upshot of the anal-\nysis is that investment-specific technological\nchange explains close to 60 percent of the\ngrowth in output per hours worked.

            "found": "The year 1996 marked the 50th anniversary\nof what has turned out to be an enormously\nsuccessful institutional innovation: the Coun-\ncil of Economic Advisers (CEA ). It was nei-\nther obvious nor inevitable that the CEA\nwould enjoy the success it has had. Who\nwould have thought that a group of academics,\ntypically with little or no experience with pol-\nitics or realpolitik, would not only survive in\nthe rough-and-tumble of Washington, but also\nthrive and have some influence over policy?\nTo be sure, the CEA's influence has fluctuated\nand has had to be established anew with each\nadministration. But the durability of the in-\nstitution, despite repeated reexaminations, is\na testimony to the contribution that it has\nmade in both Democratic and Republican\nadministrations.\n\nI. The Challenge to the CEA\n\nMy appointment as Chairman of the Coun-\ncil coincided with one of these reexamina-\ntions. Indeed, virtually on the day my\nappointment was announced, the House Ap-\npropriations Subcommittee announced that the\nCEA budget was being zeroed out. Lacking\nany sense of paranoia, I did not take this per-\nsonally. Instead, I used the opportunity pro-\nvided by this challenge to make the case for\nthe CEA both to the Congress and to a more\ngeneral audience. The outpouring of support,\nnot just from past CEA chairs, but also from\neconomists throughout the country, for this\nobscure agency with a staff of 35 and a budget\nof under $3.5 million was heartening. There\nwas also television and media interest and\nwidespread editorial support from, among oth-\ners, the New York Times, the Washington Post,\n\n* World Bank, Washington, DC 20433. At the time this\npaper was written, the author was Chairman of the Council\nof Economic Advisers, Executive Office of the President.\n\n109\n\nthe Washington Times, and the Chicago\nTribune.\n\nThe reason for the attack on the Council was\nsimple: in an era of budget stringency, every\nagency needed to be reexamined. There was per-\nhaps a desire for a trophy: an agency that could\nbe eliminated entirely. Commerce or Energy\nwould have been bigger trophies, but as the say-\ning goes, a bird in the hand is worth two in the\nbush, and the CEA looked like easy prey.\n\nAs I met with members of Congress and re-\nsponded to press and television interviews, I\nmade a few simple points. I welcomed the\nscrutiny: that was Congress's responsibility.\nAnd I felt confident that we would pass any\ncost\u2014 benefit test: the money saved from just\none of the many bad projects the CEA had\nhelped stop (such as the supersonic trans-\nport [SST] and high-definition television\n[HDTV ]) would have been enough to provide\nus with a permanent endowment. Furthermore,\nideas that the CEA had been pushing for years,\nsuch as tradable permits ( which were dis-\ncussed in the Economic Report of the Presi-\ndent as early as 1971) and spectrum auctions,\nwere finally being put into practice and prov-\ning their worth.\n\nAlthough the outpouring of support de-\nfended our importance, it gave rise to another\nquestion: if we were so important, why were\nwe so obscure? I pointed out that, in some\nsense, we should be obscure: we were meant\nto be advisers to the President, not media stars.\nWe are most effective as inside players. In-\ndeed, some Council chairs had gone so far as\nto refuse to testify before Congress. We are\nnot, and should not be, the Administration's\npublic mouthpiece on economic matters. Be-\ning such would, in almost any administration,\nput the Council chair in the compromising po-\nsition of trying to defend an important eco-\nnomic decision with which he or she might\ndisagree, forcing the unpleasant dilemma of\neither compromising the CEA's reputation for\n"

There is, how-\never, continuing disagreement about both the\nmagnitude of this disproportionate vulnerabil-\nity and the principal driving forces generating\nit Harry Holzer (1994) has examined some\nkey issues via an assessment of the relative\nmerits of arguments advanced by Lawrence\nMead and William Wilson in a 1987 dialogue\n(Focus, 1987). In essence, Mead's argument\nis that most employment problems of young\nblack males stem from their unwillingness to\naccept existing low-wage jobs. In contrast,\nWilson claims that structural changes in the\neconomy have eliminated many jobs that\nyoung black males would previously have ac-\nquired. This analysis reviews additional stud-\nies relevant to the Mead- Wilson debate and\nHolzer's interpretations of the available evi-\ndence, focusing on the interplay among (a)\nmanifestations of economic discrimination,\n(b) earnings and employment differentials,\nand (c) international, national, regional, and\nsectoral employment shifts. Where appropri-\nate, the focus of the discussion is expanded to\nencompass all black workers.\n\nI. Changes in the Manifestation\nof Labor-Market Discrimination\n\nThe differential vulnerability of African-\nAmericans to changes in the economy is layered\non top of patterns of preexisting earnings and\nunemployment differentials, and various mani-\nfestations of economic discrimination. The\nMead argument is one variant of theories that\nposit a declining impact of discrimination on the\noutcomes experienced by black workers. Spe-\n\n* Department of Labor Studies and Industrial Rela-\ntions, Penn State University, University Park, PA 16802.\n\n315\n\ncifically, the Mead formulation can be charac-\nterized as a ''dysfunctional culture'' or\n**'jnadequate cultural capital\" model. While\nsuch explanations do not assert that all discrim-\nination has vanished, it is typically hypothesized\nthat the principal contemporary manifestation of\ndiscrimination is ''statistical,\"\" rather than orig-\ninating with the individual tastes and preferences\nof employers. This *'sanitized\"\" form of discrim-\nination places major responsibility on victims to\nmodify behavior to alter employers' perceptions\nin search of equitable treatment.\n\nAlthough Holzer (1994) discusses studies\nsuggesting that employers' tastes and prefer-\nences still contribute significantly to employ-\nment problems experienced by blacks, he\ngravitates heavily toward ''statistical discrim-\nination\"\" as the principal form operative in\ncontemporary labor markets. There is no\nquestion that statistical discrimination is a sig-\nnificant problem, as indicated by studies in-\nvolving interviews with employers. These\nstudies have indicated that employers were re-\nluctant to hire black males based on experi-\nences with current and previous employees,\nwhich presumably revealed skill, motivation,\nand attitudinal problems. However, the recent\nuse of audit techniques to examine employ-\nment discrimination provides important evi-\ndence that statistical discrimination operates in\nmore complex ways. Holzer (1994) cites re-\ncent studies in which employers were pre-\nsented with observationally equivalent paired\nindividuals with respect to all relevant produc-\ntivity characteristics, who differed only by\nrace. These studies, along with that of Marc\nBenedict et al. (1994), revealed systematic\nbias against black job applicants. Holzer\n(1994) suggests, however, that a statistical-\ndiscrimination explanation is still feasible if\nemployers make decisions based on unobserv-\nable perceptions about **work ethic.''\n\nIt is not at all clear that such an explanation\nis sufficient to explain persisting problems of\ndiscrimination experienced by black workers\n"

This work\nis drawn from the author's dissertation research, and was\naccomplished during an internship at the Office of Tax\nAnalysis (OTA), U.S. Treasury Department. Appreciation\nis expressed to OTA for access to the data and the provi-\nsion of facilities which were necessary to complete the\nwork. Special thanks go to David Joulfaian for very kind\nlogistical support during the revision. I am grateful to\nJoseph Altonji, Charles De Bartolome, Chris Flinn, Roger\nGordon, David Joulfaian, Myoung-Jae Lee, Dave Ribar,\nMark Roberts, David Shapiro, Charles Wilson, the partic-\nipants at the 1991 Institute for Research on Poverty Sum-\nmer Workshop, and anonymous referees for their valuable\nsuggestions. I am responsible for any remaining errors.\nThe views in this paper are those of the author, and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of the Treasury Department.\n\n! The exact figure is unknown. Based on estate tax data\ndiscussed in Marvin Schwartz (1988) and Mary F. Bentz\n(1984), a rough calculation is that in 1982 about $200\nbillion was transferred at death. This is in line with Harry\nL. Gutman's (1979) also rough estimate of $131 billion\ntransferred at death in 1977.\n\n? Again, the exact amount inherited by children is un-\nknown. The marital deduction is approximately one third\nof aggregate gross estates (see Bentz, 1984). From the\nsmaller sample used in this paper, children's inheritances\nare twice the level of bequests to spouses. Combining\nthese two figures leads to the rough estimate of two thirds.\nRobert B. Avery and Michael S. Rendall (1994) estimate\nthat children inherited $39.4 billion in 1990, but note this\nis likely an underestimate.\n"

For example, Friedel Bolle (1990) contends that\nfor small payoffs (that is, less than $100) changing the\nsize of the prize only marginally affects behavior.

A key question is whether ''recycling\"' the rev-\nenues in this way can make the overall cost of the revenue-\nneutral policy zero or negative.

Beetsma and Frederick van der Ploeg (1996) present\na model in which more inequality in nominal wealth leads\nto more inflation. There always exists a unique equilib-\nrium in their model and as such it differs from the current\nmodel. Beetsma and van der Ploeg test their model on a\ncross section of democratic countries, where a measure of\nincome inequality replaces the measure of nominal wealth\ninequality, because the latter is not available on a com-\nparable cross-country basis. The tests suggest a positive\nassociation between inflation and inequality.\n"

The WTO came into existence on 1 January 1995 to,\ninter alia, facilitate the administration of the WTO agree-\nments that emerged from the Uruguay Round, one of\nwhich is the revised 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs\nand Trade (i.e., GATT 1994b).\n\n?

The extent of discrimination in\nregional agreements is related to the ease of accession of\nnon parties and the openness of the agreements in general.\n\n* The three are Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong. There\nwere 128 Members of GATT, and following the comple-\ntion of domestic ratification and WTO accession proce-\ndures, there will be approximately 160 members of the\nWTO in the next few years. There are presently 120\nmembers.\n\n^ There are many excellent contributions to this debate;\nsee, for example, Richard Snape, et al. (1993), Jagdish\nBhagwati (1995), and WTO (1995).\n"

Baye is also\ngrateful to the Tinbergin Institute for its hospitality during\nthe summer of 1994, when part of this work was\ncompleted.\n\n! The creation of independent competing divisions is\nthe essence of the M-form (multidivisional) structure dis-\ncussed by Oliver E. Williamson (1975). In the case of\nGeneral Motors, Alfred P. Sloan (1963 p. 106) indicates\nthat divisional autonomy was established early on: ''Ac-\ncording to General Motors plan of organization ... the ac-\ntivities of any specific Operation are under the absolute\ncontrol of the General Manager of that Division, subject\nonly to very broad contact with the general officers of the\n\n223\n\n,\n\nCorporation.\" Moreover, this independence has been\nmaintained, as evidenced by a recent description in\nMoody's Industrial Manual (1993 p. 1184) of the GM\noperating divisions: '*... each of which is a self-contained\nadministrative unit with a general manager responsible for\nall functional activities of his division.\" A similar level\nof autonomy is granted to the operating divisions of the\nother major automobile manufacturers.\n\n? See, for example, the accounts in Alfred D. Chandler\n(1962) and Sloan (1963).\n\n*This is easily established by a casual perusal of\nEdmunds 1994 New Car Prices (1994). For example, Gen-\neral Motors produces the LeSabre (Buick Motor Division)\nand the Olds 88 (Oldsmobile Division) which, while dif-\nfering in styling, are built on the same chassis and, com-\nparably equipped, sell for virtually identical prices.\nSimilarly, the Ford Motor Co. produces the Sable\n(Lincoln-Mercury Division) and the Taurus (Ford Divi-\nsion), which are effectively the same car with different\nname plates, as are the Chrysler Corporation's Plymouth\nVoyager and Dodge Caravan. Indeed, in just about every\nprice range, all of the major domestic manufacturers have\nseveral divisions producing competing products. The only\nexception would appear to be the relatively small high-\nprice premium-quality market, which is inhabited by a sin-\ngle division of each firm (Lincoln, Cadillac, and Chrysler).\n"

AII\nerrors in fact or interpretation are our own.\n\nIn The American Junior College, Arthur Cohen and\nFlorence Brawer (1982 pp. 5\u20146) define the junior col-\nlege as, *...any institution accredited to award the\nassociate's in arts or science as its highest degree.\"\nThis definition includes comprehensive two-year col-\nleges and community colleges, and it excludes publicly\nfunded vocational schools, adult education centers, and\nmost proprietary schools. We will use the terms junior\ncollege, community college, and two-year college inter-\nchangeably.\n\n?Twenty percent of Federal Pell Grants, 10 percent\nof Guaranteed Student Loans (GSL's) and over\n20 percent of state expenditures for postsecondary\neducation go to community colleges. However, these\nestimates also understate the importance of two-year\ncolleges since they include subsidies to students who\nwould have gone to college in the absence of aid. We\n\n600\n\naliad rLOWwald ousslid, 17/7, Lati y Didall Ct di.,\n1981). Nevertheless, a number of authors\nhave expressed doubts about the labor-\nmarket value of a community-college educa-\ntion (e.g., see Fred Pincus, 1980; Kevin\nDougherty, 1987; Steven Brint and Jerome\nKarabel, 1989). Unfortunately, this skepti-\ncism is largely based upon the concentration\nof low-income students in community col-\nleges and the high student attrition rates,\nrather than any direct evidence on the eco-\nnomic value of such an education.^\n\ndraw the estimate of the proportion of Pell and GSL\nmoney spent at community colleges from the National\nCenter for Education Statistics, Undergraduate Financ-\ning of Postsecondary Education (1988 pp. 48-49). Kent\nHalstead (1989) estimates that the cost of a full-time-\nequivalent (FTE) enrollment at a community college is\nroughly 70 percent of the average. Since community-\ncollege students represent 30 percent of FTE enroll-\nment nationwide, we estimate that roughly 21 percent\nof state and local postsecondary education subsidies\nflow to community colleges.\n\nThese calculations are based upon Table 7.4 in\nManski and Wise (1983 p. 124).\n\n^More recently, W. Norton Grubb (1993) used the\nNLS-72 data to conclude that only A.A. degree recipi-\nents benefit from a community-college education and\nthat two-year-college drop-outs fared no differently\nthan high-school graduates with no postsecondary edu-\ncation. However, those results are due to computa-\ntional errors which, when corrected, yield results simi-\nlar to those reported here (Kane and Rouse, 1995).\n"

Compounded over the period\n1972-1987 for a sample of 22 industries, the results in\nBaily et al.

One\nremedy, proposed by both the Brady Com-\nmission and the Working Group on Finan-\ncial Markets, is to constrain trade with\n\"circuit breakers,\" such as price limits or\ntrading halts triggered by large price move-\nments.! According to the Brady Commis-\nsion, circuit breakers ^...cushion the im-\npact of market movements, which would\notherwise damage market infrastructure.\nThey protect markets and investors\"\n\n* Kodres: Board of Governors, Federal Reserve Sys-\ntem, 20th and C Streets, N.W., Mail Stop 91, Washing-\nton, DC 20551, and The University of Michigan School\nof Business Administration; O'Brien: Antitrust Divi-\nsion, U.S. Department of Justice, 555 4th Street, N.W.,\nWashington, DC 20001.

Each author blames\nthe other for any errors.\n\nPrice limits are upper and lower bounds on price\nmovements over some specified period of time. Trad-\ning halts prohibit trade for some specified period of\ntime after the price has moved some specified amount.\n\n919\n\n(Presidential Task Force on Market Mecha-\nnisms, 1988 p. 66).\n\nWhile some have echoed these conclu-\nsions, support for circuit breakers is far\nfrom unanimous. The most obvious criticism\nis that circuit breakers prevent mutually ad-\nvantageous trades that would occur volun-\ntarily. Moreover, limited or *stale\" prices\nmay fail to release ^...valuable information\nabout mispricing which will set in motion\nself-correcting forces\" (Sanford Grossman,\n1990 [appendix G2, p. 17]. These argu-\nments suggest that circuit breakers may be\nnothing more than \"sand in the gears\" of\nthe Walrasian mechanism, which hampers it\nfrom working efficiently.\n\nOne problem with these criticisms, how-\never, is that they are based on models that\nignore market imperfections that circuit\nbreakers are designed to address. An im-\nportant imperfection in asset markets iden-\ntified by the Brady Commission is the mar-\nkets limited capacity to absorb massive\none-sided shocks. In this paper we argue\nthat limited capacity causes trading delays\nthat have important welfare consequences\nduring periods of volatile price movements.\nWe show that when the risk of futures price\nmovements exists between the time risk-\naverse investors decide to trade and the\ntime their;.orders are executed (i.e., during\norder implementation), price limits may\npromote better risk-sharing than uncon-\nstrained trade. The risk of price movements\nduring order implementation is exacerbated\n"

And what is the role of\nincome distribution in the growth process?\nTo answer these old questions, we believe\none should explain why growth-promoting\npolicies are or are not adopted. In this\npaper we try to do just that by combining\ninsights from two recent strands of litera-\nture, namely, the theory of endogenous\ngrowth and the theory of endogenous pol-\nicy. We can summarize our tentative conclu-\nsion in a simple aphorism: inequality is\nharmful for growth.\n\nThe arguments that lead us to this con-\nclusion run as follows.

The incentives for such\nproductive accumulation hinge on the abil-\nity of individuals to appropriate privately\nthe fruits of their efforts, which in turn\ncrucially hinges on what tax policies and\nregulatory policies are adopted. In a society\nwhere distributional conflict is more impor-\ntant, political decisions are likely to result in\npolicies that allow less private appropriation\nand therefore less accumulation and less\ngrowth. But the growth rate also depends\non political institutions, for it is through the\npolitical process that conflicting interests ul-\ntimately are aggregated into public-policy\ndecisions.\n\nIn the paper we first formulate a sim-\nple general-equilibrium model that formally\ncaptures this idea. It is an overlapping-gen-\nerations model in which heterogeneous in-\ndividuals are born in every period and act as\neconomic agents and voters. The model's\npolitico-economic equilibrium determines a\nsequence of growth rates as a function\nof parameters and initial conditions. The\ngreater is income inequality, the .lower is\nequilibrium growth.\n\nNext, we confront the model's empirical\nimplications with two sets of data.

When multiple bidders obtain independent\nestimates of the lease value, then the bidder with the\nhighest estimate is likely to have overestimated the\nvalue. Bids are correlated with value estimates, so\nthe high bidder is also likely to have overestimated the\nvalue, and failure to correct for this bias can produce\nlarge losses. For an introductory discussion of the\nwinner's curse, see Paul Milgrom (1989) and Richard\nH. Thaler (1992 Ch. 5).\n\nJohn Kagel and Dan Levin (1986) report that losses\ndue to overbidding are more common in auctions with\nlarger numbers of bidders and that losses are not\neliminated by using subjects with previous experience\nin such auctions. For a review of more recent experi-\nmental studies, see Douglas D. Davis and Holt (1993\nCh. 5) and Kagel (1994).\n"

Here the two variables\nevolve in a slightly more complex pat-\ntern, as in Simon Kuznets's (1955)\nproposition about the curvilinear rela-\ntion between economic growth and in-\n\n* Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ 08540.\n\n343\n\nIn attempting to establish the true nature\nof the connection between political and eco-\nnomic progress, these various patterns have\nbeen found to prevail in some countries for\nsome periods, but it is now fairly clear that\nnone can claim to be predominant. This is\nconvincingly shown in the recent article by\nAdam Przeworski and Fernando Limongi\n(1993) on \"Political Regimes and Economic\nGrowth.\" Their careful and comprehensive\nreview of the literature is in the end thor-\noughly and discouragingly inconclusive. Un-\nder the circumstances, there is an almost\ncruelly mocking ring to the article's last\nsentence: \"Clearly, the impact of political\nregimes on growth is wide open for reflec-\ntion and research.\"\n\nOne reaction to this difficulty in establish-\ning a solid connection between economic\nand political progress is to revert to the idea\nthat economics and politics are two wholly\nseparate domains. As Stephan Haggard and\nRobert Kaufman (1992) noted, political sci-\nentists analyzed the recent wave of democ-\nratization in Latin America and Asia largely\nin such autonomous terms. This may well\nreflect disappointment over certain once\npopular, but by now discarded analyses of\npolitical events in the 1960's and 1970's\nwhich represented a last-ditch effort to un-\nderstand those events\u2014in particular, the\nturn to authoritarianism during that period\n\u2014in terms of \"underlying\" economic forces.\n\nHowever, this reversion to proclaiming\nthe autonomy of politics and economics may\nbe an overreaction. The two domains do ex-\nhibit many linkages that are quite intimate\n"

They have been cited\nas evidence of the relative success or de-\ncline of nations and also as predictors of\nfuture economic growth. The most authori-\ntative of these rankings come from the\nUnited Nations International Comparison\nProject (henceforth ICP) which uses de-\ntailed price data from some 60 countries to\nprovide comparisons based on purchasing-\npower parity. The ICP data have been ex-\ntrapolated both across countries and across\ntime by Robert Summers and Alan Heston\n(1984, 1988, 1991) to form the Penn World\nTable, which provides the basis for a growth\nindustry in the analysis of comparative eco-\nnomic performance.\n\nOur main purpose here is to examine the\nextent to which the published ICP rankings\ncan be relied upon to indicate whether the\n\"average citizen\" is actually better off in\none country than in another. Our concern\nstems from the fact that relative prices vary\nacross countries. For instance, the 1980 price\nof meat relative to medical care was 4.8\ntimes higher in Japan than in the United\nStates, and 5.4 times higher than in\nArgentina. Given wide price variation, any\nsingle price index measure such as the ICP's\n*average international prices\" (see United\nNations Commission on the European\nCommunities, 1986) is a dubious basis for\n\n*Centre for Economic Policy Research, Australian\nNational University, Canberra ACT 0200, Australia.\nCommunications for John Quiggin at (Internet)\njxq302(Qcoombs.anu.edu.au.

Our criterion for judg-\nment is the Samuelsonian revealed-prefer-\nence approach. If A could have afforded B's\nconsumption bundle (at A's prices) while B\ncould not afford A's bundle (at B's prices)\nthen we say that A is better off than B,\nbasing this judgment on an assumption of\ncommon tastes and optimizing behavior. If\nneither could have afforded the other's bun-\ndle, the revealed-preference ranking is am-\nbiguous.\n\nUsing detailed ICP price data to rank 60\ncountries, we find that there are indeed\nmany ambiguities. Typically, the ranking of\nany one country is indeterminate within a\nrange of five or six places. Also, when we\nmake allowance for variation in the quantity\nand price of leisure, 16 of the pairwise rank-\nings are reversed. Our general conclusion is\nthat rankings by constant price measures of\nGDP are reliable for the purpose of ranking\none group of countries of similar level of\ndevelopment against other groups, but they\nare not reliable for the purpose of intra-\ngroup rankings.\n\nA secondary purpose of the analysis pre-\nsented here is to test the hypothesis that\nthere are no systematic differences in tastes\nbetween countries. This is important be-\ncause the revealed-preference analysis re-\nlies on the maintained hypothesis of com-\nmon tastes. It is also of interest because it is\nwidely assumed that international differ-\nences in consumption patterns reflect dif-\nferences in tastes. A possible outcome of\nthe test presented here, namely, that for\nsome pair A,B each country's representa-\ntive consumer could afford the other's bun-\ndle, amounts to a rejection of the hypothesis\nof common tastes. Except at the highest\nlevel of aggregation across commodities, the\nmaintained hypothesis is not rejected for\nany of the 1,770 country pairs in our data\nset. This confirms the results of Irving Kravis\n"

Further, as argued in this paper,\nour seasonal cycles are dependent on the stage of the\nbusiness cycle. Finally, to the extent that some costs of\nadjustment are nonconvex, our model can be applied\nto a study of more general investment decisions.\n\nThis point is discussed in Cooper and Haltiwanger\n(1992a) and Kevin Murphy et al. (1989). In some sense,\nthe fluctuations induced by nonconvexities are similar\nto those produced in models of nonlinearities in that,\nfor both types of models, optimal choices can be very\nsensitive to variations in the underlying environment.\nAndrei Shleifer (1986) analyzes a model of cycles driven\nby the synchronized introduction of new innovations.\n"

One of\nthe most frequent examples used in an early\ncore chapter of every Principles book is of\nfarm price supports to illustrate a barrier to\nmarket-clearing that leads to surpluses, and\nof rent controls in New York or Berkeley as\na barrier that leads to shortages. Compara-\ntive economics broadens these examples to\nthe *butter mountain\" and * wine lake\" of\nthe European Community, or the endless\nwaiting in line that 400 million people expe-\nrienced before the recent collapse of com-\nmunism.\n\nBroadly conceived, comparative eco-\nnomics treats comparisons both across space\nand time. What do we learn about macro-\neconomics from the decade of high unem-\nployment in Europe in the 1980's compared\nto declining unemployment (from 1982 to\n1989) in the United States? Do we learn the\nsame thing from this cross-country compari-\nson at a point of time, the 1980's, as from a\ncross-time comparison for the United States\nin the 1980's with high unemployment in\nthe Great Depression of the 1930's? Is the\nAmerican Great Depression of the 1930's\nsimilar to or different from the European\nslump of the 1980's? We learn much about\nmacroeconomics by asking these questions\nwhich combine comparisons across space\nand time.\n\nComparative economics requires that we\nthink again about the boundaries of eco-\nnomic principles. We notice many differ-\nences in economic behavior and perfor-\nmance between nations. Do these illustrate\nold economic principles, like demand and\nsupply, or newer principles, like moral haz-\nard and asymmetric information? Alterna-\ntively, are some contrasts in economic per-\nformance among nations explained by basic\ndifferences that do not fit in neat boxes,\n",

Further discussion of the casu-\nalty-loss and medical-expense deductions appears in\nKaplow (1991b).\n\n!Tn the past, when restrictions were less substantial\nand marginal rates far higher, these provisions were\nrelatively more important. The illustration in Section I\nsuggests that the effects discussed here are plausible\neven at current marginal rates. The discussion is also\nrelevant to debates about appropriate limits on the\ndeductions and whether there should be deductions or\ncredits. In addition, there are important interactions\nbetween the deductibility of losses and the more heav-\nily studied issue (e.g., Mark V. Pauly, 1986) concerning\nthe exclusion of employer-paid health-insurance premi-\nums. For example, in determining the extent to which\nthe exclusion encourages excessive insurance, account\nmust be taken of the fact that the deductibility of\nuninsured losses has a countervailing influence (see\nKaplow, 1991b).\n"

            "found": "such delays are expected to increase by 360\npercent in central cities between 1985 and\n2005 (Federal Highway Administration).\nThe situation is not better in Europe. Con-\nstruction of highways and conventional toll\npricing appear financially or politically dif-\nficult. One alternative type of policy is the\nprovision of congestion-related information\nto users. Various information systems are\nbeing experimented with all over the world\nin the hope that providing better informa-\ntion to drivers will reduce congestion, fuel\nconsumption, and the number of accidents.!\nThese projects are usually costly (millions of\ndollars for each), and their scope is often\nlimited to a few thousand vehicles. Yet an-\nother type of policy is the medieval practice\nof having roads or bridges privately owned\nand priced. Unfortunately, there is little\neconomic analysis of these types of policy,\nwith the exception of Richard Arnott et al.\n(1988) who studied the impact of informa-\ntion in the presence of congestion. The pur-\npose of this article is to cast the analysis of\ninformation and pricing into the framework\nof game theory in order to shed some light\non questions such as: should there be provi-\nsion of congestion-related information, and\nshould privately priced roads be regulated?\n\n* Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, and\nUniversity of Geneva. My thanks go to Asher Wolinsky\nwho urged me to find simple intuition to explain the\nimpact of information in the presence of congestion\nand persuaded me to go ahead with this paper. Much\nof this work draws on my joint work with Richard\nArnott, Moshe Ben-Akiva, and Robin Lindsey and\ntheir influence should be clear. I also benefited from\nvarious discussions with Simon Anderson, Richard\nArnott, Philippe Jehiel, Len Mirman, and Xavier Vives.\nFinally, I thank Qin Liu for helpful suggestions.\n\nlFor example, U.S. programs include PATH in Cali-\nfornia, Travtek in Florida and ADVANCE in Illinois.\nSimilar programs are being developed in Europe\n(ALI-SCOUT in Germany and AUTOGUIDE in the\nUnited Kingdom) and in Japan (AMTICS and RACS).\n\n494\n\nConsider the simple traffic network illus-\ntrated in Figure 1. These are two origins, O,\nand O,, and two destinations, D, and D,;.\nDrivers travel from one origin to one desti-\nnation (alternatively, goods are being trans-\nported in this network). The total cost of\ntraversing an arc comprises a fixed cost plus\na congestion cost. The fixed costs associated\nto the links are denoted by a, b, c, and d. It\nis assumed that departures occur at the\nsame time and that it takes one period of\ntime to cross one link. User cost on a link\nduring a time interval is proportional to the\nnumber of drivers traversing that link dur-\ning that time interval; for example, for the\nleft route corresponding to O, \u2014 D,, a driver\nincurs a cost equal to Cq, \u2014 a * b t 0(n,, *\n13) where a and b are fixed costs and n,\n(respectively, n4,) is the number of drivers\ncrossing *'link a\" in the first period (link b\nin the second period) and 6 is a positive\nparameter measuring the impact of conges-\ntion. The fixed costs (a, b, c, and d) in-\ncrease when road conditions deteriorate\n(due to weather conditions, for instance),\nand the parameter 0 depends negatively on\nroad capacity (a higher value of 0 corre-\nsponds, for example, to an accident which\nreduces road capacity). Similarly, costs for\nother routes and other origin-destination\npairs can be derived. In this section all\nparameters are assumed to be fixed and\nknown by the drivers.\n\nIn transportation research, user equilib-\nrium is traditionally computed for a contin-\nuum of agents. The continuous approach\n(used in Section III) guarantees the exis-\ntence of a unique equilibrium (see Martin\nBeckmann et al., 1956). In this and the next\nsection, we propose a discrete approach in\nwhich a single representative agent (packet\nor platoon of vehicles) is associated with\neach O-D pair. The discrete approach,\nalthough unconventional in transportation\n"

            "found": "Many would agree with Samuel Johnson\nthat *a decent provision for the poor is a\ntrue test of civilization.\" Yet still there is\nmuch debate about what form poverty relief\nshould take. Particularly controversial is the\nclaim that recipients of relief should be\nrequired to work in exchange for benefits.\n\nThe use of work requirements in poverty-\nalleviation programs is of widespread sig-\nnificance. Perhaps the most notorious\nhistorical example is the English system,\ninstituted by the Poor Law of 1834, in which\npoor relief was granted through residence\nin a workhouse. Workfare was also common\nin ancien r\u00e9gime France, where relief was\ngranted in \"charity workshops.\" But work-\nfare schemes are by no means just relics\nfrom the past. They remain popular in both\ndeveloped and less developed countries to-\nday. In the United States, for example, a\nnumber of states now demand that welfare\nclaimants enroll in either a training or work\nprogram in order to receive benefits.! Simi-\nlarly, current practice in India relies heavily\non public-works projects as a tool for pro-\nviding poor relief.?\n\n* Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University,\nPrinceton, NJ 08544, and Department of Economics,\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, 3718 Locust Walk,\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104, respectively. We are grateful\nto many people for helpful comments, discussions, and\nsuggestions. We particularly thank our anonymous ref-\nerees, David Bradford, Anne Case, Sandy Korenman,\nJim Mirrlees, Bill Rogerson, Sharon Tennyson, Martin\nWeitzman, and Richard Zeckhauser. They bear no\nresponsibility for the product. This work began while\nwe were attending the summer workshop at Warwick\nUniversity in July 1988. We are grateful for the support\nand hospitality of the Department of Economics. We\nalso gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the\nJohn M. Olin Program for the study of Economic\nOrganization and Public Policy at Princeton University.\n\nlFor some recent discussion of such programs see\nJudith M. Gueron (1990).\n\n?See, for example, Martin Ravallion (1991), which\nconsiders the screening potential of the Maharastra\nEmployment Guarantee scheme in India.\n\n249\n\nThere are many arguments made in favor\nof work requirements in poverty-alleviation\nprograms. One consistent theme, however,\nis that work requirements serve to provide\nthe \"appropriate incentives\" for recipients\nof poor relief. Thus, this paper provides a\ndetailed exploration of the incentive case\nfor workfare. We analyze two distinct incen-\ntive arguments: a screening argument that\nwork requirements may serve as a means of\ntargeting transfers and a deterrent argument\nthat they may serve as a device to encour-\nage poverty-reducing investments. Familiar\nnotions from the economics of incentives?\nare shown to provide insights into modern-\nday social policy and historical debates.\n\nThe screening argument is motivated by a\ndesire to direct poor support toward the\ntruly needy. In developing economies, it is\ntypically too costly for the government to set\nup a sophisticated administrative machinery\nto determine whether a particular individ-\nual is in need of poor support. Even infor-\nmation about individuals incomes is un-\nlikely to be available in this way. In such\nsituations, it may be better to make the\nrelief system self-targeting by laying down\nconditions for claiming support such that\nonly the truly needy present themselves. A\nwork requirement is one such test. As Jean\nP. Dreze (1990) makes clear, this logic lay\nbehind British administrators\" reliance on\npublic works to relieve famines in colonial\nIndia. Moreover, as confirmed by Michael\nB. Katz (1986), it was also a common theme\nin early arguments for work requirements in\nthe United States.\n\nThere may even be a screening role for\nwork requirements in developed countries,\nwhere the. administrative infrastructure\nmakes it easier to assess the circumstances\n\n3See, for example, Jean-Jacques Laffont (1990) for\nan overview of the main ideas on which our analysis\ndraws.\n"

The usual\ncaveats apply.\n\nlJfeffery Williamson (1977 p. 3) provides extensive\ncitations to the work of a number of social scientists\nincluding two Nobel laureates who have dealt with the\nquestion. Two recent studies by Mo-Yin Tam and\nJoseph Persky (1982) and David Betson and Robert\nHaveman (1984) investigate the question of converging\nregional income inequality, both finding greater in-\nequality in the South. Betson and Haveman focus on\nthe role of transfers in reducing regional inequality and\nconsider a number of related issues, including changes\nin inequality among states and across time.\n\n?Average real earnings are an important aspect of\nregional economic differences. Phillip Coelho and\nMoheb Ghali (1971, 1973) and Donald Bellante (1979)\npresent evidence showing that, when adjusted for cost-\nof-living and human-capital differences, the North-\nSouth earnings differential had disappeared by 1969.\nBellante (p. 173) attributes 62 percent of the nominal\nwage difference in 1969 to cost-of-living differences\nand 38 percent to human-capital-related demographic\ncharacteristics. More recently, Stephen Farber and\nRobert Newman (1987) present evidence that adjusted\nmean earnings in the South exceeded mean earnings in\nthe Northeast in 1979. Consistent with other recent\nstudies, we find that mean incomes converged in 1979.\n"

In fact, the term winner's curse was\nfirst introduced in the literature by petroleum geolo-\ngists (E. C. Capen et al., 1971) in order to characterize\nwhat they believed to have been the outcome of bid-\nding on outer-continental-shelf (OCS) oil-lease sales\nfor the period 1954\u20141969 (also see the references cited\nin KL [p. 894] and Wilson's [1990] review of field data\non the winner's curse).\n"
