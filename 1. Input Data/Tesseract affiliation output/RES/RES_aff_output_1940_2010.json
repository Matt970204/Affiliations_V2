Such a result may be sought as a conscious objective\n(as in the case of Mrs. Robinson, Mr. Lerner and numerous others), or it may come\nabout ''unconsciously \" (as illustrated by Mr. Smith's analysis of '' discontinuous\ncurves \") in the form of a misinterpretation of the analysis subsequent to the sub-\ntraction.

But the value of this bond-\nholding cannot be derived from the N-line without further information of how the\ntransactions are carried out. The N-line only indicates the cumulated bond purchases.\nBut moving down along the liquidity curve, the banks' bond purchases within each\nj$eriod can be performed at prices continuously rising from the minimum price pre-\nvailing at the beginning of the period to the maximum price prevailing at the end of\nthe period, or e.g. all the bonds can be bought at the maximum price. The liquidity\nfunction can be just the same but then implies different nwmbers of bonds sold to the\nbanks. And this makes a difference considering the actual value of the bond-holding\nof the banks at any given rate of interest.\n\nThe special problem considered has a bearing in general on the meaning of the\nliquidity function. The traditional liquidity function need not be unambiguous even\nwhen it can be supposed to be stable. It must be referred to an underlying relation\nbetween the numbers of bonds actually sold when moving discontinously along the\nliquidity curve. This relation explicitly states the way in which the bond transactions\nare carried out. Different numbers of bonds can be sold in such ways that they can be\nillustrated by a single liquidity curve. For that reason a discussion of the meaning of\nfrequency curves of bond sales actually carried out at successively moving prices is\nlogically primary to the drawing of liquidity curves. This whole problem of the nature\nof the liquidity function has not at all been considered here. The ambiguity of the\ncurve has only been discussed as an implication of the model sequence presented in this\npaper.\n\nUjjpsala, Sweden.

The\nliquidity function of the public cannot be used in the same way. Proving that in a\nnew equilibrium N finally corresponds to & according to the given relation simply\nmeans a second-hand registering. But even in this strong case for concentrating on\nthe liquidity function of the banks, the liquidity functions of the public can obviously\nnot be disregarded, but on the contrary has to be treated simultaneously and in\nparallel manner.\n\nAs a matter of fact the M-line can hardly be given independently of the N-line.\nThe bigger the speculative cash that the public holds at any given rate of interest,\nthe more bonds must the banks buy, until the primary increase of cash is finally\nabsorbed by their speculative cash-holding. This is sof reflected in the M-line (which\nis an imperfection), since the speculative cash-holding of the banks at any given rate\nof interest cannot possibly be assumed to be independent of their corresponding\nholding of bonds.! The flatter the N-line is, the flatter the M-line ought to be. In that\ncase it is not possible to use a given M-line if due regard has not already been taken\nto the slope of the N-line. A shift in the N-line causes a shift in the M-line too.\n\nWorking with a single, given liquidity function means that the combined holding\nof cash and bonds must be given for ary point of the liquidity curve. This presumption\nholds, e.g., in the case when a liquidity curve is used to describe the effect of open\nmarket operations. Expansive open market operations lower the rate of interest\nalong the liquidity curve and the cash increase just reflects the disappearance of bonds\ntaken over by the central bank. Such an unambiguous substitution is presupposed\nwhen using a determinate liquidity function describing the determination of the\nrate of interest. But in the model, the combination of cash and bond-holding of the\nbanks is not given for any point of the M-line independently of the N-line. (In Fig. 1\nthe sum of the increases of the cash and the bonds of the banks at any rate of interest\nis measured by the horizontal distance between the N- and the M-lines.) Therefore\nanother liquidity function of the banks has to be used when handling the model's\ncase as compared with handling the more simple case of explaining the effect of open\nmarket operations and disregarding the transactions of the public. It is to be noticed\nthat the suggested shiftability of the liquidity function of the banks appears al-\nthough expectations of the rate of interest are not assumed to have changed at all.\nBoth types of shifting calls for a dynamic analysis and in many cases certainly cannot\notherwise be taken into account.\n\nThe liquidity function of the public is in the model not ambiguous in the same\nway as the banks'. At any point on the N-line the sum of the public's holding of\nbonds and cash is independent of the M-line and can be treated as a datum. The\nbond purchases and sales of the banks act as a kind of open market operations along\nthe N-line. But since the primary increase of money does not even refer to the\nliquidity function of the public the N-line cannot separately determine the final\nequilibrium. The M-line determines the final equilibrium but depends on the slope\nof the N-line. There is thus no choice available between the two definitions of the\n\" quantity of money,\" for neither the banks' nor the public's liquidity function is in\nthis case by itself enough to describe the determination of the rate of interest.\n\nThe accumulation of the banks' bond-holding is measured along the N-line\n(Fig. x), which at the same time indicates changes in deposits and in the bond trans-\nactions of the banks. An increase of deposits means an increase in the banks' bond-\nholding calculated at cost ?rice.

This gives the same type of process\nas in the first application of equation (6) but without its inconvenient assumption\nabout the rigidity of the banks' reactions. This assumption was originally introduced\nto facilitate the illustration of the mechanism by model sequences as in the table\nand in Fig. 2.\n\nThe model does not claim to be a tool immediately applicable to handling credit\nmarket problems or even suited for statistical testing. The linear form of the equations\nemphasises its character of an arithmetical exercise. But the mechanism is founded\non an important phenomenon, i.e. the more or less unexpected reflux of money to the\nbanks. This mechanism certainly holds whether the banking system is integrated or\nconsists of a multitude of independent banks. It is also important to notice the\ndifferentiation of the model that makes it possible to consider this and other factors\nin the determination of the rate of interest. The model presented in this paper can be\nextended to a more complete picture of the price formation of the credit market\nwithout losing its main feature of putting the problem from a primarily '' monetary \"'\npoint of view. Introducing, e.g., investment (and thereby bank loans and the floatation\nof private bonds) as a function of the rate of interest new types of supply or demand for\ncredit can be treated systematically. But such an extension of the analysis goes far\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n\nSoME IMPLICATIONS OF THE MODEL\n\nA glance at Fig. 1 shows that the primary cash increase together with the banks'\nliquidity function determine the equilibrium position of the rate of interest, although\nthe liquidity function of the public immediately determines the rate of interest in\neach period. The cash-holding of the public only indirectly influences the final position\nvia the reserve cash needed by the banks. The flatter the N-line is, the bigger is ceteris\nfaribus the reserve cash that the banks must hold at every rate of interest and the\nhigher is the final equilibrium rate caused by any given cash increase. In this con-\nnection the question can be raised which is the most suitable definition of '\"' the\nquantity of money,\" i.e. which liquidity function shall be primarily used in interest\nrate theory. Keynes stressed the relation between deposits and the rate of interest.?\nScandinavian writers pay more attention to the banks' claims on the central bank?\nwhen explaining the determination of the rate of interest. As far as this model holds\nattention obviously ought to be paid simultaneously to both liquidity functions.\n\nThe M-line and the N-line separately indicate a relation between a '\"' quantity\nof money \"' and the rate of interest. In the model chosen we start with a change in\nthe banks' total cash, which then remains unchanged period after period. Disregarding\nreserve cash the liquidity function of the banks therefore directly indicates the final\n\n1 Even if the reflux of money is completely foreseen by the banks, they can hardly be assumed to\nanticipate the final equilibrium level of the rate of interest, and in any case can only reach it by disposing\nof the money reflux step by step.\n\n1 Cf.

As is indicated by the figure, the oscillation is enclosed\nby the first two values of the series and successively moves towards an equilibrium\n(R.) situated between them. This damped oscillation can be transformed to an\nexploding one by a slight change in the assumptions. Assume that c \u2014 o, 3 instead of\n\u20ac \u2014 0. The line in the right bottom quadrant will be only slightly moved to the right,\nbut this change is sufficient to get an exploding series of the rate of interest.\n\nThe oscillations are caused principally by the same mechanism as in the cob-web\ntheorem. The banks' demand (supply) of bonds is assumed to be fixed at the beginning\nof each period and cannot be corrected until a succeeding period. This assumption of\nrigidity has been made to facilitate the illustration of the mechanism in a model\nsequence. The assumption appears to be reasonable, at least as long as the revisions\nof the plans do not run opposite to the performed transactions. This holds for the\nsmooth movement towards a new equilibrium. In this case the banks find throughout\nthat they have bought too little bonds and never correct their previous bond purchases\nby selling bonds. The model will then give about the same picture of the development\nas when it is assumed that\u2014as in reality\u2014the reserve cash and the speculative cash\nof the banks are continuously adjusted to changes in deposits and in the rate of interest.\n\nThe lack of realism of the strict timing of the events appear in those cases where\none period's bond purchases are corrected by bond sales in the next period. The\nassumed rigidity of the speculative cash of the banks dominates the development.\nThese drawbacks of the model can be eliminated by a slight change in the assumptions.\nThis can be made keeping the main feature of the mechanism but at the cost of using\nillustrating model sequences. The assumption is removed that the banks adjust their\nspeculative cash not until after a lag to those changes in the rate of interest that their\nown bond transactions have caused. It is more reasonable to assume that the banks,\nwhen trying to get rid of the surplus cash, simultaneously adjust the speculative cash\nto changes in the rate of interest.! According to this assumption equation (1) is changed\nso that M \"; will be determined by the same period's rate of interest R;. As a consequence\n\n1 Notice the opposite case when the banks try to eliminate a primary deficit of cash by selling bonds\u2014\nas a matter of fact without being able to increase their total cash-holding at all. A process analogous to\nthat described before then occurs, but with a continuously increasing rate of interest.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:42:39 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In the first round the rate of interest is forced down to\nthe level where the public is willing to hold the banks' cash surplus as speculative cash.\nBut after the bond transactions have been carried out the money returns to the banks as\nthe increase in speculative cash of the publicis deposited. The banks have to keep a part\nof that reflux of cash as a reserve against the increase of deposits. In addition the rate\nof interest has fallen, which is an incentive to the banks to hold a bigger speculative\ncash as compared with the situation at the starting point. If the whole reflux of money\nis not absorbed either as reserve cash or as speculative cash, there is a surplus which\nthe banks will again use for buying bonds and thereby lower the rate of interest. So\nthe process goes on possibly until an equilibrium level of the rate of interest is attained.\nAt that level the total primary increase of money is totally absorbed by the banks\npartly as reserve cash and partly as speculative cash. The increase in the banks' and\nin the public's speculative cash-holding corresponds to the lowering of the rate of\ninterest according to the given liquidity functions. The increase in the banks' reserve\ncash corresponds to the increase of the public's speculative cash, i.e. of deposits accord-\ning to the given reserve ratio.\n\nThis outline of a process can be stated in terms of a model sequence. In order to\ndefine the mechanism of the model the timing of events has to be fixed within each\nperiod. It is assumed that the whole surplus cash of the banks at the beginning of\neach period will buy bonds from the public ?ndefendently of the changes of the rate\nof interest that the bond purchases themselves cause during the same period. This\nassumption is made in order to simplify the model and to isolate the driving forces. It\nwill be removed later. It implies that the banks bid up bond prices until the public\nhas absorbed the whole surplus cash of the banks. The change in the rate of interest\nduring each period is therefore immediately determined by the banks' surplus cash at\nthe beginning of the period and by the public's liquidity function. But when the\nbanks' supply of cash (inelastic during the period) has been fixed at the beginning of\neach period and the bond transactions afterwards have been carried out, the surplus\ncash of the banks is only temporarily eliminated. At the end of the period the banks\nfind their total cash unchanged as compared with the situation before the bond\npurchases, and this causes a new decision in the next period. This more or less unex-\npected reflux of cash marks off the periods and carries the process forward.!\n\nOf course the assumption of bond purchases of fixed amounts followed by a\nperiodical reflux of cash is rather unrealistic. But changing to more realistic assump-\ntions does not change even the outlines of the model very much. The artificial timing\nof events represents a special variant of the mechanism of the credit market. It is\nselected because it seems suitable for the illustration of the mechanism with the help\nof a model sequence.\n\nThe model can be defined by a system of equations. At the beginning of each\nperiod (/) the banks' d\u00e9cision about their speculative cash (M'') depends on the rate\nof interest (R) at the end of the preceding period.

                    "Two Liquidity Functions and the Rate\nof Intetest: |. A Simple Dynamic Model\n\nThis paper contains a model describing the determination of the rate of interest.\nThe model is in principle founded on the Keynesian theory of the interrelation between\nthe quantity of money and the rate of interest. When using this theory it is important\nto distinguish between different kinds of ''interest rates\" and different kinds of\n\" money.\" The model is concerned with the latter distinction, which is stressed by\nintroducing two sectors\u2014'' the banks\" and ''the public \"\u2014whose dispositions on\nthe credit market will be treated separately. In consequence two '' quantities of\nmoney \"' and two liquidity functions are obtained. The importance of this distinction\nis further stressed by introducing the banks' reserve ratio of cash to the public's\ndeposits as a link between the two liquidity functions. The model operates exclusively\nin terms of these two functions and thus the analysis of the determination of the rate\nof interest concentrates on the monetary sector of the economy. But in this respect\nthe model is to be regarded only as a first step towards a more complete treatment.\n\nThe aim of the analysis is not limited to giving a dynamic and differentiated\nmodel that still in principle runs on traditional lines. When trying to make precise\nthat model in a sequence there appear certain weaknesses in the use of given liquidity\nfunctions. The confusions partly concern the meaning of a successive movement along\nthe liquidity curve and partly the constancy of that curve itself when the successive\nmovements are carried out. The problems are raised when the given changes in '' the\nquantity of money \" have to be '\"' translated \" into those bond transactions that a\nmovement along the liquidity curve actually imply. This consideration is an out-\nstanding feature of the model. It will possibly give a more clear picture of price\nformation on the credit market and suggest some completions and modifications of\nthe traditional theory.\n\nDEescRIPTION or THE MopEL\n\nUsing Keynesian terminology the cash-holding of the public for transaction\npurposes is assumed to be constant since variations in income and employment are not\nconsidered in the model. Further, the speculative cash-holding of the public is assumed\nexclusively to take the form of bank deposits. The banks need a certain transaction\ncash determined by the amount of deposits. The amount of this reserve cash is assumed\nto bear a fixed ratio of total deposits (given by convention or by law). The banks are\nassumed to hold their cash in the form of money (liquid claims on the central banks).\nThe speculative cash-holding of the public and of the banks is assumed to depend on\nthe rate of interest. In equilibrium the amount of the speculative cash-holding, both\nof the banks and of the public, corresponds to the rate of interest according to individual\nliquidity functions. And at the same time that part of the banks' total cash which is\nnot held for speculation exactly amounts to the given quota of public's deposits.!\n\nWhat happens if in an equilibrium the total cash-holding of the banks is increased ?\nFor simplicity the primary change in cash-holding is assumed to concern only the\nbanks and, e.g., depends on a redemption of governmental bonds. The banks are\nconfronted with surplus cash which they try to place in iriterest-bearing paper. This\n\n1 It is a$sumed that the necessary reserve cash is primarily supplied out of total cash. The remaining\n\npart makes up for the speculative cash. The two types of cash cannot replace each other. (Cf. Keynes,\nGeneral Theory, p. 199.)\n\n98\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:42:39 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Families have been assumed\nto take the whole ration of cooking fats, one-third being in the form of lard. The subsidy on bread, flour\nand potatoes has been assessed on the basis of pre-war consumption.\n\nAt the rates of subsidy ruling in September, 1948, the subsidies shown in the table above would account\nfor an expenditure of about \u00a3300 million as compared with total subsidies of \u00a3471 million. The difference\nis accounted for by /74.8 million subsidies on feeding stuffs and fertilizers (these have not been included\nbecause their effect on retail prices is problematical) 437.9 million for the National Milk, Milk in Schools\nand ''other welfare foods \" schemes which are considered elsewhere, and finally that part of the food\nsubsidies which is paid on food which is not bought by households. (This would appear to be about \u00a360\nmillion.) The subsidy on meals out accrues almost entirely to adults or middle class children, except in the\ncase of that part of the subsidy which reduces the cost of school meals. This part of the subsidies is included\nin the value of school meals.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:43:54 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

This raises no difficulties in principle if total consumption is\nuniquely related to the volume of trade. But under free trade, patterns of international\nexchange represented by points off E's offer-curve cannot occur consistently with\nequilibrium, and it is therefore not possible to say what pattern of consumption in E\nthey would be associated with if they did occur. If the indifference curves are to have\nany clear meaning, we have to suppose that the various '' unnatural\"' patterns of\nexchange are made consistent with equilibrium by some departure from free trade.\nNow any given '' unnatural \" position can be brought about by a variety of measures :\ntariffs (or import bounties), export duties (or subsidies), quantitative controls, etc.\nEach of these methods will lead to a different pattern of production and consumption.\nIn drawing indifference curves in this context we have therefore to specify which form\nof commercial policy we are assuming, with free trade and sel\u00ed-sufficiency as special\ncases. The curves in the resulting system will be affected by costs as well as by tastes,\nand hence will be liable to be convex or kinked as well as concave.

This will be the case because only part of the total consumer expenditures\nare made by wage earners, and because only a part of the increase in wages is spent\non consumer goods.\n\nAs we have seen, the first wage increase of 3.5 per cent will cause the cost of\nliving to rise by 1.64 per cent. The second wage increase (i.e. 1.64 per cent of \u00a34,900 \u2014\n\u00a380.3 million) will raise consumer expenditures by fr million (ie. by f80.3 million\n\n. 6\ntimes 0.76) and will further increase the cost of living by 0.76 per cent (ie. Boo )\n\nThe total rise in the cost of living after the initial increase and two rounds of wage\nadjustments will be 5.9 per cent (i.e. 3.50 -4- 1.64 J4- 0.76).\n\nAfter the first two rounds of wage increases, the wage and price adjustments\ndecrease rapidly. The theoretical limit of the rise in the cost of living from an infinite\nnumber of rounds is 6.55 per cent.!\n\nIt should be remembered that our estimate of both the initial rise in the cost of\nliving and the further increases resulting from two rounds of wage adjustments are\nbased on the outside assumption of an absolutely inelastic supply of consumer goods.\nIn all probability, there will be some increase in the total output of consumer goods\nas prices and profits rise. Furthermore, the government has the option of effecting a\nshift of resources from the capital goods industries to consumer goods industries.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:48:35 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Similarly, in the case\nof imported goods, the quantity purchased will tend to fall, as their sterling cost rises.\nReduced physical consumption and increased prices may offset one another so that\nthe rate of consumer expenditures is unchanged\u2014or, if consumers strongly resist a\nlowering of real consumption, they may save less (or even dis-save) and thereby cause\nconsumption expenditures to increase. Thus, an increase in the cost of living can\noccur without any change in personal money income.\n\nHowever, the total amount and distribution of personal incomes might change\nas \u00e0 direct consequence of devaluation. Export firms are likely to expand, as a conse-\nquence of higher profits, and take on workers, but other firms producing chiefly for\nthe domestic market may be adversely affected by the increased cost of imported\nmaterials, and may discharge employees. There will be some lag in the movement of\nworkers from contracting industries to expanding industries. If unemployment is\ncaused, personal incomes of those who become unemployed will be reduced by the\ndifference between their former wages and the unemployment benefits they receive.\n\nCapital expenditures may also be directly affected by devaluation. The induced\nexpansion of firms which produce in part for the export market may exceed the cut-\nbacks of other firms. But the government can, by adopting restrictive credit policies,\ncounteract a tendency toward increased aggregate investment if it chooses to do so.\n\nIn summary, aggregate expenditure will tend to increase as a result of reduced\npersonal saving and of additional capital expenditures by export industries. On the\nother hand, aggregate expenditure will tend to fall as a result of reduced expenditures\nby persons who become unemployed and by reduced capital outlays in domestic\nindustries. These two tendencies may balance each other. If they do not balance, the\ngovernment can strengthen the weaker tendency.\n\nIt is in this setting that we assume a government policy of permitting wage\nadjustments every three months equal to the increase in the cost of living index.\n\nErrFECT OF WAGE ADJUSTMENTS\n\nAny increase in wages will tend further to increase the cost of living, but the\nimpact of wage increases is tempered by the fact that part of the increment is taxed\naway or saved and is thus not available for bidding up prices of consumer goods and\nservices. (Increased wage payments can always be wholly neutralised by appropriate\nfiscal and credit policies designed to limit disposable incomes, but it is assumed that\nno additional taxes or restrictions on private credit are imposed.)\n\nThe purpose of the following analysis is to assess the total increase in consumption\nexpenditures that two quarterly wage adjustments would give rise to, and the effect\nof such increases upon the cost of living.\n\nAs shown in the following tabulation, the increase of personal expenditure in\n1947 and 1948 was very large in relation to the rise of personal income. As consumer\ngoods reappeared in quantity for the first time after the war, consumers made abnorm-\nally large purchases to replace worn-out clothing and household furnishings.\nThe increase in expenditure of \u00a3724 million in 1947 and [539 million in 1948 was\nachieved mainly by a decrease in saving amounting to \u00a3493 million and \u00a3109 million,\nrespectively. But the decrease in saving was much less in 1948 than in 1947. As\nthis tendency continues and consumers complete the restocking of their inventories\nsaving out of current income will cease to decline and may increase in 1949.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:48:35 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Before considering the effects of\nwage adjustments, it is desirable to mention the immediate income and employment\neffects of devaluation and, in particular, to see what an initial increase in the cost of\nliving implies both with respect to the availability of consumers' goods and the rate\nof consumer expenditures.\n\nINCOME AND EMPLOYMENT ErrkECTS OF DEVALUATION\n\nAs the quantity of consumers' goods available for home consumption falls, their\nsterling prices will tend to rise. Indeed, a rise in prices is the means of restricting\n\nl'TThese estimates were obtained by multiplying the original estimates by 44/33.3 to adjust for the\n44 per cent appreciation of the dollar in terms of sterling instead of the assumed 33.3 per cent appreciation.\n\n? Based on Records and Statistics supplement to the Economist. Where specific commodities are selected\nto compare with our estimates for commodity groups, the item is indicated in parenthesis.\n\n3 No adjustment is applied because the price rise!is determined chiefly by the devaluation against the\nCanadian dollar.\n\n! Egyptian Giza 20 per cent; Mid-American 23 per cent. The large difference between the estimate\nand the actual price rise is probably due to the following two influences: (1r) the proportion of current\nimports of American cotton to total cotton imports is higher than the proportion in 1948 upon which our\nestimate is based ; (2) the existence of a fixed American reservation price supported by the Commodity\nCredit Corporation has a tendency to pull the cotton market up towards the American price level. This\namounts to an infinite price elasticity of dollar supplies, and application of our formula (18) would give a\nprice increase equal to the degree of appreciation of the dollar.\n\nSee Section TII on the relevance of raw cotton price increases to the price increase of clothing.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:48:35 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

            "found": "46 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\npricing,! but the subject was treated in a very cursory manner which did not consider\nany of the fundamental issues raised by Kahn.\n\nDuring the next few years, the development of the theory of marginal cost pricing\nwas given a new twist by a number of writers who concerned themselves with the\nrelation between the marginal cost pricing principle and the price system of a socialist\neconomy. Lerner in particular gave impetus to this turn of the controversy, writing a\nlengthy criticism? of E. F. M. Durbin's analysis? of price systems for a planned economy.\nDurbin had advocated an average cost pricing system. Lerner dissented from this\nopinion, saying that the one contribution pure economic theory has to make to the\nbuilding up of a socialist economy is that price must be made equal to marginal cost.\nLerner's article was one of the first general explanations of the marginal cost pricing\nprinciple which adequately treated the problem of defining marginal cost. His presenta-\ntion of the Viner envelope curves showing explicitly the relationship between long and\nshort run marginal cost served a very useful purpose. Although Viner's article on the\nsubject had been written six years before,* many of the writers (Durbin included)\nhad no very clear conception of what was meant by marginal cost.\n\nAbout this same time, Meade also advocated the principle of marginal cost pricing\nin the planning of industry. Meade proposed both the control of monopoly so as to\nforce production to take place at the point where marginal cost is equal to price, and\nalso the extension of subsidies to all those cases where marginal cost pricing would\nnot cover total costs. From Meade's point of view, the principle of marginal cost\npricing was by this time no longer a controversial question, but rather something to\nbe explained in a popular manner. Lange,9 writing at about the same time, adopted\nthe same attitude; the scale of output in a socialist economy, he indicated, should be\nfixed so that marginal cost is equal to the price of the product.\n\nThus by 1938 the marginal cost pricing principle had by stages evolved out of\nthe original Marshallian premise with reference to increasing and decreasing cost\nindustries. Along the way, the basis of the argument had shifted from the assumption\nof equal marginal utilities of income to the claim that interpersonal comparisons need\nnot be made, and the conclusions had shifted from the simple Marshallian premise\nconcerning increasing and decreasing costs, based on a comparison of geometrical\nareas, to a fairly subtle proposition of pricing at marginal cost. Although there still\nwas not full agreement on all of the reasoning involved\u2014for instance, Dobb's question\nwith regard to what it was that was being maximised\u2014there was a fairly general\nagreement among the majority of those writing on this subject that the principle of\nmarginal cost pricing was a valid principle for the achievement of an optimum alloca-\ntion of resources, and even, in the view of some, the only optimum. This history of\nthe origin and development of the marginal cost pricing thesis is largely ignored by\npresent-day writers on welfare economics, even though it has played a very real part\nin shaping the present form of the theory. There is a considerable gulf between the\nmarginal cost pricing thesis up to 1938 and its development after that period.\n\nNew Haven, Conn. NawNcvy RUGGLES.\n\n1C. L.

We cannot judge between them without making interpersonal\ncomparisons ; and their existence makes it rather difficult to attach significance to\nattempts at discovering the '* probable height \" of an optimum tariff.\n\nThe situation is precisely analogous to that encountered in a closed economy.\nThere we can formulate a rule such as '' equate marginal cost to price \"\" which is quite\ngeneral. But this rule will not tell us how high prices must be until we know something\nabout the pattern of demand, and therefore the distribution of wealth. Without a\ncriterion for judging between different distributions we cannot say at what level prices\nand marginal costs are to be equated ; and so we can say but little of the '' probable\nheight \" of the prices.\n\nThis does not, of course, mean that we can never obtain any idea at all of the\n'* probable height \"' of prices or tariffs, for it is at least conceivable that the infinity of\npossible heights will occasionally lie within a reasonably narrow range. But it does\nmake the task of determining the range rather difficult. For this reason it may be\nthought that the preceding analysis has yielded few positive results. To a certain\nextent that is true. What has emerged very clearly, however, is that what I take to be\nProfessor de Scitovszky's main conclusion is even more firmly based than his treatment\nmight lead one to suspect. His conclusion, the reader will recall, was that it is, generally\nspeaking, the rational thing for each country, acting separately, to try to turn the terms\nof trade in its favour by protection\u2014that there is nothing natural about free trade,\nand that if we want it to obtain we must see that it is 2mposed and enforced.! The\nanalysis of this paper has refined the argument somewhat. It has shown that its validity\ndepends in no way upon the possibility of making interpersonal comparisons of well-\nbeing,? or upon the absence of external economies and diseconomies in production and\nconsumption. It has unearthed the rather odd case where the optimum tariffs are, in\nfact, subsidies, and it has established that (whether tariffs or subsidies) their imposition\nis always at least potentially beneficial, unless it impairs the allocative efficiency of\nthe economy.?\n\nThus the force of Professor de Scitovszky's conclusion is considerably strengthened.\nThe moral to be drawn from it is too obvious to require emphasis.\n\nV. MATHEMATICAL NOTE\n\nConsider a community of N people. We adopt the convention that the services\nof productive factors are negative commodities, inputs negative outputs, and exports\nnegative imports. Denote by x;* the quantity of the th commodity consumed by\nthe ath citizen. Then the utility indexes take the form :\n\n\u00ab9 \u2014 \u00ab9 (x) (0\u20141,2,..., N) ....seseA (x)\nwhere x is the row vector of xi* (a \u2014 1, 2, . . ., N ; \u00a3\u2014 1,2, .. ., n).

Professor de Scitovszky's treatment does not make this quite clear, since he bases his welfare judg-\nments upon but two of the infinity of possible distributions of wealth\u2014viz. that obtaining in the free trade\nsituation, and that obtaining once the tariff has been imposed.\n\n? The reader familiar with Professor de Scitovszky's analysis of the optimum tariff problem will recall\nthat he employs Marshallian offer curves super- imposed on a set of community indifference loci; and\nthat he is careful to distinguish cases where the community indifference loci intersect between the points\nrepresenting free trade and the optimum degree of protection from those in which they do not intersect.\nIn the former event we can, on his welfare criteria, make no statement about the desirability of the tariff ;\nin the latter event we can say that it is desirable. What our analysis (which runs along lines rather different\n\u00cdrom Professor de Scitovszky's) has shown is, in effect, that the community indifference loci can never\nintersect in the relevant range, unless the allocative efficiency of the system is impaired.

They constitute\nan important qualification we should bear in mind when discussing the probable\nheight of the taxes.\n\nThe point just made is closely akin to the classical distinction between revenue\nduties and protecting duties.! The burden of the former can be thrown on the foreigner,\nthrough the movement in the terms of trade; whereas the latter \" are purely mis-\nchievous,\"' to use Mill's phrase. The distinction should not be pressed too far, however,\nfor any-actual duty cannot but be a compound of the two : it will affect the possibility\nand efficiency loci to different degrees.\n\nThe second problem of consistency is concerned with Mr. Kahn's revival of\nBickerdike's argument that the optimum tariff is likely to be '' large \" rather than\n\" small\" Bickerdike, it will be recalled, maintained that '' rather strong assumptions\nhave to be made . . . if the rate of tax affording maximum advantage is to come\nbelow ro per cent.'\"? We are not here concerned with the fact that the formula on which\nthis conclusion is based is itself dependent upon '' rather strong assumptions \"' about\n** cross-elasticities vanishing identically. The point is rather this: whatever the\nelasticities may be, there can be no escaping the fact that their magnitudes will depend\nupon the height of the tariff\u2014they are functionally related. One relation which must\nexist between them at the optimum point has been produced, but there are undoubtedly\nothers. Thus, consider the case where the foreign elasticity of demand is unity. This\ndoes not mean, as a simple substitution in Mr. Kahn's formula might seem to suggest,\nthat the optimum tariff is infinitely high\u2014for an infinite tariff is not consistent with a\ndemand elasticity of unity. As the tariff grew one would expect the elasticity to\nchange. Speaking very generally, there is perhaps a presumption that it will increase\nas the tariff grows ; and there is perhaps a further presumption that the foreign supply\nof imports will become more elastic too. Both these changes would tend to reduce\nthe height of the optimum tariff. It is not quite legitimate, therefore, to make deduc-\ntions about its probable height from so simple a formula as Mr. Kahn's\u2014one can\nnever be sure that the values one attributes to the elasticities are, in fact. consistent\nwith the tariff the formula indicates.\n\nOnce it is recognised that the elasticities depend on the height of the tariff, it is\nnatural to ask if it is possible to establish rather more precisely the nature of the\ndependence. Into this matter I do not propose to enter. But it is probably worth\npointing out that one of the obvious factors influencing the final result is the way in\nwhich the tariff affects the prices of imports and exports. This in turn depends in\npart upon domestic elasticities of demand and supply, and so upon the domestic distri-\nbution of income.\n\nWe have here the resolution of two paradoxes. The first is Mr. Kahn's?: that the\noptimum tariff formula should depend upon the foreign elasticities only. The second\nis one which may have troubled the careful reader : We have been making no inter-\npersonal comparisons of well-being ; we have merely been seeking a position on the\npossibility locus. There are an infinity of such positions, each corresponding to a\ndifferent distribution of welfare. How is it that we have been able to derive a unique\nformula for the optimum tariff structure? The answer is that, while the formula is\nunique, the actual tariff structure it indicates depends very intimately indeed upon\nthe initial distribution of wealth\u2014for this is one of the factors determining the con-\nsistency of the elements in the formula. Tus we have an infimity of optimum tariff\nsiructures, each corresponding to a. different. initial distribution of wealth, but all. deter-\n\n1 Cf.

Marshall, it is interesting to recall, did not do\nthis, In his Memorandum on Fiscal Policy! he suggested that the Giffen Paradox\nmight operate in respect of imports of wheat into England, and pointed out that if it\ndid the effect of a tariff on wheat would be to turn the terms of trade against her.\nBut the Giffen Paradox is not an everyday market phenomenon; and if it were it\nalone that could cause this perverse movement in the terms of trade, economists\nwould be justified in dismissing the whole matter as a mere curiosum.\n\nWe do not live in a two-commodity world, however, and so it is not necessarily a\ncuriosum. Our treatment has the advantage that it evades the difficult matter of\nwhat happens to the terms of trade and tackles the problem of the optimum taxes\nquite directly. It does seem, moreover, that when some of our optimum taxes turn\nout to be negative, those of us who are accustomed to think the matter through with\nreference to the terms of trade need not feel too suspicious. We need simply remind\nourselves that in a multi-commodity world the terms of trade is a rather elusive con-\ncept, and that\u2014however useful\u2014it may occasionally play us tricks.\n\nLeavirig the matter of the terms of trade, we might\u2014before concluding this section\n\u2014fpause for a moment to consider the modifications that would have to be introduced\ninto our earlier analysis if we were to relax the assumption that external economies\nand diseconomies are absent from both production and consumption. If they are\npresent in' production, our formula for the optimum taxes remains the same, but\ndomestic prices must be corrected by the imposition of proportionate taxes to bring\nmarginal private rates of transformation in domestic factories into line with the\nmarginal social rates\u2014otherwise the General Optimum will not b\u00e9 attained, even in\nthe closed economy. If they are present in consumption, our simple formula is no\nlonger correct, but it remains true that free trade will land us on the possibility locus\nin quite exceptional (one might almost say '' degenerate \"\") circumstances only. It is,\ntherefore, in general, always possible to approach the locus more closely by imposing\na suitable tariff structure. But the formula defining it is complicated, and little purpose\nwould be served in deriving it here. It is worth noting, however, that it is still true\nthat the attainment of the possibility locus requires that the marginal rates of trans-\nformation through foreign trade should equal the marginal social rates of transforma-\ntion at home.?\n\nFinally, it hardly requires emphasis that throughout the preceding analysis we\nhave stuck rigidly to statics, and ignored completely such important dynamic con-\nsiderations as the probability of retaliation and the chance of protection in an important\ncountry precipitating a world slump.\n\nIV. TWO PROBLEMS OF CONSISTENCY\n\nThere remain for consideration two problems of consistency. Both are related\nto the matter of estimating the probable height of an optimum tariff. The first is\nconcerned with the extent to which protection is consistent with the maintenance of\na high degree of allocative efficiency in an economy. In the welfare jargon of earlier\nsections, the problem might be phrased : Granted that the imposition of an optimum\ntariff structure will shift the possibility locus outwards, may it not twist, or even shift\ninwards, the efficiency locus\u2014for may not protection give birth to monopoly, and so\ndisrupt the allocative efficiency of an economy ? This is one of those questions we\ncannot answer theoretically. But it does seem probable that considerations of this\n\n! Official Papers (London, 1926), pp. 382-3.\n? Cf.

The assumptions which have to be\nmade to derive it are rather restrictive. In particular, it is, of course, extremely unlikely\nthat all '' cross-elasticities \" will ever vanish identically.! Even when all goods are\nindependent in production (i.e. when all productive factors are completely specific),\nthey still compete for the consumer's income. Indeed, only when all consumer demand\nschedules have unit elasticity is it possible for a change in the price of any one good to\nhave no effect at all on the demand for one or more of the others. When there is some\ndegree of substitutability in production, and demand schedules are not thus circum-\nscribed, the ''cross-elasticities \" must be taken into account. To neglect them is to\ncommit the unjustifiable act of carrying over into general equilibrium analysis assump-\ntions appropriate to partial equilibrium analysis only.\n\nThe objection to the use of formula (3) rather than formula (2) is twofold. Firstly,\nit may give an exaggerated idea of the height of the optimum tariff. And, secondly,\nit obscures the interesting fact that the optimum '' tariff '\" is sometimes a subsidy.\nThis fact is interesting because it throws light on the usual discussion on Tariffs and\nthe Terms of Trade, in which the possibility of a subsidy on imports being required to\nturn the terms of trade in one's favour is seldom considered.\n\nEconomists have been aware of the possibility of a country turning the terms of\ntrade in its favour by protection ever since the time of John Stuart Mill?\u2014if not\nTorrens and Ricardo. But the actual effect of a tariff on the terms of trade is a rather\ncomplicated matter, and has seldom been analysed in detail. The fullest theoretical\ntreatment available is probably that provided by Dr. Mosak, to whose monograph on\nGeneral Equilibrium Theory in International Trade* the reader may find it helpful to\nrefer. Briefly, the position is that if we make the simplifying assumption that the\ngovernment spends the proceeds of the tariff on exports only, the terms of trade\nmust, in a two-country, two-commodity model, move in favour of the protecting\ncountry\u2014unless the imported good is markedly inferior, so that the demand for it\nincreases as its price rises. In a multi-commodity world, on the other hand, it does\nnot seem to be possible to generalise about the direction of the movement in the terms\nof trade\u2014even when we abstract from the inevitable index number problem involved\nin saying what the terms of trade are when more than two commodities are traded\ninternationally. The crucial factors turn out to be the relations of complementarity\nand substitution existing between the traded goods. They can turn the terms of trade\nin either direction.\n\nThe two-commodity case, however, is the one most theoretical economists have\nin mind when discussing problems of international trade. It is the easiest to handle\ngeometrical ; and by talking of '\" two bales of commodities \" rather than '' two\ncommodities \"' it can be invested with a fictitious air of generality. It is not altogether\nsurprising, therefore, that they should have tended to ignore the rather odd case\nwhere imports are markedly inferior and the Giffen Paradox operates, and to have\n\n1 Mr. Kahn is aware of this when he warns that his elasticities are not true elasticities at all, but what\nmight be called ''elasticities in the Pigou sense.\" Cf. loc. cit., p. 17 and A.

In this exceptional case,\ntherefore, free trade establishes the General Optimum\u201434.e. lands us on the possibility\nlocus.\n\nIn the more usual case, however, it will be necessary to adjust domestic prices\n(since foreign prices are not within our control) to secure the satisfaction of equation (1).\nThe simplest method of adjustment is to put an ad valorem tax of a;[p; on the ;th good\nwhenever it crosses the frontier\u2014the tax being calculated on the foreign price. Then\nwe would have:\n\nvi \u2014 $i (1 c ailbi)\n\n7j \u2014 Bj (1 d ajlbj)\nwhich is what is required. In the welfare terminology of previous sections, these taxes\nlead us to the possibility locus, and are therefore at least potentially beneficial: once\nthey have been imposed wealth can be so redistributed that every citizen of our country\nis better off than he was under free trade. Stated in another way : compared with the\nfree trade situation, the imposition of the optimum taxes shifts the possibility locus\noutwards.\n\nThis scheme of taxing both imports and exports is essentially the same as the\none Professor Lerner suggests in The \u00c9conom\u00fccs of Control] The only difference\nresults from the fact that he implicitly assumes that all '' cross-elasticities '' of demand\nand supply vanish identically. It will readily be seen that whenever this procedure\nis legitimate our tax on imports reduces to the reciprocal of the foreign elasticity of\nsupply, and our tax on exports to the reciprocal of the foreign elasticity of demand.\nThis is Professor Lerner's elegant result. When the ''cross-elasticities \" cannot be\nneglected, however, it is likely to be a little misleading. For, in general, we cannot\neven say what the szens of the a; will be; and, as we shall see, cases can arise where\nthe attainment of the General Optimum requires subsidies (or negative taxes) on both\nimports and exports. Yet this phenomenon is in no way related to changes in the\nsigns of Professor Lerner's elasticities.\n\nOur formula is also very closely related to the Bickerdike-Edgeworth-Kahn-\nLittle formula for the optimum tariff. In fact, ours reduces to it in a world in which\nbut two commodities are traded internationally?, and where all the '' cross-elasticities ''\nvanish identically.

To adjust the domestic import-export\nprice ratio to it we need not tax both imports and exports: a single tax will do the\ntrick.

It is usually suggested that this is to be effected through the price\nmechanism : consumers equate their marginal rates of substitution, and producers\ntheir marginal rates of transformation, to given domestic price ratios. In an open\neconomy, however, the establishment of the General Optimum requires too that\nmarginal rates of transformation in home factories should be equal to marginal rates\nof transformation through foreign trade.

The answer, I think, depends upon the\ncontext. There is little point in bothering about possibility loci if there is no chance of\nthe community ever attaining them. A change will lead us from a point on one effi-\nciency locus to a point on another. Its potential desirability should normally be judged\non this basis. Then we can consider the further question of improving the allocative\nefficiency of the system so as to make the efficiency locus approach closer to its possi-\nbility boundary. Such an improvement is always at least potentially beneficial. But\nit cannot be taken for granted. Its achievement is a matter quite distinct from the\npotential desirability of the change. Thus an invention which shifts the efficiency\nlocus inwards should normally be regarded as potentially harmful, even if it shifts the\npossibility locus outwards. But it may well be that the same invention f/us a vigorous\ntrust-busting campaign would shift the efficiency locus outwards. In that case the\ninvention 2/us the trust-busting, as opposed to the invention alone, is to be judged at\nleast potentially beneficial. This would be true even if the invention were to involve\nan inward shift of the possibility locus\u2014although, in the latter eventuality, it might\nbe thought that the trust-busting without the invention might be potentially even\nmore beneficial. This would not necessarily be correct, however, for the success of a\ngiven trust-busting campaign might not be altogether independent of the invention.\n\nThe question to which the various exponents! of '' compensation tests \"' in welfare\n\ntheory have addressed themselves is essentially a part of the wider problem of deter-\nmining just what a particular change will do to the efficiency locus. But even the\nmost powerful of these tests\u2014 Professor de Scitovszky's well-known double one\u2014\ncannot always detect a twist in the locus. This the reader can verify by glancing at\nFig. 3. There we consider a move from R on the first locus to S on the second. It\nbenefits Alpha, but Beta suffers. Alpha can, how-\never, profitably bribe Beta into accepting the change f E P]\n(cf. Q), and Beta cannot profitably bribe Alpha into\nrejecting it. Yetthelocicross. Professor de Scitovszky's\ntest is not quite strong enough for our purposes. (It\nis, of course, perfectly correct to say that Q represents\na point of greater welfare than R, for both Alpha and\nBeta are better off in Q than in R. But this is not to\nsay that the change is even potentially beneficial.\nFor there is no reason what- soever why we should\njudge the old situation with reference to the single\npoint R. Nor is there any reason for judging the new Fre ET\nsituation with reference to Q alone.) |\n\nThe problem of determining the behaviour of the efficiency locus in any actual\nsituation is a very difficult one, and does not lend itself at all readily to theoretical\ntreatment. In discussing optimum tariff structures in the next section, therefore, we\nshall concern ourselves chiefly with the possibility locus. But we should bear in mind\nthat this is very much a second best, and that what we are really after is the efficiency\nlocus.\n\n1N.

Thus\nwe shall see that the erection of an optimum tariff structure can never twist the locus,\nbut must always shift it outwards.\n\nII. THE EFFICIENCY LOCUS\n\nIn any actual situation our community is unlikely to be on the possibility locus :\nit is likely to be well inside it. A redistribution of wealth by lump-sum taxes and\nbounties (which are assumed to cost nothing to collect and distribute) will normally\nmove it to another position inside the locus. Any such redistribution will normally\nalso affect the allocative efficiency of the system, increasing the degree of monopoly in\nsome parts and diminishing it in others. The locus of all points in the (a, B)-plane\ntraced out by redistributions of this kind we shall call the efficiency locus, because it\nindicates the allocative efficiency of the system for various distributions of welfare.\nOptimum allocative efficiency, for a particular distribution of welfare, is not attained\nunless the possibility and efficiency loci coincide in the point corresponding to that\ndistribution. But optimum allocative efficiency is seldom achieved, and the efficiency\nlocus will usually lie beneath the possibility one.\n\nThose steeped in the traditional surplus analysis may find it helpful to think of a\npoint on the efficiency locus as indicating the total consumer's and producer's surplus\nenjoyed by each of Alpha and Beta in any actual situation. A point on the possibility\nlocus, on the other hand, represents the maximum either could enjoy, given the amount\nenjoyed by the other, if the economic system were to be organised in an optimum\nmanner\u2014i.e. if the Paretean General Optimum were to obtain.\n\nTechnological progress, or a change of some other kind, is likely to affect both the\npossibility and the efficiency loci. It may shift one and twist the other, or affect both\nin the same way. There are, in fact, nine different combinations to consider: any\none of the three different types of movement of the possibility locus can be associated\nwith any one of the three different types of movement of the efficiency locus. For\ninstance, an invention which shifts the possibility locus outwards may confer on the\ninnovator monopoly power so great that the efficiency locus is given a twist, or even\nshifted inwards.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:49:31 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

That is the correct meaning of the phrase '\"' the ends must be given.\"\nBut, as can easily be seen, the phrase '' the ends must be given \" can have a different\ninterpretation. It may suggest that the welfare economist can say nothing until\nsomeone, or some committee, actually comes along and says '' These are my value\njudgments. Now get along with the job of making your deductions.\" But this is quite\nfalse. The word '' given \" in the sentence '' the ends must be given \" is, of course, a\nmetaphor. The welfare economist can make deductions from any value premises he\nchooses, and say '' These conclusions follow from these premises. Take them or leave\nthem.\" Or, if he wishes to make propaganda (and why should we even deny him that ?)\nhe can state his value conclusions, and carefully conceal the premises.\n\nIn his chapter on *' Welfare Economics,\" in The Foundations of Economic Analysis,\nProfessor Samuelson adopts a technique of exposition which, in view of his great\ninfluence, may possibly be unfortunate. -He holds that value judgments must be given,\nin the sense that, without value postulates, we cannot have welfare conclusions. But\nhe puts these value judgments into the mouth of some postulated being or Being.\nTo quote: '' Without inquiring into its origins we take as a starting-point for our\ndiscussion a function of all the economic magnitudes of a system which is supposed to\ncharacterise some ethical belief\u2014that of a benevolent despot, or a complete egotist,\nor ' all men of goodwill, a misanthrope, the State, race, or group mind, God, etc.\"\nThis may mislead people into thinking that the postulates of a logical system must\nliterally be given by someone. In fact, we can deduce conclusions from postulates\nwithout ever needing to suppose that they ar\u00e9 given by anyone or believed in by\nanyone. Postulates do not require to have \"' origins.\" Whether or not anyone believes\nin the truth of, or '' gives\" us, some sentences, called premises, is irrelevant to the\nquestion whether certain other sentences, called conclusions, follow from them.\nSamuelson's introduction of a benevolent despot, God, etc., is surely meant to be\nmerely a device for the purposes of separating off those sentences, which are value\nsentences, from those which are not. Value sentences are only '' put into the mouth\nof\" God, etc., for the purpose of distinguishing them from descriptive sentences.\nBut this purely expositional device might mislead people into thinking that the\neconomist really has to wait until someone, or some Government, comes along and\nhands him his premises on a platter (unless he is prepared to '' give \" them to himself).\nTaking the sentence '' The ends must be given \"' literally is thus a possible explanation\nof why some economists might be misled into accepting the rather servile view of\ntheir functions which Mr. Henderson puts forward. But, as I said above and wish to\nemphasise, this sentence means '' value conclusions can only be deduced from value\npremises.\"\n\nOxford. I. M. D. LirrrE.\n\n!'

Thus,\nthe strain in the balance of payments during the boom was probably due to the excess\nof the outflow of long-term capital over the surplus in the balance of payments on\nincome account, which was also increasing. Short-term capital movements were easily\ninduced through manipulation of the discount rate by the Bank of England, which\nhad managed to ensure sufficient control over the British money market in contrast\nwith the relatively passive policies of the Continental central banks.! Thus, short-\nterm capital movements and perhaps also reinforcements in gold supplies ensured\nequilibrium in the balance of payments and probably helped in the prevention of a\nshortage of funds during the boom years in the U.K.?\n\nLong-term foreign lending declined sharply in the advanced stages of the boom\nand continued to fall during the years of recession and depression, when the surplus of\nthe balance on current account was also declining. But the contraction in British\nlong-term foreign investment was apparently greater than the reduction of the surplus\non current account. An equilibrating outflow of short-term capital, supported by net\nexports of gold, was therefore probably necessary. At the same time the deterioration\nof the British net barter terms of trade was a factor offsetting, at least partially, the\ndepressing impact of the sharp reduction in the rate of British long-term lending and\nconstituted probably a condition stimulating the revival of activity in the primary\nproducing areas of the world.\n\nCambridge.

If they did, it\nwould mean frequent changes in output which would entail frequent calculations of\nthe worry which would be caused by such changes, as well as the possibility of increased\nprofits offsetting that worry. It may be that because of the worry involved in deciding\nwhat the net result of any change in output will be the business man finds it best to\ncarry on as long as possible at any given level of output, and only when this is patently\nimpossible does he feel the trouble of changing output worth while. Thus the effect\nof the entrepreneur's desire to avoid the worry of changing output may be to cause\ninertia. In small firms this tendency to inertia seems to be only too apparent.\n\nIt will no doubt be objected that the whole of this analysis is useless because the\nmagnitude of the '' anti-worry \" premium is, in any case, impossible to measure. But\nis this important if it can at any rate explain the wey in which equilibrium can be\nreached ? After all, what do we really know about marginal revenue and marginal\ncost? Yet economic analysis speaks blithely about equating them. There are good\nreasons for believing that the present analysis is at least as useful as the conventional\none.\n\nIt seems, then, that marginal theory suffers from three main defects: (ri) Many\nfirms do not attempt to maximise profits at all. (2) Subjective estimates and influences\nare very important, and marginal theory tends to overlook them. (3) It is largely a\nstatic theory.\n\nThe first defect is probably inevitable since it is difficult for such a theory to work\nefficiently unless it assumes a maximisation problem, but the other defects may well\nbe remedied. If our theory is to be brought more closely into line with practice, we\nmust develop a deeper understanding of business psychology and expectations and\nconstruct more fruitful dynamic analyses of the firm.\n\nUniversity College, London.

It is made up of\nthree parts, one attributable to each of the variables x, d and , and it seems desirable\nto discuss each of these parts separately.\n\nLA *| 7\nFIG. 3A. fiQG, 58. FIG. Sc.\n\n\u00ab\"zot\n\n4c\nio t-cunva\ne *\n\ne *\n\nOuTPuT ourTPu? ou*\u00bburt\n\n(N.B.\u2014These are all marginal curves.)\n\nThe x-curve (showing the amount of money needed to offset managerial worry\nat each level of output) is likely to be of the shape shown in Fig. 3A. This infers that,\nas output increases the intensity and quantity of the managerial worry needed to\nproduce it increases more than in proportion. The amount of money needed to offset\nthis worry increases similarly. At a certain level, perhaps where a new machine becomes\nnecessary, the amount of money needed to offset the worry of deciding whether to\nhave it may well increase rapidly, declining once the decision to install the machine\nhas been made. Thus the bulge on the curve may appear.\n\nFrom Fig. 3B the d-curve (showing the amount of money needed to offset the\nworry of actual or potential Government action at each output) seems likely to rise\nwith output. The greater the output the greater the worry of the forms to be filled in\nand the greater the worry arising from the danger of nationalisation. It seems reason-\nable to think that there will be different d-curves at different times. Here, the one\nd (C) represents the position under Sir Stafford Cripps, the other 2 (D) under Dr.\nHugh Dalton.\n\nIn Fig. 3C the \u00a3-curve (showing the amount of money needed to make taxes at\neach level of output worth paying) is seen, given the general tax structure and its\nprogressiveness, to change more than in proportion with profits, reaching a maximum\nvalue when profits do so. The hump in the curve will be accentuated by the fact that,\nas profits rise, the marginal utility of money to the entrepreneur declines, and so the\nprofits are less worth the effort needed to earn them. Strictly speaking, with our\npresent tax system there should be discontinuities in the curve where the rate of tax\nchanges. It seems reasonable to ignore these here.\n\nIt must be remembered that the position of all these curves will change with the\npassage of time. At any given moment, however, each will be related to either profits\nor output, and I feel that the relationship will be as suggested. Of course, all this\nassumes that entrepreneurs can attribute an objective value to subjective concepts,\nbut I feel that this is not, unreasonable.\n\nReturning to Fig. 2 and summing the three curves, it is possible to show the\n\" anti-worry \" premium by the curve PM which gives it a marginal value. Adding this\ncurve to marginal costs, as in the curve MC -- P, it can be seen that equilibrium\nwill be reached where output \u2014 OM' and price \u2014 OP'.

The following analysis is carried out on these\nlines, but it is intended to apply only to the '' one-man \" firm. It would be inappro-\npriate in other cases.!\n\nThe conventional analysis of the individual firm is, of course, carried out as\n\nfollows.?\nHere, equilibrium will be reached where output\nOM is sold at price OP, for then marginal revenue\nwill equal marginal cost. The analysis is based\non the assumption that entrepreneurs wish to\nmaximise monetary profits.\n\nFrom our survey, however, it seems reasonable\nto conclude that some entrepreneurs do not act\nin this way. Soit may well be useful to assume\nthat entrepreneurs fix output at the same level\nas they would if they mentally increased their\ncosts by a hypothetical allowance in respect of\nwhat I shall christen an '' anti-worry \" premium.\nThis premium represents entrepreneurs' estimates of the amount of money needed, in\naddition to cost (including \" normal\" profit), to persuade them to produce a given\noutput. Its purpose is to ensure that the sale of output amply repays entrepreneurs\nfor the worries and difficulties which arise from its production and sale.\n\nSymbolically, we may define the '\"' anti-worry \" premium (P) in any given circum-\nstances in the function :\n\n[I\n\nou?*\u00bbur\n\nP \u2014 \u00e0 (x, d, t)\n\nWhere x \u2014 the worry and difficulty involved in directing production,\nd \u2014 the worry caused by actual or potential Government action,\n? \u2014 the burden of the current rate of (progressive) taxation on profits.\nCarrying the analysis further, it seems likely that x, d and / are themselves dependent\nvariables, as in the functions :\n\nx\u2014g() . d\u2014f(o) andt\u2014F (9)\nwhere 0 \u2014 output and $ \u2014 profits.\n\nClearly, if we are to assess the magnitude of P, we must obtain a monetary\n\nestimate of each of the variables x, d and \u00a3. In\norder to see how this might be done in practice,\nlet us consider a concrete example\u2014Fig. 2\n(neglecting for the moment the curves PM and\nMC 4- P).\nHere we assume, to simplify the diagram, that\nmarginal costs are constant over '\" normal\"\nranges of output but rise quickly once \"' normal\"\ncapacity is exceeded. The position of equili-\nbrium, on the conventional assumptions, is where\noutput \u2014 OM, price \u2014 OP and \" supernormal\"\nprofits are OM x WP.\n\nFrom this information we can now make a\n\n\"o-\u00bb*\n\nOout*to\u00bbvut\n\n1!

                    "154 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nIt was generally agreed that prices would have to be reduced in slumps, but\nthough few, if any, of the firms studied had scientific policies for meeting conditions\nof depressed trade, it seems that there was little need to deviate from ''full cost \"\npolicies in the Black Country during the 1930's.\n\nIV. THE USEFULNESS OF MARGINAL THEORY\n\nIt is now possible to discuss marginal theory in the light of these results and to\ndraw the following conclusions :\n\n(1) The desire for maximum monetary profits, though it seems stronger in large\nthan in small firms, is not ubiquitous. The main reasons why some firms do not try\nto earn maximum profits seem to be (a) that some only want a '' reasonable \" income ;\n(b) that some prefer a smaller but more certain income, and (c) that non-pecuniary\nfactors are taken into account, e.g. output is not increased beyond a level where entre-\npreneurial effort and worry outweighs expected gains. In this last case, there is, of\nCourse, a maximisation decision, but it is of a rather different kind. All these factors\nare no doubt important, but it seems likely that since economic theory is best able to\ngive definite results when it is concerned with relatively simple maximisation problems,\nthe assumption of profit-maximisation may be as useful as any.\n\n(2) In practice, business men can base policy only on subjective estimates of cost\nand revenue. Prices are therefore usually based on accounting estimates of average\ncost adapted to conform to expectations of demand conditions. So, whilst many firms\nclaim to earn maximum profits, it is doubtful whether they have enough information\nto be sure whether they are doing so or not. As a result, an equilibrium position in\nthe real world may well be one where an entrepreneur \u00a3Ain&s he is earning maximum\nprofits and need not be one where he ;s earning them.\n\n(3) None of the firms studied attempted to equate marginal revenue and marginal\ncost as such. Some firms did not wish to earn maximum profits in any case, but even\nthose who did used other methods. This was either because they had never heard of\nmarginal analysis, or, where they had, because they found calculations of the relevant\nitems impossible. Profit-maximisation by balancing cost against revenue was, however,\ncarried out, but only on a long-term and unscientific basis. Short-run profit-maximisa-\ntion is usually unacceptable in practice.\n\n(4) Whilst, since they cannot calculate marginal cost and marginal revenue,\nbusiness men are forced to base their prices on estimates of average cost and average\nrevenue, this does not mean that they equate average cost and average revenue.\nIndeed, the main occupation of most entrepreneurs is keeping the margin between\nthese as wide as possible at any given level of output.\n\n(5) Business men are usually unaware of the true meaning of marginal analysis,\nand so, while some of them do realise that, in bad times, they should cover only\nvariable costs, most of them do not know what type of policy to follow in a depression.\n\n(6) Whilst marginal theory is not yet fully dynamic, it seems that if it is to become\ndynamic, it must show in particular how entrepreneurs' estimates of cost and revenue\nare derived, how they decide between earning different incomes with different prob-\nabilities of being earned and involving different risks! and how, when, and why changes\nin price and output are made.\n\nIt will be seen from these conclusions that, as Professor Boulding has said, '* The\nproblem * What does the entrepreneur maximise ?' . . . becomes an acute one.\"? It\n\n1See, however, ''Some Notes on Monopoly Price,\" R. H. Coase, REVIEW oF EcoNoMIC STUDIES,\n\nVol. 5, p. 17, where an outline of this kind of analysis is given.\n?

                    "ECONOMIC THEORY AND BUSINESS BEHAVIOUR I53\n\nHaving said something about price-fixing policies in general, we must consider\nhow they are applied in boom and slump. In times of boom, prices are, of course,\nstill based on '' full cost \" but the profit margins which they include are increased.\nSuch increases seem to be limited by entrepreneurs' fears of the effects of raising\nprices too far. No one likes to be the first to raise prices for fear of being branded a\n\" rob dog \" ora \" speculator \" and losing trade, for all fear the reaction of customers and\ncompetitors (see Table V). One business man said that in a boom he would aim at a\nprofit margin of 1o per cent to 15 per cent instead of the 10 per cent which he tried\nto earn normally.\n\nThere does, however, sometimes seem to be a quasi-moral objection to increased\nprices, and a statement by the owner of a small foundry puts this very clearly. He\nsaid, \"\" In a boom we should put some money away for a rainy day, but we should not\ngreatly increase prices. Indeed, it would be wrong for us to charge high prices to\ncustomers of thirty years' standing. Besides, there is what amounts to an unwritten\nlaw in the industry that sellers should not charge prices which are unnecessarily high.\nOur main fear is that if we did, buyers would retaliate in a slump.\"\n\nTo sum up, then, in times of boom the profit margins which '' full cost \" involves\nwill be increased as far as it seems safe and reasonable to do so. The main aim of\nbusiness men is to avoid making short-run gains at the expense of long-run profits.\nPrices would, of course, be raised to cover increases in cost.\n\nFinally, we turn to price policy in slumps. In such conditions '' fall cost \"\" policy\nis difficult to apply, and, to judge from the opinions of business men, policy becomes\nconfused, complicated and uncertain. Especially in small firms, there is little science\nin price-fixing during slumps. That is to say, while it is not unusual to find large firms\nrefusing to accept orders at prices which would not cover their estimated '' direct \"\"\n(or '* variable \"\") costs,! several of the small firms studied seemed to undertake blind\nslashing of prices.\n\nOn the other hand, there are very strong objections to charging less than \"' full\ncost,\" and this policy is not lightly abandoned even during a depression, but is often\npursued for as long as is humanly possible. Most interesting of all, however, it was\nfound that while entrepreneurs admitted that prices would usually be cut in slumps,\nthey not only seemed. to regard this as in opposition to a familiar and conventional\nmode of behaviour, but also as far less serious than many economists seem to assume.\nFor a very large proportion of the employers interviewed, though they \u00e0dmitted that\nprices would have to be reduced, spoke of this price change as entailing merely a\nreduction in the profit margin received. Very few of them envisaged actual losses.\nThere seem to be two reasons for this.\n\nFirst, the area studied was not badly hit by the slump of the 1930's and trade\nsoon improved. Second, the firms which did suffer big losses will by now have gone\nbankrupt and so cannot be surveyed at all !\n\nThere are, of course, some instances of prices being raised during slumps. For\nexample, T/e Autocar stated on. January roth, 1930, that \"' increased prices at the\nNew York Show are the result of excess production compelling lower output; hence\nthe cost per car is higher.\" Mrs. Robinson has given the plausible explanation? that\nelasticity of demand had fallen and this explained the price rise, but it seems quite\nlikely that adherence to '' full cost \" policy is the real explanation. As Lord Keynes\nhas suggested, '' it is rare for anyone but an economist to suppose that price is pre-\ndominantly governed by marginal cost.\"'?\n\n1 See, for example, an article by A.

There is no reason, however, to think that firms which seek maximum\nprofits in the long run do not fix output so as to earn them. One difficulty, of course,\nis that because business expectations are so uncertain, changes in output are usually\nmade hesitantly, and the time lags inevitable in a dynamic world are always present.\nAnother difficulty is that if firms were to seek maximum profits in the short run, the\ngymnastic display required to keep price and output always at the requisite level\nwould prove impracticable. It is interesting to note that one of the few firms which\ndid try to maximise short-run profits (ie. given its existing equipment, there being\nno desire to expand) was one making ladies' fashion goods. Here, there was no desire\nto avoid penalising the consumer, high prices were charged, and changes in the type\nof article produced were very frequent. In more stable industries, this type of behaviour\nwould soon alienate customers and a steadier policy is followed.\n\nThe following tables give the ostensible reasons why prices were not higher or\nlower.\n\nTABLE IV\nReason why $rices were not lower.\n\nLarge Small\n\nfirms firms\nFear of retaliation by competitors 2 I\nNo response by consumers e e. e \u2014 2\nActual or tacit agreement to maintain prices 6 2\nProfits good, price change would reduce them \u2014 7\n8 I2\n\nTasrE V\nReason why $rices were not higher.\n\nLarge Small\n\nfirms firms\nFear of reaction of consumers or competitors 3 IO\nActual or tacit agreement 5 \u2014\nNo desire to earn higher profits \u2014 2\n8 I2\n\nThese figures seem to support the view that a ''full cost \" policy and profit-\nmaximisation are not inconsistent. Most of the firms felt that lower prices would\nlessen profits and were therefore undesirable. In the large firms, there was often a\ntrade association to back up this policy, but in small firms it was carried out voluntarily.\nOn the other hand, prices were not higher because, in most cases, it was thought that\nthere was nothing to be gained from increasing them in view of the expected reactions\nof customers and competitors. It must, of course, be admitted that before the war\nprices would probably have been lowered more readily, and that it is inflationary\npressure which prevents price reductions now, but this does not invalidate the claim\nthat '' full cost \" policy and profit maximisation are quite compatible and consistent.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:56:21 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Where\nconventional or controlled prices were already fixed, the method adopted was different.\nHere, the controlled or fixed price was taken as a target, and the design and quality\nof the product altered to allow the conventional profit margin to be earned when this\nprice was charged.\n\nIf firms do calculate prices in this way, they will arrive at a final figure which will\nbe identical with ''full cost\" as defined by Messrs. Hall and Hitch. Full cost is\ndefined by them in this way: '\" Prime (or ' direct \") cost per unit is taken as a base,\na percentage addition is made to cover overheads (or 'oncost' or ' indirect ' cost),\nand a further conventional addition (frequently ro per cent) is made for profit.\"\nWhile there is no time to debate the matter fully, it may well be that accounting\nconventions provide the main force ensuring the continuance of '' full cost \"\" policies,\nfor what can be easier than to add 5 per cent or 1o per cent to accounting estimates\nof '' total cost \"\" and leave price-fixing at that ?\n\nBut while it is impossible to disagree with the conclusions of those economists\nwhose empirical researches have led them to the conclusion that business men pursue\na. '' full cost \"\" price policy, this does not lead inevitably to the conclusion that marginal\nanalysis is useless.\n\nFirst it must be remembered that business men are always working from incom-\nplete data; they must inevitably take estimated average cost as a basis for their price\npolicy, since this is usually the only figure which they can calculate. Nor is it very\ncom\u00edorting for business men to be told? that if conditions of demand and supply\nremain constant they will be able to find that output which maximises profit by trial\nand error. For in the real world conditions rarely are stable and even profit-maximisa-\ntion by trial and error may be a dangerous pastime. In practice, when there is any\nchange in price, all that the entrepreneur is certain about is the actual result. He\ncan hardly retrace his steps and see what results other price changes could have had.\nEven where the business man tries to maximise profits, he can only do so by taking\na risk, making a change which he assumes will be to his benefit, and seeing what the\nresult is. He cannot then compare this result with that of an alternative move, and\nwhilst he may think that his profits are now maximised, he may be wrong. To suggest\nthat he can do anything else is to imply superhuman knowledge about the results of\npossible moves on his part.\n\nSecond, as has been suggested, a number of entrepreneurs, especially in small\nfirms, did not wish to maximise monetary profits in any case. Where an entrepreneur\nonly tries to earn a '' reasonable \" income, he can hardly be maligned for refusing to\nfollow a line of action which would give him maximum profits !\n\nAllowing for these difficulties, however, there seems no reason to think that the\npursuit of a \"full cost \" policy is necessarily inconsistent with profit-maximisation.\nIn all the firms studied, where the entrepreneurs did aim at maximum profits, they\nclearly tried to keep the margin of profit included in '' full cost \" as wide as possible\nunder given market conditions. While it is quite certain that several entrepreneurs\nrefrained from price changes because they feared the results of such changes, this\nsurely implies nothing but that they thought that they were better off as things were.\nTheir reasons for refusing to change prices may result from incorrect or uncertain\nexpectations, or even purely subjective and non-pecuniary influences, but this merely\ncomplicates their maximisation decision and does not invalidate it.\n\nIt is true, of course, that even if a firm were earning maximum profits, given its\npresent output, this would be no guarantee that profits might not be larger at other\n\n1 Hall and Hitch, op. cit., p. 19.\n?

                    "150 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nwhile there is little doubt that in the long run large firms do try to maximise profits,\nthis can be done only on the basis of their expectations of cost and revenue. These\nmay be wrong, but in most cases it is impossible for the firm to be sure whether a\npolicy based on any other expectations would be more successful. Second, it seems\nthat the output policy of the large firms was, in essence, marginal. Expansion was\nundertaken only if the net result was expected to be increased profits. Admittedly,\nthe estimates of cost and revenue used were long-run ones, but that hardly invalidates\nthe whole of marginal analysis, though it does throw doubt on the importance of\nshort-run analyses of the firm.\n\nIt must be admitted, however, that the firms concerned were at the time chary\nof increasing profits because of trade union views, and developments since the '' wage\nfreeze \"' in 1948 have no doubt accentuated this feeling, but this is likely to be only a\npassing phase. There was also a tendency in large firms to put much money into\nwelfare and re-equipment schemes, but this is clearly not inconsistent with long-term\nprofit-maximisation.\n\nOne further difficulty in large firms is that the divorce between ownership and\ncontrol, which is greatest in such firms, lessens the personal interest of management\nin profit-maximisation. The quest for maximum profits is, therefore, probably carried\nout less diligently than it would be if the management were directly interested in\n\nrofits.\n\nP To sum up, two distinct types of output policy were found. In small firms output\nwas rarely fixed so as to equate marginal cost and marginal revenue, but by rule-of-\nthumb methods, and there was no widespread desire to earn maximum profits.\nObviously some profits had to be made, and just because these businesses did not seek\nmaximum profits, they were not thereby debarred from earning a great deal. Business\nmen are always the first to stress the fact that if they do not try to earn reasonable\nprofits, they will probably suffer losses.\n\nIn large firms, on the other hand, there was a greater desire to earn maximum\nprofits\u2014in the words of one manager, '' You can never earn too much for the share-\nholders \"\u2014but again there was no attempt at careful balancing of marginal revenue\nand marginal cost. In general these firms seemed to be satisfied that long-run profits\nwere maximised, but they had no scientific policy for ensuring this. There was only\na rough-and-ready application of whatever vague expectations of costs and demand\nthey happened to possess.\n\n(b PnRicE Poricv\n\nThe business men's views on price policy were found to be almost unanimous.\nWhere there was no conventional or controlled price for an article, almost all of them\nadmitted that its price was based on '' cost \" and this usually meant the accountant's\nestimate of '' total unit cost \"\u2014corresponding broadly to the economist's '' average\ncost.\"! This estimate usually made allowance for expected changes in the cost of\nmaterials or factors of production and was based on an expected level of output decided\nupon in advance. To this estimate of the '' total cost \" of each article was added a\nprofit margin, based largely on convention. This margin varied from 5 per cent to\nI5 per cent and was related to the turnovers of the different industries. These were\nfound to vary between a turnover of stock twice a year in some cases to one of five\ntimes in others, and it was invariably found that an industry with a low turnover was\n\n! Until further notice we shall use average cost to mean average cost excluding normal profits, since\nbusiness men do not include normal profits in their cost calculations. We shall also ignore the problems\nwhich arise from the fact that business men do not all calculate average cost in the same way. For example,\nwe shall ignore problems arising from different practices in calculating depreciation allowances, but it must\nbe remembered that these are very important in practice.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:56:21 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The chief reason for this seemed to be that the owners of these\nfirms wished, as a rule, merely to earn a comfortable and secure income, and once they\nhad done this they felt that the management problems involved in further expansion\nwould not be worth the returns which they would bring. These firms could almost\ncertainly make larger profits, not only by increasing output, but often merely by using\nmore efficient methods. Yet they did not consider this worth while.\n\nThe manager of a small leather firm gave a most explicit statement of his attitude.\nHe made it clear that he aimed only to secure a comfortable living for himself and\nhis workers, saying he had calculated a target figure for output sufficient to keep his\nmain plant, employing 150 workers, fully occupied. Another plant, which he con-\nsidered was not worth the trouble involved in its management, had been sold. The\ndirectors and workers now had a comfortable existence, free from the many worries\nwhich would exist if output were larger. Expansion was quite possible but was simply\nnot desired.\n\nThis attitude seems to typify that of many employers. They believe that man\nwas not made merely to work, and that the best aim in life is to combine the minimum\nof business with the maximum of pleasure. Another leather manufacturer, this time\nof finished goods, said that he had seen men come into the industry, make more money\nin a few years than he had made in his lifetime, and then leave it. Such a policy did\nnot appeal to him. Provided he had sufficient trade to keep his business running, he\nwas quite content.\n\nAnother important reason for this lack of interest in profit-maximisation is that\none of the reactions to the economic difficulties of the inter-war years has been the\ngrowth of a desire to make certain of a comfortable and stable income over a long\nperiod\u2014a sort of insurance policy. At the moment, also, there is a widespread feeling\nthat high profits are welcomed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and one or two\nfirms deliberately earned smaller profits just to spite him!\n\nPolicies such as these seem to be quite general among small firms, and it would\nbe interesting to discover how important they are in industry as a whole. To do this,\nhowever, it would be necessary to estimate the relative importance of the small firm\nin the modern economy\u2014a very difficult task. Nevertheless, it does seem reasonable\nto assume that the small firm, and this type of policy, is by no means unimportant.\nOne final point is important. Such an attitude is likely to be found in small firms,\nsimply because if they pursued a more progressive policy, they would, presumably,\ncease to be small.\n\nIn the large firms studied, as can be seen from Tables II and III, it was thought\nthat both output and profits were as great as possible, though it was usually long-run\nprofits which were maximised. There are two important facts to notice here. First,\n\nc\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:56:21 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The reaction to this\nwas one of immediate panic, and expectations changed radically. The firms now\ndoubted whether they would in future increase sales at all.\n\nThe ignorance among business men of the nature of marginal analysis and the\nobvious impracticability of calculating the magnitudes of the items involved, do not,\nhowever, necessarily mean that marginal analysis is unrealistic. We must discuss\nfirst the output and second the price policies of the firms investigated before we can\nsay whether these were in any way consistent with marginal theory.\n\n(e) OvrPvT Poricy\n\nIn the firms studied in this survey, output appeared to be determined by reference\nto rule-of-thumb methods and not by careful balancing of cost and revenue. The\nfirms studied claimed to try at all times to keep the whole of their existing plants in\noperation, the reasons for this being as much psychological as economic. Almost all\nof them felt that full employment of the plant was a level of activity at which every\nworker was happily occupied, and was therefore a desirable goal, if only for the sake\nof maintaining morale. For various reasons, they were unwilling to dismiss workers,\nand, as always, displayed a rooted objection to seeing any machine idle. Their aim\nwas to find sufficient orders to keep their factories comfortably occupied. If this\nproved impossible, they regarded it as a measure of their failure in their duty as\nemployers.\n\nDespite these statements, however, it does seem certain that no entrepreneur\nwill run his plant in accordance with these ideals if it means running at a loss, except\nfor relatively short periods. On the other hand, the facts that his expectations are\ninvariably very uncertain and that he does not understand the true nature of marginal\nanalysis, often make him unable to decide when it is best to go on running at loss, and\nwhen to close down altogether. Such decisions are usually made more or less arbitrarily\nand very hesitantly.\n\nIt must be clear that if employers do behave in this way, monetary profits need\nnot be maximised. It will, therefore, be interesting to try to find how often maximum\n\nprofits were sought and how often maximum output was produced. The information\ncollected on these points is summarised below :\n\nTABLE II\n\nFirms!

This\nclearly does not matter very much so long as the tariff which the formula suggests\nwill at least cause an improvement. It seems to be true that too small a tariff cannot\ndecrease '' welfare\"' (always assuming that any real income redistribution is not\nunfavourable), but too large a tariff can obviously do so. Even at the static level of\nanalysis there is, therefore, something to be said in favour of aiming at erring on the\nsmall side. The argument from retaliation would certainly support this view.\n\nThere is, however, another consideration to be taken into account. This concept\nof an *' optimum \" tariff depends on many assumptions. We require a purely com-\npetitive system of fully employed economic individuals, who preferably never die.\nAll dynamic elements are also excluded. Thus our static '\"\" welfare \" model hardly\nfits the world like a glove. When could we, in practice, be at all confident that the\npotential losers really would be unable to bribe the potential gainers ? Surely only\nwhen the conceivable gains were large. But our theory says nothing about the size\nof the conceivable gains. This can only be estimated in some very unscientific way.\nYet one requires to be able to say how large the gain would be if our model did fit the\nworld, in order to be able to make an intelligent guess as to whether there would be\nany gain at all, in view of the fact that the model cannot be said to fit very well. Unless\nthe divergence from '' optimum efficiency \"' is startling, it is, in fact, anyone's guess\nas to whether the change would be good, even assuming that everyone accepted the\nvalue judgments involved.\n\nThere is also the fact that it may be rather difficult to describe what the distri-\nbutional effects of a tariff would be. In which case it would be very difficult for anyone\nto decide whether he regarded the probable redistribution as good or bad. To com-\npensate for this uncertainty the conceivable net gains would need to be all the larger.\n\nOur conclusion is then as follows. If it is not considered a bad thing to harm\nthose who consume relatively most imports, then if the '' optimum \"' tariff formula\nsuggests a large general tariff one might, rather tentatively, recommend a small tariff.\nIf only a small tariff were suggested by the formula one could have very little confi-\ndence that it would be worthwhile. This is all, of course, quite apart from specific\ntariffs for specific purposes, or even a general tariff for a specific purpose.\n\nOxford. I. M. D.

But this rate is itself influenced by the rate in the\npreceding period. As it becomes clear that the rate of interest is not going to return\nto its former level, the public presumes that a permanent fall in the rate of interest has\ntaken place. Each time the expectation as to the future rate of interest is changed\nin this way, the curve will be lowered a trifle.\n\nThe conclusion, therefore, seems to be that the speculation curve itself is nearly\nright-angled, falling vertically until it reaches the level of the expected future rate of\ninterest, and then becoming more and more horizontal. It can therefore be said that\nif this statistical investigation gives the correct result, we have confirmed those theories\nof the shape of the liquidity-preference curve, which are based on Keynes' General\nTheory. The only difference, I think, is that the curve is even more right-angled than\nhas previously been supposed. Furthermore, there is no negative amount of speculative\ncash at very high levels of interest, as has sometimes been assumed.\n\n(9) Before we finish this investigation, a brief account should be given of possible\nerrors in the analysis, and the importance of such errors.\n\nIt will be seen immediately that MT is determined in a rather arbitrary way. It\nseems reasonable, however, to assume that all notes, MN, are used for transaction\npurposes. Within the transaction motive we have also included all those extra-\nordinary motives for holding cash in a war period. A great deal of money was needed\nin Danish as well as German illegal transactions. All such transactions had to be paid\nwith notes, as it was too risky to use cheques, which would disclose by whom and\nto whom the payment was made.\n\nA further difficulty in the above calculation of MT is that we have assumed that\nxM p is independent of the rate of interest. Only more detailed investigations can\nshow if this assumption is correct; but it is fair to assume beforehand that the cash\nwhich the banks hold in order to meet daily outlays is very little affected by small\nchanges in the rate of interest they could obtain by placing the money at current\naccount in the central bank. It is possible that some influence can be demonstrated,\nbut as the amount used for transaction purposes in the case of M p is very small, it is\nnot of any importance for the final result, even if M p, T should have been somewhat\nhigher at low rates of interest.\n\nA third objection to the investigation is that it is pure coincidence that the rate\nof interest and Ms are so highly correlated as is the case.\n\nIt might be maintained that the reason why the correlation is nearly perfect is\nthat both of them are correlated with a third phenomenon. We cannot deny that this\npossibility exists, and, of course, our result would have been more convincing if we\nhad had observations from many up and downward movements, instead of for one\nperiod only. That the result, however, is not merely coincidental is shown by the\nfact that our result is in agreement with theoretical considerations.\n\nA more thorough investigation of this problem would require a comparison with\nsimilar investigations for other periods and other countries.

For suppose that it were true. Then\nwe would be back at our system (i) to (ro) above. This system presumably has a\nsolution, C \u2014 C (t), R \u2014 R (f), X \u2014 X (t), etc., for all the ten variables involved.\nThese solutions contain only one arbitrary constant, which, for example, may be the\nvalue of K at! \u2014 fo. Only under special assumptions could these solutions be such that,\nfor all values of \u00a3, wN \u2014 constant, and PK \u2014 constant.\n\nHence, we reach the following conclusions : (2) An expansion, or contraction, of\nthe total wage bill and the value of the capital stock takes place only as long as the\npoint of maximum profit is not yet reached. (b) If, at a point of time when marginal\nproductivity of labour is equal to the real wage rate, N is not zero, this must be due\nto the fact that w is z^ zero. (c) If, at a point of time when the marginal productivity\nof capital is equal to the rate of interest, K (i.e. real investment) is not zero, this must\nbe due to the fact that P is z^ zero.\n\nEquation (44*) brings out the '' high-volatility \"\" nature of the rate of real invest-\nment. It depends, at any given moment upon the degree to which profit has been\nmaximized and upon the type of price movements that the system permits. Further-\nmore, it is likely that a, is a rather unstable parameter.\n\nThe '' high-volatility \" nature of the demand for investment and its influence\nupon employment can also be described in another way : The su$ply of goods depends\non the presence of a certain sock of labour and a certain stock of capital and, thus,\nimplies\u2014on the part of the producers\u2014essentially a demand function for N and a\ndemand function for K. But the demand for the outbut, X, depends on the demand\nfor D and the demand for K. Since the essential parameters of action of the producers\nare their shares of K and not of K, an effective demand for all the investment goods\nthat the producers want to supply can be insured only by the presence of some stable\nelement of '' inertia \" as suggested by the dynamic relation (44*).\n\nAs a further expansion of the system considered above one might add to the\nright-hand side of (44) a term representing autonomous investment purchases due\nto innovations, etc. This term could then keep the system \"' alive\" (i.e., K z& 0) even\nif the system should otherwise have only damped solutions.\n\nOslo, November, 1948.

According to the same source, the yearly average rose from 93.7 in\n1946 to rIO in I947.\n\nA certain number of favourable circumstances have contributed to bring about\nthis quick and remarkable recovery. Active fighting in Belgium was short and the\ndestruction caused by the Liberation fighting was not so serious as in France or in the\nNetherlands. The country's industrial equipment, although it had to some extent\ngrown old and obsolete, had been fairly well maintained, and could be used to its full\ncapacity as soon as raw materials became available. Modernisation could, without\ngreat inconvenience, be postponed until the greatest shortages had been alleviated.\nThe main body of the labour force had been preserved. The country's large gold\nreserve had been kept intact during the war. Important dollar and sterling payments\nwere received from the Allies in reimbursement for the troop pay advances, while\nother income accumulated from investments abroad and the repatriation of short-\nterm capital also provided substantial exchange receipts. These ample resources in\ngold and foreign exchange enabled Belgium to import large quantities of food, raw\nmaterials and new industrial equipment. The supplies received from the Allies in\ncompensation for the Belgian Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid contributions also brought\nvaluable help. These big imports, allowing production to restart and leading to a\nquick return to normal of supply conditions, were probably the most decisive factor\nin the whole recovery process.\n\nThe orderly relations which were restored in the monetary system through the\nmonetary and fiscal programme, by increasing confidence in the currency and pro-\nmoting at least a relative stability, helped to create a climate propitious for the ex-\nploitation of the country's economic potentialities. The reflationary monetary policy,\nthe flexible and moderately expansive policy followed in respect of prices and wages,\nthe fairly liberal attitude adopted towards production and consumption, should\nalso be considered favourable factors. The general opinion in Belgium is that a com-\nparison of the results achieved so far, with those arrived at in countries like Great\nBritain or the Netherlands, where policies of restriction and control of prices and\ndistribution were applied with much more rigidity, argues in favour of the more\nflexible attitude adopted in Belgium. Personally, we think that it is premature to\ncome to a definite conclusion in this respect, which could only be reached on the basis\nof a thoroughgoing investigation of all the factors involved.\n\nIt would be futile to make any guess as to the specific part which should be\nattributed to the monetary experiment in the Belgian recovery process. The quan-\ntitative monetary aspect seems to have had little or no direct influence on the volume\nof production. The increase in output was determined primarily by the real economic\nfactors which were fundamental to the recovery (availability of industrial equipment,\nfood and raw materials in reasonable supply, undamaged labour force). Actually,\nthe severe money cut may even have hampered production in some cases during the\nearliest phase of the contraction, although this can hardly have been of much im-\nportance. The main merit of the monetary operation as it concerns production and\neconomic recovery, is rather to be sought in an indirect and more general direction in\nproviding that feeling of confidence, order and stability which is indispensable to the\nrestoration of a sound and vigorous economy. In this sense, the monetary and fiscal\nprogramme undoubtedly played a major r\u00f3le in the process of recovery.\n\nBrussels, Belgium. A. V.

In\npractice, the presence of oligopolistic competition between the banks makes for a\ndegree of rigidity in the rate on deposits which may have a certain bearing on our\nproblem ; for it means that the rate on bank loans indeed varies within certain limits\nwithout the deposit rate being affected. Any considerable rise in the rate on bank\nloans, on the other hand, should be and usually is followed by a similar rise in the\ndeposit rate, so that this objection to the theory is only of limited importance.\n\nMr. Wilson has pointed out! that one consequence of the rigidity of the deposit\nrate makes for greater instability in the system. By shifting balances from deposit to\ncurrent account, money can be '' borrowed \" from the banks without any effect on\nthe rate of interest. Or, looking at it from another point of view, the quantity of money\ncan be increased by such a shift, even though the banks are unwilling themselves to\nexpand credit (using the phrase in the customary sense).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn opposition to the views of Mr. Wilson,? I would submit that the Keynesian\ntechnique is still very much the simpler and more elegant method of presenting as a\nwhole the theory of the rate of interest and of effective demand, even though it relies\nfor its simplicity perhaps too much on an assumption which is at best only an approx-\nimation to the truth.? This is not to deny that the loanable funds approach may be\nmore useful in the analysis of particular problems. Indeed, it will probably be found\nto be more capable of taking into account those refinements which will bring the\ntheory into closer relation with the institutional practice of the capital market. If the\ntwo techniques are to continue to be used in the analysis of related problems, however,\ntwo dangers should be guarded against. First, it is inadvisable to change techniques\nin the middle of a piece of analysis. I agree entirely with Mr. Tsiang when he criticises\nMr. Kaldor for using a '' flow \"\" approach in his analysis of the securities, but reverting\nto a \"' stock \" approach in his analysis of the short loan market. Such a procedure\nis very likely to lead to confusion. The second danger we have already discussed :\nit is that the simultaneous use of the two approaches may give rise to controversies\nwhich rest on misunderstanding rather than any fundamental difference of opinion.\nThis can be prevented only if the language of the one approach can be made more\nreadily translatable into that of the other. I hope the foregoing paragraphs may have\ncontributed something to this end.\n\nOxford. CHARLES KENNEDY.\n\n1 Op. cit., p. 288. Cf. also Kaldor, op. cit., p. 14n.\n\n?

For the\nsame reasons, the exemptions granted were small: 40,000 francs per family head,\nplus 40,000 francs for the wife, plus 10,000 or 15,000 francs per child. A further\nexemption up to 20,000 francs was allowed on savings deposits.\n\nSuch were the main features and phases of the reform technique as finally adopted.\nBy blocking initially all the old purchasing power and releasing immediately only a\nsmall fraction, the new money circulation was reduced to the level considered as\njustified in relation to the current volume of economic activity, the new exchange rate,\nand the planned price and wage level. By transforming a large fraction of the with-\ndrawn purchasing power into temporarily undisposable balances which would be\ngradually released as output and imports improved, a desirable elasticity in the money\nsupply was provided for. Finally, by first neutralising through blocking and forced\nloan, and then destroying through exceptional taxation, the fraction of old purchasing\npower considered as being ultimately in excess, the operation was completed and a\nnew monetary and financial equilibrium in accordance with the country's productive\ncapacity and its new price and exchange rate structure could be reached.

The various reports so far published by the C.P.B. all\nemphasise the necessity for the programme contained in the above five points by\ntrying to give them a numerical value.\n\nApart from the strict rationing of consumers' goods which is still enforced, and\napart from the rigorous price and wage regulations still prevailing, the following\nsuggestions have been made by the C.P.B.: (r) In order further to stimulate labour\nproductivity, an extended application of piece-rates on the one hand, and of modern\nlabour management methods on the other. (2) In order to stimulate industrialisation,\nfurther concessions in respect of the taxation of profits. Taxes on profits, which\namounted to about 70 to 80 per cent during the war, have been reduced to 40 per\ncent; important tax concessions are also already available for new investment. In\naddition to these alleviations further industrial freedom seems to be called for in order\nto stimulate the process of readjustment. Accordingly, the C.P.B. considers that its\nfuture task lies especially in the field of employment policy. It is believed that within\nthe framework of a good tax system and a well-advised employment policy (factors\nwhich partly overlap) ; and within the framework of existing international regula-\ntions (or those to be expected) the restoration of free enterprise would probably be\nall to the good. Experiments will probably be made in this respect through the indus-\ntrial organisations which have lately been proposed. The activities of these bodies\nmay either extend over rather a broad field or over only a restricted area, as seems\nmost convenient after a process of trial and error. The preparation of a modern em-\nployment policy along these lines has already been begun. Apart from the tax proposals\njust mentioned, further proposals are now being investigated which would tend to\nconcentrate the tax burden on boom years, and to create facilities for investment in\ndepression periods.

Although uncertainty\nwill still be present in a collectivist economy, there seems no reason to expect such\nserious changes in yield-expectations as to nullify the influence of the rate of interest.\nThe propensity to consume will almost certainly be higher in a more egalitarian society.\nWhat experience we have of socialism suggests that the planners will more often\ncomplain of shortage of investment resources than of investment opportunities.\n\nFirm believers in the '' stagnation thesis \" may still shake their heads gloomily\nand continue to insist on the likelihood that the lowest conceivable rate of interest will\nfail to stimulate sufficient investment to fill the vast. gap between full employment\nincome and consumption out of that income in a very rich country. As a hypothesis,\nlet this possibility be admitted. Does it mean that the rate of interest cannot be\nrelied upon to equate saving and investment at a full-employment level? Not at all.\nIt merely means that the rate of interest would have to be negative, expressing the\nfact that in such a society the postponement of consumption involves a cost, while\nthe facilitating of such postponement through capital expenditure confers a benefit\nand deserves reward. A carrying cost would then have to be attached to money, as\nwell as a charge imposed on lending. It is actually very difficult to imagine a society\nin which the marginal efficiency of capital is less than zero, a society in which, in\nKeynes' phrase,?

These intervals have one advantage over the intervals usually developed\nfor the cost-of-iving index from indexes of the Paasche and Laspeyres type. The\nlatter intervals provided only an upper limit for the index on one base and a lower\nlimit for the index on another base; they do not provide upper and lower bounds for\na given index simultaneously. On the other hand, our intervals give upper and lower\nbounds for the index on any base; and, furthermore, it is possible to calculate the\nprobability that the true value of the index will be covered by our interval in repeated\nsamples.\n\nIt should be pointed out, however, that our index is subject to the restrictions\nthat apply to all indexes based on the theory of consumer behaviour. In addition to\nthe fulfilment of the obvious restriction that the base period indifference map remains\ninvariant in other periods, there are moore subtle restrictions connected with the\ntransformation from individual to market data. What the economic theory of the\ntrue cost-of-living index really gives is a cost-of-living index for an individual. This\nmeans that to use our method of calculating the index on the basis of parameters of\nthe demand functions, we must have a knowledge of the properties of the demand\nequations of an individual. The demand equations that we customarily estimate\nstatistically are demand curves based on market data that refer to an entire group\nof individuals.\n\nThe following interpretation of our results, and, for that matter, the results of\nother methods of calculating the true cost of living, seems to be the most satisfactory\nsolution. Regard the indifference map as pertaining to an average individual, say, a\nfamily head earning an average wage in a typical urban area. This is specifically the\nsituation that is claimed for many official cost-of-living indexes. Estimate the demand\nequations from fer capita market data, and regard these statistical demand equations\nas pertaining to the average individual whose cost-of-living is being measured. This\nis the usual interpretation of fer capita demand equations. Then use the estimated\nparameters of the fer capita demand equation to calculate the cost-of-living index\nfor the average individual whose utility level is to remain constant.\n\nChicago. L. R.

But it is nevertheless probably worth mentioning.\n\nTwo separate approaches have been made to the general problem of determining\nthe changes in real income resulting from the introduction of rationing. One is to ask :\nAssuming his tastes to remain unaltered, by how much must a particular consumer's\nmoney income be changed when rationing is introduced to leave him just as well off\nas he was in the pre-rationing situation ? Methods of answering this question, under\nvarious simplitying assumptions, have been devised by Messrs. Kaldor! and Nicholson.?\nThe other is to ask: By how much would it have been necessary to have changed his\nincome in the pre-rationing situation to have made him just as well off as he is, in fact,\nunder rationing. This was the question Erwin Rothbarth tackled.? He introduced the\nidea of a virtual $rice system\u2014one under which the consumer would have exactly the\nsame pattern of consumption as he, in fact, has under rationing\u2014and showed that if\nsuch a virtual price system could be found ordinary price index number theory could\nbe applied to it to obtain the limits within which the required income-change must lie.\n\nIt hardly requires emphasis that the virtual price system is unlikely to be the same\nfor any two consumers; or, if we assume \u2014as is customary in this field\u2014that con-\nsumers have identical tastes, that it will differ for consumers with different money\nincomes (assuming point incomes to be the same for all). And the problem of finding\nthe virtual price system for consumers with a given money income is likely to be\ndifficult enough. Moreover, the very large changes in relative prices, compared with\neither the rationing or the pre-rationing situation, that the virtual price system would\nrepresent, seem at first sight to enhance this difficulty considerably. It is this latter\nsource of difficulty that the Slutsky equation helps us to avoid. We proceed as follows :\n\nUnder the virtual price system the pattern of consumption of our consumer is\nidentical with his actual consumption under rationing. Hence the equilibrium marginal\nutilities of the commodities must be unchanged. Denote the marginal utility of money\n\nunder the virtual price system by \u2014p, and the virtual prices by \u00ab; (/ \u2014 1,2, .. ., ^;\nnote that Z7; x; \u2014 I). Then the equilibrium marginal utilities are given by the\nequations :\n\nUi -- umi \u20140 (21,2,...,n*).\nUnder rationing these are given by the equations (2) of 2 (1), so we must have :\n\nuri \u2014 Mi XNpPid...dd Mf (21,2,...m) ........

And so the problem of determining the virtual prices resolves\nitself into that of estimating the ratio M/As.

(4) It is clear from the foregoing summary that if, in the usual way, we define\ncomplementarity with reference to the sign of the substitution term, we are spared\nsuch concepts as ''point complementarity \" and ' money independence.\" For, as\n\nstated at the end of 2 (3): .\n(0x4 [05* 2. \u2014\u2014MX D(Ug|D .(5j\u201412,...m)......

And so we can\nspeak of ; and j being complementary, independent or competing goods (at the\nprevailing set of point and money prices and incomes) quite unambiguously.\n\nIt is not a very difficult matter to show that, when rationing is effective, all the\nsubstitution terms obey the six rules commonly stipulated for them in the absence of\nrationing.? We shall not prove this here, but it is worth mentioning one of its implica-\ntions. Suppose tea and sugar to be effectively priced in terms of the kth group of\npoint prices, and suppose them to be the only goods \"' on\" these points. Then one\nof the six rules tells us that tea and sugar must be substitutes\u2014although, in the\nabsence of rationing, we might expect them to be complementary. This illustration\nsimply serves to emphasise that the introduction of rationing may change the relations\nexisting between goods.\n\n2. (5) The reader may easily verify that the matrix of income-effect terms is\nthe north-east partition of A\u2014t, after this submatrix has been premultiplied by the\nscalar (\u2014 xj) ; and he will see that there exists no simple relation between, say,\n\u2014 Xj (0x;[01*) and \u2014 x; (Ox;[0Is). And so, although we are fortunate enough to be\nspared such concepts as '\"' point complementarity,\" it will be clear to him that we\ncannot escape the following ones : goods which are inferior or non-inferior with respect\nto a particular point-group income, those which are inferior or non-inferior with\nrespect to another point-group income, and those which are inferior or non-inferior\nwith respect to money. An every-day example of this is not difficult to find. A large\nnumber of to-day's unrationed luxuries, for instance, which are surely non-inferior\nwith respect to money, are very probably inferior with respect to points. For a large\nnumber of these unrationed luxuries are bought precisely because rationing has blocked\nother channels of expenditure. When a point income is increased, therefore, we should\nexpect to find a reduction in the quantity purchased. If this is indeed the case, they\nare inferior goods with respect to that point income.\n\n3. Apart from its purely theoretical interest, the significance of the preceding\nanalysis lies in the fact that it\u2014or, more specifically, the Slutsky equation\u2014seems to\nprovide a possible line of approach to the very difficult, and not unimportant, problem\nof determining the magnitude of the changes in real income brought about by the\nintroduction of point-rationing. It should be emphasised at the outset that the solution\nsuggested in the lines that follow is not altogether satisfactory. It depends upon the\npossibility of estimating, or '' guessing intelligently \" (3r 4- 1) elasticities\u2014where \u00bb\nis the number of different sorts of points that are effective for a particular consumer ;\n\n1'This concludes our summary of those of Professor Samuelson's results we require.\n?

It may\nreasonably be objected, however, that in the purchase of rationed commodities the\ncareful distribution of expenditure through time, which\u2014in the absence of rationing\n\u2014probably helps to smooth out discontinuities quite appreciably, is limited by the\nperiod of currency of the points, and is the more difficult to achieve the shorter this\nperiod. While probably valid, it is unlikely that this objection is of much importance.\n\nFinally, provided that at least one commodity is not rationed, the consumer\nwill spend the full amount of his money income. (Saving may, if desired, be numbered\namong the commodities). But he need not spend fully his point incomes. He may,\nfor instance, be too poor to afford it; or he may be unwilling to consume the rationed\ncommodities under any circumstances whatsoever. When this is the case, one or\nmore inequalities will hold in (1), the corresponding Lagrange multipliers in (2) will\nbe zero, and the consumer will be unaffected by the corresponding groups of point\nprices. Professor Samuelson calls these prices ineffective) And when an equality\nsign holds in (1) he calls the corresponding group of point prices effective. It seems\nto me, however, that it is both more natural and more convenient to say that a\nparticular group of point prices is effective when, and only when, the corresponding\nLagrange multiplier is not zero\u2014i.e. when, and only when, it brings about a re-\nadjustment of the consumer's equilibrium pattern of expenditure in accordance with\nthe equations (2). It is easy to see that this is a stronger condition than Professor\nSamuelson's. For if a consumer is given a number of points just sufficient to maintain\nhis pre-rationing pattern of expenditure, the corresponding Lagrange multiplier will\nbe zero and yet the equality sign will hold in the relevant equation in (r)?.\n\n2.

The notes that follow are based on excerpts from a lengthier paper on the\ntheory of consumers' choice under rationing,! most of the results of which had\u2014I\nfind\u2014been anticipated by Paul A.

The matters primarily discussed are: (7) the interpretation of the\nSlutsky equation when point-rationing is in force, and (i?) the use of this equation in\nconnection with the measurement of changes in real income resulting from the intro-\nduction of point-rationing. First, however, we shall summarise some of Professor\nSamuelson's results. This is done in 2 (1) and 2 (3) below. 2 (2) contains some com-\nments on them.

When an inequality\nholds, the corresponding Lagrange multiplier is set equal to zero.\n\n2. (2) A few comments may be interjected at this stage. Firstly, Mr. K. W.\nRothschild has suggested? that a commodity may stand high in a consumer's\npreference-scale simply because it is rationed ; or, alternatively, that the bother\ninvolved in buying a rationed commodity may lower its position in the scale. Since\nneither point nor money prices appear among the independent variables in our utility\nfunction, we must consider a different utility function for each different set of point\nand money prices if we want to take cases such as these into account. Generally,\nhowever, little harm will be done by abstracting from these complications.\n\n1 Towards an.

The\ngain is entirely (indeed more than entirely) at the expense of the rest of the world,\nand is therefore immoral. But if this argument is to be taken seriously it points to\npositive subsidies on imports (or on exports), which will benefit the rest of the world\nby turning the terms of trade in favour of the rest of the world. When it comes to\nmorality there is no particular virtue in stopping at free trade.\n\nIt remains, of course, true that in an equilibrium position in which each country\ncharges the optimum tariff most, if not all, countries would be worse off than they\nwould be with universal free trade. In just the same way as monopolistic combination\nbetween competitive producers will benefit all of them, so can the countries of the\nworld benefit themselves by a restrictionist agreement to maintain free trade.? But\nthe success of a policy of universal free trade is seriously prejudiced by the belief that\ncountries which indulge in protection are acting contrary to their own economic\ninterests. It is because the /a2ssez-faire economist has so often believed that free trade\nis the natural state of affairs which, in the absence of stupidity and wickedness, would\nprevail that his attempts to establish it have not been more successful. As Mr. de\nScitovsky has said: '\" It is not enough to declare the desirability of free trade and\ntrust that enlightenment will bring it about : nor is it enough to create initial conditions\n\nfavourable to it: it must be imposed and enforced. . . .

The\ncontingent liabilities against which a certain minimum degree of liquidity in this\nsense provides a buffer are represented by possible net deficits arising from disequili-\nbrium in all the spontaneous items of the balance of payments, whether on current\nor capital account. On this definition, therefore, the \"' liquidity position \" of a country\nwould apparently not be affected by an increase in its short-term foreign indebtedness\nwhich would merely imply an increase in its contingent liabilities and therefore in its\nneed. for liquidity. This, however, would lead to absurd conclusions. For any given\nbalance of payments disequilibrium can be offset either by a reduction in the deficit\ncountry's foreign balances in the surplus country or by an increase in the surplus\ncountry's foreign balances in the deficit country. The former case would imply a\nreduction in the deficit country's holdings of international liquid assets, the latter\nmerely an increase in its foreign short-term indebtedness. Which types of trans-\naction takes place in any particular situation is of no economic importance. Yet\naccording to this definition, it would seem that the former would and the latter would\nnot affect the country's \"liquidity position.\"\n\nClearly, there is something wrong. The answer suggests itself if we consider once\nagain the case of a bank in a domestic economy. It is usual to define the \"' liquidity\nposition \"' of a bank, not in terms of the disposition of its assets only, but in terms of\ncertain va/ios of assets to liabilities, especially the ratios of cash to deposits and of\nliquid assets (or, conversely, advances) to deposits. It is clear that this is also the\nonly feasible approach to the concept of \"liquidity position \" in the international\ncontext.\n\nIf we wished to compare the relative \"' liquidity positions \" of two countries, it\nwould be meaningless to compare the absolute amounts of their holdings of inter-\nnational liquid reserves, even in conjunction with all other items on the credit side of\ntheir international capital accounts. Their respective holdings would be significant\nonly in relation to their respective need for liquidity, in other words, to their contingent\nbalance of payments deficits. A logically satisfactory definition of international\n*']iquidity position \" must, therefore, run somehow in terms of a country's holdings\nof actual and '' potential\" international liquid assets i4 relation to its actual and\ncontingent international liabilities in the form of temporary balance of payments\ndeficits.! In practice, if the concept is to be of use, it will be necessary, internationally\nas much as in domestic theory, to devise some rough and ready measure of liquidity\nposition, in the form of some significant ratio. This, however, is another question\nconsideration of which must be left to another occasion.\n\nThis interpretation must also be applied to Dr. Balogh's use of the term '' liquidity position \" when\nhe, in effect, defines short-term balance of payments equilibrium as a state in which the '' liquidity position\nof a country remains unchanged (see Note 5, p. 22). On that definition, any disequilibrium will show itself\neither in a change in the country's holdings of '* international liquid assets \" (though not necessarily in the\nnarrow sense of official gold and foreign exchange reserves) ov in a change in its foreign short-term debt.\nFor practical purposes, it can be assumed that the effect on the country's \"liquidity position \" will be\nequal in either case ; although, strictly speaking, this will hold only if the ratio between assets and liabilities\nwhich is selected as the most appropriate measure of a country's liquidity position is 1 : 1.\n\nSydney.

While I do not\nwish to defend my article in toto, as I should now present the point somewhat\ndifferently, I am also not willing to accept the whole of his criticism. This falls into\nthree parts: he argues that I have misunderstood and misrepresented a section of\n\" 'The Theory of Monopolistic Competition\" ; that my own suggested technique is\nbased upon error; and that the problem created for economic analysis by the fact\nthat advertisement creates interdependence between cost conditions and demand\nconditions cannot be eliminated by devising a technique of subtraction.\n\nOn the first of these points I am prepared to let the case rest; both texts are\navailable, and where difference arises it is only reasonable that Professor Chamberlin's\ninterpretation of his own works should be accepted. On the third, I am in complete\naccord, and only the clumsiness of my presentation could have conveyed a different\nimpression, particularly, as Professor Chamberlin notes, in view of my subsequent\nwork in the same field. I therefore devote the greater part of this note to developing\nthis more fruitful theme. The second I cannot accept. In a note in the Qwarterly\nJournal of Economics for May, 1935, \" Discontinuous Demand Curves and Mono-\npolistic Competition,\" quoted in the bibliography to the fifth edition of '' Monopolistic\nCompetition\", I present the full diagram of which only a part appears in my REvIEW\narticle, and from it the argument is self-evident. Or it can be proved in the following\nmanner, for which I am indebted to Dr. E. G. Phillips of this University.\n\nIf & is the total expenditure on advertising, ? the price, and x the quantity\ndemanded for any combination of ? and &, then the height of the curve PQ on my\ndiagram is y \u2014 $ \u2014 \" when $ is given.\n\nIf k is given, this equation gives a family of curves, each for a value of ?$. The\nenvelope of the family is given by:\n\nie., \u2014rictxz . ap^ when\n\nmeans the derivative when x is kept constant in the fundamental relation between\nx, k and $.

It thus denotes, for any given quantity of sales, the point of maximum revenue.\n\nI should not now claim that the conditions of full equilibrium were to be derived\nfrom my diagram. My object in presenting it was not to remove advertising costs and\nthe results of advertisements from the picture, but indeed to emphasise the extent\nto which the entrepreneur in an imperfect market must always give simultaneous\n\n40\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:20:02 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

If some coupons are unused in\nthe absence of legal sale, then the right to sell them means that coupon prices must be\nraised. Even in this case the losers could be compensated so that no consumer was\nworse off and some people were better off than before.! The problems revealed by\nreports of people who could not afford to use their clothing coupons and who have\nbeen prosecuted for selling them, suggest strongly that the present position is failing\nto maintain the goal of greater equality. But it soon becomes apparent that legalised\nsale of coupons would not necessarily aid in the achievement of either of the purposes\nit has in view.\n\nIn terms of equality, it is not possible to say of a given change whether it increases\nor decreases equality in cases where it affects different income ranges in different\nways; this is the case here. The poor gain relative to the middle group, so that\nequality in this range is increased, but the rich also gain relatively to the middle group,\nso that here equality is reduced. There is no meaning to be given to the question as\nto whether, on balance, there is greater or less equality. There is one policy available\nwhich would be free from this objection and which would reduce the Black Market\nsupply of coupons. If the government were to purchase from their owners surplus\ncoupons it would raise the satisfaction obtainable by the poorest without increasing\nthat of the rich. At the same time it would reduce the tendency to use up coupons\nsimply because they are available. Finally, it would ensure that for the poor the\nrates of substitution between products.did not diverge greatly from the ratio of their\nmarginal costs.\n\nBut even this one-way convertibility of coupons into money is subject to con-\nsiderable disadvantages. The first is the administrative difficulty and the encourage-\nment of fraud. The experiment of making bread units convertible into points showed\nthe danger of making it possible to convert a surplus of one form of coupon into some\nother form ; those who were in a position to cheat the rationing system for one product\nwere enabled to extend their advantage to other commodities. Besides this, such a\nsystem would run counter to the paternalist element in rationing ; it would weaken\nthe incentive which rationing provides to consume what is good for us rather than\nwhat we happen to prefer. To many this would seem a major reason for refusing to\nredeem any ration coupons in money.\n\nThese considerations are presented to show that even an adequate theory of\nrationing cannot provide complete answers to policy questions. Once the state takes\non the task of restricting consumer demand, it cannot take consumers' preferences\nas the sole relevant data and the problems are complicated by administrative problems\nand by specific social ends which are not those of the individual consumer.\n\nManchester.

                    "NATIONAL CENTRAL BANKING THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY 75\n\nThe main result of such policies is, therefore, to propagate to the world at large\nany cyclical disturbance arising in a major economic area. Balance of payments\ndeficits may be corrected in the end, but mostly as the result of a general decline in\nincome and economic activity. Furthermore, the accompanying price changes will\nleave in their wake a basically unbalanced structure of international prices when the\ncyclical depression subsides and more normal conditions are restored.\n\nWhenever balance of payments disequilibria are due, not to international price\ndisparities, but to accidental factors or to cyclical fluctuations in foreign income and\ndemand, compensatory policies should be followed to the fullest possible extent. This\nrequires a high level of international reserves, especially in raw material and food\nproducing countries, and the willingness to spend these reserves liberally in times of\ncrisis and to accumulate them during prosperous years. When reserves are insufficient,\nforeign or international assistance\u2014such as contemplated under the International\nMonetary Fund\u2014would be necessary. Failing this, exchange control should be used\nas a third line of defense, in order to continue compensatory policies and avoid the\ngreater evils inseparable from deflation or currency devaluation. The disadvantage of\nthe latter policies, as compared to exchange control, is that their corrective effect on\nthe balance of payments is likely to depend on an income contraction several times the\nsize of the international deficit to be plugged.\n\nExchange control, however, should be restricted to periods of temporary exchange\ndifficulties, and should not be used to elude readjustments to fundamental disequilibria.\nEven more important, the system of controls to be adopted should preserve the multi-\nlateralism and flexibility of international trade. It should not lend itself to adminis-\ntrative arbitrariness, rigid and uneconomic allocation of exchange, discrimination and\nbilateralism. These historical evils associated with exchange control as used in the\ninter-war period, should not lead to a blind and dogmatic rejection of exchange control\nas such, but to concrete efforts to dissociate it from such abuses, and make it a fit\ninstrument for the protection of the economy and the currency against temporary\npressures on the exchange.\n\nWashington.

                    "74 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nselective policies designed to plug the main leaks in the balance of payments, with a\nminimum impact on basic economic activities and on production and living costs.\n\nDevaluation is also of limited value as a remedy for pervasive maladjustments,\nwhether cyclical or fundamental, affecting simultaneously a large number of countries.\nAgricultural over-production, for instance, may disrupt at the same time the inter-\nnational balance of all the competing countries whose exports are largely concentrated\non the overproduced commodities. Concerted international action designed toward\nreadjustment would be preferable, in this case, to cut-throat competition through\nlower prices or currency devaluation. The lack of balance between supply and demand\nshould be gauged, moreover, not with relation to abnormally low levels of demand\nassociated with a world depression, but in terms of normal requirements. The ever-\nnormal granary concept should be extended beyond national borders through inter-\nnational commodity agreements. It is true that such agreements may lead to opposite\nabuses and to artificial efforts permanently to maintain prices at higher than com-\npetitive levels. The dilemma, however, is an inescapable one. Unfettered competition\nin a market dominated by a few large sellers cannot ensure competitive prices. It may\nvery often lead either to cut-throat underselling, or to monopolistic pricing through\nformal or informal cartel agreements, price leadership, etc. This is true at the inter-\nnational level as well as at the national one. International commodity agreements\nshould be so organised as to prevent domination of policies by vested interests of the\nproducers or of their governments. Broad representation of consuming countries,\ntogether with the adoption of some automatic or semi-automatic indicators, may help\nto avoid'major errors. In the long run, however, policy decisions can never be dis-\nSociated from responsibility. The refusal to take action is no solution in the face of the\nbreakdown, or unavailability, of the impersonal, competitive mechanisms which, in\nclassical theory, justified non-interference with market forces.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe classical theory of international balance and of readjustments to balance of\npayments disequilibria centres around disparities in a single country's price and cost\nlevels with relation to the rest of the world. Under such conditions, domestic deflation\n\u2014if costs are not too rigid\u2014or currency devaluation may be able to bring about\nreadjustment, through the restoration of the country's competitive position in world\nmarkets.\n\nThis doctrine was mistakenly extended, especially by the '' rules of the game \"\"\nadherents, to world-wide cyclical disequilibria, originating in one, or a few, highly\ndeveloped and industrialised countries. Efforts by other countries to correct resulting\nbalance of payments deficits, either through price deflation or exchange devaluation,\nare then thwarted because such action by any one country or group of countries\naggravates the difficulties in their supply and export markets, as well as in competing\ncountries, and leads to similar, and mutually self-defeating, measures of defense.\nPrice deflation and devaluation spread from country to country without increasing\nexport receipts, especially if world demand for a nation's exports is relatively inelastic.\nThe situation presents a strong analogy with that of oligopoly, where each effort by\none seller to cut into the competitors' markets is thwarted by the competitors' price\nretaliation. Thus, the actual elasticity of demand for one country's exports is merged\nwith the much lower world's elasticity of demand for those products. Sales can be\nexpanded only in so far as lower prices stimulate consumption, and not through inroads\ninto the competitors' sales.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:22:47 UTC\nAI use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "NATIONAL CENTRAL BANKING THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY 73\n\nto 13.7 billions at the end of 1933.! The impact of the disequilibrium was thus felt,\nnot in a deficit in the balance of payments, but in a drastic decline in economic activity\nand incomes, especially in the so-called '' non-sheltered \" industries, in competition\nwith foreign firms in the national or international markets.?\n\nIt has recently been argued that a country subject to such pressures should attempt\nto protect itself through domestic compensatory policies, but should not be allowed\nto devalue its currency unless, and until, these policies have led to an actual deficit\nin the balance of international payments.? This attitude is open to serious objections.\nFirst of all, it would lead to unnecessary disruptions, since labour and other economic\nfactors would have to be uprooted and transferred into temporary activities, such as\npublic works, for instance, and then returned to their normal field of employment,\nwhen currency devaluation makes it again profitable and economic. Secondly, the\nScope of compensatory action may be relatively limited, especially in undeveloped\ncountries heavily dependent on the exportation of primary products. For such\ncountries, currency devaluation will often be the most direct, or even the only effective,\nway of maintaining domestic levels of income.\n\nWhat is true, however, is that devaluation should not be regarded as a proper\nand legitimate remedy for any domestic depression, whatever its origin ; but neither\nshould it be regarded as legitimate and desirable merely because a country is experienc-\ning balance of payments difficulties. The Belgian case showed clear evidence that\nexternal pressures resulting from the undervaluation of the pound with respect to the\nfranc, were at the root of a severe domestic depression, but this evidence did not\nemerge from balance of payments data. On the other hand, balance of payments\ndeficits are often the result of cyclical, rather than fundamental disequilibria, and\ndevaluation, in that case, would usually be a most undesirable remedy, from a national\nas well as from an international viewpoint.\n\nFinally, not every fundamental disequilibrium should be ascribed to, or corrected\nby, currency devaluation. For instance, the difficulties of the nitrate industry in\nChile, following the development of synthetic nitrates, were of a fundamental character\nand have had a deep impact on the international balance of the country. Devaluation,\neven though probably unavoidable under the circumstances, could not be expected to\nrighten by itself the Chilean economy. Domestic monetary and fiscal policies, changes\nin the tariff structure, diversification of production and modernisation of industrial\nand agricultural techniques, possibly with foreign help, may prove better remedies\nthan, or the indispensable complement of, currency readjustments. A specially\ninteresting case is the one of colonial economies in which income expansion may lead\nrapidly and directly to balance of payments disequilibria, because of its effects on\nluxury imports, tourist expenditure abroad, capital exports and the like, rather than\nbecause of any upward pressure on domestic wage and cost levels. Devaluation is a\nvery blunt and indiscriminate instrument and may often be a less efficient tool than\n\n! A decline to 12.5 took place in the latter part of 1934, but is to be ascribed primarily to capital flight,\nprompted by the approaching devaluation of the currency.\n\n3 See Robert Triffin, '' La th\u00e9orie de la sur\u00e9valuation mon\u00e9taire et la d\u00e9valuation belge,\" Bulletin de\nl'Institut de Recherches Economiques, Louvain, Belgium, November, 1937, pp. 19-52.\n\n* See Gottfried Haberler, ' Currency Depreciation and the International Monetary Fund,\" Review\nof Economic Statistics, Vol. XXVI (November, 1944), pp. 178-81. A draft of the present paper was sub-\nmitted to Professor Haberler, who commented as follows on this point, in his reply : '* As to your discussion\nof what is meant by fundamental disequilibrium, I would make this concession : If it could be shown that\nincome effects in fact operate so fast that depreciation will not lead to an appreciable balance of payments\nsurplus, I would not object to it. I still believe, however, that that is a rather fanciful case. I would agree,\nhowever, that depreciation on the part of a small country need not be ruled out even if it led to a temporary\ninflow of gold, especially if that inflow was only to compensate for an outflow which has taken place some\ntime in the past. I think I could handle all those cases with appropriate and reasonable interpretations of\nthe balance of payments criterion.\"\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:22:47 UTC\nAI use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The country's indebtedness would then grow without lasting\nbenefit to it, and the resources of the Fund would be wasted in a manner directly\ncontrary to the objectives of the institution.! The Fund, however, can protect itself\nagainst such abuses, not only through the ceilings placed on each country's presumptive\nborrowing rights, but also through the application of Article V, Section 5 of the Fund's\nCharter.\n\nThe diagnosis of a fundamental disequilibrium, however, is not an easy task. A\nmere deficit in a country's balance of payments is, of course, no evidence of an excessive\nand untenable level of domestic, as compared with international prices. Contrary to\nthe '' rules of the game \" concept, it should not, therefore, be taken as a signal for\ndeflationary policies. Compensatory action should be preferred, and supported by the\nFund, whenever the deficit can be ascribed to accidental causes, such as a crop failure,\nor to a cyclical world depression. Similarly, a favourable balance of payments, not\nassociated with international cost and price disparities, should not be viewed as\nrequiring expansionary policies disruptive of domestic stability and conducive to\ninflationary price rises.\n\nBefore assuming the existence of a durable disqeuilibiurm calling for corrective\nmeasures, additional evidence should be studied and weighed. Any fundamental\ndisequilibrium should manifest itself, not only in a deficit in the balance of payments,\nbut also in monetary and banking statistics, price and production data, etc. Such\nseries, as well as the performance of the balance of payments, should be compared\nwith the experience of other countries, and especially of those of similar economic\nStructure, but subject to different domestic influences and policies. Only in this\nmanner can a proper diagnosis be arrived at, and an adequate policy determined.\n\nWhere clear evidence is lacking, empirical decisions are unavoidable. The deficit\ncountry would probably be given the benefit of the doubt, and allowed to pursue, for\na time, compensatory policies with the help of the Fund and, possibly, under the\nadditional protection of exchange control when needed. This interpretation would\nlater be confirmed by events if the deficit does in fact disappear within a normal period\nof time. It would have to be reversed, however, and corrective policies would have to\nbe applied, if the deficits continue, piling up the country's indebtedness to the Fund,\nor if the need for exchange control persists, with sustained and substantial premiums\non the auction and free exchange markets.\n\nJust as a mere balance of payments deficit is no evidence of a fundamental dis-\nequilibrium, the absence of such a deficit is no conclusive proof of a fundamental\nequilibrium in a country's international position. In the absence of compensatory\naction by the monetary authorities, a fundamental disequilibrium may fail to be\nreflected in any balance of payments deficit, owing to the prompt transmission of\nexternal deflationary pressures to domestic prices and incomes. One of the clearest\ncases, in recent years, of a fundamental disequilibrium due to currency overvaluation\nis the experience of Belgium following the devaluation of the British pound. And yet,\nboth the balance of trade and the balance of payments improved, rather than deteriora-\nted, during most of the overvaluation period. The average import surplus fell from\n4.3 billion francs a year in 1929-30 to o.8 billion in 1932-34, and the international\nreserves of the central bank rose from 12.3 billions on the eve of the British devaluation\n\n3 Article I (iv) states as one of the purposes of the Fund '' to shorten the duration and lessen the degree\nof disequilibrium in the international balances of payments of members.\"\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:22:47 UTC\nAI use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

It would indeed, be absurd to\nenforce general restrictions against all imports because of the unavailability of one,\nor a few, currencies only,! and the scarce currency clauses of the Fund Charter? accept,\nin such a case, an exception to the general principle of non-discrimination and\nmultilateralism.\n\nThe abuses and discriminations resulting from the blocking of some currencies\ncannot be blamed on the country subject to, and suffering from, the blocking.\nResponsibility for the maintenance of interconvertibility and multilateralism properly\nbelongs only to the International Monetary Fund and to the blocking countries\nthemselves.\n\nThe Fund will also want to guard against the permanency of exchange restrictions\nbeyond the period in which they are required by the balance of payments situation.\nThe system outlined above solves this difficulty without making necessary any further\naction by the Fund. Indeed, the control system is self-liquidating, since the auction\nand free market premiums would automatically decrease and vanish, as the exchange\nsituation improves. If such improvement does not take place within a reasonable\nperiod, the disequilibrium of the balance of payments should be recognised as funda-\nmental, rather than temporary, and corrective measures, rather than exchange control,\nshould be regarded as the proper remedy to adopt. The Fund might enforce this\nviewpoint by reviewing periodically, let us say once a year, the authorisation which\nit grants to resort to exchange control schemes.\n\nThe above proposals are not merely theoretical.

The Guatemalan law, especially, indicates, in greater\ndetail, the precise mechanism in which the suggestions made here can be embodied\nin a practical manner. Both legislations, however, express only the limitations to\nwhich these countries subjected their freedom of action on their own initiative. Further\nsafeguards might, of course, be desirable on an international plane, through the\nadministration of the Fund's own powers with respect to exchange control.\n\nB. FUNDAMENTAL READJUSTMENTS\n\nThe main emphasis of this paper has been on the inappropriateness of traditional\nreadjustment policies as a remedy for temporary or cyclical disequilibria. The opposite\ndanger, ie. the failure to adopt readjustment policies in the case of fundamental\ndisequilibria\u2014also faces the Fund, but has been so widely discussed already that a\nfew comments will suffice here.\n\nIn the case of a persisting disequilibrium in one country's economy, due to inflated\nprice or income levels, corrective measures should be applied. Neither the use of the\ncountry's reserves, nor borrowings from abroad, nor exchange control bring to bear\nany remedial influence on the disequilibrium.

It presents, on the other hand, the tremendous advantage of eliminating,\nor restricting considerably, the opportunity for favouritism or discrimination on the\npart of the exchange authorities.\n\nThe supervision of exchange control by the International Monetary Fund will not\nbe limited to the avoidance of discriminatory administration of the controls. The\nFund will also want to judge whether exchange control as such is justified in the\nconcrete circumstances under which a member country requests permission to implant\nit.. As the Fund gets under operation, it will have to develop certain general and\nobjective criteria for granting, or denying, such requests, in order to avoid arbitrary,\ndiscriminatory or merely haphazard decisions, which would soon breed ill-will among\nthe members and endanger their loyalty to the institution. The problem is most acute\nfor the smaller countries, whose vote in the Fund's councils will necessarily have\nlittle weight in reaching a decision. These countries should be guaranteed an impartial\ntreatment based on as objective rules and principles of policy as can be practically\ndevised by the Fund.\n\nOne of the first criteria to be taken into consideration would obviously be the\nlevel of international reserves of the country requesting the authorisation for the\nimplantation of exchange restrictions. The appraisal of the adequacy or inadequacy\nof these reserves, from the point of view of balance of payments needs, obviously\ncannot be gauged with reference to the traditional reserve ratios, relating gold and\nforeign exchange holdings to note circulation or sight obligations. What is here\nrelevant is the ability of the country to finance from its own reserves foreseeable\ndeficits in its international transactions. From this point of view, reserves should first\nbe expressed as a percentage of the normal requirements for payments abroad, i.e. of\ntotal annual sales of exchange by the banks. A reserve ratio of 30 per cent, for instance,\nwould mean that the central bank could maintain a free and stable exchange market\nfor one year in the face of a 30 per cent deficit in the balance of payments, or for two\nyears, in the case of a 15 per cent deficit. The level of reserves, calculated in this way,\nwould indicate the breathing spell which the monetary authorities will have, while\nwaiting for an automatic improvement in the balance of payments, in cases of tem-\nporary disequilibria, or for the readjusting effect of any corrective policy which they\nthink advisable to adopt when the deficit is deemed to be of a persistent or fundamental\nnature. If the length of such breathing spell is too short, the country might be given\nauthorisation for direct restrictions over exchange sales.\n\nWhether a 15, a 30 or a 50 per cent reserve is deemed sufficiently critical for the\nintroduction of exchange control would, of course, depend upon the previous balance\nof payments experience of the country in question. A country subject to sudden and\nviolent fluctuations in its export trade should be recognised a higher critical reserve\nlevel than a country with more stable sources of foreign exchange receipts. Maximum\nvariations in exports, or exchange receipts, in the past might serve as an objective\nindication in helping to determine the critical reserve level.\n\nA weaker, but still possibly valid, claim for measures of control might be made\nwhen gold and foreign exchange reserves experience a violent and sufficiently sustained\ndecline, even though they still remain, for the time being, above the critical level\nagreed upon between the Fund and the member country. The argument, in this case,\nwould be based, as in the Chapultepec discussions, upon the desirability of limiting\nthe expenditure of reserves for luxury imports, capital flight, etc. Milder controls\nwill suffice in this case, while stronger controls might prove unavoidable if the intro-\nduction of the controls must wait until the critical level has been reached.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:22:47 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Indeed, as long as currency inter-convertibility is maintained, the central\nbank would have no justifiable incentive to sell one currency in preference to another.!\n\nObjection is likely to be raised, however, to the differential rates implied in the\nfunctioning of the auction and free exchange markets. This might be interpreted as a\n** multiple currency \" practice, specifically outlawed by the Fund Articles of Agree-\nment.?\n\nIt should be noted, first of all, that provision is also made, in the Fund Agreement\nfor the approval of such practices by the Fund (VIII, 3). Indeed, the Fund's approval\nis necessary, not only for this case, but for the more general one of any system of\ncontrols on current transactions (except as applied to scarce currencies, or under the\ntransitional arrangements of Article XIV).\n\nMore than that, however, the exact meaning of the '' multiple currency \" stricture\nis open to question. First of all, the system here proposed does not constitute a multiple\ncurrency practice, if the term is interpreted to imply the setting up of different exchange\npremiums as between currencies. As pointed out above, no distinction is allowed as\nbetween currencies, but only as between different categories of transactions, irrespec-\ntive of the currencies involved.\n\nSecondly, the auction and free market premia are completely flexible, and do not\n\u2014as would rigid multiple rates\u2014introduce any effective restriction on exchange\ntransactions, independent from, and additional to, the basic and inevitable restriction\nresulting from the allocation of a limited quota of exchange among various claimants.\nSince the monetary authorities are forced, under the proposed system, to sel] fully\nthat quota for whatever rate the auction brings about, the rate itself does not constitute,\nin any way, an independent or additional restriction. Foreign exports to the country\nare limited only by the application of the quota, and in no way influenced by the fact\nthat the exchange rate diverges from normal. The only significant effect is a purely\ndomestic, and entirely desirable one, 7.e. the recapture by the monetary authorities\nof the unjustified windfall profits that would otherwise accrue to importers. It should\nbe kept in mind that any scarcity of exchange which reduces imports below the normal\ndemand at the official exchange rates, tends to drive up domestic prices, no matter the\nexchange rate charged to the importers to which exchange is allocated. In the absence\nof price control and rationing, the importers will be led to charge what the traffic will\nbear, or will distribute their short supplies in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\nWhile price control and rationing might reasonably be expected for essential goods of\nmass consumption, they will not, in most countries, be normally extended, and\neffectively enforced, to sales of luxuries and semi-luxuries. Under the auction system,\nthe importers would be forced to compete with one another for the exchange offered\nfor sale. Such competition would drive the rate to, but not beyond, the point at which\ntheir profits will again be close to competitive levels, under competitive pricing\nconditions. Special problems may, of course, arise in the case of collusion or mono-\npolistic practices by the sellers, but these would also arise under a system of adminis-\ntrative allocation, and can be taken care of, as far as is administratively and politically\nfeasible, without modifying the basic mechanism of control suggested above.\n\nIt might be observed, in passing, that any system of tariff duties is equivalent to\nvery real and rigid multiple currency practices. The very fact that objections to\ntariffs are so much milder than the objections to multiple exchange rates again suggests\nthat we often tend to fight words rather than realities. Looking at the problem without\ndogmatic preconceptions, it will be realised that the allocation of scarce exchange\nthrough a free auction system does not add any further restrictive element, beyond\n\n!

Such a procedure,\nhowever, is by no means inevitable. A promising alternative would be to enforce\nexchange restrictions through flexible, and impersonal, market forces, leaving the\nimporters free to buy whatever they please wherever they please (presumably from the\ncheapest source of supply), subject only to such automatic restrictions as would norm-\nally result from the free interplay of supply and demand. More concretely, what is\nhere suggested is that all the exchange currently available to the monetary authorities\nbe offered for sale in the following manner.\n\nExchange would be freely obtainable, without previous permit or restrictions of\nany sort, at the normal exchange rates, for payment of all essential and urgent imports\nor services and of contractual obligations, dividends or reasonable amortisation on\napproved foreign investments. The monetary authorities would undertake to sell the\nbalance of all their current exchange receipts for payment of deferrable or unessential\nimports and services, again without quantitative restrictions or imports permit, but\nthrough the functioning of one, or a few, auction markets. In other words, the limited\nsupply would be distributed among the buyers, not by administrative decision, but\nas a result of an impersonal pricing mechanism.\n\nIn order to provide the central bank with sufficient exchange to assure the\nfunctioning of these two markets\u2014the normal, and the auction, markets\u2014all exchange\nproceeds from exports or other easily controllable sources would have to be sold, at\nthe normal exchange rates, to the monetary authorities. On the other hand, exchange\nproceeds from unimportant or practically uncontrollable transactions, could be freely\nsold and bought in a free exchange market. This would avoid giving a premium to\nillegal evasion, where evasion cannot be effectively checked, and would, at the same\ntime, provide an escape valve for the control system. Capital exports, beyond those\nwhich have access to the official market, could be channelled here without harmful\nrepercussions on the rates applying to more essential exchange requirements. The\nhigher rates prevailing on the free market in times of crisis would, moreover, tend to\ndiscourage capital exports and encourage capital imports.\n\nThe advantages of such a plan are obvious. It would eliminate at the root\narbitrary and discriminatory allocation of exchange, drastically simplify the adminis-\ntrative machinery, red tape and delays, and bar most of the possibilities for graft or\nfavouritism in the distribution of exchange permits. From the international point of\nview, the main objection raised, quite properly, against the traditional forms of\nexchange control would also disappear. Nothing in the above system would tend to\ndestroy, or even weaken, a multilateral system of world trade. No distinction need be\nallowed between the various currencies bid for on any auction market and, on the\ncontrary, all auction premiums should be uniform, in percentage terms, for any one\ncategory of transactions, no matter what foreign currency is involved. The exact\ncurrency requested need not even be specified until the bidding is over and the exchange\n\n1 International acceptance of a '' previous representative period \" criterion as an objective guide for\nallocation might help to some extent, but would be of limited value. First of all, it could not serve as a\npattern for commodity allocation, since any rationing of scarce exchange should change the '' representa-\ntive\" pattern of imports in favour of more essential, and against less essential, imports. Secondly, the\n*' previous representative period \" criterion tends to freeze the channels of trade in a very arbitrary and\nuneconomic manner. The resulting distortion and unreality will be the more marked as one must go further\nand further back into the past to discover a '' representative \" period. Structural changes brought about\nby the war make it extremely difficult to accept as representative not only war-time, but even pre-war\npatterns.

The\ngeneral tenor of the Chapultepec discussions on the desirability of husbanding, for\nthe purpose of economic development, reserves acquired in war-time would lead to\nthe same conclusion.\n\nThe creation of the International Monetary Fund, therefore, should not be inter-\npreted as definitely removing, even after the expiration of a transitory period, all\njustification for, and possibility of, exchange control measures by member countries.\nThe Fund will greatly reduce the need for exchange control, and set up safeguards\nagainst unnecessary or discriminatory restrictions. It will not, and should not, prohibit\nblindly and flatly all uses of legitimate controls as an instrument of monetary policy,\nwhen temporary exchange shortages make them the only alternative to drastic defla-\ntionary policies or currency devaluation. As indicated above, price or currency\nadjustments may often be wholly inadequate to correct balance of payments deficits\n\u2014especially in the case of agricultural or raw material producing countries, faced with\nan inelastic demand for their exports\u2014except through the resulting contraction of\nnational income and effective import demand. Moreover, since only a fraction of total\nincome is spent abroad, the balancing of foreign transactions will normally call for a\ndecline in the income level several times greater than the deficit to be resorbed.? This\nis clearly undesirable on national grounds and does not, in any way, lessen the un-\nfavourable impact of import contraction on world trade. On the contrary, it aggravates\nthe difficulties of competing exporting countries. Finally, it corrects a temporary\ndisequilibrium at the cost of creating a fundamental one, in the other direction, once\nthe transient factors of disturbance have disappeared. Under such circumstances,\ntemporary and selective controls on expenditures abroad are preferable by far to\nindiscriminate, and multiple, income adjustments.\n\nThe efforts of the International Monetary Fund should thus be directed, not\ntoward the simple abolition of all exchange controls, but toward the elimination of\nthe abuses which have so often characterised them in the past.\n\nThe most patent and most crucial defect of exchange control lies in the discrimina-\ntory policies, or practices, to which it lends itself.

Gold coin does not, in practice, circulate to-day as\nmoney, and bank notes have become the ultimate legal tender for domestic payment.\nThe only purpose of a gold or foreign exchange reserve is to provide available resources\nto meet, without undue pressure on the currency, a deficit in the balance of payments.\nAll member countries should be induced to accept this viewpoint, and to liberate their\nreserves for effective use in case of need.\n\nThe second alternative is the recourse to foreign borrowings from other sources\nthan the Fund itself. This would be especially valuable to meet specific rehabilitation\nor developmental expenditures, the financing of which is outside the scope of the Fund,\nand can be secured through private investments or through the help of such institutions\nas the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and Export-Import\nBank, etc.\n\nThe third alternative is the husbanding of reserves for the most urgent needs,\nthrough some priority system of exchange distribution. The very name of '' exchange\ncontrol\" unfortunately suffices to raise such emotional reactions with many people\nas to prevent any serious discussion of the subject. The history of exchange control\nin the last two decades is such as to justify fully the condemnation of most exchange\ncontrol systems used in the past. It does not, however, justify a blind excommunication\nof exchange control as such, irrespective of its concrete forms and of the circumstances\nleading to their adoption. Exchange control was, in some cases, wilfully resorted to as\na weapon of economic blackmail and aggression. In other cases, however, it was only\na measure of despair, reluctantly accepted as a lesser evil under the pressure of\nnecessity. The statesmen who introduced exchange control in so many countries were\nnot all malevolent blackguards or stupid fools. Their motives should be understood,\nand every effort should be bent to prevent abuses, or unnecessary restrictions, without\nsacrificing the real purposes which non-discriminatory controls can justifiably serve.\nConstructive criticism may succeed where dogmatic and purely negative opposition\nhas failed, and would probably remain as sterile in the future as it has proved in the\npast.\n\nSelf-denial through exchange restrictions may be preferred, both by a member\ncountry and by the Fund, to excessive borrowings, internal deflation or exchange\ndepreciation. Provision is already made for some such cases in the Fund agreement\nitself. First of all, the Fund gives the members full freedom '' to exercise such controls\nas are necessary to regulate international capital movements \" not connected with\npayments for current transactions or settlement of commitments.? Members are even\nprohibited, in principle, from making net use of the Fund's resources '' to meet a large\nand sustained outflow of capital, and the Fund may request a member to exercise\ncontrols to prevent such use of the resources of the Fund. If, after receiving such a\nrequest, a member fails to exercise appropriate controls, the Fund may declare the\nmember ineligible to use the resources of the Fund.''?\n\nSecondly, the demands made upon the Fund for a member's currency may exceed\nthe Fund's ability to supply it. In that case, the Fund may ultimately be forced to\ndeclare such currency scarce and to ration its supply among the members applying\nfor it. Such a declaration '\" shall operate as an authorisation to any member, after\nconsultation with the Fund, temporarily to impose limitations on the freedom of\nexchange operations in the scarce currency.'4\n\n!'The '' war chest \" argument falls within the scope of this definition, although recent procedures of\nforeign funds controls weaken greatly the value of gold for purchases in enemy, or even neutral, countries.\n\n?

It is certain that the use of an analytic\ntool of such power will reveal possibilities of combinations and arrangements which\nhave either not been observed in the economic world, or the nature of which has been\ninsufficiently understood; and thus give deeper insight into the workings of real\nmarkets.\n\nOne other aspect of the ''indeterminateness \" of the solutions offered by this\nnew theory remains to be mentioned. In our introduction, we discussed problems like\nthe duopoly problem (page 2), in which no solution can be given by the traditional\ntheory which does not depend on the use of an arbitrary element. In the case of the\nduopoly problem the reaction function of one of the rivals must be specified if the\nproblem is to be solved. This specification may be relieved of '' arbitrariness \"' if the\nstudy of actual markets can lead to an analysis of the forces determining the nature\nof this reaction function. Thus, it may be that a consideration of the relative sizes,\nfinancial structures, and cost conditions of two firms will provide enough information\nto enable the economist to specify the reaction function of one of the rivals to moves\nof the other. The question then arises, whether, by incorporating these same '' facts \"\ninto a game-theoretical description of the market, or constructing with their aid a\nnew game based on the '' solution \" of the previous game which did not use them,\nanother '' solution \" can be reached which is free of indeterminacy. If this in fact can\nbe done, then it seems justifiable to conclude that this new method of analysis does not\nrepresent the revolution in economic theory which its authors (and Prof. Marschak)\nthink it does. Rather, we would then have an isomorphism between this theory and\nmore familiar analytical techniques, analagous to the isomorphism between analysis\nand geometry. It would make little sense to argue the virtues of analysis over geometry\nfor the solution of the problems of economic theory. If a solution can be found in one\nway, its isomorph can be found in the other. But, of course, for any particular problem,\nit may be better, that is speedier and more convenient, to use geometry rather than\nanalysis, or vice versa. Similarly, then, some problems of monopolistic markets which\ndo not readily yield to the ordinary tools of economic analysis, may fruitfully be dealt\nwith by the theory of games. This is, of course, a speculation ; the author hopes to\nbe able to treat the problem further at another time.\n\nWe may conclude, then, that the '* Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour \"\ndoes not seem to offer the promised revolution in economic theory. Nonetheless, it\noffers, along with its formidable mathematical apparatus, some new insights into\neconomics, and opens paths which will be well worth exploring.\n\nCambridge, Mass.

Whether this income-distribution will, in fact, be the most desirable\none, or whether other distributions are even more desirable, is a question that cannot\nbe answered without ''political postulates.\" I fully agree that it is impossible to\npursue a particular line of policy without bringing in politics. But I still think that\neconomics has much to gain, and nothing to lose, from a clear demarcation between\nthe two\u2014from showing, in other words, which aspect of a particular line of action is\ndependent on '' political postulates \" and which is not.\n\nAll this is independent of the criticism made by Mr. Scitovszky in an earlier\narticle of this REviEW!\u2014that in order to be certain that a particular measure will in\nfact (potentially) increase welfare, the simple test originally suggested by me was not\nsufficient. The test, in order to be fool-proof, must be a double one ; not only must the\nnew situation show itself superior to the old one, when looked at on the basis of the\nincome-distribution of the old situation, but the old situation must also be inferior to\nthe new one, when looked at on the basis of the income distribution of the new situation.\n\nLondon.

                    "66 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nand those in the quantity of exports. But, in general, the export-elasticity is well\nbelow unity.\n\nFor the countries in the agricultural and mining groups, the income-elasticity, in\nmost cases, tends to be over two. The differences among them broadly reflect the\nvarious stages of development of manufacturing industries in these countries and,\nhence, the relative composition of their imported manufactures.\n\nNow let us turn to discuss the size of the price-elasticity for different types of\ncountries. It seems that the difference in their magnitude as shown in the table is\nrandom ; and no generalisation can therefore be made on them. But, with the excep-\ntion of the case of Canada, all the elasticities tend to be less than unity. This, however,\nmay be explained by the fact that, as imports are generally the goods which cannot\nbe produced at home, their fluctuations would tend to be inelastic with respect to the\nfluctuations in the prices. Moreover, in most cases, the partial correlation between\nimport quantity and price is not high. This is partly due to the defect of using either\nwholesale or cost-of-living index to represent the prices of home-produced substitutes ;!\nand, more particularly, it is due to the fact that the cyclical fluctuations in the quantity\nof imports is predominantly determined by the changes in income.\n\nV\n\nThe elasticities given in Table IV concern the individual countries' demand for\nlola] imports. It has been found that they generally reflect the predominance of a\ncertain group of commodities in the total imports, which is in turn determined by the\neconomic set-up of the country in question. In this way, our calculations fail to reflect\nthe difference in a country's demand for different groups of commodities. If, for\ninstance, a country importing mainly foodstuffs tends to have a less elastic income-\ndemand for imports than a country importing mainly manufactured goods, do we also\nexpect that a single country's income-elasticity of demand for imported foodstuffs\nis smaller than that for manufactured goods ? Or, in other words, do '' horizontal \"'\ncomparison and '' vertical '\" comparison tend to give more or less the same conclusions ?\nOur expectation that this will be so is confirmed by the results of further calculations,\nwhich are given in Table V.\n\nThe American and the British data yield parallel results. The income-elasticity\nof demand for foodstuffs tends to be less than unity. This is in accordance with the\nfact that consumption expenditure on food, though closely related to income, change\nless than in proportion to income. For price-elasticity, the U.K. has a low value. This\nis natural because she is deficient in foodstuffs and is therefore bound to buy abroad.\nThe presence of home-produced substitutes will not have much influence upon the\nmagnitude on this price-elasticity, as their total quantity is small in relation to total\nhome consumption. The U.S.A., which is self-sufficient in staple foodstuffs, tends to\nimport some crude and manufactured foodstuffs which in general are not produced at\nhome. An examination of the trade statistics reveals that the main items in these\nbroad groups are tea, cocoa and drinks. Consequently, the American price-elasticity\nof demand for foodstuffs tends to be low too.\n\nBoth countries import raw materials which in general have no home-produced\nsubstitutes ; and, therefore, their demands are inelastic with respect to changes in\ntheir respective import prices. But, as expected, the raw materials show elastic\nchanges with respect to home income changes. Moreover, as the U.K. isdependent upon\n\n! Even if the substitution between imports and home-produced goods is regarded as a competition for\nthe purchasing power of the home consumer, the correlation coefficient may not be expected to be high,\nbecause such substitution is rather remote and insensitive.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:36:40 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON OF DEMAND FOR IMPORTS 65\n\ndifferent types of country, the results are in conformity with our a $riori expectation.\nFor the industrial countries as a group, the income-elasticity though greater than unity\ndoes not tend to be very high ; and, moreover, it is well below that for the agricultural\nand mining countries as a group. It is interesting to compare the income-elasticity\nfor the two groups with the income-elasticity calculated for the world as a whole. In\nour calculation, the world's income-elasticity of demand for imports is given as J4- 1.5,\nwhich means that the cyclical fluctuations in the quantity of total world imports\ntend, on the average, to be 1.5 times more violent than those in the world real income.\nThe value, 1.5, stands just between the averages for the two groups. This is equivalent\nto saying that, given a uniform economic expansion or contraction all over the world,\nthe quantity of imports of the industrial countries tends to fluctuate less than that of\nthe world average ; and, that of the agricultural and mining countries tends to fluctuate\nmore. This fact, however, can be easily explained. As the imports of the industrial\ncountries consist of smaller percentage of capital equipments and other manufactured\ngoods than total world imports, the former should remain more stable than the latter\nduring trade cycle; and, the converse is true for the case of agricultural and mining\ncountries. However, this comparison, ?n/er alia, points out another feature of cyclical\nmovements of world trade. It is the inherent tendency of the distribution of world\ntrade to shift during the trade cycle. It would seem that, as the quantity of total\nworld trade is rising during world prosperity, the total imports into agricultural and\nmining countries will be rising faster than those into the industrial countries ; and,\nthat, in times of world slump and recession, the former will be falling faster than the\nlatter. On a $riori grounds, we would expect opposite cyclical shifts on the side of\nexports of different types of country. These two facts taken together provide a very\nimportant clue to the cyclical pattern of change in the balance of payments of different\ntypes of country in the world.\n\nFurthermore, it seems that the difference in the size of the income-elasticity of\ndifferent countries in the same broad group also reflects the relative composition of\nthe imports of that particular country. We have to divide the industrial countries\ninto three sub-groups. So far as their respective compositions of imports are con-\ncerned, the highly industrialised and self-sufficient type of country tends to import\nmainly those raw materials which have no substitutes at home. The figure given in\nTable IV shows that the U.S.A., though having a very low marginal propensity to\nimport, still has an elastic demand for imports. The imports into the highly indus-\ntrialised and deficient type of country consist not only of raw materials, but also of\nfoodstuffs; and, consequently, the income-elasticity for them would tend to be\nrelatively low among the industrial group. This is confirmed by the cases of the U.K.\nand Germany. For the less industrialised type of country whose imports consist of a\nfairly high percentage of manufactured goods and capital equipments, the income-\nelasticity would necessarily be the highest of the group. Switzerland, Japan, France\nand Sweden support our argument. Moreover, some industrial co\u00fcntries are dependent\nupon imported raw materials for making domestic exports. Therefore, we find that, in\nthese cases, there is correlation between the fluctuations in the quantity of imports\n\nmade because it seems reasonable to use the index of a country to represent also the countries whose internal\neconomic activities are closely connected with it. For instance, we use British index to represent India and\nother British colonies; American index to represent Latin-American countries; Hungarian index to\nrepresent the south-eastern European countries, etc. The fourteen countries included and their respective\nweights are as follows: Australia 10; Canada 8; Denmark 5; France 15; Germany 20; Hungary 20;\nJapan ro; Netherlands 6; New Zealand 6; Norway 5; South Africa 5; Sweden 5; the U.K. 30 ; and\nthe U.S.A. 75. Estimates for Germany covering 1924 and for New Zealand covering 1924 and 1925 are\nextrapolated on the basis of the aggregate for other countries. Estimates for Australia and New Zealand\nare converted from a fiscal-year to an approximate calender-year basis by averaging successive pairs of\nfiscal-year figures.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:36:40 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON OF DEMAND FOR IMPORTS 63\n\nIV\n\nThe foregoing discussion reveals that the cyclical change in the quantity of imports\nof a country is determined by four elasticities : (r) the income-elasticity of demand\nfor imports; (2) the price-elasticity of demand for imports (with tariff corrected) ;\n(3) the price-elasticity of substitution of home-produced goods for imports; and\n(4) in some cases, the export-elasticity of demand for imports. We can use partial\ncorrelation analysis to get all these elasticities.\n\nFor the total imports of a country, the tariff changes may be corrected in the\nfollowing way. The Customs revenue is first reduced to an index number with the\nbase year similar to those of import quantity and price indices. This index is then\ndivided throughout by the quantity index of the same period. The resultant ratios\nrepresenting the tariff changes are added to the price index for the corresponding\nyears; therefore we get the import prices including tariff for a country. This pro-\ncedure is only an approximation ; but it is thought that it would be sufficient for our\npresent purpose.\n\nIn general, we use a wholesale price index or cost-of-living index to represent the\nprices of home-produced substitutes. Moreover, in order to simplify our statistical\ncalculations, we divide the corrected import price of a country by its home price to\nget relative prices; and, consequently, the elasticity means a relative-price-elasticity\nof demand for imports.\n\nLet log x, \u2014 quantity of imports ;\n\nlog x, \u2014 real income or home employment ;\n\nlog x4 \u2014 relative prices; and\n\nlog x, \u2014 quantity of exports.\nThen, the partial correlation equation, with the trend of all these series eliminated,\nis of the form :\n\nlog x; \u2014 b,sa4 log x, \u2014 Pisa log Xs -- Dicas log X4.\nHere, 545.54, \u20140453.94 and 5,454 give respectively the income-elasticity, the relative-price-\nelasticity and export-elasticity of demand for imports of a country. The square of\nthe multiple correlation coefficient will then give the percentage of the sample variance\nof the quantity of imports which can be explained by the variations of these three\nfactors.\n\nOne point should be borne in mind. Our estimates of elasticities are made by the\nusual regression analysis, which assumes the whole error-variation concentrated in\nthe dependent variable. Theoretically, the estimates are therefore not the best estimates\nof the true structural relationships existing in the data.? However, the error is prob-\nably not large; and the method is simpler.\n\nThe results of our calculations of the various elasticities of imports for different\ntypes of country are given in Table IV. Moreover, for the sake of comparison, the\nelasticities of demand for imports of the world as a whole (i.e. the sum of imports of\nall countries) are also calculated.\n\nThe countries chosen for each type are confined to the cases in which all the\nseries involved in our statistical calculations are available for the period under study ;\nbut, it is expected that, in general, they would form representative samples of their\nrespective types. Therefore, any generalisations based upon them would seem justified.\n\nWith regard to the magnitude of the income-elasticity of demand for imports of\n\n1'That is: Price Customs revenue\nuantit\n\n1 Cf.

The international com-\nparison of such crude values provides only imperfect guide to the understanding of\nthe cyclical behaviour of demand for imports of different types of country during a\nperiod of world-wide economic expansion or contraction.\n\nFirstly, this is because the marginal propensity to import calculated in terms of\nmoney, does not take into consideration the effect of cyclical change in the terms\nof trade. The difference in the magnitude of cyclical changes in the import and\nhome prices tends either to overestimate or to underestimate the marginal propensity\nof a country. For instance, for a country whose import prices relative to home prices\ntend to rise more in times of general world prosperity and to fall more during world\ndepression and recession, the marginal propensity to import is likely to be relatively\nover-estimated in the above calculation ; whereas, on the other hand, for a country\nwith the opposite pattern of cyclical change in the relative prices, it is likely to be\nunderestimated. Therefore, the import series and the income series should be deflated\nby their respective price indices. Or, in other words, we should study the relationship\nof their cyclical changes in real terms.\n\nMoreover, the magnitude of the change in real imports associated with a change\nin real income may be better judged by relating them to their respective absolute\nlevels in the initial period of equilibrium. When the proportionate changes of these\ntwo variables are correlated, we get the income-elasticity of demand for the imports\nof a country.\n\nSecondly, in addition to income, there are other factors which are equally important\nin determining the cyclical change of imports. The quantity of imports of a country\nchanges also with changes in price levels during the cyclical fluctuations ; or, in other\nwords, we have to calculate the price-elasticities of demand for imports. (r) There\nis the change in the level of import prices. However, the notion of import prices is\nnot a simple one. From the point of view of home consumers, the cost of buying\nimported commodities is not the price quoted by the foreign sellers, but the quoted\nprice, cif, plus import duties. Any change in tariff is equivalent to an increase or\na decrease of import price. Therefore, when we discuss the price-elasticity of demand\nfor imports, we have to correct the absolute level of import price by the change in\ntariff. (2) There are price substitutions of home-produced goods for imports. Any\nincrease in the prices of similar home-produced goods would generally induce an\nincrease in the quantity of imports; and conversely. Moreover, the substitution of\nhome-produced goods for imports can still be conceived to take place even if there are\nno close substitutes produced at home. In this case, the substitution is through the\ncompetition between imports and home-produced goods for the purchasing power of\nthe home consumer.\n\nFurthermore, some countries are dependent upon imported raw materials for\nmaking exports. Therefore, the change in the quantity of imports is also determined\nby the change in the quantity of exports. Accordingly, we have a further elasticity,\nie. the export-elasticity of demand for imports.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:36:40 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Therefore, comparing the industrial countries as a\nwhole with the agricultural countries as a whole, we find that the marginal propensity\nto import of the former tends to be lower than that of the latter.\n\nSecondly, with the exception of the U.S.A., the marginal propensities of the\nindustrial countries cluster along the value of 0.3. The U.S.A. stands by her own\nwith a marginal propensity to import well below o.r. This is no doubt due to her\nnatural self-sufficiency in foodstuffs and most of the important raw materials for her\nhome industries. In contrast, the marginal propensities of agricultural countries vary\ngreatly ; and the mean value for the group lies probably in the range from 0.45 to\n0.5; and the median is 0.475.\n\nLastly, within each group, there is also a regular distribution of the marginal\npropensities. Of the industrial group, the countries which are less industrialised than\nthe rest and consequently import relatively more investment goods, tend to have\nhigher marginal propensities.

The relationship between the value of total imports and that of total national\nincome depicts the result of historical development ; ^ whereas the relationship\nbetween the changes in imports and those in national income tells the cyclical\nbehaviour of demand for imports of a country during a short period of time.\n\nThe relationship between changes in imports and national income can be expressed\nin two ways. If we set out the change in imports that typically result from a unit\nchange in income, the relationship being measured is the marginal propensity to\nimport of a country. Whereas, if we correlate proportional changes in imports and in\nincome, we are measuring the income-elasticity of demand for imports.! In this section,\nwe shall attempt to make an international comparison of the marginal propensities\nto import.\n\nThe imports of a country can be divided into three broad groups: (1) goods\nmainly purchased by consumers for the purpose of immediate or '' deferred \" con-\nsumption; (2) goods mainly entering into the production of consumers' goods ; and\n(3) mainly producers' goods. The relationship between the change in national income\nand the change in expenditure on any one of these groups is obvious and direct. With\nregard to (ri) and (2), that the change in the consumption expenditure is related\npositively to the change in national income is an established fact; and, in an open\nsystem, a part of any increase in consumption expenditure is necessarily devoted to\nimported goods. Therefore, so far as these are concerned, the marginal propensity\nto import is the application of the marginal propensity to consume to the field of\ninternational trade.\n\nMoreover, the demand for imported producers' goods is directly determined by\nthe fluctuation of basic economic conditions at home, which are in turn reflected in\nthe changes of national income. Since this group of goods is generally investment\ngoods, the '' aggregate \" marginal propensity to import measure the changes in expen-\nditure not only on imported consumers' goods but also on imported investment goods.\n\nIn general, the change in national income does not equally affect the expenditures\non these groups of goods. For instance, with a given change in national income, the\nconsumption expenditure changes less than investment expenditure ; and, moreover,\namong the consumption expenditure, the demand for immediate consumption goods\nchanges less than that for '' deferred \"\" consumption goods.? Therefore, the magnitude\nof the marginal propensity to import of a country is, ?nter alia, very much dependent\nupon the relative composition of its imports, which is in turn determined by the type\nof economic set-up of that country. In accordance with the main characteristics of\nthe economic set-up, we may roughly divide the countries in the world into two groups :\nagricultural and industrial. The imports of the countries in the former group tend to\nhave a relatively higher proportion of investment goods and '' deferred \" consumption\ngoods; while in the case of the countries in the latter group, imports consist less of\nthese goods but more of goods for immediate consumption and raw materials for\nmaking consumption goods. Looking at this fact broadly, we would expect that the\nmarginal propensity to import of agricultural countries tends to be larger than that\nof industrial countries. The result of our statistical calculations is shown in Table IIT.\n\nIt must be noted that, in some cases, the period covered is rather short and the\nincome indices used are, in the strict sense, not very reliable ; and, therefore, the\nresults may fail to be precise. However, this defect will not invalidate our attempt\nto discuss the general relationship among the marginal propensities of different coun-\ntries in the world.\n\n1!

All the countries tend to lie along a straight line with a\npositive slope; and the correlation is fairly high. This is in conformity with our\nexpectation. The higher the degree of specialisation, the larger the value of the average\npropensity to import; and conversely. For the purpose of comparison, Diagram III\nis drawn by correlating the average propensities with the '' degree of specialisation in\nhome production \" (as given in Column 3 5\u00bb). The.result is broadly the same, but the\ncorrelation is much improved. This is due to the fact that the ratio of specialised\noutput to total output generally provides a better measurement of a country's degree\nof specialisation than the ratio of specialised exports to total exports. .\n\nAs compared with Diagram 1, the relative position of different countries in\nDiagram II has not materially changed. Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, Norway\nand Eire still stand in the right top corner, while China is still at the opposite end.\nMoreover, when the countries with the same degree of specialisation are compared,\nthose which have higher average propensities to import are generally the richer coun-\ntries, and conversely. This fact is complementary with that revealed in Diagram I.\nThere, the average propensities of the more specialised countries tend to be higher\nthan those of less specialised countries-with same real income Per carita.\n\nIn conclusion, the two fundamental factors, which deterniine the economic self-\nsufficiency of different countries in the world, are the level of real income fer cafita\nand the degree of specialisation of home production in exports.

This it is possible for 7 to vanish, even when the separate income-effects on\nthe separate commodities do not vanish ; this will happen if the change in prices is\nsuch that the sum of\n\nOx.

This seemed to suggest the presence of some factor or factors other than\nmigration in the results of column (4), and led us to consider further the question of\nan increase in distributive and allied industries and the factors likely to affect it.\n\nOn this subject P. Ford, in an article on *' Decentralisation and Changes in the\nNumber of Shops, rgor-1931;\" published in the. Economic Jowrnal of June, 1936,\ncame to the following conclusion : '' The rigidity of distributive costs in a period when\nmassive retailing was extending, for which ' excessive competition ' has been largely\nblamed, is thus seen to be partly due to decentralisation. Housing the population at\nlight,densities over wide areas increases the cost of services which reach to the home.\nWhether it be postal delivery, water, gas or electricity service, or refuse disposal, the\nmileage per home to be covered by personnel, capital equipment, or vehicle is greatly\nincreased. Retail distribution is no exception.\"\n\nIn order to estimate how far this factor of decentralisation has been influential in\nthe places in our sample, we have added, in column (5), the change in the number of\noccupied houses per r,000 of the population between 1921 and 1931, as given in the\nCensus Returns. From this it can be seen that decentralisation has probably not been\nan important factor in the declining areas, where new building has not been very\nextensive. Thus if, as Ford's calculations have shown, decentralisation is an important\nfactor contributing to the increase which has taken place in the distributive and allied\nindustries, then the absence of decentralisation to any great extent in the declining\nareas could well explain the discrepancy between the actual and the expected changes\nin these industries in these areas\u2014as shown in column (4).\n\nFrom this it would appear that any conclusions regarding the effects of emigration\non the distributive and allied industries must be based on the actual changes occurring\nin the numbers employed in these industries\u2014i.e. column (2). These, as has been\nalready noted, show that in only two cases out of ten did the numbers so employed\ndecline as much as or more than the population.\n\nTo sum up, while the results of these calculations have not been decisive, they do\nseem to justify the conclusion that migration will tend to leave the distributive and\nallied industries with excess capacity in the declining areas, while its effect on the\nexpanding areas will depend, among other things, on the extent to which it stimulates\ndecentralisation. If this conclusion is correct, it would appear that the usual arguments\nin favour of bringing industry to the workers rather than the workers to industry,?\nare strengthened by considering the effects of migration on the distributive trades.\nTo stimulate employment in these trades in the expanding areas while distributive\nagencies in the declining areas work below capacity leads to unnecessary duplication,\nwhich will tend to reinforce the already disproportionate trend towards an overgrown\n\"' tertiary \" sector.\n\nSanaH C. GILLESPIE.\nGlasgow. K. W. RorHsCHILD.\n! Ford further points out that decentralisation would not lead to an increase in shops like drapers and\nchina and glass dealers, where people go to central places.

These may well be\nthose goods which are created largely out of themselves, (4e. in whose production\nprocesses input and output mainly consist of the same commodities), as, for example;\nwhales or mathematical wranglers. The point of these examples is that the com-\nmodities with the lowest rate of expansion may be trivial goods.

It is expressly assumed that\nevery good is involved (either as input or as output) in every process. Hence it is not\npossible in the model to reduce below a certain proportion the part played in the economy\nby such goods as whales and wranglers, and eventually the expansion of the system\nmust be slowed down to their own pace. v. Neumann states that his assumption\nthat every good enters every process does not really matter because they may be\nsupposed to do so in very small quantities ; nevertheless the implications of this\nassumption need bearing in mind.\n\n(7) 1t should be noted that although in the model the equilibrium rate of interest\nis uniquely determined, the system of prices and outputs are not wniquely determined :\nthere may be any number of possible equilibrium positions. But each must satisfy\nthe rules set out in section 2 above.\n\nThe ease with which these rules could be established once the existence of an equi-\nlibrium position was known, was due to tlie choice of assumptions which enabled con-\nstant prices and stable relative outputs to exist together under competition. The whole\nprocess of mathematics would become greatly complicated if increasing returns c:\nmonopoly were introduced.\n\nIt will be noted, of course, that the '' equilibrium \" of v. Neumann's model i$\na very long run equilibrium ; it may take many decades or even centuries for the\nsystem to settle down to the rate of expansion of the least expandable goods ; and over\nthis period, the basic assumption of known technical possibilities remaining unchanged\nloses all reality. An important question, therefore, is how far v. Neumann's results\nare applicable to systems which are only in an approach to equilibrium ; and any\nrigorous examination of the properties of such a system would be bound to be most\ncomplicated.\n\nYet it is in the problems of the approach to equilibrium that economists are most\ninterested. How can a country acquire the equipment needed to achieve the best\nsystem of production ? What prices should be used in its accounting system bya\nplanning authority seeking to make the best use of its resources ?

Accordingly, non-interference in the spontaneous operation of the\ncapitalist economy is considered to be the best way of assuring the '' ideal\" use of\nresources. Most contemporary students of welfare economics consider this claim to be\nfalse and point out many conflicts between the private rationality of business enter-\nprises and social rationality as postulated by welfare economics. The private ration-\nality of business enterprises is also in conflict with the social objectives accepted by\nmost citizens of modern democratic society. This accounts for the increasing tendency\ntoward planning under contemporary capitalism and also for the socialist movements\npresent in most capitalist countries.\n\nA final observation has to be made about the procedure of verification of the\npostulate of rationality. There is some difference in procedure between firms, on the one\nhand, and households and public services on the other. Money profit is a quantity\nwhich can be observed empirically (like, for instance, velocity in physics). The\ntheoretical concept of money profit, therefore, can be easily identified with corres-\nponding empirical observations (the procedure of identification involves an inter-\npretation of book-keeping categories). Direct observation tells, then, whether firms\ndo or do not maximise money profit. Utility and public welfare, instead, are purely\ntheoretical constructs; there are no empirical observations which would serve as\ntheir counterparts (just like in the case of the concept of potential in physics). But\nthis does not preclude verification by indirect devices. The uniformities of decision\npatterns are different when utility or public welfare, respectively, are maximised than\nwhen they are not. This difference in the uniformities mentioned makes it possible\nto verify empirically the hypothesis of rationality of acts of households and of public\nservices.\n\nWashington, D.C. O.

This was a jealously guarded preserve of G\u00f3ring, who steadily\nrefused to allow any share of control to the Speer Ministry. At the end of February,\n1944, however, the Allied Air Forces succeeded, in a series of blows, in knocking out\n70 per cent of fighter assembly plants. As a result, the control of the fighter aircraft\nproduction was handed over to Speer. Extremely energetic rationalisation measures\nwere put in hand immediately : the number of models in production was severely cut,\ncomponents were standardised, and designs simplified (though not, according to the\nMinistry's claim, at the expense of performance) ; while the salvaged machine tools of\nthe destroyed plants were set up under canvas. As a result, the pre-raid level of pro-\nduction was exceeded by April and nearly doubled by July, with a no more than\nI5 per cent increase in the industry's labour force.?\n\nThe picture that emerges from a study of the years 1942-44 is that of an economy\nrapidly trying to build up its war effort to the stage of total mobilisation, but never\nattaining the stage at which the country's war potential would have been fully exploited.\nFrom September, 1944, onwards, the disorganisation caused by the air attacks on the\nrailway system, and the loss of territories in the West and East caused a decline in\nproduction, followed by a complete industrial collapse in the early months of 1945.\nAccording to the officials of the Speer Ministry, war production was still expanding\nrapidly when these factors supervened, and in their absence, the level of munitions\nproduction would have risen by another 20-30 per cent before capacity output, as\ndetermined by raw material supplies, would have been reached. The factors, therefore,\nwhich really limited German war production in the last three years of the war are to\nbe sought simply in those elements of inertia in the economic system which set a limit\nto the rate at which adjustment and expansion can proceed, rather than in any absolute\nshortage either of man-power, equipment, or raw materials. No doubt, with a better\nsystem of co-ordination, a greater readiness to sacrifice civilian standards and to\nmobilise labour, the process of expansion could have been speeded up further. But\nthe basic fault was the failure to plan for expansion and total mobilisation in the\nearlier years. It was due to a breakdown of strategy at the highest level, caused by\nthe virtual absence of any effective machinery for thorough and systematic discussion\nof requirements and potentialities.\n\nIt would be a mistake to conclude from this analysis that the German war economy\nprovides any evidence of the inefficiency of '' planned \" or '' controlled \" economies.\nIts failures were due to the absence of planning and co-ordinated control, and not to\nany abandonment of a /aisser faire system. But it will stand as a monument to the\ninefficiency of a system of personal dictatorship. Those of us who are fortunate enough\nto live in a free society will take comfort from the fact that even in the matter of\nefficiency of administrative control and co-ordination, the '\"' cumbrous \" methods of\ndemocratic government should prove so superior to systems based on the ruthless\nexercise of personal power.\n\nLondon. NicHOLAS KALDoR.\n\n1The saving of labour was accompanied by equally impressive savings in raw materials. Thus in the\ncase of weapons, the overall ratio between the required input weight and finished weight of steel was reduced\nfrom 4: 1 to 2 : t, between 1942 and 1944.\n\n3 No doubt this performance was greatly aided by the fact that the industry was previously highly\ninefficient, measured by any standard. This is evident also from a comparison of the labour force engaged on\naircraft production in Britain and Germany as shown in Table 9, if account is taken of the fact that the\nBritish production was considerably in excess of the German, as measured by numbers or structural weight ;\nand that the German figures, unlike the British, do not include all the workmen engaged on armament orders.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:52:27 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

At the same time, in doing so, such a housing policy would\nsecure the pre-condition for a Population Policy aiming at maintaining something like\nthe present size of the population.

The answer to this\nis that rent subsidies would, according to this scheme, only be given to the compar-\natively low income classes up to say \u00a36 per week. So far as old houses are concerned,\nrent restriction will prevent any benefit for the landlord for the time being and, it\nmay well be, for a long time to come.\n\nAs for new houses: only those builders should be given loans or mortgages at a\nreduced interest rate who are prepared to comply with the stipulations and control, of\nwhich rent control is one.\n\nIt is essential that the tenant should know the amount of the subsidy to which\nhe is entitled : for this reason tables for various incomes and family size could easily\nbe worked out and handed to the tenant which would immediately show the amount\nof the subsidy.

We may conclude, therefore, that the danger of retaliatory action by individual-\nistic export surplus countries is not in the field of commercial policy so much as in\nusing the weapon of foreign lending in order to cause diversions in the channels of\ntrade.

The offer of long-\nterm reciprocal purchase agreements, on the other hand, by its promise of economic\nstability, would increase the advantages to third countries of trading with the '' full\nemployment ' block. Unless and until satisfactory world-wide agreements can be\nconcluded which safeguard employment policy and potential export surplus countries\ncan be induced to renounce the right to \" tie\" foreign loans it would be suicidal for\npotential deficit countries to renounce the right to conclude reciprocal (bilateral)\nbulk-purchase agreements.

'' The fact that in\nthe real world the demand curve and the cost curve of individual firms are not inde-\npendent presents a very formidable problem to economic analysis.\" Indeed it seems\nobvious that hardly a firm in the '' real world \"' is without selling costs of some kind,\nand hence that there is hardly a firm whose demand curve is not functionally dependent\nupon its cost curve. How, then, can one explain the fact that in the world of economic\ntheorizing there exists hardly a firm for which the two curves are not treated as\nfunctionally independent ? How, above all, can this procedure be explained on the\npart of those who otherwise have seemed to accept a revision of economic theory in\nthe direction of monopolistic competition ; and finally, even among so many of those\nwho have contributed to the development of substantial portions of this field ? The\nproblem zs formidable, without any question, but this is surely not the reason. A good\npart of the explanation lies in the fundamental character of the change, and the over-\nwhelming psychological barriers to casting off established modes of thought which\nare so much a part of our theoretical tradition. The remainder lies, I believe, in con-\nscious avoidance: the interdependence in question is not admitted because it badly\nmesses up what is otherwise a more tractable theoretical model.

However, from the notes Rothbarth left behind the method of the inquiry\nis perfectly clear and judging from the results obtained further research in this direction\nis very much worth continuing.\n\nShortly before joining the Forces, Rothbarth was at work on an article on the\ninfluence of cost dispersion in an industry under conditions of imperfect competition\nupon the relative share of wages in the product of that industry. He shows that\non certain plausible assumptions this influence is likely to be small.\n\nEven when on active service Rothbarth continued to think and to write of\neconomic problems. He wrote in Holland a brilliant essay on the reasons for high\nproductivity in the U.S.A. as compared with Europe, which, I hope, will be published.\nIn the last letter I received from him he described an ingenious system of full employ-\nment in a developed economy based on assuring to everybody a minimum income.\nThis measure would both increase effective demand (if financed properly) and reduce\nthe supply of labour because people could afford to work shorter hours for their living.\n\nRothbarth planned to write sometime a book (or a few books) which would cover\nall the wide field of economics and politics in which he was interested. Such plans\nfrequently instil into people a strong instinct of self preservation. They stick to life\nin order to accomplish their life work\u2014or so they think..

He volunteered for the Forces as soon\nas it was possible to do so on equal terms (up to 1943 German refugees were accepted\nonly for the Pioneer Corps). He hardly spared himself too much when on active service.\nIn his last letter to me, after the description of the full employment system mentioned\nabove, there is the following passage : '' Since I last wrote to you we had a fairly grim\ntime. I came through it better than most.

It might, for instance,\nrestrain us from advocating, in a phase of the boom when the demands for commodities\nand for bonds are still antagonistic, a policy of money-creation which would be appro-\npriate enough-if we had reached the crisis phase at which they have been precipitated\ninto sympathy.\n\nCambridge. D. H. ROBERTSON.\n\n1. Since the discussion which Professor Robertson has reopened does in a sense\ngo back to Value and. Capital, I should like to be allowed to make some remarks on\nhis note, without (I hope) standing in the way of a reply by Professor Lange.\n\nMy own feeling, which I expressed at the time Professor Lange's paper appeared,\nis that although his terminology (of sympathetic and antagonistic shifts) is a useful\nway of describing certain sorts of economic phenomena, we should be careful to notice\nthat it does not in itself explain anything. It is a way of classifying the changes which\ncome into the economic system from outside\u2014the exogenous changes, as Professor\nHayek used to call them. The change from summer to winter is an exogenous change\nof this sort. It has no economic causes, but it has economic effects. It sets up changes\nin consumers' demands, increases the demands for beefsteaks and plum-puddings,\ndiminishes the demands for salads and ice-creams. It we like, we may say that with\nrespect to this change the demands for beefsteaks and plum-puddings are sympathetic,\nthe demands for salads and ices are sympathetic, while the demands for salads and\nbeefsteaks, or for ices and plum-puddings, are antagonistic.\n\nIt is, however, already apparent from this example that Professor Robertson has\nsomewhat underestimated the flexibility of the Lange terminology. Sympathy and\nanatagonism are always to be read with reference to some particular parameter (the\nparameter in my example being temperature, or some similar seasonal index). The\nnumber of parameters which we may introduce into our demand functions are legion ;\nthey may include absolutely anything on heaven or earth which has any relevance for\nhuman conduct. And there is no reason why two commodities which are sympathetic\nwith respect to one parameter, should also be sympathetic with respect to another.\nTo return to my example. Suppose that instead of taking temperature as our para-\nmeter (and therefore concentrating attention on rather short-period changes), we\nhad taken a longer view, averaging consumption over longer periods, and had investi-\ngated the changes in demand which might result from an increase in the average age\n\n1 See my Essays in Monetary Theory, p. 24.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 11:23:34 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

This shows that the decrease in the volume of consumption\nof about 17 per cent is mainly due to a decrease in the total supply of productive\nresources and to a lesser extent to the shifting over to the Government sector. The use\nof substitutes, the bad weather conditions for the harvests in 1940 and 1941, the lack\nof concentrated feeding-stuffs and fertilisers has lowered the productivity of consump-\ntion goods industries and agriculture. We have here a good illustration of the point\nmentioned earlier concerning the difference between Sweden and Great Britain, not\nonly in the magnitude of the war economic problem, but also with regard to the blockade\nand to the trend of Government expenditure. The space for the expansion of Govern-\nment expenditure has been provided for by a decrease in private investment from\n14 per cent to 1o per cent in 1942. The volume of private investment has been reduced\nto two-thirds of the pre-war level. In this connection it may be of interest to study\nthe amount of disinvestment. Part of consumption has been made possible through\nthe reduction of stocks. Estimated at pre-war prices, the reduction of stocks of food-\nstuffs and raw materials for food industries and agriculture comes to about Kr. 200\nmillions and of industrial raw materials to about Kr. roo millions. At the same time,\nhowever, there has been a big increase in stocks of fuel which are estimated at Kr. 200\nmillions. It would thus seem that there has been no substantial reduction in the total\ncapital of the country, held in the form of stocks of raw materials and finished goods.\nA correction of the total consumption figure (in 1939 about Kr. 7,700 millions) for\nchanges in stocks, is therefore hardly necessary.\n\nWith regard to fixed capital, any estimates are hazardous, partly because some of\nthe new investment, being temporary investments for the war period, should not be\nreckoned an addition to the fixed capital of the country. There are also great differences\nbetween different industries, but the Report which I have been quoting draws the\nconclusion that there has been no reduction in the fixed capital of industry, even if\ntemporary investment for special war purposes and for the production of substitutes\nis excluded.\n\nIn agriculture, however, there has been a substantial decrease in livestock, due to\nthe bad harvests and to the blockade. This has resulted in an increase in the liquid\nresources (deposits and cash) of the farmers. The value of this reduction has been\nestimated at about Kr. 180 millions. The stock of automobiles has been reduced,\nsteamers have been sunk (about Kr. roo millions over and above the value of new\nships built), etc., but in other fields there have been new investments, especially in new\npower stations (about Kr. 400 millions) and new houses (about Kr. 500 millions). On\nthe whole, there is reason to believe that there has been a net increase in the fixed\ncapital of the country.\n\nWith incomes growing, the problem of managing the price level becomes more\nand more difficult. There is a surplus of purchasing power which takes the form of\nsavings in bank accounts and an increase in cash reserves. This creates a tension\nbetween the potential demand for and the supply of consumption goods, which at\npresent, however, does not lead to an increase in prices because of a stringent control\nof prices, production and consumption. The control will probably be effective during\nthe war.: The stability of the price level since the autumn of 1942 shows the effective-\nness of the control and has had favourable reactions on expectations. But the danger\nof this latent purchasing power becoming a driving factor in the transition period after\nthe war is very great. We have here a very important motive for retaining control of\nproduction and consumption for a considerable transition period.\n\nStockholm.

The Group concentrated mainly on the case\nof oligopoly, where there are so few competitors in a market that no single firm can\nact without provoking reactions among the others, and where, consequently, from the\nuncertainty of human behaviour, it is impossible to predict the results of a change of\nprice: in terms of theory, each firm sees the demand curve for its products as kinked,\nand is afraid to move prices in either direction for fear of provoking a movement\nwhich might cause serious losses. Clearly, a similar situation might arise from other\ncauses of uncertainty\u2014e.g. political uncertainty, a particularly important point for\nthe building trade, or uncertainty about the way in which the general economic situation\nwill change\u2014in all trades where individual firms can affect the price level. In all such\ncases, there is a presumption in favour of sticking to what is commonly regarded as a\nfair price level to avoid provoking undesirable reactions, or simply to avoid the risk of\njumping the wrong way. The basis of the accepted price in such cases will always tend\nto be \"full cost \"\" or *' cost plus \"\u2014the extreme case arising, of course, at the stage of\nuncertainty where a rational basis for estimating money prices for any length of time\nahead ceases to exist, and the normal price becomes '' cost plus '\" pure and simple.\n\nSince ethics and self-interest lead in certain circumstances to the same conclusion,\nit is obviously likely to be extremely difficult to disentangle what, in any particular\ncase, are the actual motives. It is not directly relevant to this inquiry into rating\nproblems to know whether landlords acted from ethical or financial motives\u2014all that\nis relevant is to know that many of them did act on the full cost or cost-plus principle\u2014\nand I have not tried to disentangle their actual feelings. I can only point out that\nthere is $rima facie evidence that both ethical and self-interested motives were at\nwork. Certain public utility societies were building entirely from philanthropic motives.\nOrdinary landlords and builders, as a class, are presumably neither better nor worse\nthan other men, and they must in many cases have shared the public dislike of high\nhousing prices and the desire of so many employers for a just price rather than maxi-\nmisation of receipts. On the other hand, there was a period after the last war when\nthe housing market was extremely uncertain: there has always been the possibility\nof political reaction if rents were raised, particularly in an area like Birmingham where\ntenants' organisations have been strong: there may well have been elements of\noligopoly in the housing market, particularly in the market for selling new houses :\nand the behaviour of certain landlords and builders suggests that something more\nimmediately affecting their pockets.than morality must have existed to restrain\nsome of the others.\n\nClearly, though not relevant here, this question of the motives of landlords and\nbuilders is extremely relevant to a number of other important questions. As the\nsupply of houses increases to equilibrium levels, the principle on which landlords and\nbuilders fix prices will for a time determine the incidence of rates : and, again, the\nmotives of landlords and builders must very largely determine what is the right policy\nover such matters as rent control and self-government in the building trade. It would\nbe worth while to follow out these points when there is time and opportunity.\n\nOxford. M. P.

It has already become apparent that the most serious\nerror in the older conception of consumers' surplus (how far Marshall shared this\nerror I shall not presume to discuss) lay in treating it as an absolute magnitude, in\nmaking statements such as that a consumer, just because he is in such and such a\nposition, is getting so and so much consumer's surplus. The newer conception is quite\ndifferent from this. Consumers' surplus is relative, not absolute. We are always\nconsidering the movement from one defined situation to another defined situation ; we\nare asking what is the gain (or loss) of money income which would measure the gain\n(or loss) of economic welfare resulting from the movement. This gain or loss of income\nmust itself always refer to one or other of the two situations ; otherwise it is meaning-\nless. We have now seen that even in this restricted sense consumers' surplus is not an\nunambiguous magnitude; but we have now cleared up the ambiguities (so far as can\nbe seen at present) and they are not after all so very formidable. Consumers' surplus\nremains a usable instrument of analysis\u2014as usable as it ever was; and we ought now\nto be enabled to use it with more security and greater confidence.\n\nI hope, in yet another article, to employ my present technique to clear up the\nparallel ambiguities in the concept of producers' surplus.\n\nManchester.

In such a case, therefore, the assumption of a\nzero income elasticity of supply of entrepreneurship will be perfectly justified, and it\nwill be correct to ascribe to the entrepreneur the desire to maximise his profits. Only\nwhen he is more susceptible to the attractions of leisure than to those of his work\nand is consequently induced by a higher income to take life easier, will the entre-\npreneur's optimum behaviour be, not to maximise profits, but to keep his exertions\nand output below the point at which profits would be at a maximum.\n\nThe puritan psychology of valuing money for its own sake, and not for the enjoy-\nments and com\u00edorts it might yield, is that of the ideal entrepreneur as he was con-\nceived of in the early days of capitalism. The combination of frugality and industry,\nthe entrepreneurial virtues, is calculated to insure the independence of the entre-\npreneur's willingness to work from the level of his income. The classical economists,\ntherefore, were perfectly justified in assuming that the entrepreneur aims at maximising\nhis profits. They were concerned with a type of businessman whose psychology\nhappened to be such that for him maximising profits was identical with maximising\nsatisfaction.\n\nThe entrepreneur of to-day may have lost some of the frugality and industry of\nhis forefathers ; nevertheless, the assumption that he aims at maximising his profits\nis still quite likely to apply to him\u2014at least as a first approximation. lor this assump-\ntion is patently untrue only about people who regard work as plain drudgery: a\nnecessary evil, with which they have to put up in order to earn their living and the\ncom\u00edforts of life. The person who derives satisfaction from his work\u2014other than that\nyielded by the income he receives for it\u2014will to a large extent be governed by ambition,\na spirit of emulation and rivalry, pride in his work, and similar considerations, when\nhe plans his activity. We believe that the entrepreneur usually belongsto this\nlatter category.\n\nHowever, we set out, not to justify or criticise the assumption that entrepreneurs\naim at maximising profits, but to make its implications explicit. Many of us have\nbeen in the habit of regarding this assumption as similar in every respect to the assump-\ntion that the individual maximises his satisfaction. We have shown above that this\nis not so. For to say that the individual maximises his satisfaction is a perfectly\ngeneral statement. It says nothing about the individual's psychology or behaviour,\nis, therefore, devoid of empirical content, and is true by definition. As against this,\nthe assumption that the entrepreneur maximises his profits is based on observation\nand implies a special hypothesis concerning the businessman's psychology. It is,\ntherefore, an empirical law, which need not apply to every businessman, and may\nconceivably be untrue even about the representative entrepreneur. Its justification\nlies in its usefulness, which should be enhanced by a better understanding of its exact\nmeaning and limitations.\n\nStillwater, Oklahoma.

It is clear that the two levels of output\nneed not coincide. For we used one indifference curve to determine maximum profits,\nanother one for determining maximum satisfaction: and as long as we make no\nspecial assumption about the individual's psychology or behaviour, there is no definite\nrelationship between the shape or position of the various indifference curves in his\nindifference map. In order, therefore, that maximum profits should maximise his\nsatisfaction, the entrepreneur must have a special type of psychology, and, corres-\nponding to it, a special type of indifference map.\n\nThe geometrical nature of this condition will be immediately obvious to the\nreader. For the net income curve to be tangential to an indifference curve at the same\nlevel of output at which its slope equals that of indifference curve 7, the tangents to\nthe two indifference curves at that level of output must be parallel. In order that\nthis condition may be satisfied for any and every kind of net income curve, all\nindifference curves must have the same slope for each abscissa. In other words, the\nseveral indifference curves must be vertical displacements of each other.\n\nThe economic meaning of the above geometrical condition is that the entre-\npreneur's choice between more and less activity\u2014or between more income and more\nleisure\u2014must be independent of his income. This is equivalent to Marshall's familiar\nassumption of a constant marginal utility of money ; or, to use more up-to-date\nterminology, to a zero income elasticity of supply of entrepreneurship.\n\nAt first sight it may seem strange and unrealistic to attribute to the entrepreneur\na type of behaviour that would fulfil this condition. For, if his aim is to make money,\nit seems natural that the amount he is already making should affect the ardour and\nenergy with which he seeks to make more. But the assumption that the entrepreneur's\nwillingness to work is independent of his income need not imply that he is not interested\nin the material rewards of his work. It may also mean that he is so keen on making\nmoney that his ambition cannot be damped by a rising income. The latter inter-\npretation seems to be the more realistic one of the two. Businessmen regard the income\nthey earn as an index of their success and efficiency ; and their ambition of excelling\nin their profession manifests itself in the desire to make more money. We claim that a\nbusinessman's entrepreneurial activity will remain unaffected by a rise in his income\nif he makes money, not in order to have more to spend, but for its own sake, because\nit is an index and token of his success in life.\n\nThe man who aims at raising his standard of living tends to relax his efforts when\nthey meet with success. This is so, not only because material demands are satiable,\nbut also because leisure is an essential ingredient of a good life. He, however, who\nwants success for its own sake, and measures it in terms of money, is likely to keep\nworking unabated even after his income has risen. This is likely to be the case, partly\nbecause the desire for success is more insatiable than the demand for material goods,\nand partly because it is not a high but a rising income that is a sign of business success.!\n\nFor the supply of entrepreneurship to be independent of income it is not necessary\nthat the entrepreneur's psychology should be such that he save the total increment\nof a rise in his income. He may devote part or all of it to raising his standard of living,\nprovided that he regards this as no more than a by-product of his business success\nand its outward manifestation. As long as raising his standard of living does not become\n\n1 A high but constant level of income can be a sign of past business success.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:22:45 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

But for an indifference\ncurve to be tangential to the income curve at this point, it would have to be horizontal\nor even upward-sloping over\npart of its range. This is very\nunlikely and conflicts with our\ngeneral notions of the shape of\nindifference curves.\n\nWe must bear in mind,\nhowever, that what the entre-\npreneur is supposed to maxi-\nmise is not his total net income.\nHe is assumed to maximise the\ndifference between his total\nreceipts and total costs; and\ntotal costs are always assumed\nto comprise, not only the entre-\npreneur's outlays, but also the\nwages of routine management\nand supervision, which he is\nsupposed to pay to himself\nand include in his regular cost\ncalculations. In other words, the entrepreneur's income consists of two elements.\nThe wages of routine management, which form part of costs; and the profits of\nentrepreneurship proper, which are his residual income. Marshall called both elements\nprofits: the one normal, the other extraordinary, profits. For our purposes it will be\nmore convenient to refer to the former as the entrepreneur's wages, and to apply the\nterm profit only to his residual income. But irrespectively of terminology, it is always\nhis residual income only that the entrepreneur is supposed to maximise. That this\ndichotomy of the entrepreneur's income is always implied in the orthodox theory will\nbecome plain to the reader when he recalls the full equilibrium conditions of perfect\ncompetition: the equality of price with marginal and average costs. While the latter\ncondition eliminates the entrepreneur's residual income completely, he is still supposed\nto earn wages for supervision (normal profits) in this situation. These must conse-\nquently be included in costs ; and they are supposed to represent the entrepreneur's\nminimum (ie. marginal) income. Profits, therefore, the entrepreneur's residual\nincome, are of the nature of a rent.!\n\nIn our diagram (Fig. 2) we can separate the two elements of the entrepreneur's\nincome by drawing the indifference curve that goes through the point \u00ab. This indiffer-\nence curve represents the minimum satisfaction that will keep the entrepreneur in\nhis profession. If his satisfaction were to fall below this level he would cease being an\nentrepreneur and do something else. That part of his income, therefore, which brings\nthe entrepreneur to this level of satisfaction is his minimum income, the wage of\nroutine management.? Only the part of his income that brings his satisfaction above\nthe indifference curve I can be regarded as profit proper.

                    "A Note on Profit Maximisation\nand its Implications.\n\nThat the entrepreneur aims at maximising his profits is one of the most fundamental\nassumptions of economic theory. So much so that it has almost come to be regarded\nas equivalent to rational behaviour, and as an axiom, which is self-evident and needs\nno proof or justification. Doubts have been raised by several writers whether maximis-\ning his profits is always the entrepreneur's best policy.! But such doubts were few\nand have died away without reverberation ; mainly, I think, because it has never\nbeen made clear what exactly profit maximisation implies ; and perhaps also because\nwe have a vested interest in maintaining this assumption\u2014it makes economic analysis\nso much simpler. In the following we set out to show that by attributing to the entre-\npreneur the desire to maximise his profits we also attribute to him a particular\npsychology, which, though very plausible, is rather special.\n\nLet us draw the entre-\nm preneur's indifference map\nbetween money income, ;,\nand entrepreneurial inactivity,\ni? (Fig. 1)?. Entrepreneurial\nactivity is the negative of 7\nP and is measured from right to\nleft along the horizontal axis.\nAssume next that entrepre-\nneurial activity is a limita-\ntional factor in the manu-\nfacture of the entrepreneur's\nproduce and can, therefore, be\nmeasured in terms of output.*\nPoint c represents zero output\nor total entrepreneurial in-\nactivity.\n\no E T\u201474 Since the unit of measure-\n\nFig. r. ment along the horizontal\n\naxis is the unit of output,\n\nwe can draw the entrepreneur's total receipts curve and total outlays curve in this\ndiagram. The vertical difference of the two curves shows, for each level of output, the\nentrepreneur's total net income from operating his firm. Taking these differences as\nordinates we can draw the entrepreneur's net income curve (Fig. 2). The point at\nwhich the net income curve is tangential to an indifference curve is the entrepreneur's\npoint of maximum satisfaction and determines his optimum rate of output. This\noptimum rate of output may or may not maximise his profits; and our problem is to\n1 Cf. J. R.

It is not however\nunique since it depends on the definition of direct and indirect taxes. I shall not pursue this\nmatter here.\n\nAPPENDIX VII.\n\nThe quarterly data given in the tables of Appendix I above are stated to be at seasonally\nadjusted annual rates. In calculating the quarterly changes in certain ratios and, in particular, the\nratio of private savings to private disposable income, it became apparent that the method of\nseasonal adjustment used was of a kind which did not fully allow for the trend of the series. As\na result the savings ratios took the form of a saw edge rising throughout each calendar year and\ndropping abruptly between the fourth and first quarters. In order to calculate smooth series for\nthe diagrams it seemed desirable to remove this residual seasonality.\n\nSince these residual seasonalities may be useful to other workers in this field, I set them out\nbelow. They were obtained by the median link relative method from the data for the quarters of\n1939, 1940, 1941 and the first quarter of 1942.\n\nResidual seasonality.\n\nI II Il IV\nY 1.013 1.003 0.992 9.993\nc I.021 1.002 0.991 0.986\nT 1.017 I.O0I 0.999 0.983\nS 0.908 0.957 I.031 I.105\nL 1.019 0.997 0.992 0.993\n\nAPPENDIX VIII.\n\nThe phrases ''tax liabilities \" and \"tax accruals\" perhaps need some explanation. Tax\nliabilities may be understood in two senses. The first '' estimated tax liabilities \" in the case of,\nsay, income tax means the liability at current tax rates which will finally have to be met in respect\nof the possession of current income. This will be different from current payments in so far as\n(a) these payments are in respect of assessments based on a higher or lower past income, (b) the\nfluctuations in payments throughout the year do not correspond to the fluctuations in income,\nand (c) the rate of tax at which current payments are being made is different from the current\nrate of tax. This is the most useful sense I think in which the term is used.\n\nThis concept must be distinguished from final or true tax liabilities which makes allowance\nfor the fact that tax in respect of the income of a given period may finally be levied at a rate\ndifferent frcm that current in the period.\n\nSimilarly there are two forms of tax accruals which are respectively the excess of the first\nor the second kind of tax liabilities over tax payments in a given period.\n\nIna tax system in which both the period of collection and the lag in assessment are one year,\ntrue tax accruals summed over the whole of the past through this year will be equal to this year's\ntax liabilities. This is obvious, since if true tax liabilities, row (1) say, are to date a, b, c, d, e then\ntax payments row (2)say, are o, a, b, c, d and the sum of the differences (1) \u2014 (2) is identically\nequal to e. The amount c would eventually flow into the tax authority even if no tax were levied\nin respect of income earned after the current period.\n\n1\u00e1 Vol.9/10\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:24:12 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

These proportions were moreover independent of\nthe level of income.\n\nThe concept of private disposable income (Y) differs from the net national income at factor\ncost in that it excludes miscellaneous income from public property and includes transfer payments.\nStrictly therefore the proportions just given do not relate to marginal factor shares. They may\nhowever be taken as fairly close approximations of these since in the figures taken from the\nDepartment of Commerce, miscellaneous income from public property is zero throughout the\nperiod while transfer payments vary hardly at all apart from a slight upward trend. It is of\ninterest therefore to note that there is no evidence that the shares of R, P and L are constant at\ndifferent levels of income as is shown by the fact that the constants c4, c3, and c$, are not near\nto zero.

This procedure does not count as part of the burden taxes\non goods bought by the government or payable on government income from property. This\nomission can be seen to be reasonable from the fact that such taxes are equivalent only to inter-\ngovernmental transfers which could be struck out from both sides of the consolidated account of\npublic authorities. Put another way, if the government only raises from the private sector enough\nmoney to pay the cost of the factors employed in providing the goods and services it buys, then\nthe indirect taxes in the market value of these goods and services are self-financing.\n\nThe correctness of this result can be seen from an example! from which, on the simplified\nassumptions employed, can also be deduced the appropriate income concept if it be desired to\ntreat the total revenue as the numerator of the proportion of private incomes going in taxes.\n\nConsider a simple economy in which the only forms of expenditure are consumption and the\npurchase of goods by the government. Further suppose the whole of government purchases to be\nfinanced out of indirect taxes.

Second, other factors, of which the distribution of income may be an example though\nlittle is known on this point, clearly affect the relation of C to Y but may be supposed normally\nto be highly correlated with Y apart from a trend factor. If the distribution of incomes had not\nbeen highly correlated with income over the period 1929-41 then either its independent variation\nmust be unimportant, which on general grounds is unlikely, or its variation must have been small\nso that it can be subsumed in the trend factor. For if neither of these facts were the case over the\nperiod it would have been impossible to express C in terms of Y and / with a high degree of\naccuracy.\n\nIt Dan be seen therefore that in so far as previously existing correlations of this kind are\nbroken down in the future it may turn out that the partial differential of C with respect to Y is\ndifferent from the value given by the equation since to some extent this may really be the differen-\ntial of C with respect to Y and the distribution of income, the relation between the last pair of\nvariables having been stable over the period of observation.,\n\nReturning to the question of independent variables other than Y and / which may be\nsupposed to influence C, it may well be that the equation of normal relationship is slightly affected\nnumerically by the inclusion of the latter part of 1941, since at this time the progress of the war\nmay have introduced new factors.\n\n(3) I have chosen to study the relationship between certain variables because they enable\ncertain relations to be seen simply and are adequate for my particular purposes.

This is obviously not an ideal assumption though it may give\nreasonable results over a fairly wide range of values of Y. A disadvantage of this assumption is,\nfor example, that the estimated value of C will reach a maximum as Y increases, though in fact\nthis is most unlikely to happen. This maximum will be reached at the point where\n\nDu\n2bis\n\u2014 \u2014 174(appr.)\nFurther, the calculated value of T reaches a minimum at the point where\n\nY-2-\u2014\n\n2b,\n\u2014 \u2014 So(app) | .. .\n\nThis is clearly unsatisfactory since it is not to be expected that tax payments in fact rise\nwith every fall in Y below 5o. Thus, while the simple equations used are adequate for a general\ndescription of the data it must be borne in mind that their form is not ideal.\n\n(2) The coefficients in the equations were obtained so as to give the best fit in a least squares\nsense to the data over the period 1929-41. Since the fit obtained is very good, it is to be presumed\nthat other factors which might be supposed to affect C, T or S were either highly correlated with\nY over the period or remained constant or changed slowly so that their variation could be sub-\nsumed in the trend factor. This raises two questions.

Il assumed that they were\nall specific, realising that this was probably not the case but thinking that anyhow the equations\nwould not be greatly affected whatever plausible assumption was made. Information which has\nmore recently become available? enables a better estimate to be made for recent years. It is\nstated that in order to deduct what I have called general indirect taxes from war expenditures the\nprocedure was to allocate all indirect taxes other than those specifically on consumption to war\nexpenditures in the ratio of these expenditures to national product. It is not stated how national\nproduct is defined in this context but it is to be presumed that it is after deduction of specific\nindirect taxes since otherwise consumption would bear an undue share of general indirect taxes.\nIf therefore we write :\n\nI; - specific indirect taxes on consumption\nIg - general indirect taxes\nI | \u2014 I;-- Ig \u2014 total indirect taxes\nP - national product\nW - war expenditures\n4 -\u2014 general indirect taxes falling on war expenditures\nthen\na \u2014l Wo\n*(P\u2014 n)\n\u2014 gl,\nand therefore\na(P \u2014 I)\nI \u2014\u2014wy\u2014.a\nFor 1941 in milliards of dollars\n\u00e1 \u2014 04\nP -\u2014 119.5\nI - 104\nW \u2014 i2\nSo that\nI -\u2014 73\nand\nIl \u2014 34\n\nFor 1939 and 1940 Ig was 6.2 and 6.8 while I, was 1.9 and 2.2 respectively.\n\nMy assumption was evidently not a good one. But in peace time this was not of great import-\nance since the greater part of I; had also to come off consumption.\n\nLet us now return to the two methods.

Sum of items 40 and 41.\n\nAPPENDIX II.\n\nIn the S.C.B. for august, 1942! an attempt is made to allocate indirect taxes, other than those\nspecifically on consumption goods, to the components of the national product. Since for my\npurposes it is necessary to make this allocation on the same basis in each country, I shall set out\nwhat seem to me to be the admissible solutions to this problem.?\n\nIt is convenient to distinguish between specific indirect taxes which are levied on a single\ncommodity, such as the tobacco duty, and general indirect taxes which fall, possibly in varying\ndegrees, on the whole of output. Examples of this class are, on the definitions employed in this\npaper; employers' contributions to social insurance, compulsory premiums paid under war risks\ninsurance schemes and local rates.\n\nAlthough not perfectly general, it is unlikely that any of these taxes have a very marked\neffect on relative prices and for this reason it might be convenient to regard them as direct taxes\npaid out of income rather than as indirect taxes to be deducted from the sales proceeds of output.*\n1f this treatment were adopted there would clearly be no problem of allocation since only specific\nindirect taxes would be left to be deducted from expenditure.\n\nLet us suppose however that we decide not to do this and so require to know the principles on\nwhich the allocation should be made. There are two quite distinct concepts which we may wish\nto measure. First, we may wish to determine the proportion of current factors of production used\nin producing investment goods (whether or not these be for the replacement of assets currently\nused up) and the remaining proportion of current factors used together with capital equipment in\nindustries producing consumption and government goods and services. Second, we may be\ninterested in the proportion of current factors used to produce additions to the stock of capital\non the one hand and to produce other goods and services including all capital goods necessary for\nreplacement purposes on the other.\n\nIf it is the first alternative that we are interested in then it is necessary first to distribute\ndepreciation allowances, etc., between gross investment and the remaining part of the gross\nnational expenditure at market prices less specific indirect taxes (assumed to fall only on con-\nsumption) and then to allocate general indirect taxes over these two parts of output. If we are\ninterested in the second, then we must simply allocate general indirect taxes between net invest-\nment and the remainder of the net national expenditure at market prices less specific indirect\ntaxes (assumed to fall only on consumption).\n\nThis distinction may be made clearer by an example. In it I shall assume, for want of\ninformation, that where any allocation is to be done in the case either of depreciation allowances or\nof general indirect taxes it may be done fro rata.\n\nE\n\n1 p. 15 statistical note to table I.\n\n1T am indebted to Mr. J. M. Fleming who, I think, was the first to see the correct line of\napproach here and to Mr. Meade for discussions on these questions.\n\n3 For a further discussion of the implications of this treatment in the case of social security\ncontributions, see pp. 2 and 3 above.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:24:12 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The definition depends\nmaterially on the assumption that each of the anticipated-receipts functions\nof the several entrepreneurs remains wnchanged throughout the period between\nthe initial and final factor price regimes.\n\nThe combinatorial laws developed in section 5 apply to al] types of index\nnumbers. Combined individual and joint anticipated-profits production-cost\nindices are calculated in keeping with formulae (5.2) and (5.3). Adhering to\nthe convention of denoting anticipated-profits production-cost indices by I, we\ncan make these formulae apply formally to the indices of the present section by\nintroducing bars over all /'s occurring in them.\n\nThe entrepreneur, avid for profits though he is, usually prefers safe\nmoderate short term gains to risky large long term ones. He feels there is a\nbottom to commodity prices and that he can generally command a minimum\nsum for given physical quantities of products ; whereas anticipated net profits,\ndepending as they do on future supply and demand, are highly uncertain. He is,\ntherefore, persuaded that his Jong term profits will be greater if at each turn he\nminimises the production cost of fixed physical quantities of products than if,\ntrusting to hypothetical estimates of the future, he minimises the cost of produc-\ning stated levels of (short term) anticipated net profits. Most people will agree\nthat this is a reasonable attitude to take. Accordingly, an entrepreneur's\nactivities are more likely to conform to section 4 than to the theory of the\npresent section. As a result, physical production-cost indices are likely to prove\nmore realistic and important than anticipated-profits production-cost indices.\n\n7.

R.R. as every female spends five years in the age group. It is\nseen that the 1938 G.R.R. is 0.905 against the figure of 0.897 given by the\nRegistrar-General, and the N.R.R. is 0.816 against the official figure of 0.805.\nThe discrepancy is due to the fact that the Registrar-General proceeds from a\nslightly different age distribution, and also that his life table shows a slightly\nheavier mortality than ours. However, the differences are not very large, and\nas our figures are only very rough estimates, they will serve. We note that the\nN.R.R. remained practically unchanged in 1939, but fell by about 5 per cent\nbetween 1939 and 1941. If the high level of births, which was shown in the\nfirst quarter of 1942 continues, the N.R.R. for that year will be higher than in\n1938, but there is no reason why births should continue at that level, and we\nwould do well to wait for further figures before assuming that fertility is\nstabilised.\n\nHowever, the net reproduction rates alone do not tell the whole story.\nThe war has brought an appreciable increase in marriages, and we should\nordinarily have expected an increase in the net reproduction rates, for the\nRegistrar-General's figures show that the average interval between marriage\nand first birth is less than two years for younger women. The fact that fertility\nhas actually decreased in r94r in spite of increased nuptiality, shows that\nnuptial fertility must have decreased rather more than is shown by the net\nreproduction rate. The high number of births in the first quarter of 1942 may\nsimply be a reflection of previous high nuptiality, and if this hypothesis is true\nthe reproduction rate may be expected to decrease heavily in the near future.\n\nWe therefore see that fertility has not so far shown any sign of remaining\nstable during the war. If the war lasts much longer, the number of ' unborn\ncasualties '\"\" will become larger and will have an important effect on the post-\nwar development of population. The optimism of the Registrar-General and\nof those associated with him seems to be unfounded. One cannot escape the\nconclusion that a decline in the population of this country is imminent, and\nthat it may assume disturbing proportions unless action is taken very soon.\n\nThe problem of formulating a population policy is beyond the scope of this\npaper. It is nevertheless clear that such a policy will have to be very compre-\nhensive, and involve extensive changes. Such changes will necessarily involve\ntreading on many people's toes, and one cannot help suspecting that the\ngovernment's reluctance to face the problems involved may be due to this\nfact. Nevertheless the present ostrich-like position in which people who refuse\nto face the facts find themselves, can only have disastrous consequences.\n\nLondon. E.

That is, they will lead to welfare expenditure, the\namount of which will be determined by the usual standard of profit maximisa-\ntion, though the forces involved are far too complex to allow any accurate\napproximation to that standard. Into this category falls the improvement of\nconditions with the aim of increasing the efficiency of labour (while wages\nremain unchanged or rise proportionately less than efficiency). Then, welfare\nexpenditure might be incurred as part of the selling expenditure of a firm.\nGood working conditions will help to increase sales to a socially interested body\nof consumers.! Finally, as we have shown, buying expenditure can take the\nform of welfare improvements.\n\nThese factors are summarised in the following list :\nA. Institutional Factors.\n\ni. Pressure from Trade Unions and other bodies.\n2. Benevolent motives on the side of employers.\nB. Economic Factors.\n\nI. Increase in the efficiency of labour.\n\n2. Selling expenditure.\n\n3. Buying expenditure.\n\nThis classification seems to me to have some practical bearing on welfare\npolicy in war-time. For three of the five factors listed above have lost much\nof their power under present conditions. With the prohibition of strikes,\nessential work orders and conscription of labour, the strategic position of\ntrade unions has been somewhat weakened. With increased purchasing power,\nlimited supplies and controlled prices, the factor '' selling expenditure \"' loses\nmost of its importance. And '' buying costs \"' are also less important in times\nwhen a large proportion of the labour supply is centrally controlled and cannot\nbe engaged in the usual ways.\n\nThus we see that some of the forces which induce welfare expenditure are\nnow '' out of order.\" There is therefore a strong case in favour of a legal\nimposition of welfare standards in order to secure satisfactory conditions of\nwork for the many thousands who are now in the war industries. This has\nalready been partly recognised by the Ministry of Labour which demands a\ncertain minimum amount of welfare conditions from every establishment that\nis scheduled under the Essential Works Order. But it seems the above points\nshow the necessity of introducing further minimum welfare standards for all\nindustrial establishments for the duration of the war, and a strict supervision\nof conditions by factory inspectors who might work in co-operation with shop\nStewards, trade unions and the new joint production committees.

For these are more suitable\nfor affording protection in the above defined sense; while those would have\nbeen more natural and more efficient had the monopolistic exploitation of\nforeigners been the primary aim.! In more recent times, changing the terms of\ntrade and creating employment were probably more important considerations\nwith public opinion and legislative bodies in determining tariff policy.\n\nVIII\n\nWe have tried to show in the foregoing that to impose tariffs on inter-\nnational trade is generally in the rational interest of single countries for more\nthan one reason. This does not conflict with the fact that free trade is the best\npolicy for the universe as a whole. For just as each entrepreneur's competitive\nbehaviour diminishes the profits of all entrepreneurs, so each single country's\neffort to increase its national welfare tends to diminish the welfare of all.\n\nFree trade leads to the best allocation (most efficient utilisation) of the\nworld's resources, provided that full employment is somehow ensured. It leads\nto a distribution of welfare among nations that, if ethically neutral, is at least\nbased on historically and geographically determined inequalities and not on\ninequalities of political and military power. Any corrections of this distribution\nthat may be considered necessary or just, are better made openly (preferably in\nkind), in the form of payments of tribute or assistance, than surreptitiously,\nunder the cloak of tariffs or barter agreements. That is a better guarantee of\neconomic efficiency and justice.\n\nBut it is not enough to declare the desirability of free trade and trust that\nenlightenment will bring it about: nor is it enough to create initial conditions\nfavourable to it: it must be imposed and enforced. Whether this should be\ndone with the aid of the more effective sanctions of a new League of Nations,\nor through the political prestige of a British Empire, or in any other way, is\nbeyond the economist's competence to decide. We can only tell that some form\nof compulsion is necessary to ensure free trade. The truth of this statement is\nattested by the past history of international trade as much as by our rationalisa-\ntion of it. Both show that independent states, in possession of their full\nsovereignty, will keep on erecting and raising tariffs in order to increase their\nshare of the world's resources, to achieve fuller employment, and to protect\ntheir growing industries. Of these three aims only the last is likely to be\nrealised ; the second will generally defeat itself as tariffs are erected all round ;\nwhereas the first will not only defeat itself but every country will actually be\nimpoverished as they all raise their tariffs. It is to guard against this general\nimpoverishment that free trade must be enforced and each country kept from\nseeking more than its share of the world's resources. Employment can be\nmaintained and infant industries subsidised by other means than protection.\nThis, from a single country's point of view, is probably the cheapest way of\nachieving those aims ; but it is against the general interest to let one country\ndo what would be detrimental to all if generally practised.\n\n1 This is in apparent contradiction with footnote ?, p. 95. But Mr. Lerner's demonstration\nthat the effects of import and export duties are identical in all respects only holds good of duties\nthat are levied at a uniform rate on all commodities.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:28:33 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "108 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nwould be an argument in favour of free trade. If however we recognise, as I\nthink we should, that specialisation among countries is to a large extent a\nmatter of historical accident, we would have to draw a different conclusion.\n\nSince the progress of our material welfare depends mainly on technical\nadvance, our civilisation offers the greatest rewards to industrial skill and\ntechnical ingenuity, and the nations specialising in these fields will inevitably\nlead, and agricultural nations lag behind. Hence, the best long-run policy a\nnation can pursue is to create an atmosphere favourable to industry and\ntechnical progress. But, it may be asked, if industry is more profitable than\nagriculture, why does it need special stimulus ? The answer to that question\ncan best be put in the language of external economies. The produce of industry\nconsists of goods and services sold for money, and of benefits for whose use no\ncharge can be made by their very nature, but which nevertheless contribute to\nthe social product. These benefits are called external economies from the\npoint of view of those benefited : they consist in the training of workers, the\ncreation of a labour market and of markets for bye-products, the stimulus\ngiven to transport facilities, the arousing of interest in science and engineering,\nand the like. In an industrial community, a new firm or industry will not only\ncontribute to, but also benefit by, the external economies already in existence.\nThe free benefits he makes use of repay, so to speak, the entrepreneur for\nhis free contribution to the community's welfare. No free benefits com-\npensate the first firm or industry to be established in an agricultural community\nfor the advantages it confers on the firms and industries to follow. Yet, those\nadvantages may be very important and valuable from society's point of view,\nand should be accounted for when calculating the firm's or industry's marginal\nproductivity. A firm's or industry's economic right to live, therefore, should\nbe based not on its private but its social marginal productivity, which takes\naccount of intangible factors! and products. In an industrial community these\ntwo are likely to cancel each other out, making private and social marginal\nproductivity approximately equal. In an agricultural economy the difficulties\nof beginning may make an industrial firm's private marginal productivity\nsignificantly lower than its social marginal productivity ; and to make up for\nthe difference, protection or the payment of subsidies is economically justified.\n\nThis is, I think, what writers like Carey, List, and Sch\u00fcller really meant.\nThe above argument shows that to extend public assistance to infant industries\nis economically fair and proper, provided it does no more than equate\nprivate to social marginal productivity. Tariffs are the cheapest way of giving\nsuch assistance from the point of view of the country imposing them, which\nadds yet another rational reason for imposing tariffs, at least in the special\ncase of industrially backward countries. This, of course, is not incompatible\nwith the fact that from the universe's point of view, direct subsidies, paid out\nof general taxation, would be more efficient.\n\nProtection, in this restricted and true sense of the word, was probably the\nmain factor motivating the first tariffs of capitalism. One gains that impression\nnot only when perusing the writings of early Continental and American writers\non the subject ; but also from the fact that the export duties of the mercantilist\n\n!

It is therefore an increasing function of the price of the\nindustry's output, and a diminishing function of the price of capital equipment\nand co-operating factors. Tariffs will affect the marginal efficiency of invest-\nment if they alter the relationship of these prices. The prices relevant here are\nthose including the tariff. Hence, an import duty raises the prices of the goods\non which it is imposed. To a lesser extent, it also raises those of their substitutes\nand lowers the prices of their complements. An import duty, therefore, will\nincrease the marginal efficiency of investment in industries producing goods\nidentical with or similar to those hit by the duty ; it will diminish the marginal\nefficiency of investment in industries that make \u00abse of such goods and that\nproduce goods complementary to them. This argument, therefore, together\nwith that of paragraph (3) of this section, does not enable us to make general\nstatements about the effect of tariffs on national welfare, though it is very\nimportant in considering the effects of farticular tariffs.\n\nVII.\n\nThe preceding argument, concerning the effect of duties on the marginal\nefficiency of investment, has an important bearing also on the secular aspects\nof the free trade versus protection controversy. First of all, it provides an\neconomic explanation of why England was for such a long time the champion\nof free trade. In eighteenth and nineteenth century England free trade, by\nlowering the price of labour? and raw materials, meant a higher rate of profit\nin industry, greater investment opportunities, more prosperity, and fuller\nemployment. It depressed agricultural production ; but possibilities of expan-\nSion being more restricted there, it increased national prosperity and income\non balance. In all other countries the situation was the reverse during the same\nperiod : it was protection that raised the marginal efficiency of investment in\nindustry and, may be, depressed agricultural production.? This is so because\nfree trade favours whichever line of activity is already best established in a\ncountry. If we believed that the division of labour among nations is the outcome\nof inherent and unalterable national and geographical characteristics, that\n\n1Cf. P. B. Whale: ''The Working of the Pre-War Gold Standard,\" Economica, N.S.,\nvol. 4, 1937.\n\n? Via cheapening foodstuffs, the primary wage good.\n\n3 | am doubtful about this last statement, because historically, the transition from agricul-\ntural to industrial production was invariably accompanied by drastic institutional changes, which\nprobably gave a stimulus to agricultural production more important than the depressing effect\ntaken account of by more formal analysis. Such a stimulant, for instance, must have been the\ntransition from barter to a money economy. By introducing the new habit of expressing welfare\nin terms of money, and thereby minimising the importance of those elements of welfare that\n\ncannot be so expressed (leisure, a comfortable life, etc.), it must have stimulated farmers to\nproduce more for the market.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:28:33 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

They are:\n(1) the value of imports net of tariffs; (2) the value of exports; (3) the shape\nof the propensity to save function ; and the two determinants of the level of\ninvestment activity ; (4) the rate of interest ; and (5) the marginal efficiency\nof investment.\n\n(1) The imposition or raising of tariffs always diminishes the \u00abe value of\nimports, and on that count always increases employment and income. It\nincreases them to the extent that is needed to raise the community's saving,\nand expenditure on imports (net of the tariff), by the amount of the initial\nfall of imports. The ratio between the value of additional income and the\nprimary fall of imports may be called the foreign multiplier. Its value is equal\nto that of the investment multiplier in the same economy.\n\n(2) The impact effect of tariffs to create an export surplus is sometimes\nsaid to be of short duration only. If it is based on the belief that exports\nautomatically tend to be equal to imports, that statement is wrong, as has been\nshown above. While trade is relatively free, that statement is also wrong if it\nis based on the consideration that one country's export surplus is the import\nsurplus of other countries, who may retaliate. For the argument of section IV\nabout the danger of retaliation holds good here just as much as it did there.\nexports, that may be due not so much to retaliation as to the existence\nabroad of the same motive to diminish imports (i.e. other countries, also suffer-\ning from depression, might have thought of the same way of relieving it). This\nargument also shows that our long-period theory of tariffs is not dependent on\nthe assumption that trade policies are determined by welfare considerations of\nthe kind discussed in section I. If the desire to increase employment and to stop\nimport surpluses and resulting depression were the sole motive force behind\nrising tariff walls, it would still be true that the rational behaviour of each\ncountry, aiming at fuller employment and greater internal prosperity, tends to\ndefeat that aim and only results in ever-mounting tariffs.\n\n(3) The form of the propensity to save function depends on the distribution\nof income ; for rich people generally save a larger proportion of their income\nthan the poor. Hence, we can say that the more unequal is its distribution, the\ngreater the proportion of the national income which will be saved. A change in\ntrade policy, therefore, will on this account tend to raise or to lower the level of\nemployment according as it makes the distribution of income less or more\nunequal. This is a purely economic argument in favour of trade policies that\ntend to make the distribution of income more equal.\n\n(4) Since tariffs always diminish the value of imports and do not directly\naffect that of exports, they always enhance the liquidity of the banking system\n\u2014or at least alleviate the drain on its reserves. Increased protection, therefore,\nwill always lead to lower interest rates, provided that the banking system\nallows its interest rate policy to be at all influenced by its liquidity. But too\nmuch importance should not be attached to this as a factor stimulating\nemployment. Our preoccupation with the rate of interest is probably explained\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:28:33 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

As such it is more efficient than, say, the reparations\nimposed in the Versailles treaties were, because it presents no transfer problem.\nOn the other hand it imposes tribute in a veiled form, and is therefore less open\nto the critical scrutiny of public opinion.\n\nVI.\n\nSo far we have been concerned with the theory of tariffs on the classical\nassumption of full (or a given level of) employment. We now proceed to con-\nsider the effect of tariffs on employment ; such effect to be added to or sub-\ntracted from the effects of tariffs on national welfare hitherto discussed. For\nan increase in employment increases national welfare in exactly the same way\nas a. tariff does when the foreigners' reciprocal demand is inelastic. It increases\nthe quantity of all goods except that of involuntary idleness, and thus makes\nit possible for everybody to be better off than he was before, whatever the\ndistribution of welfare. Before examining how tariffs affect employment,\nhowever, it will be necessary shortly to recapitulate the theory of employment\nin a closed community.\n\nIt is generally agreed to-day among economists that it is most convenient\nto think of the level of employment as being determined by the equality of\ninvestment and saving. If we consider investment activity in the short period\nas a datum\u2014a convention based on the consideration that capital equipment,\nhaving the longest gestation period, is the commodity whose rate of production\nis least dependent on present and most irrevocably determined by past\ndecisions\u2014employment and income must be such as to make saving equal to\ninvestment. The function showing the proportion of income the community\nsaves out of each level of income is called the propensity to save function. If\nits form is approximately linear, the process by which additional investment\ngenerates additional income can be illustrated by an infinite geometric pro-\ngression, well known as the theory of the multiplier.\n\nIn a closed community saving must equal investment in short-period\nequilibrium, because that is the condition for the equality of anticipated and\nrealised receipts in current production. In an open economy, the condition for\nshort-period equilibrium is still the equality of anticipated and realised receipts\nin domestic current production. But since in the latter case there are two\nalternatives to spending on home produced goods: saving, and spending on\nimported goods ; and the receipts of domestic producers originate not only in\ndomestic expenditure but also in exports, it follows that, in an open economy,\nthe condition for short-period equilibrium is the equality between the sum of\nimports and saving and the sum of exports and investment. In other words,\nan open economy has no inherent short-run tendency to equate either saving\nwith investment or exports with imports ; but only to make the discrepancies\nin these two equal to each other.! Only to the extent that the central bank\nallows changes in its reserves (caused by the export or import surplus) to\ninfluence its interest rate policy, and to the extent that this affects investment\n\n1Cf.

Anyone acquainted with the derivation of offer curves from\nindifference maps will see at once that the tangent to the two indifference\ncurves going through 5, is the locus of all such initial situations; for it is the\nlocus of the origin of all pairs of offer curves that intersect in 5. It follows\nfrom this that the barter agreement leading to f, is equivalent in its effect to\nfree trade between the two countries, after the payment of a tribute from A\nto B that brings them from the origin of the barter diagram to any point of\nthe tangent drawn through $,. In the figure, the new offer curves are drawn\n(broken line) from o' as origin, assuming that the tribute is paid in terms of y.\nBut the tribute could just as well be paid in terms of x, bringing the origin of\nthe offer curves\u2014still intersecting in $,\u2014 to o\"; or it could be paid in any\ncombination of x and y, as long as the rate of transformation between them\nremained equal to the slope of the indifference curves tangential to each other\nin /,. Barter trade agreements, therefore, represent the exploitation of one\ncountry by the other, just as tariffs do; but with the difference that to the\nextent that they bring the trading point nearer the contract curve, they are\nmore efficient.\n\nSo far we have only considered barter trade agreements that are volun-\ntarily entered into and therefore do not increase the exploitation of one country\nby the other but only render existing exploitation more efficient. If, however,\none of the countries can bring political or military pressure to bear on the\nother country, it can force it into a barter agreement that brings them onto a\ntrading point outside the area enclosed by the indifference curves going through\nthe point reached under existing trading conditions (5,). In an extreme case,\na barter agreement may bring the trading point outside the indifference curves\ngoing through the origin of the barter diagram (not drawn in the figure),\nindicating that trade under such circumstances would be worse for the exploited\ncountry than no trade at all.? Barter agreements, of course, need not neces-\nsarily be efficient in the sense of leading to the contract curve. They do, if\nafter their conclusion the relative prices of the bartered goods are the same in\nthe two countries ;? and \u00a3e conformity of that brice vatio in the two countries 1s\nan index of the efficiency of the agreement.\n\nTo sum up the above argument, barter trade agreements are a method for\none country to exploit another, more efficient potentially than tariffs. They\nare equivalent to free trade $/us the payment of a tribute from one country to\nanother, if efficient.A A barter agreement may be to mutual advantage if it\nsupersedes protective tariffs, provided that it does not increase already existing\nexploitation but merely makes it more efficient. To the extent that it increases\nthe degree of exploitation, it may be regarded as a method of turning political\nascendancy to economic account by exacting tribute from defeated conquered\n\n1! In Fig. 4 the intersection of the axes of the two indifference maps gives the total quantity\nof the two goods jointly possessed by A and B, while the origin of the barter diagram itself shows\ntheir initial distribution between \u00c0 and B. Cf. A. L. Bowley: Mathematical Groundwork of\nEconomics, Oxford, 1924, for the best description of such a diagram.\n\n? In a happier age, Edgeworth and Marshall have not even drawn the contract curve beyond\nthese limits.\n\n?

So in either case, heterogeneous\ncompetition leads through the rational behaviour of each competitor to\n** paucilateral'\" and bilateral monopoly ; and tariff autonomy will, in time,\ngive way to tariff clubs and bilateral trade agreements.\n\nV.\n\nBilateral trade agreements are a matter of higgling and bargaining and\nhave little interest for the economist. Nevertheless, it may be worth our while\nto make a short digression and discuss barter agreements, a special form of\nthem, which has recently acquired some importance. Barter trade agreements\nnot only set the terms on which indefinite amounts of goods are to be traded\nfor each other, but also fix the exact amounts to be exchanged. They have\nbeen introduced by Nazi Germany in her trade with South American and\nSouth-East European countries, and declared by a Nazi spokesman to be the\nprinciple on which trade in Hitler's '* New Order \" would be based. Since by\ntheir very nature they overrule all existing tariffs, it is to be expected that\nthey should be able both to improve and to worsen the situation they replace.\nWe set out to prove that barter agreements may be to the mutual advantage\nof countries whose trade was previously conducted across tariff walls; but\nthat at the same time they are a convenient way of exacting tribute from\nconquered or intimidated countries.\n\nLet us draw a pair of Marshallian offer curves belonging to countries A\nand B, and assume that owing to the existence of trade barriers between them,\ntheir trading point is not at the intersection of the offer curves but, say, at\npoint 2, (Fig. 4). We shall not bother to draw the two tariff-distorted offer\ncurves that intersect at that point. The two countries' community indifference\ncurves going through $, and corresponding to their distributions of income\nbrought about by this particular set of tariffs intersect one another, as shown\nin the figure, since they could not be tangential under any combination of\ntariffs. That means, however, that a new trade agreement bringing the\ntrading point within the area enclosed by the two indifference curves would\nbe likely to be beneficial to both countries.\n\nThe qualification '' likely \" is that accompanying all arguments based on\ncommunity indifference curves. For, if the new trade agreement resulted in a\nvery drastic redistribution of income as between social classes in either or both\ncountries, either or both of the indifference curves pertaining to the agreement\nmight intersect the corresponding indifference curve or curves going through\n$,, and therefore not signify an increase in national welfare. After this last\nwarning we shall leave it to the reader to make the qualifications incumbent on\nthe use of community indifference curves and proceed for the rest of this\nargument pretending that each country is a single person. That will simplify\nthe argument considerably, without qualifying its results more than turning\nthem from certain into probable statements. We also wish to emphasise once\nmore that the intersection of community indifference curves cannot reverse\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:28:33 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

That the two\nassumptions have nothing to do with each other is well known ; and the\nimportance of keeping them strictly apart has recently been emphasised.!\nThe difference\u2014real and supposed l\u2014between a country's produce and its\nforeign substitutes determines the elasticity of the foreigners' reciprocal\ndemand, and hence the size of the optimum initial tariff and of subsequent\ntariff raises. The more perfectly identical are in the estimation of foreigners\ntheir substitutes for our country's produce, the more elastic will be their\ndemand for its exports, and the smaller will be the tariff it can profitably\nimpose upon foreign trade. If foreigners produced perfect substitutes, their\nreciprocal demand would be perfectly elastic? and the optimum tariff rate\nwould be zero, and would remain zero even after other countries have imposed\ntariffs of their own. Perfect competition refers to this limiting case alone.\n\nAt this stage we may attempt to sketch a long-period theory of inter-\nnational trade. Imagine an initial situation where trade is free, or at least\ntariffs are low and the most-favoured-nation clause is in vogue ; and where\neach country trades with most of the others, and there is some triangular trade.\nCountries that believe themselves to be sufficiently small to erect or raise\ntariffs unpunished will do so as soon as they discover that they can thereby\nincrease their national welfare. When a number of countries have followed this\ncourse, those still on a free trade basis will find themselves monopolistically\nexploited and will be perfectly justified in saying that they are being forced\ninto erecting tariff walls too. That they can thereby improve their position\nwe have shown above; and this should be as obvious as that a mono-\npolistically exploited consumer can improve his position by charging mono-\npolistic prices in his capacity of producer.\n\nWhen tariff walls have been erected all round, those who started the\nprocess will find some of their initial advantage gone ; but they are also likely\nto find that they can improve their position by raising tariffs further, even if\ninitially they made full use of their monopolistic position. As tariff walls rise,\nconferences on international trade may be called to arrest the process, which is\nobviously harmful to all concerned. Yet, as long as it remains in the individual\ninterest of each country separately to raise tariffs, such collective attempts are\nbound to be ineffectual if not backed by international sanctions ; just as cartel\nagreements are ineffectual if there is not a large producer with enough authority\nto enforce them.\n\nAs tariff walls mount and international trade dwindles, the number of\ncountries each country trades with will diminish. That will tend to destroy\nthe atomistic nature of international trade and lend increasing reality to the\ndanger of retaliation. In other words, it will lead to the realisation of the\ninterdependence of the various countries' tariff policies. That may cause the\nmost-favoured-nation clause to fall into disuse and tariffs to be determined\nby bargaining, before equilibrium had been reached. If, on the other hand,\n\n1Cf.

The low value of the income-elasticity of the demand for\ntobacco may be accidental, but the fact that it lies below unity is not as\nparadoxical as it may seem at first sight.\n\nThe five groups ''Transportation,\" ''Other household operations,\"\n\"' Recreation,\" \" Clothing \" and '' Miscellaneous \" which have the highest\nincome-elasticities have at the same time necessarily a price-elastic demand, if\nwe can trust our method. They are the only goods having a price-elastic\ndemand, if 4 \u2014 o.14, a case which seems quite plausible. Again it seems\nhighly probable that A \u2014 r, as otherwise the demand for each good would be\nprice-elastic. But, as emphasised, this cannot be decided on ground of the\nfamily budget data which fit equally well all these possibilities.\n\nFinally, a few critical remarks on the significance of the results may not\nbe out of place. As already stated, the elasticity of demand shows the change\nin demand in consequence of a price change, after such a time has passed that\na new equilibrium is established. The short run effects may be different, as\ntotal expenditure need not always be equal to income. For certain income-\nlevels, especially for high ones, it is even doubtful whether this equality exists\nor will be established within a measurable period. The crucial point seems\ntherefore to lie rather more in the well-known assumption (II) than in the\nassumptions (III) or (IIIa) which are peculiar to the present analysis.\n\nFor these and other reasons, it is obvious that we cannot expect to obtain\nexact results by the simple method developed here. But it is suggested that\nthe method gives a fair approximation and a useful check to results derived in\nother ways.\n\nCambridge. C. E. V.

The price of Y will rise if X and Y are substitutes, fall if they are\ncomplementary.\" In respect of the indirect effects through third markets this\n\" rule \" will also hold true.! In fact, it is taken as one of the '' rules about the\nway in which the price system will react to changes in tastes and resources.\"'?\n\nThis application of the '' rule \" appears startling. Have we not been told\nthat by definition the demand for complements always works in the same\ndirection as that for X ? How is it possible that an increased demand for X\nshould effect a fall in the price of its complement Y ? Apparently refuge is\ntaken in the assumption that the demands and supplies for all other commodi-\nties, whether complements or substitutes, are being unaffected.? Yet, far from\nbeing helpful this assumption renders the analysis all the more abtruse, if not\nunintelligible. For, in the first place, even if we granted this assumption, how\ncould it be that the prices of complements and substitutes would move in\nopposite direction ? If the increased demand for X acts upon X alone, and not\nupon others, the prices of all these latter should move, if at all, in the same\ndirection, i.e. tend to fall. Then there would be no point of differentiating goods\ninto complements and substitutes at all.\n\nBut the objection goes deeper than that. After all, is this assumption\nlegitimate ? Does it involve contradiction to the very definition laid down for\ncomplementarity ? At one place, Professor Hicks points out that the effect as\nenvisaged by the \"' rule \" may frequently be masked '' in practice by a simultan-\neous rise in the demand for these complementary commodities.\"^ But is this\nsimultaneous rise in demand for complements not a necessary condition of\ncomplementarity by definition ? The common instance of tennis rackets and\ntennis balls as complementary to each other well demonstrates that increased\ndemand for one necessarily entails increased demand for the other.5 In another\nplace, it is said that as a result of the increased demand for X, the '' fall in the\nprices of the complements will in its turn increase the demand for them (and\ntherefore for X itself).'* Then is it justifiable that whereas this increased\ndemand (itself a secondary effect) for the complements consequent upon the\nfall in their prices is permitted to communicate to the demand for X, the\ninitial increase in demand for X is assumed to be confined to itself alone ?\n\nThe present writer believes that in considering these price changes we must\ndifferentiate the case where the initial cause of disturbance is a change in the\nrice of X from the other in which the initial cause is a change in demand. In\nthe first case, Professor Hicks' rule holds: the price movements of X and Y\nwill be in opposite direction when they are complementary, and in the same\ndirection when they are substitutes. In the second case, however, assuming\n\n! Value and Capital, p. 42-5. Income effects are abstracted in this analysis.\n\n? Ibid, p. 74 ; see also p. 106\n\n* Ibid, p. 62.\n\n* Ibid, p. 73.

The simultaneous rise of the price of the comple-\nment follows from definition.? As to substitutability, assuming (as Professor\nHicks does) the expenditure of this group of consumers on other goods has nof\nbeen curtailed, the prices for substitutes will also tend to rise as a result of a\nshift, by the erstwhile marginal buyers of X and Y, of their expenditure to\npurchases of these substitutes. In any case there will be a relative rise of the\nprices of X and Y as compared with the prices of substitutes. Looking at the\nmatter this way, an increase in demand, if of considerable importance, for any\ngood or group of goods may produce an upward effect upon prices in general.?\nThe increased expenditure for X as well as for Y being financed apparently\nfrom dishoarding, and not through diminished demand for other goods, such\nan up-lifting effect on prices in general need not appear strange as it is in fact\nwell-established in monetary theory. But is there any reason to hold the effect\nin the first case any more than that in the second as the '\"' rule \" for price\nbehaviour of complements and substitutes ?\n\nIf the foregoing analysis is valid, then it may be suggested that not only\nwill the '' rules about the way in which the price system will react to changes\nin zastes and resources \" be modified, but the conditions for the stability in\nmultiple exchange must also be reconsidered.

REviEw or Ecowowuic SruDpirEs, October, 1940). But it is clear that\nProfessor Lange's note, and Professor Hicks' reply had not penetrated to\nChungking when Professor Li wrote his note.

                    "88 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nbuted as to make the distribution of welfare similar to that of the second\nsituation.\n\nVIII\n\nMr. Kaldor and Professor Hicks have asserted that it is always possible:to\ntell whether a given change improves general welfare, even if not all people\ngain by it and some lose. The test suggested by them : to see whether it is\npossible after the change fully to compensate the losers at a cost to those\nfavoured that falls short of their total gain, is fundamentally identical with\nthe first of our two criteria. The objection to using this criterion by itself is that\nit is asymmetrical, because it attributes undue importance to the particular\ndistribution of welfare obtaining before the contemplated change. If the\ngovernment had a special attachment to the s/atus quo before the change and\nwould actually undertake to reproduce that welfare distribution by differential\ntaxation after the change, then Mr. Kaldor's test would be sufficient. For then,\nthe economist could regard that particular welfare distribution as the only\nrelevant one and would be entitled to use it as his sole standard of reference.\nBut in the absence of such a governmental policy there can be no justification\nin attaching greater importance to the welfare distribution as it was before\nthan as it is after the change.\n\nTo illustrate the pitfalls of this one-sided criterion, imagine a change, say\nthe imposition of a duty on imports, that brings the welfare of 4 and B from\nP, (Fig. 2) on the contract curve of diagram r onto m; on the contract curve of\ndiagram 2. According to Mr. Kaldor's test this change is desirable, because by\nredistributing income we could travel from z, along the v curve to z,, which\nis superior to P,. But once the tariff has been imposed and situation m estab-\nlished, it will be free trade and the resulting (original) situation P, that will\nappear preferable by the same test, because starting from P,, income could be so\nredistributed (travelling along the PP curve in the first diagram this time) as\nto reach Ps, which is superior to v. So the two situations can be shown each\nto be preferable to the other by the identical criterion : an absurd result, which\ncan only be avoided by using our double criterion.\n\nWashington, D.C. T. pnE Scrrovszkv.\n\n! We say that the distribution of welfare is similar in two situations if every member of the\ncommunity prefers the same situation. A more exact definition would be unnecessary for our\npurposes; besides, it is also impossible, since welfare cannot be measured.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:39:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

If the first is\npossible and the second impossible, we shall say that the new situation is better\nthan the old was. If the first is impossible but the second possible, we shall say\nthat the new situation is worse; whereas if both are possible or both are\nimpossible, we shall refrain from making a welfare proposition.!\n\nWe can illustrate this procedure in Fig. 2 for the special case when allocat-\ning efficiency is at its optimum both before and after the change. Each situation\ncan then be represented by a point on its respective contract curve and com-\npared with the corresponding point on the other contract curve. If both points\nlie to the left of P, on their respective contract curves, the change will increase\ngeneral welfare, because starting from the new situation on the second diagram's\ncontract curve it is always possible to travel along that curve by redistributing\nincome and arrive at a point which is superior to the initial situation from\neverybody's point of view ; whereas starting from the initial situation on the\nfirst diagram's contract curve, it is impossible by travelling along that curve\nto reach a position superior to the new situation. If on the other hand, both\npoints lie to the right of the common point P,, the change can be said to diminish\ngeneral welfare on the same reasoning ; while if one point lies to the left and the\nother to the right, we can make no welfare propositions relative to our group.\n\nVII\n\nOur two criteria for making welfare propositions bear a close resemblance\nto Paasche's and Laspeyre's formulae in the theory of cost of living index\nnumbers. There, just as here, the difficulty lies in comparing averages whose\nweighting is different ;? and the solution is sought in comparing the two real\nsituations not one with another, but each with a hypothetical situation, which\nresembles it in weighting but is otherwise identical with the other real situation.\nIn the theory of index numbers, budgets of different dates or places are com-\npared each with the cost of the identical bundle of commodities at the prices\nof the other date or place; and these two comparisons, expressed as ratios\n(Paasche's and Laspeyre's formulae), are the limits within which the true\ndifference in the cost of living must lie.? In welfare problems, of course, we can\naim neither at a \"' true \" answer nor at its quantitative expression without\nmeasuring satisfaction and comparing different people's. But our two criteria\nare exactly analogous to Paasche's and Laspeyre's formulae. For we compare\nthe first welfare situation with what general welfare would be if the satisfaction,\nyielded by the physical income of the second situation were distributed as it\nwas in the first ; and contrast the second situation with the welfare that the\nfirst situation's physical income would yield to each person if it were so distri-\n\n1 It need hardly be recalled that in the situation discussed in section 5\u2014that is, when the\nquantities of goods and services all change in the same direction\u2014this last case can never occur,\nand we can always make welfare propositions.\n\n? Because the general welfare can be conceived of as average welfare.\n\n* Cf. Henry Schultz: '' A Misunderstanding in Index Number Theory,\" Econometrica, vol. 7\n\n(1939), P. 1; and A. A.

Imagine members of a com-\nmunity divided into two groups according to their preference for goods Y and X\nrespectively.! Then assume a change that increases the quantity of Y and\ndiminishes that of X, but leaves the distribution of money income between\nour two groups unaffected. From the point of view of individuals, the change\nwill appear as a shift in relative prices ; which, given the distribution of income,\nwill be likely to make those with a special preference for Y better off, and those\nwith a liking for X worse off, than they were before. Assume next that the\nmembers of our first group are rich and those of the second poor. Then the gain\nof the first group expressed in money (or in terms of any single commodity)\nwill be greater than the money equivalent of the loss suffered by the second\ngroup. Therefore, if we so redistributed income as to restore approximately\nthe initial distribution of welfare, there would be a net gain, making members of\nboth groups better off than they were before. Conversely, if the people favoured\nby the change were poor, and those prejudiced by it were rich, the money\nequivalent of the former's gain would be insufficient fully to compensate the\nlatter's loss, so that a redistribution of income tending to restore the initial\ndistribution of welfare would result in a net loss of satisfaction for everybody.\n\nWhat significance are we to attach to this case ? To refrain altogether, as\nthe classical economists did, from making welfare propositions relating to it,\nseems unduly restrictive. It is true that as we have seen such a change would\nimprove general welfare for some welfare distributions and worsen it for others ;\non the other hand, we are not interested in all possible welfare distributions.\nThere are only two distributions of welfare that really matter. Those actually\nobtaining immediately before and after the change contemplated.? It seems\ntherefore sufficient to concentrate on these and to investigate how the change\nwould affect general welfare if it were to leave the distribution of welfare\nunaffected and if that were both before and after it, first what it actually is\nbefore, secondly what it actually is after, the change. Whenever these two\ncomparisons yield identical results, we can make welfare propositions of almost\nthe same generality and significance as the allocative welfare propositions of\nthe classical economists; especially since the identical results for the two\nwelfare distributions imply a strong presumption in favour of the same result\nholding for all intermediate welfare distributions as well.\n\nWe propose, therefore, to make welfare propositions on the following\nprinciple. We must first see whether it is possible in the new situation so to\nredistribute income as to make everybody better off than he was in the initial\nsituation ; secondly, we must see whether starting from the initial situation it\n\n1 The term '' preference \"' is used in a loose sense. It denotes the whole shape of indifference\nsurfaces and not only their slope at the relevant point, which in equilibrium conditions is the\nsame for everybody.\n\n? The reader's attention is called to the fact that in reality the distribution of income is not\ngiven as we have assumed in the argument above. As a rule, the change will affect the distribution\nof welfare not only by shifting relative prices but also by boosting some industries and depressing\nothers, and thereby redistributing money income.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:39:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

From the fact that the second\ndiagram's .contract curve is superior to that of the first, it follows that the\nlatter can be represented on the second diagram by tracing the locus of the\npoints of intersection of all the indifference curves that in the first diagram are\ntangential to each other. This will give us a curve on each side of the second\ndiagram's contract curve, and the area between them represents welfare\npositions that are superior to the first diagram's contract curve. Hence, a\nchange that brings the welfare of our groups from a point of the first diagram's\ncontract curve onto a point of the second diagram's contract curve (or at least\nwithin the area between the broken lines), can be said to be desirable with the\nsame generality and significance with which perfect competition or direct\ntaxation are said to be desirable on the ground of their allocating efficiency.\nIn other words, while it need not actually improve everybody's position, it\nwould do so for every possible distribution of welfare if the change tere to leave\nthat distribution unaffected.\n\nThe above argument is an explicit formulation of the statement that\ngetting more of some (or all) commodities at no cost of foregoing others is a\ngood thing. This may be considered as overpedantic, since that statement seems\nto be obvious; on the other hand, it is subject to the same limitations that\nqualify allocative welfare propositions (cf. section 3 above) ; and besides, it is\nnot even always true. Increased plenty is a good thing only if it is not linked\nwith a redistribution of welfare, too retrogressive from the point of view of\nsocial justice ; and if it does not lead to a serious deterioration of the allocating\nefficiency of the economic system. For the former there exists no objective\ncriterion, but there is a simple test for the latter. To test whether a diminution\nin allocating efficiency has not obviated the advantages of increased plenty, we\nmust see if after the change, it is possible fully to compensate people prejudiced\nby it out of funds levied on those favoured by the change, without thereby\ncompletely eliminating the latter's gain.

The former may be due to the\nimposition of a duty on international trade, which from the point of view of an\nindividual country alters the quantities of imports and retained. exports\navailable for home consumption ; while the latter may be caused by this or any\nother change, if it affects the propensity to save or the inducement to invest\nand thereby changes employment. Analytically there is no difference between\nthe two cases. In both, the quantities of resources available for consumption\nare changed, hence the relative position of the indifference maps is altered ;\nwhence it follows that welfare propositions in the wider sense must involve the\ncomparison of two diagrams. Since these are constructed from the identical\ntwo indifference maps and differ only in the latter's relative position to each\nother, such comparisons are not the hopeless task they might seem at first sight.\nFor we can represent some (not all) welfare positions on both diagrams ; and\nit is possible to represent on one diagram the welfare positions corresponding\nto all those points of the other diagram's contract curve that are inferior to its\n** own \" contract curve. This follows from the fact that our diagrams admit\nthe representation of all welfare situations that are inferior (worse from the\npoint of view of at least one of the two persons) to their contract curve, while\nwelfare positions superior to the contract curve cannot be represented on them.\n\nOur welfare propositions may necessitate the comparison of points on the\ncontract curves of the two diagrams, or of points suboptimal to them, or of a\npoint on one contract curve with a point suboptimal to the other contract\ncurve. The first case is that where the system's allocating efficiency is at an\noptimum both before and after the given change; the second, where it is\nsuboptimal both before and after the change; the third, where the change\naffects allocating efficiency. Taking an example from the theory of inter-\nnational trade, the first case may be illustrated by the imposition of an import\nduty by a country in which taxation is direct and domestic markets are per-\nfectly competitive ;* the second case can be represented by a duty imposed in\na monopolistic world ; and the third by a duty which favours the formation of\nmonopolies or is linked with an excise tax on the home production of import\nsubstitutes.\n\nV\n\nLet us draw two diagrams (Fig: 1r), both consisting of the superposed\nindifference maps of individuals A and B, but with the difference that in the\nsecond, B's map has been shifted by opop ; so that the joint possessions of 4\nand B have increased by xqx, of X and yoy, of Y compared with what they were\nin the first. This shift will bring into a position of tangency indifference curves\nthat in the first diagram have neither touched nor intersected, and will thus\nmake the second diagram's contract curve superior to that of the first diagram\nthroughout its range. This follows from that fundamental postulate of economic\n\n1 A tariff on foreign trade is not incompatible with the tariff imposing country's domestic\ntrade and production being of optimum allocating efficiency. The reader must not let himself be\nconfused by the fact that similar diagrams have been used for illustrating the waste caused by\ntariffs from the point of view of the universe as a whole. We are here solely concerned with the\n\neffects of a tariff on the welfare of a single country, consequently the indifference maps that\nconstitute our diagrams belong to inhabitants of the same country.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:39:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "A NOTE ON WELFARE PROPOSITIONS IN ECONOMICS 79\nIII\n\nWe have: seen above that allocative welfare propositions are based on the\ncriterion of economic efficiency. They state that of alternative situations,\nbrought about by different institutions or courses of policy, one is superior to\nthe other in the sense that it would make everybody better off for every\ndistribution of welfare, 7f that were the same in the two situations. This is\ndifferent from saying that one situation is actually better than the other from\neverybody's point of view, because a change in institutions or policy almost\nalways redistributes welfare sufficiently not to have a uniform effect on every-\nbody but to favour some people and prejudice others. It follows from this that\neconomic welfare propositions cannot as a rule be made independently of\ninterpersonal comparisons of utility.\n\nIt would hardly be satisfactory, however, to confine the economist's value\njudgments to cases where one situation is superior to the other from the point\nof view of everybody affected. It is doubtful if in practice any choice comes\nwithin this category ; besides, there would not be much point in soliciting the\neconomist's expert opinion when everybody is unanimous, except in order to\nenlighten people as to their true interest.\n\nFavouring an improvement in the organisation of production and exchange\nonly when it is accompanied by a corrective redistribution of income fully com-\npensating those prejudiced by it might seem to be a way out of the difficulty,\nbecause such a change would make some people better off without making\nanyone worse off. For instance, it might be argued that the abolition of the\nCorn Laws should not have been advocated by economists in their capacity of\npure economists without advocating at the same time the full compensation of\nlandowners out of taxes levied on those favoured by the cheapening of corn.\nYet, in a sense, and regarded from a long-run point of view, such propositions\nare not independent of value judgments between alternative income distribu-\ntions either. For, going out of their way to preserve the existing distribution\nof income, they imply a preference for the s/atus quo.\n\nThere seem to be two solutions of the problem. First of all, in addition to\nadmitting his inability to compare different people's satisfaction, the economist\nmay postulate that such comparisons are impossible, and that therefore there\nis nothing to choose between one distribution of income and another. He may\nthen make value judgments on the sole criterion of efficiency without bothering\nabout concomitant shifts in the distribution of income, since he considers one\nincome distribution as good as any other. In this case, however, he cannot\nclaim that his value judgments are independent of interpersonal utility com-\nparisons,-because they depend on the assumption of their impossibility.\n\nSecondly, the economist may put forward his welfare propositions with due\n\n1'This, I think, was the attitude of the classical economists ; at least of those who did not,\nlike Bastiat, impute ethical values to the distribution of income under perfect competition. It\nseems to be the correct interpretation of that fairly representative statement of Cairnes': ''...\nstandards of abstract justice . . . are inefficacious as means of solving the actual problems of . . .\ndistribution. . . . If our present system of industry (perfect competition) is to be justified, it\nmust . . . find its justification . . . in the fact that it secures for the mass of mankind a greater\namount of material and moral well-being, and provides more effectively for its progress in civilisa-\ntion than any other plan,\"\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:39:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Attempts to rationalise retail trade (begun at the\nend of the \" New Economic Policy \"\") were resumed during the First Five Year\nPlan, apparently with fairly satisfactory partialresults. But on the whole these\nefforts were nullified in their effects by the inherent deficiencies of rationing.\n\nIn connection with wholesale trade Party and Government adopted a\nnumber of measures with a view to counteracting '' Leftist \" practices. The\nrevival of wholesale trade assumed three main forms: (r) the organisation of\nspecialised wholesale supply bases under the charge of the various productive\nCommissariats ; (2) the formation of wholesale centres for the express purpose\nof facilitating the sale of ' non-deficit \" goods; and (3) the setting-up of\ninter-regional universal wholesale bases of the co-operative and State trade\nsystems. The Authorities also tried to bring about a more even distribution of\nthe wholesale network, so as to avoid the concentration of wholesale trade in\nbig cities and in regions where the commodities were actually produced.\n\nThe economic measures to mitigate the hardships caused by the shortage\nof goods were based on the belief that, although the paucity of consumers'\ngoods in relation to the soaring demands of the population was unavoidable\nunder the period of industrialisation, the output of consumers' goods could be\nincreased by methods of enhancing the utilisation of the existing resources\n(local supply, Kolkhoz and bazaar trade, decentralised collections, expansion\nof handicraft co-operatives in local centres of raw-materials, fostering of small-\nscale fishing, production of consumers' goods out of waste material from the\nheavy industries, etc.)\n\nEfforts were also being made in the direction of diminishing intra-industrial\nconsumption by means of rationalising production and cutting down unreasonable\nand excessive demands, especially as regards working clothes and footwear. In\nthe course of 1932 the Authorities succeeded in bringingabout a slight reduction\nof intra-industrial consumption anda corresponding increase in '' market-funds.\"\"\n\nLastly, the Government and the Communist Party began to take steps\nto narrow, as much as possible, the number of commodities and commodity\ngroups under rationing. The Joint Appeal of the Central Committee of the\nC.P.S.U., the Soviet of People's Commissars and the Central Co-operative\nUnion, dated May r2th, 1931, which scourged the utopian schemes to proceed\nat once to direct commodity distribution and which warned co-operative\nofficials not to interpret the elimination of private trade as the elimination of\ntrade as a whole, succeeded in stopping the tendency to widen the range of\nrationed goods and after that date the number of such goods began to diminish,\nthough it remained high enough in the course of the second half of 1931. In\nApril, 1932, Party and Government published a decree according to which\nthe number of rationed foodstuffs was reduced from thirteen to six, viz., bread,\ngroats, sugar, meat, herrings, animal and vegetable fats. This number remained\nunaltered until January, 1935, when the scheme was, in the main, terminated.\n\nA somewhat clearer picture of the attitude of the Soviet State towards\nthe functions of distribution and the relation between production and con-\nsumption will, we hope, emerge when we come to pass under review the\nde-rationing of Soviet trade.\n\nGlasgow.

(Since in the\nactual system the working day is likely to shorten, this relative lengthening of\nthe working day in the reference system may not amount to an absolute one.)\nBut if output increases more rapidly than the available labour, unemploy-\nment in the reference system will disappear and an absolute lengthening of the\nworking day will become necessary. This, however, would be resisted by trade\nunions and a further rise in output would be prevented by scarcity of labour.\nThis. makes clear the point that although technical progress does not promote\nby its '' pure \" effect an increase in outp\u00fct, in certain cases it clears the ground\nfor it by overcoming the scarcity of labour.\n\nIt is further important to state that the features of technical progress from\nwhich we abstracted in order to obtain its '' pure \"' effect are by no means\nunimportant. For instance the Industrial Revolution did increase output\nbecause the tremendous outburst of new inventions and their applications\ncreated a. '' secular boom.\" (In our reference system there would correspond to\nit an equivalent wave of optimism.) But the significance of our theorem is to\nshow that technical progress influences output only through the channels of\ninvention stimulus, oligopoly, and the general price level (or by overcoming the\nscarcity of labour.)\n\n2. Another problem of this type is that of the ratio of output to capital.\nIf in the actual system the utilisation of equipment is not increasing\u2014and such\nseems to be the case in reality\u2014there must occur a permanent fall in the ratio\nof output to capital. But this does not mean that the capital using type of\ntechnical progress is responsible for this change. For the same fall of the ratio\nof output to capital occurs in the reference system, taking there the form of\ndiminishing utilisation of equipment. Thus there must exist some factors other\nthan the fall in the ratio of capacity to capital which account for the fall of the\nratio of output to capital both in the actual and in the reference system.\n\nOne of these factors may be the rise in the degree of oligopoly. But it must\nbe stated generally that the degree of utilisation of plant in the reference\nsystem is constant only in the case of uniform trend. If the pace of secular\ntrend is permanently slowing down the utilisation of equipment is in general\ndeclining.\n\nIt must be added that if the ratio of output to capital were constant in the\ncourse of the dynamic process so would be the utilisation in the reference\nsystem, while in the actual system the utilisation would rise. (If in the latter\nthe ratio of output to capital wc is constant and the ratio of capacity to capital\nc falls the utilisation w rises). Thus after a certain time a point would be reached\nwhen the marginal cost curves cease to be horizontal and our assumption about\nthe actual system would not. hold good any more. The complete parallelism\nbetween the actual system and the reference system would then break down\nand our theorem would cease to be true. It is likely (although it cannot be\ndemonstrated quite rigorously) that the output in the actual system would\nthen start diminishing as compared with that in the reference system because\nof the adverse influence of the '' shift to profit \" upon effective demand.

But this is a double-edged weapon because at the same\ntime it also creates technological unemployment, and it is not impossible that\non balance it sometimes increases rather than alleviates unemployment.\n\nTo review shortly the main results of this paper, we have shown firstly,\nhow in a non-capitalistic economy people's desire to save leads to unemployment\nif prices are perfectly rigid and to instability when they are perfectly flexible\n(and when a rise in the interest rate leads to a higher rate of saving !) : and we\nhave also determined the optimum degree of price-flexibility which yields the\nhighest level of employment compatible with the stability of the system. We\nhave then proceeded to study the capitalistic economy and have found that it\nbehaves similarly to our non-capitalistic model, except that it is less stable\n(requires greater price-rigidity for stability) and that its instability does sot\ndepend on the assumption that saving increases with the real rate of interest.\nFinally, we have shown that the secular accumulation of capital equipment and\nof securities is likely to lead to increasing unemployment even if prices and\ncosts are not perfectly rigid (but their flexibility is limited by the requirement\nof stability), unless employment is maintained by population growth, technical\nadvance, increasing quantity of money, or by at least one of these factors. As\nregards the more general problem of economic change, the conclusion to be\ndrawn from our results is that on the assumption of fixed prices or limited\nprice-flexibility, there need be no inh\u00e9rent tendency in the economic system\ntowards the full (optimum) employment of productive resources ; whereas it is\nimpossible to base a theory of economic change on the assumption of perfectly\nflexible prices. It is inadmissible even to start out from the assumption of\nflexible prices as a limiting case, for it is very dangerous to argue or to draw\nconclusions about our economy on the basis of a model which is essentially\nunstable. It also follows from this that the criticism of the methods and\nconclusions of Mr. Keynes and his followers on the ground that they assume\nrigid money wages is totally unwarranted ; not only because this assumption is\nprobably less unrealistic than the classical assumption of perfectly flexible\nwages and prices, but also because the model of rigid wages\u2014fulfilling the\ncondition of stability\u2014is unlikely to differ significantly from the real economy\nin its essential features, whereas the same certainly cannot be said of the model\nof perfectly flexible prices and wages which is unstable.\n\nChicago.

Furthermore, the system will be the less stable the greater is the\nimportance of fixed-interest-bearing securities.\n\nThe maximum time-rate of price-fall compatible with the stability of the\nsystem is unlikely to be sufficient to counteract completely the secular fall in the\nmarginal productivity of capital and the secular rise in market rates of interest,\nand thereby to maintain the level of employment in the long run. It is more\nlikely that even in the case of (limited) price-flexibility, the long-run level of\nemployment will fall in a progressive economy, although, of course, at a smaller\nrate than when prices are perfectly rigid.\n\nIt is often said that the contrast between the relatively smooth working\nof our economic system during the nineteenth century and the chronic unem-\nployment of the 1920's and '30's is explained by the increasing rigidity of our\nprice- and cost-structure. While personally I do not think that this factor is\nvery important, it has been shown above that it is a possible explanation, yet\nit does not follow from it that measures aiming at increasing the flexibility of\nprices and costs would be the proper remedy. For hand in hand with the\nincreasing rigidity of prices went another development: the community's\ndiminishing willingness to bear risk. This tendency manifested itself partly in\nthe increased care and caution with which investments were planned, and\npartly in the shift in investors' tastes from ordinary shares to preferential stock\nand fixed-interest-bearing securities. Both these changes were shown above to\nmake for lesser stability of the system so that the greater rigidity of present-day\nprices and costs may well be necessary to maintain the stability of our economy.\n\nOther, and probably more important factors that have contributed to the\nspectacular progress and relatively high average level of employment of the\nnineteenth century were population growth, the increase in the quantity of\nmoney (in the form of gold rushes and of the development of the means of\npayment other than gold), and, possibly, technical advance. Population\ngrowth raises the marginal productivity of capital by diminishing its quantity\nrelatively to that of labour; it diminishes the propensity to save by lowering\nreal income per head (owing to the law of non-proportional returns) ; and it\nincreases the willingness to bear risk by making misinvestments pay.!

Consequently, investing entrepreneurs will, if\nthey are prudent, base their decisions on their experience over a much longer\npast period than do expenditure-planning consumers; and the longer the\nperiod taken into consideration, the sooner are changes in prices noticed.\nSome may argue here that human beings always base all their decisions on their\nwhole past experience\u2014or on what they remember of it. Yet, I believe, that\ndecisions relating to investment, being more momentous because less easily\nrevocable than consumption and saving plans, will be made more carefully,\nafter a more thorough examination of one's memory and consultation of\nstatistics and other people's opinion and forecasts.\n\nThis train of thought could be developed further by the consideration that\ncorresponding to differences in the economic lifetime of various forms of capital\nequipment, different investment decisions will be made with varying care and\ncaution and based on varying lengths of past experience. Moreover, there are\nalso differences in the rigidity of prices and costs relevant for different industries.\nFor both these reasons it is possible that some sections of the economy should\nbe unstable while others are stable. A detailed analysis of this problem would\nlie beyond the scope of this article, but because of its importance for business\ncycle theory (where its significance is somewhat different !) we may give an\nillustration. Consider an economy in which the past experience of fairly regular\ncyclical changes in prices and employment is given as a datum. Then assume\nan initial increase in prosperity and employment, coupled with a rise in prices\nand a slight rise in interest rates. In industries where equipment is relatively\nshort-lived, entrepreneurs will have a tendency to extrapolate the initial\nprice-rise linearly (i.e. to expect a further rise) and to increase their investments,\nthereby further increasing prosperity and employment and raising prices. As\nagainst the destabilising behaviour of these entrepreneurs, those whose equip-\nment is of such longevity as to compel them to base their investment policy\non past experience over at least one complete trade-cycle will consider the\nincreased prosperity and price-rise as cyclical and temporary and will only be\naffected by the increase in investment-costs and interest-rates which tends to\nreduce their investment plans. Two practical examples of such industries,\ndisplaying an anti-cyclical and, therefore, stabilising behaviour, are the railway\nindustry and residential building.!\n\nAfter this digression we may sum up the foregoing argument by saying\n\n1Cf.

Since, however,\nthey will be lowered only slightly, we can say approximately that an economy\nin which the issuing of fixed-interest-bearing securities is the main form of\nraising capital (we include bank-advances under fixed-interest-bearing securi-\nties) will only be stable if prices are so rigid that a primary price-change does\nnot lead to the expectation of a further change in the same direction. For if it\ndid, the primary excess of savings would, by lowering the inducement to invest,\nlead to a yet greater excess of saving, and instability in the form of a cumulative\nprice-fall would result.?\n\nThe market rate on shares will, in the neutral case when no future price-\nchanges are expected, be lowered more than that on fixed-interest-bearing\nsecurities ; while price-change expectations will affect it in exactly the same\nway as they affect the marginal productivity of capital, but always to a much\nlesser extent. The compound effect of the price-fall and of future price-change\nexpectations will be such as to raise the inducement to invest (i.e. widen the\ngap between the marginal productivity of capital and the market rate of\ninterest) and to diminish the excess of savings when the elasticity of price-\nexpectations is unity, below unity, or slightly above it, whereas it will lower it\n(and lead to instability) when the elasticity of expectations exceeds a certain\ncritical value which is somewhere above unity. While this result is fundamen-\ntally identical with that which we have reached in the case of fixed-interest-\nbearing securities (cf. the footnote on this page), it also shows that a system in\nwhich shares are the dominant form of securities is likely to be more stable than\none in which fixed-interest-bearing stocks and bonds are the favourite form of\ninvestment. This is due partly to the fact that a price-fall always depresses the\nmarket rate on shares more than that on stocks and bonds, and partly to the\nfact that elastic price-change expectations lower the rate on shares still further,\nwhile leaving that on stocks and bonds unaffected.\n\nAs to the formation of expectations, the reader is referred to our discussion\nof the subject on pages 75 and the following. There are, however, important\ndifferences between the two cases. There, we were concerned with the expecta-\ntions of consumers in relation to their planned expenditure and saving; here, it\nis the expectations of entrepreneurs when they plan their investments that are\nrelevant. There, we have argued that past price-changes will affect saving plans\nand make the system unstable only if they are sufficiently general to be recog-\nnised as changes in the value of money. Here, no general price-change is\nnecessary to affect expectations relevant to investment plans, because the\ninducement to invest depends only on the price of the produce of the equipment\nto be built and on the cost of co-operating factors. The significance of this\ndifference is that less general and smaller price-changes will be sufficient to lead\n\n1]t will be noticed that our definition of the elasticity of price-expectations is somewhat\nnarrower than Professor Hicks'.\n\n? This statement is only approximately true because in order that the inducement to invest\nbe lowered, it is not enough that the marginal productivity of capital should fall; it must fall by\nmore than the market rate of interest has fallen. Hence, the elasticity of expectations which\nforms the limit between stability and instability is not unity, but slightly greater than unity.\n\nB\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:46:34 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The disparity between saving and investment will,\ntherefore, lower employment before the accumulation of excess savings would\nhave had time to eliminate this disparity by depressing interest rates. The fall\nin incomes and employment will lower the rate of saving directly and also, by\ncausing interest rates to fall, indirectly. It will also depress the marginal\nproductivity of capital, but this will, to a certain extent, be counteracted by\nthe fall in interest rates. On balance the level of investment is likely to fall, but\nat a slower rate than the rate of saving.! Hence the fall in employment will\nre-establish short-period equilibrium, and the trend of short-period equilibria\nwill be one of diminishing employment, approaching the point of long-period\nequilibrium, at which capital accumulation will have ceased, and the commun-\nity's desire to save will have been obliterated by unemployment and the\naccumulation of wealth.\n\nFlexible Prices. We can now turn to the case where the incipient unem-\nployment leads to a fall in prices. We know that, as long as prices keep on\nfalling, saving can exceed investment by a quantity which, expressed as a\npercentage of total national income, is equal to the percentage fall of prices over\nthe period of consumers' reaction-time. But the fall of prices might affect\ninvestment activity and saving, so we must first of all see how these quantities\nchange.\n\nSaving as we know, depends among other factors on the reward for pure\nabstinence, i.e. on the real rate of interest on money (the perfectly riskless and\nliquid security) ; and on the reward for risk- and illiquidity-bearing, i.e. on the\nmarket rate of interest on securities. The fall in prices raises the real rate on\nmoney only if it leads to the expectation of a further general price-fall, while it\nalways lowers market rates of interest on securities. We shall see presently\nthat our capitalistic model already becomes unstable at a degree of price-\nflexibility below that at which an initial price-change begins to undermine the\nnotion of a normal price-level ; hence we will not have to consider at all the\neffect of expected changes in the value of money. As to the fall in market rates\nof interest, that is likely to leave the rate of saving unaffected in the short run,\nwhile it may lower it in the long run. Since we shall mainly be concerned with\nproblems of stability for which short-run considerations alone are relevant, and\nalso because changes in interest rates are unlikely to make a great difference\nto saving even in the long run, we feel justified in simplitying the argument by\nassuming the rate of saving to be constant and by concentrating on the induce-\nment to invest.\n\nThe marginal productivity of capital will remain unchanged by the fall in\nprices if that is regarded as permanent and non-recurring (unit elasticity of\nexpectations), it will be raised if the latter leads to the expectation of a future\nreturn towards the previous higher level of prices (elasticity below unity), and\n\n1Cf, however, N. Kaldor: ''A Model of the Trade-Cycle\" (Economic Journal, May, 1940),\n\nwhere it is contended that the inducement to invest is a steeper function of the level of employment\nthan the propensity to save, and this fact is presented as a possible explanation of the trade-cycle.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:46:34 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

While this is true, I believe that the level of employ-\nment of existing equipment is bound to have a strong psychological influence on\nthe mind of new investors, whereas investment in the duplication of already\nexisting equipment (the \"' widening \"' of capital) is altogether unthinkable as\nlong as there is excess capacity. More strictly relevant to our special problems\nis the question how the marginal productivity of capital is affected by a change\nin prices. Recalling its definition, we see that the marginal productivity of\ncapital is an increasing function of the expected future prices of finished goods,\na diminishing function of expected future costs (because expected net profits\nare the difference between expected receipts and outlays), and a diminishing\nfunction of present replacement costs. It also appears that a proportionate\nchange in all the three of these quantities leaves the marginal productivity of\ncapital unchanged, whence it follows that the latter is independent of the\nabsolute level of prices. It is not independent, however, of expected changes in\nprices since these will affect the relationship between present costs and expected\nfuture net profits, and will raise the marginal productivity of capital when a\nprice-rise is expected and lower it when a price-fall is foreseen by the expected\ntime-rate of change of prices.\n\nRigid Prices. We are now fully equipped for the analysis of the behaviour\nof the capitalistic economy. We shall consider the case of perfectly rigid prices\nfirst, and we shall start from initial conditions that make for full employment.\nIt will appear presently that this last assumption makes no difference to the\nargument and that we could equally well have started from any degree of\nunderemployment. Assume that with given tastes, production functions,\nsaving and risk-bearing propensities, and with given quantities of money,\nsecurities, and equipment, the market rates of interest and the marginal\nproductivity of capital are such that the level of investment determined by\nthem exactly equals the rate of saving performed at full employment. We know\nthat this leads to full employment. But as time goes on, the accumulation of\ncapital equipment will depress the marginal productivity of capital, the\ncorresponding increase in the quantity of securities will be likely to raise market\nrates of interest,! and both effects will tend to lower the level of investment.\nThe propensity to save\u2014that is, the rate of saving as a function of the level of\nemployment\u2014will rise on account of rising real incomes (due to the increasing\nquantity and roundaboutness of equipment) and rising interest rates, but this\ntendency may be partly offset by the increase in the stock of wealth. As the\ninducement to invest falls and the propensity to save rises, the level of employ-\nment will have to fall to ensure the equality of saving and investment, but first\nthere will be an excess of savings for a short time. This is due to the fact that\nsince present investment activity is determined to a large extent by past, and\nto a small extent only by present investment decisions (ex amie investment),\nemployment and the level of incomes will not start falling immediately after the\nrate of investment decisions has fallen. But the excess of savings so accumulated\n\n!

If, however, the initial price-fall leads to the expectation of a further\nprice-fall, and a corresponding fall in money profits and dividends, then the\nexpected time-rate of fall (p.a.) must be deducted from the market rate and\nmay easily make it negative. This tendency, however, will be partially counter-\nacted by the diminution in the demand for holding shares due to their diminished\nattraction. One would, indeed, be tempted to argue that it would be totally\ncounteracted were it not for the fact that shares are held not only for the\nincome they yield but also for the control they give over industry. This\nestablishes a significant difference between them and fixed-interest-bearing\nsecurities and lowers their elasticity of substitution. (The argument is perfectly\nsymmetrical for the case of an expected price-rise). It is important to notice\nthat the market rate on fixed-interest-bearing securities is entirely unaffected\nby price-change expectations.\n\nThe Marginal Productivity of Cajital. The marginal productivity of\ncapital may be defined as that rate of interest at which the stream of expected\nfuture marginal value products (net profits) of a capital-good must be dis-\ncounted in order to make its (the stream's) present value equal to the cost of\nbuilding an equivalent capital-good. This rate will fall with capital accumula-\ntion, because the greater is the quantity of capital relatively to that of other\nfactors of production, the smaller will be its marginal productivity. Besides\nthe relative quantity of different factors of production, the marginal pro-\nductivity of capital-goods also depends on the relative demand for different\nfactors. Variations in the level of investment constitute changes in this relative\ndemand if the various factors are not combined in the same proportions in\ninvestment-good industries and consumption-good industries respectively.\nE.g. if investment-good industries are capital-intensive, the marginal pro-\nductivity of capital-goods will rise as the rate of investment increases, it will\nfall if investment-good industries are labour-intensive. But the marginal\nproductivity of a capital-good is not the same thing as the marginal pro-\nductivity of capital. The latter also depends on the replacement cost of capital-\ngoods. This is likely to rise with increasing rate of investment, thereby tending\nto lower the marginal productivity of capital. On balance, therefore, an increase\nin the rate of investment is more likely to lower than to raise the marginal\nproductivity of capital, although the latter is not impossible.! Another factor\naffecting the marginal productivity of capital is the degree of utilisation of\nexisting equipment. For one of the most significant differences between the\nproductive factors: capital and labour is that the former must be hired for a\nmuch longer period than the latter. Labour can usually be dismissed at a\nweek's notice, but equipment, when once bought or constructed, remains on\nthe hands of the entrepreneur who will have to pay interest on the capital\ninvested irrespective of whether and to what extent he makes use of it. It may\nbe argued that this consideration enters the determination of the marginal\nproductivity of already existing equipment only, and not at all that of new\n\n1 But even that would not lead to instability, because the risk of investment is likely to rise\nfaster than the marginal productivity of capital, so that even with a fixed rate of interest there\nwould always be a stable equilibrium level of investment at which the difference between the\n\nmarginal productivity of capital and the money rate of interest is exactly equal to the cost of\nbearing the risk of that rate of investment.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:46:34 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The way in which these two rates are compounded is given by the\nformula\n(1--i5) \u2014 (1--m) (1-Fia),\nor approximately by\niym --1a.\n\nHence, What we customarily call the market or money vate of interest on fixed-\ninterest-bearing securities (im) $s the difference between the veal vate om securities\n(iv) and the veal rate on money (ia). It is the additional attraction of securities\nnecessary to induce people to bear the risk and. illiquidity of holding them instead\nof money and can, therefore, be vegarded as the veward thereof. This shows the\nmistake of the classical economists who thought of the market rate of interest\nas composed of the reward for abstinence and the reward for risk-bearing.\nThat indeed is true of the real rate on securities, but the market rate is always\nthat part of the real rate which is the reward for risk- and illiquidity-bearing\nonly.\n\nThis argument does not necessarily imply that the proportion people\nsave out of their income depends only on expected changes in the value of\nmoney and not at all on market rates of interest. For it is in the nature of risk-\nand illiquidity-bearing that they cannot be separated from abstinence, in the\nsame way as butter cannot (with any propriety) be eaten without bread. Thus,\nwhen higher market rates make risk-bearing more attractive, not only will\npeople try to keep a greater proportion of their already accumulated wealth in\nsecurities, they may also be induced to save more out of their income. But it is\nimportant to realise that the relationship between the market rate of interest\nand the rate of saving is comparable to that between the price of butter and the\ndemand for bread, and not to that between the price of, and demand for, the\nsame commodity. The indirect nature of this relationship explains its looseness,\nand it seems to me that it also provides a satisfactory explanation of the\ninsensitivity of the rate of saving to shori-rwn changes in the market rate of\ninterest.\n\nAfter this digression we can proceed to the analysis of the effects of price-\nchanges on the market rate of interest on shares. We define the market rate\non a share as the ratio of its expected dividend payments to its market value.\nSince dividend payments are likely to move together with the general level of\nprices, the store (or stream) of future purchasing power represented by the\nstock of shares will remain approximately unchanged when a general price-fall\n(price-rise) increases (diminishes) the store of purchasing power represented by\nmoney and fixed-interest-bearing securities. As this is equivalent to a diminu-\ntion (increase) in the quantity of shares relatively to that of money and fixed-\ninterest-bearing securities, it will lead to a fall (rise) in the market rate on\nshares in exactly the same way as a diminution in the supply of a consumers'\ngood leads to a rise in its price.!\n\nThus far we have computed the market rate on shares on the implicit\nassumption that the change in prices is regarded as permanent and non-\n\n! We have seen above that the fall in prices also lowers the market rate on fixed-interest-\nbearing securities, but\u2014as a comparison of the two arguments will show\u2014always to a lesser extent.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:46:34 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

But\nin a modern industrial community the value of net investment made during\nthe short period is an insignificant and negligible fraction of the total stock of\nequipment already in existence, and its influence on the average level of interest\nrates can, therefore, be neglected. In the long run, of course, the quantity of\nsecurities will increase absolutely and\u2014what is more important\u2014relatively to\nthe constant quantity of money, causing market rates of interest to fall. But\nwe emphasise once more that owing to the relative smallness of the volume of\nnew investment per short period this is a secular phenomenon and can be\nneglected in short-run arguments.\n\nSo far we have assumed a constant level of employment. This was\nnecessary because given the total quantity of money, the higher is the level of\nemployment, the higher will be the demand for money for transaction purposes\nand the less money will be left available for investment.? Hence, a rise in\nemployment has the same effect as a diminution of the quantity of money :\nboth raise market rates of interest. Another factor which may cause changes in\ninterest rates is a change in the purchasing power of money. A fall in the\ngeneral price-level means an increase in the store of purchasing power repre-\nsented by the fixed quantity of money, but it also means a proportionate\nincrease in the store of future income represented by the stock of securities that\npromise the future payment of predetermined sums of money. There is no\nspecial reason why people should continue to hold money and fixed-interest-\nbearing securities in the same proportions\u2014or rather that they should be\ninduced to hold them in the same proportions by the same structure of interest\nrates when the real value of their total stock of wealth has increased. Neverthe-\nless, a proportional increase in the quantities of purchasing power represented\nby money and fixed-interest-bearing securities would be unlikely to affect\ninterest rates significantly. The fall in the price-level, however, diminishes the\ntransaction demand for money and, setting free a greater proportion for\npurposes of investment, will cause a slight fall in interest rates.\n\nBefore proceeding to the discussion of the influence of price-changes on\nthe market rate on shares, it may be worth our while to make a short digression\nand to inquire into the exact nature of the market rate on fixed-interest-\nbearing securities. In the first part of this article we have seen that under a\nsystem where money is the only form in which purchasing power can be stored\nthe appreciation of money is the '' reward for abstinence.\" When money and\nsecurities exist side by side as alternative forms of holding purchasing power,\nthe real rate of interest on holding money will still be its rate of appreciation,\nwhile the real rate of interest on a fixed-interest-bearing security will be\ncompounded of its market rate (determined by the relation of the security's\nmarket value and its promised future money payments) and the rate of apprecia-\ntion of money over its life-time. This is due to the fact that the fate of fixed-\ninterest-bearing securities is tied up with that of money : representing definite\n\n! Taking six months as our short-period, the ratio that the value of new investment bears to\nthe value of already extant equipment is probably of the order of magnitude of 1-2 per cent.\nCf. S.

Hitherto we have assumed that the quantity of\nmoney, the sole medium in which value can be stored, is fixed. This assumption\nwill be retained throughout this article, but we now introduce other, alternative\nmedia of storing and holding wealth: securities. These are imperfect substi-\ntutes for money because they involve risk and (potential) illiquidity. To\ncounteract this relative disadvantage and to induce people to hold them in\nspite of this deficiency, their prices must always be lower than that of money,\nin other words they must earn a positive rate of interest in terms of money.\nWe distinguish between securities that promise the future payment of definite\nsums of money (fixed-interest-bearing securities) and those that promise\nindefinite payments (shares). With the now fashionable policy of dividend\nstabilisation there is little difference between the two as long as prices are\nstable or show only temporary fluctuations, but fundamental differences arise\nwhen there is a permanent shift in prices. Accordingly we shall treat them\ntogether first, and separately when we come to the consideration of the effects\nof price-changes.\n\nIndividuals form (subjective) judgments of the risk and illiquidity\nembodied in different securities and have a certain preference for safety and\nliquidity. Given these judgments and preferences, each individual will\u2014when\nconfronted with the system of market rates of interest\u2014choose a definite\ncombination of different securities and money in which to hold his wealth.\nThe parallelism between the individual's behaviour in the securities market and\nin the market where he buys consumers' goods is complete. There the consumer,\nfacing market prices which to him are given, aims at spending his income on\ndifferent goods in a way that will maximise his total satisfaction. Here the\ninvestor, facing market rates of interest, aims at investing his stock of wealth\nin different securities and in money so that they should yield him the maximum\nfuture income compatible with his limited willingness to bear risk and\nilliquidity.\n\nFrom the point of view of the community as a whole it is the quantities of\nsecurities and of money that are given, and they, together with the given\njudgments and preferences of investors, determine the market rates of interest\nin the short period.!\n\nThe greater is the quantity of any particular kind of security the higher will\nbe its market rate of interest since, given their tastes and judgments, people\nneed an ever-stronger inducement to increase their holdings of any one type of\nsecurity.

In the following we shall only be concerned with the average or\ngeneral level of market rates; the determination and interdependence of\ninterest rates on different kinds of securities has been discussed in detail in my\n\" A Study of Interest and Capital\"?

Each existing\ncommodity is given its right to exist by the mere fact of its being profitable to\nproduce it. But when we start from a position where there is an excess of price\nover marginal cost in the related industries, the social cost of producing a\nparticular article is no longer represented by its marginal cost curve. We have\nto mark up the marginal cost curve, in the manner described in the last section ;\nso that it becomes possible for production to be profitable when the social\nsurplus accruing from production of the article is negative. The social surplus\n\u2014 consumers' surplus J- producers' surplus \u2014 loss of potential surplus on other\ncommodities ; this may well be negative, when producers' surplus is positive.\n\nThis is the possibility which has been uncovered by the modern theories\nof Imperfect Competition ; it is in fact the correct and general statement of\nthe possibility of loss due to Imperfect Competition. In order to compress it\ninto the marginal analysis, all the writers on the subject have made simplifica-\ntions which are unwarrantable, and to some extent misleading. The different\nproducts of the different firms in an imperfectly competitive industry do\ngenerate consumers' surpluses, by the mere fact that they are different. To\nemphasise the differences between the products for the purpose of getting a\ndownward sloping demand curve for the individual firm, and then to neglect\nthe differences between the products (irrational preferences !) for the purpose\nof neglecting the consumers' surplus, is both inconsistent and practically\ndangerous. To neglect the producers! surplus for the purpose of equating\nprice with average cost imports quite unnecessary difficulties into the theory.\nThese two simplifications together have been responsible for the quite incorrect\nidea that the number of firms in an industry ought always to be reduced when\nan industry is imperfectly competitive\u2014an idea which we should at once\nrecognise as absurd if we were not bemused by diagrams, and whose practical\nrealisation could only lead to universal monopoly. One may remark, in paren-\nthesis, that it is particularly absurd when it is applied (as it often is) to the\nproblems of retail trade ; in retail trade both the consumers' surpluses (due to\neconomy of shopping time) and the producers' surpluses (economy of living at\none's work) which are derived from multiplicity of shops are abnormally large,\nso that the technical advantages of a concentration policy have to be abnormally\nlarge if there is to be a case for it.\n\nAnd so one might go on. But enough has perhaps been said to show that\nConsumers' Surplus is not a mere economic plaything, a curioswm. It is the\nfoundation of an important branch of economics, a branch cultivated with\nsuperb success by Marshall, Edgeworth and Pigou, shockingly neglected in the\nlast twenty years, but urgently needing reconstruction on a broader basis.\nBeyond all doubt it is still capable of much further development ; if economists\nare to play their part in shaping the canons of economic policy fit for a new age,\nthey will have to build on the foundation of Consumers' Surplus.\n\nManchester.

If the\nrate of toll is not sufficient to pay for the cost of the bridge, how much is it\nworth paying to supplement the toll? The answer depends on the source from\nwhich the supplement is to come. If it comes from the consumers by a poll\ntax on them, it will be worth their while to pay the tax so long as it does not\nexceed M A,. On the other hand, if the supplement is financed from national\nfunds (to which the consumers' contribution is supposed not to be significantly\naffected by the extra expenditure) then the gain to the consumers will exceed\nthe cost so long as the supplement does not exceed PR.!\n\nTaking the most common application of the concept, the comparison\nbetween direct and indirect taxation, the consumer would prefer a direct tax\nof any amount less than 44, (Fig. II) (even though greater than CD) rather\nthan an indirect tax which would raise the price from P, to P,, or, alternatively,\nhe would gain from any increase in direct taxation of less than 4 4, if it were\ncoupled with the removal of indirect taxation lowering the price from P, to P,.?\n\nIt will thus be seen that, in at any rate most of the cases where we are in\nthe habit of using the concept of consumer's surplus, it is the compensating\nvariation which interests us, so that Hicks' restatement does not quite go far\nenough\u2014though the Marshallian consumer's surplus is a concept which, within\na more restricted field, may still remain a useful tool.\n\n6. The solution here suggested is that there are four alternative expressions\nof the consumer's surplus from which we have to choose one in each particular\ncase according to the problem with which we are dealing. This solution certainly\nhas the disadvantage of introducing complexity into a field where it is of\nsingularly little practical importance, since we shall normally expect the four\nresults to lie so close together that it would not matter which we chose and, in\nany case, when we use the concept we do so without making any pretensions\nto accuracy of measurement. This further refinement of the concept is only\nput forward here in the belief that the attainment of precise logical accuracy\nhas some small value for its own sake and that occasionally it may indirectly\nconduce to some other results with some practical importance.\n\n1 [t was necessary to assume that a toll would be charged if the bridge is built, since otherwise\nthe consumption is likely to be independent of income so that the two interpretations of con-\nsumer's surplus coincide.\n\n? Hence the familiar proposition that the cost of indirect taxation to the consumer must\nexceed the revenue to the state (unless supply price is rising sufficiently fast) can be proved. The\nrevenue to the state, if the price net of indirect taxation remains constant, is BK which is necess-\narily smaller than 4 4, and 44, but may be greater than CD.\n\nEdinburgh. A.

Although the control\nwas not very efficient, the registration of property, when it was completed, pre-\nvented any further capital flight. Again, it was patent to all that the alterna-\ntives to the levy were few, and probably even more undesirable. It would have\nbeen manifestly unfair to repudiate the bank-note debts. On the other hand\nneither internal credit conditions northe stateof theinternational capital market\ngaveany hope of raisingloans for funding or conversion. Nor wasthereany pros-\npect of improving the tax yield by other measures. The tax system inherited\nfrom the Dual Monarchy was in any case a very poor one, and the fiscal\nadministrations were completely disorganised. Such new taxes as could be\nimposed and collected were at least as unsatisfactory as the levy.!\n\nRecords, so far as available, do not indicate conspicuous administrative\ndifficulties in valuation and collection. All three states had previous experience\nof property taxation, and the relatively simple structure of wealth simplified\nthe valuation problem. Capital assets, such as securities, deposits, life insurance\npolices, proprietary rights and intangible property in general, accounted for a\nvery small part of total wealth. It was the valuation of land holdings of\nperpetual corporations, ecclesiastical foundations, etc., which caused the worst\ndifficulties. It seems that there were no unusual delays in valuation and assess-\nment. Delay was mainly in collection, which was hampered by the rapid changes\nin money values. In Czechoslovakia there are good reasons to believe that both\nthe unexpected delay over the innumerable instalment payments and the low\nproportion of total collection were almost entirely due to general economic\nconditions and to the fluctuations in the value of money, and not to the negli-\ngence of the administration. There is no reason to doubt the competence and\nfairness of the Czech administration in the use of their discretionary powers,\nthough some discrimination in favour of Czech nationals cannot be excluded\naltogether. It must always be remembered however that compared with Great\nBritain, Continental fiscal administration meant and still means, '' a lower level\nof equity, yield and efficiency.\"\n\nPost-war failure did not prove sufficiently discouraging to prevent the\nreimposition of a capital levy in recent years. War and rearmament created a\nnew state of national emergency, new extraordinary requirements and a new\ncry for shifting the burden onto the wealthy. It is noticeable that at least two\ncountries (Hungary and Italy) where post-war levies failed, have not resisted\nthe attractions of a more successful '' repetition.\" This is not surprising in an\nage of increasing state omnipotence, refined state intervention and highly\nefficient state control. The differences in the type and conditions of these\nrecent levies make however separate consideration necessary.\n\nManchester. L. Rosras.\n\n! A conspicuous example was the coal tax in Czechoslovakia, an ad valorem tax of 42.89, on\nthe price of coal, which badly hampered industrial activity. Income tax was of little use because\nit was still imposed on the different sources of income, and not on the global income of the tax-\npayer. In the event, apart from the levy, most reliance had to be placed on turnover and sales\ntaxes in all three states.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:53:33 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

As this\npaper is already rather long, I propose to confine myself to pointing out certain\nconflicts between the financial interests of Local Authorities and their duties\nto improve the housing of their areas, which are suggested by our earlier\nanalysis.\n\nAs owners of houses Local Authorities have a direct interest in high rents,\nbut as recipients of rates they are indifferent to whether the high rents are due\nto the discouragement of building by the rates, or to some other cause.! In this\nthey differ from private house-owners who only benefit from high rents due to\nthe limitation of building by the rates, if the excess rent more than compensates\nfor the fact that the incidence of the rates is on them. It seems then that when\nthe Local Authorities are competing as house-owners with private owners they\nhave an incentive to limit the volume of new building by the imposition of\nrates. It does not follow that Local Authorities do in fact pursue this policy,\nbut if they were to behave as profit-making bodies they might very well take\nadvantage of the opportunity afforded them.\n\nIn the case of subsidies on new houses Local Authorities appear to be in\nthe same position of natural opposition as other owners of existing houses, a\nfortiori i any part of the subsidy comes out of the rates.\n\nSome alleviation of the apparent conflict between the financial interest of\na Local Authority and its duty as housing authority, may be found in the\npossibility that an increase in the number of houses may increase the rateable\nvalue of its area. An increase in total rateable value does not necessarilly\nfollow, however, from an increase in the supply of new houses. The increased\nnumber of new houses may be partly offset by demolitions of old houses and\nthis may result in a loss of rateable value if, for example, the site is used for\nsome building not liable to rates; on the other hand admittedly the new\nbuilding may have a higher rateable value than the demolished house had.\nApart from demolition, however, an increased supply of new houses will have a\ntendency to lower rents and thus rateable values of old houses, since rateable\nvalues are proportionate to rents.\n\nIt would take us to far afield to discuss the full implications of the\npoints raised here, and we must also ignore the problems which arise if Local\nAuthorities happen to be monopolists in any particular house market. It must\nbe sufficient to conclude by suggesting that the whole question of the suitability\nof the authority which receives the rates to be the housing authority requires\nexamination.\n\nDundee. MantAN BOWLEY.\n\n!'The fact that in general the incidence of the rates is on the Local Authorities with respect\nto their own houses does not of course constitute a disadvantage, it merely involves a book-keeping\ntransaction.

On the contrary, the expectation\nof income is greater, in the face of uncertainty, under a flexible than under a\nrigid plan. What happens is that one contingent income (that corresponding to\nthe \" most likely \" course of markets) is reduced to raise other contingent\nincomes (those corresponding to more and to less favourable states of markets) ;\nand if the latter have a high probability relative to the former the value of the\nwhole set of contingencies rises. Refusal to strive for flexibility is not the mark\nof a business man who is '' neutral towards risk,\" but of one who positively\nrelishes danger\u2014of a '' plunger.\"!\n\n4. Applied to the theory of investment, the principle of flexibility is in the\nfirst instance a guide to qualitative elements of investment. A family which\nknows it will live in a house for a generation can afford to build a house very\nspecifically adapted to its peculiarities ; but if the family is uncertain of\ncontinued residence in the town, a less specialised house (with lower rental\nvalue to the family) will be worth a larger capital outlay. In general, uncer-\ntainty points toward less specialised equipment, even at the expense of having\nhigher operating costs if things go as thought \"' most likely \" ; certainty points\ntoward fuller specialisation.\n\nFor a particular firm, a diminution of uncertainty (decreased dispersion of\nanticipations) calls for increase of specialised as against unspecialised equipment.\nIt does not necessarily call for net investment on the part of that firm, inasmuch\nas resources will be released from holdings of unspecialised assets. But for the\neconomy it calls for net investment, since it involves a qualitative shift in\ndemand. Some of the assets released, moreover, are apt to be monetary : i.e.\nthe firm's valuations of physical goods of specialised character will rise relative\nto valuations of money, which favours net investment for the economy.\n\n5. The theory of investment thus involves the dispersion as well as the\nmean value of market anticipations. Dr. Shackle's model offers us no measure\nof dispersion except the range of the '' likely \" class of contingencies. But if the\nbusiness man's habit \"splitting the difference \" is evidence, the degree of\nprobability attributed to values toward the middle of the range is higher than\nthat attributed to extreme values. If this is the case, the choice of the boundary\nbetween '' likely \"\" and '' surprising \" contingencies is arbitrary, and the range\ndinal probability estimatesas the standard assumption in anticipations analysis.\nuseless asa measure of dispersion.

An increase in liquidity preference is an increase in the\ndemand for cash in terms of securities, i.e. a decrease in the demand for\nsecurities in terms of money. The demand function for commodities in terms\nof money, which is classified under the headings of the propensity to consume\nand to invest (the latter being determined by the equality of the marginal\nefficiency of investment and of the rate of interest) is assumed to remain\nunaltered. Thus the demand for commodities is thought to be neutral toward\nshifts in the demand for securities. An increase in liquidity preference results\ndirectly only in a rise of the rate of interest (i.e. a fall of security prices). The\ndemand for commodities is affected only indirectly via the rate of interest.\nSince commodities and securities are substitutes the rise of the rate of interest\n(i.e. fall of security prices) diminishes the demand for commodities and causes\na fall of commodity prices or (if factor prices are rigid) of employment.\n\nThere seems, however, good reason to believe that the demand for com-\nmodities is sympathetic toward shifts in the demand for securities. Since cash\nbalances can be increased at the expense of commodities as well as at the\nexpense of securities a desire to hold more cash may be expected normally\nto lead to a substitution of cash for both securities and commodities. Thus the\nfunctions of the propensity to consume and to invest appear to have common\nparameters with the liquidity preference function and cannot be supposed to\nremain unaltered when the latter changes. In consequence an increase in\nliquidity preference affects commodity prices and/or employment not only\nindirectly via a rise in the rate of interest, but also directly through a down-\nward shift of the demand function for commodities. The recognition of the\nfact that the demand for commodities is sympathetic toward shifts in the\ndemand for securities enables us to bridge the gap between the '' classical \"'\nand the Keynesian doctrine concerning the effects of changes in the desire to\nhold cash.\n\nChicago.

To say that\npork and beans are sympathetic must mean that in our experience, changes in\npreference increasing or decreasing the demands for both pork and beans are\ncommoner than changes affecting either singly, or affecting them in opposite\ndirections. This is only partly a question of the relation between the com-\nmodities ; it is also a question of the sorts of changes in preferences we have to\ndeal with.\n\nSeasonal influences would be an obvious cause of \"sympathy\" in\nDr. Lange's sense ; politics (war and peace) might be another; the cyclical\napplication made in the latter part of his note seems to me more doubtful. To\nsay that the rate of interest tends to rise when prices rise because commodities\nand securities are ''antagonistic\" tells us nothing useful about the causal\nprocesses involved. And in any case it will not serve to resolve the dilemma.\nSuppose, as I was supposing (Value and Cafital, p. 276) that there is an\nincreased demand for a particular commodity in terms of money. This implies\na change in the scales of preference of a particular section ; as usual, it is\nnecessary to assume that the preferences of other people remain unchanged if\nwe are to deduce an \"economic law.\" But the increased borrowing, which\nraises the rate of interest, does surely come from other people, not from the\npeople who made the initial disturbance. ' Antagonism \" will not explain it.\n\nI did try to offer an explanation (pp. 276-9); it may be wrong, but\nDr. Lange has not shown why he rejects it. In a dynamic problem, so I should\nSay, we must consider the dependence of people's conduct, not only upon\ncurrent prices, but upon price-expectations also; if these expectations were\nto be unaltered by the change in current prices, then I think it is plausible to\nclaim that a rise in the demand for commodities in terms of money would tend\nto lower the rate of interest, as strict theory would indicate. The observed fact\nthat prices and interest rates so frequently move in the same direction is to be\nexplained, in my view, by assuming that there is a strong tendency for price-\nexpectations to be shifted in the same direction when there is a change in\ncurrent prices ; this hypothesis is obviously plausible, and seems to account for\na wide range of observed phenomena. While it is no doubt capable of more\nrealistic elaboration than I gave it, I do claim that it uncovers something of the\ncasual connection involved, and therefore takes us much further than we can\npossibly be taken by an empirical classification.\n\nManchester.

For it is a commonplace in international economic theory that wage\ncuts in any country encourage capital imports and commodity exports, while\ndiscouraging capital exports and commodity imports. The effect on the balance\nof payments is a favourable one, the effect of wage cuts may be to put the cut-\nting country in a position to hoard without danger to its income and employ-\nment level. Moreover, Mr. Keynes to the contrary notwithstanding, cuts in\nmoney wages lead to declining real wages as well\u2014if any foreign goods are\nconsumed by working men, if Mr. Keynes' '\" wage goods \"' are not exclusively\ndomestic.\n\nThis argument does not, in the writer's opinion, detract seriously from the\nreliability of Mr. Keynes' practical conclusions for wage policy. Any cut in\nwages initiated in country A4 may spread to all competing countries, and leave\nno competitor better off than before as regards its balance of payments. In\npractice, there may well be two groups of net losers. At one extreme will be\ncountries such as Great Britain, in which strong trade union organisation\nprevents or retards wage cuts, and at the other countries such as \u00cdndia and\nChina, in which bald biology will probably prevent any substantial decrease in\nreal wages. No country is apt to be a large net gainer unless her income\nelasticity of demand for imports is low, and her relative price elasticity of\ndemand for imports! high, while foreign income and relative price elasticities\nare higher and lower, respectively. On the supply side, a relatively high\nelasticity of substitution of labour for capital would also tend to increase her\nnet gain. The writer does not believe that any of these conditions apply in\nmarked degree to any of the major free-enterprise economies to-day. For all\npractical purposes, then, we may say that in no case will any free country A\ngain greatly by inaugurating or following a policy of competitive wage cutting.\nWhereas, on the other hand, a programme of monetary expansion in country A\nwhich is aimed at increasing employment rather than domestic prices, and which\nis kept from raising the prices of foreign currency by monetary authorities,\nneed inspire no retaliatory measures whatever, and lead to no long-run reper-\ncussions undoing its original beneficent effects.\n\nChicago, Illinois.

But when he says that he made '' insufficient allowance for\n\n1]f an individual's expectations are abnormally high, it may of course be a reason for his\nnot hedging.\n\n? Technical uncertainties would, however, be hedgeable, where fluctuations in an individual's\ncrop were closely associated with fluctuations in the total crop coming to the market. The hedging\nwould be either by sales, or by purchases, of futures, according as the market demand function\nwere elastic or inelastic. If there were no correlation between changes in the individual and the\ntotal crop, futures sales would be better than no hedge; though where fluctuations in the size\nof the crop were great, the unhedgeable risks would be large relative to the hedgeable price risks.\n\n?* Kaldor, p. 197 above, footnote 3.

Such a condition of the market tends to evoke sales\nof spot supplies, till the fall in the spot price restores the normal condition in\nwhich every forward price provides a sufficient premium to cover carrying\ncosts. But this process may be interrupted by a shortage of spot supplies. That\nreally means that traders' stocks cannot be further reduced except at the cost\nof some loss of convenience. The inconvenience may take the form of a lower\nminimum holding, involving a greater risk of the trader's operations being\ninterrupted by an exhaustion of his stock, but is more likely to be the incon-\nvenience of smaller and more frequent purchases for replenishment. The higher\nspot price has the same effect as a rise in the short-term rate of interest on those\ntraders who hold goods with borrowed money.\n\nIt iswhen thisshortage of spot supplies becomes severe enough to outweigh\nthe entire carrying cost that a \"backwardation,\" or excess of the spot price\nover the forward price, appears. Such temporary scarcities are, of course, not\nuncommon. The scarcity must be '' temporary,\" for it is only the prospect of\nbetter supplies that justifies either the lower future price or the present release\nof goods from stock. But it need not be a fAysical scarcity at all; a scarcity\nof spot supplies may arise merely because the forward sales by which the\nholders have covered the available stocks are not maturing in sufficient amounts\nto release the supplies required for use. An inducement is needed for the\nholders to undo their forward sales by forward purchases and meet the\ndemand for spot sales.\n\nMr. Kaldor, while recognising the objections to the ''expected price,\"\ncontinues to employ it. He says that '' for certain problems in the theory of\nspeculation \" the concept of '\" representative expectation \" is a legitimate\nsimplification. The representative expectation is that which ''if held by all\nindividuals participating in the market, would lead to the establishment of\nthe same current price as that actually reached.\" But surely if all held the same\nexpectations there would be no speculation. The professional dealers would\nconfine themselves to satisfying the requirements of the hedging traders and\nmaking their profit out of the turn of the market.\n\nNor is the hypothesis of a representative expectation complete unless it is\nsupplemented by a hypothesis as to people's views of the probability of the\nexpectation being fulfilled. If all hedging traders are supposed to have expecta-\ntions, they are all potential speculators, and they will be more likely to abstain\nfrom incurring some probable loss on hedging if they are very confident that\nthe expected price will be realised.\n\nIn fact, the introduction of the expected price in any form, far from being\na simplification, is an additional complication.\n\nLondon.

According to our hypothesis, if he continues\nto operate the old machine now for the rest of its accounting life, i.ee. for the next a years, he\nwill receive a series of greater-than-abandonment rents.

MARX 135\n\nabove-noted differences between Keynes and Marx with respect to the depend-\nence of the marginal efficiency of capital on the rate of real wages and on the\npropensity to consume. Dobb maintains! that neither the state nor the banking\nsystem could be depended upon to bring about a distribution of income contrary\nto the interest of the capitalist class as a whole. Thus this difference of opinion\nis reduced to a problem of the practical feasibility of a zero rate of interest in a\ncapitalist system.? I think it is more than this. It is a disagreement on the\nfundamental working of the economic system, the Marxian view being that a\nsystem motivated by profit will not function well, as profit goes toward zero.\nThis remains a question of theory, however great its practical importance.\nThe line between a theoretical and a practical question is limited only by the\nlimits of the theoretical framework.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFrom the general Marxian framework, criticism of Mr. Keynes' system\nwould fall under two headings: (r) Mr. Keynes fails to recognise a law of\ncapitalist development, i.e. his system regards human institutions as data,\nchanging independently, and hence he fails to recognise that the limitations on\nproduction are imposed by the capitalist mode of production :/self. (2)\nMr. Keynes' fundamental relationships, as represented in his schedules are not\nindependent of each other nor even of the values of the variables they relate.\nAnalytically this means, for example, that even with the slope of the liquidity\npreference schedule given as negative, we cannot then say that an increase in\nthe quantity of money will lower the rate of interest. We must first find the\neffects on the other variables in the system. Pragmatically, it means that these\nschedules may be altered by the alteration of property and income relationships,\nalthough, say the Marxists, to do so would be to transform the capitalist system.\n\nCambridge, Mass. S. S. ALEXANDER.\n\nlop. cit., p. 110. He also refers to Harrod's view that the banking system may be unable to\n'' influence appropriately \"' the long term rate of interest.\n\n? Of course there is another solution which solves the riddle in a most direct way. The solution\nis to convert that portion of the total surplus value which is not consumed by the capitalists nor\nused for replacement, into articles which the state finds desirable and which are capable neither\nof glutting the market, nor of increasing the amount of capital. Armaments may be considered\nthe archetype of this form of commodity. The state may acquire these commodities either by a\ndirect requisition in the form of taxation or by purchase through funds obtained by inducing the\ncapitalists to convert their unconsumed surplus-value into money-capital (interest-bearing\ncertificates of indebtedness of the state). This inducement may be facilitated by obstructions to\nor prohibitions of conversion of the surplus value into other forms of capital. This seems to have\nbeen the policy of the Nazi state. The essential background of the solution is a transformation\nfrom a dynamic into a static state, or a state dynamic only with regard to the accumulation of\nmoney-capital. It is a divorce of the profit motive from the accumulation of capital goods. It is\nin a very real sense, therefore, that the totalitarian state may be said to '' preserve capitalism.\"\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 13:12:02 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Conclusion\n\nThis concludes our analysis of the connections between the various sets of stability\nconditions. It was stated in the Introduction that the restriction to equal speeds of adjust-\nment k; would be relaxed later. This is easily done. Observe that the matrix M, defined\nby mi \u2014 ki ai, may be written in matrix notation as\n\nM \u2014 KA (18)\nwhere Kisdiag(k k,, . . . .. ; kw), and the Kk; are all positive. Now if any stable matrix\nA, upon multiplication by a diagonal matrix D, in turn gives a stable matrix if and only\nif all the diagonal elements of D are positive, then 4 is said, by Arrow and McManus\n(1958) to be D-stable. In economic terms, if 4 is D-stable, then if it is stable in the ordinary\nsense it will be stable for any (positive) set of speeds of adjustment (and only for a positive\nset). Now if A is Metzlerian (Enthoven and Arrow, 1956), or quasi-negative definite\n(Arrow and McManus, 1958), or has a quasi-dominant main diagonal (Theorem 13 of\nthis paper), it will be D-stable. Since these are the main stability conditions so far\ndiscovered (though C5a is not strictly a' stability condition), the restriction to identical\nspeeds of adjustment is seen to be of no great consequence:\n\nIf we are concerned with invariance of stability under transformation of num\u00e9raire\n(on the subject of general transformations see McManus, 1958), then each one of the\nn(m x m) matrices A that can be formed from the 5 excess demand functions will have\nto be stable if equilibrium is to be stable. This has already been discussed in connection\nwith C5a and C5b.\n\nThere remain a few open questions on the relation of the various stability conditions\nto each other. Two such problems will be discussed here. Does C3 imply C7 for a general\nmatrix 4 ? If A is Metzlerian, then the corollary to Theorem 16 says that the answer is\nyes, while it may be shown that if m is equal to 2, the answer is also yes. A further question,\nrelated to this, is whether, given that 4 is symmetric, C7 E Cl (as C2 E C1). Both prob-\nlems apparently turn upon whether, given that a matrix is symmetric and stable, there\nalways exists a positive vector /i satisfying C7, a proposition which seems extremely unlikely.?\n\nKingston, Jamaica. P. K. NEWMAN.\n\n! One application of this result is to the model of equilibrium in imperfect competition constructed\nby Smithies (1942) in a remarkable and unjustifiably neglected paper. If it is assumed that the cost functions\nare linear (not quadratic, as in the original model) then it may be shown that C7 is a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for stability in his model. This condition would be satisfied if the expected influence of a pro-\nducer's own price on his sales is greater than the sum of the expected influences of his rivals! prices, which\nis a condition mentioned by Smithies (1942, p.259).\n\n? Since this paper was written, Professor Arrow has sent me a numerical example confirming that\nsuch a positive vector does not always exist. Generalising this example a little, consider the matrix\n\n\u20141 a a\nG4 \u20141 \u2014a jr where$ \u00ab a \u2014\u00ab l1. This matrix is symmetrical and Hicksian, and hence stable ; but\na \u2014a \u20141\n\nit is easy to check that one cannot find a positive vector (/,, /, 43) such that C7 is satisfied.\n\nHahn's Theorem (14) has recently been independently proved by Takashi Negishi (Economerrica,\nJuly 1958), while yet another proof is due to Arrow and Hurwicz, in the October issue 1958 of the same\njournal, Essentially this theorem states that, if 4 is Mezlerian, then Hicksian imperfect stability (see foot-\nnote 1, page 4) is a sufficient condition for dynamic stability. \u2014 Metzler's original theorem (7) proved that\nHicksian perfect stability is necessary and sufficient for dynamic stability if 4 is Metzlerian. These results\ngive an easy alternative proof of Theorem 16, since if 4 obeys C5a, then stability implies '* perfect \" stability,\nwhich in turn implies imperfect stability. It follows that the equilibrium price vector satisfies the require-\nments of the vector / in C7, so C7 is necessary as well as sufficient, which is Theorem 16.\n\nAnother development since this paper was written is an article by M. E. Fisher and A. T. Fuller (Proc.\nCamb. Phil. Soc., 54, Part 4, October 1958) on the mathematics of such linear systems. Using their remark-\nable Theorem 1, it is easy to show that if 4 is Hicksian, then we can always find a positive diagonal matrix\nD such that the product matrix DA has all its roots real, distinct and negative, and so is stable.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.:ffff:ffff:ffff on Thu, 01 Jan 1976 12:34:56 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

A temporary\nblocage is another matter, but this is not generally an appropriate alternative.\n\nOf course, a satisfactory answer to this question can only be given for each individual\ncase after a detailed examination of its administration, methods of valuation and guesses\nabout the likely affects of the alternatives. All that is suggested here is that a general case\nagainst the levy on equity grounds, is, in the circumstance of the post-war levies in Western\nEurope, difficult to substantiate. Certainly there do not appear to be any a priori grounds\nfor preferring the alternative to the levies.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nPost war capital levies have been operated in many countries without giving rise to\nmajor difficulties, and in a number of instances they have been productive of substantial\nrevenues. Their success from these standpoints was greater than anyone would reason-\nably have expected on the basis of earlier experience with this form of taxation.  Amongst\nthe factors which go to explain this success, the monetary reforms and the existence of\neffective systems of exchange control must be assigned a high place.\n\nTo evaluate the economic usefulness of these levies is another matter and it is not an\neasy task. Each of the anti-inflationary levies made a substantial contribution to the\nreduction in liquidity desired by the authorities, but their effects from this standpoint were\nrapidly offset by the monetary or budgetary policies which were simultaneously being\npursued. This result emphasises the need to accompany an anti-inflationary levy with a\nrestrictive credit policy if the levy is to be effective. A capital levy is unlikely to be an\nadequate substitute for a restrictive credit policy where excess liquidity exists, although\nit is sometimes regarded in this light. It is perhaps best to look at it, at least initially, as a\nmeans of reducing the burden of such a policy. The main merit of the other levies rests\non their ability to combine the fixed assessment basis of the levy with a capacity to restrict\neffective demand. In the case of Finland's Second Capital Levy the value of the tax\nas an instrument for facilitating a substantial redistribution of real capital was also\nimportant.\n\nEvidently a full evaluation of these levies requires that they should be compared with\nthe alternative instruments available for achieving the same ends from the threefold\nstandpoints of administration, economic effects and equity. This article does not pretend\nto provide the material for making such a general judgement. It does seem justifiable\nto conclude however that if these devices are evaluated not against any ideal alternative,\nbut rather against the alternatives practically available, then a number of the levies must\nbe conceded to have considerable merit. In a sense though, any general justification for\nthese levies has to rest on distributional grounds, although in some instances questions of\nincentive may also be relevant. This is because in most cases the alternative devices\navailable do not appear to be demonstrably inferior to the levy whether they are con-\nsidered from the standpoint of administration or from the standpoint of their effects on\nthe level of effective demand.\n\nBelfast.

It remains to enquire whether there are any grounds of public advantage for pre-\nferring any one of the three methods of encouraging investment to any other. It is some-\ntimes suggested that investment allowances are wrong in principle because they involve a\nsubsidy on investment ; but they do this no more and no less than equivalent initial allow-\nances of cheap credit facilities. Investment allowances have the advantage of arith-\nmetic simplicity, and that their value is independent of subjective interest rates ; these\nshould not be valued too highly, however, since any comparison of investment allowances\nwith either of the other two methods involves doing the sums for both. It has sometimes\nbeen suggested that investment allowances are the best method of the three because they\ndiscriminate in favour of firms which are growing fast ; but there is no reason to believe\nthis. If a rapid rate of expansion leaves a firm short of ready money, and this is reflected\nin a high value of r relative to the average firm, then if the rates of initial and investment\nallowances are fixed so as to make them equivalent for the average firm, it is initial allow-\nances which discriminate in favour of the rapidly growing firm. Investment allowances,\nas seen above, discriminate not in favour of the firm which is growing fastest, but in favour\nof the firm which turns its capital over fastest ; and there is no reason why the public\ninterest should require the encouragement of relatively short-lived investments.\n\n11. It is also possible that reasons for preferring one type of inducement to invest\nto another should arise from differences in their impact on government finance. The\nimmediate direct reduction in the receipts of the Treasury in the year an investment is\nmade due to the granting of investment or initial allowances is v? or at ; to make these\nequivalent from the point of view of the firm a must be larger than v (to an extent shown\nin appendix 2), so that initial allowances involve a larger direct and immediate loss of\nrevenue. Whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer prefers a method of encouraging\ninvestment which implies a larger or a smaller immediate impact on government finance\ndepends on a variety of considerations of debt-management, monetary policy and sheer\npolitical expediency which will vary from time to time. The immediate effects of cheap\nloans on government finance are harder to generalise ; if the government actually provides\nthe loans, the immediate impact on the overall government financial position is large, but\ndoes not fall ** above the line \"', i.e., on current account ; if the government merely sub-\nsidises loans actually provided by some other body, the direct impact on government\nfinance, like the benefits to the firm, all lie in the future, and the immediate cost is zero.\n\n12. In conclusion it must be emphasised that the analysis above has taken a partial\nequilibrium viewpoint in comparing investment allowances, initial allowances and the\ngranting of cheap credit facilities as inducements to investment. If any of these, or any\ncombination, is successful in increasing investment the effects on employment and financial\nconditions will be felt throughout the economy, and the resulting changes in the financial\nposition of both the government and private firms may permit or require widespread changes\nin t or r. As these more general effects of a rise in investment will be fairly similar what-\never type of inducement was used to bring it about, it has been thought worth while to\npursue the partial equilibrium approach involved in analysing the effects of a, v and c\nwith r, ? and n either held constant or varying independently. This approach has shown\nthe differences between investment allowances, initial allowances and cheap loans to be\nboth smaller than, and different from, what is sometimes believed.\n\nOxford. J.

TRANSACTIONS AMONG PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS\n\nSo far the only aspect of transactions between private individuals which has been\nconsidered is the expenditure of a part of urban incomes on the free markets for farm pro-\nducts. This process, as we have seen, retards the return of cash to the issuing bank,\nhence it increases the cash circulation. Apart from this, transactions among private indi-\nviduals only amount to a few per cent of the transactions between private individuals\nand the socialist sector. For this reas\u00f3n it is possible in an analysis of short period\nfluctuations to assume that the volume of transactions among private individuals is constant\nand hence can be left out of the discussion. Over longer periods the volume of transactions\namong private individuals can undergo variations sufficiently great to need attention, at\nleast as minor influences on the currency circulation. Growth in the volume of such\ntransactions of course increases, while a decline diminishes the circulation of cash.\n\n* * *\n\nAmong the factors described above, a disproportion between purchasing power and\nthe stock of goods available has a special character ; when such a disproportion obtains\nthe ratio which the cash circulation bears to income is determined not by the spontaneous\nspending habits of the population, but by compulsion resulting from rigidities in the plan-\nned economic system. In planned economies the most general form of inflation is thus\ninvoluntary retardation of the rate at which incomes are spent. \"This arises because the\nstate provides for consumption a supply of goods which is too small or of inadequate\nquality to mop up the purchasing power outstanding.\n\nA potential reduction in the rate at which incomes are spent is an important element\nof elasticity in the general rigidity of a planned economy, since for some time and to some\ndegree it bridges the gap between purchasing power and the supply of goods ; it thus\nfulfils a function similar to that of rising prices in a free market economy.\n\nLondon J. BARACS.\n\n! This applies only to the sphere of cash transactions. A situation in which the supply of investment\ngoods fails to match the sums provided in the investment plans is also appropriately described as inflationary.\n\"This, however is outside the cash sphere and has different consequences from the inflation described here.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 05:54:26 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "62 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nConcerning the view that macrotheory has been built up as a parallel or analogy\nto microtheory, and that we cannot construct macrotheory without making use of micro-\ntheory, it may, first of all, be said that this is hardly justified by the history of economic\nthought. A great deal of classical theory is macrotheory, and does not depend for its\njustification or empirical relevance on micro analogies.! Secondly, although it may well\nbe admitted that it is possible to construct macrotheory as an analogy to micro theory,\nand economists sometimes do so, this is not an argument relevant to the logical structure\nof economic theory. After all, to refer to an old problem, while hypotheses may sometimes\nin practice be obtained inductively, this in no way validates induction as a form of inference.\nIn addition, some disaggregated models such as the matrix multiplier have been derived\nby way of analogies to aggregated models, but it would scarcely be suggested that the\nlatter are logically prior or more fundamental than the former. Thirdly, the approach\nbased on analogies with microtheory seems to mistake the whole purpose of macrotheory\nwhich is to analyse specific problems based on aggregates. Thus the behaviour of con.\nsumption relative to national income can be formulated and tested without the apparatu:\nof maximizing and allocative theory. Moreover, one may go further and suggest that\nmicrotheory may even be an impediment to the formulation of good hypotheses at the\nmacro-level. In the case of the acceleration principle, for example, it has been shown\nthat this may or may not lead to the magnification of fluctuations in net investment relative\nto net national income (or net investment of the firm relative to its sales). The ability\nto progress beyond pure taxonomy, however, depends on the construction of a complete\nmodel into which are introduced empirical assumptions. In this way, the introduction\nof the macro-consumption function (with the usual conditions of diminishing marginal\nand average propensities to consume) does, in fact, lead to magnification in a macro-\nmodel.?\n\nAn important consequence of this point of view is that a less aggregated analysis\nof any problem cannot by itself stand as a criticism or refutation of a more aggregated\nanalysis. For example, models have been constructed in which investment minus saving\nex ante is equal to the sum of excess demands ex ante in \u00e0 number of factor and goods\nmarkets. Equilibrium is defined as a situation in which excess demand in every market\nis zero, so that equality of investment and saving ex ante is not a sufficient condition for\nequilibrium. It is then suggested that this throws doubt on the value of models based of\na straightforward investment-saving approach.5 But this would be so only if, on the one\nhand, the investment-saving approach were intended to solve problems related to the\ninterdependence of markets, and, on the other, the market approach is shown to provide\nbetter answers to the problems for which the theory in terms of investment and saving\nwas propounded.\n\n4. CONCLUSION\n\nThe argument presented here is not to be interpreted as saying that disaggregation is\nuninteresting or unimportant, or that cross section studies may not throw considerable\nlight on the behaviour of the economy. It also does not say that there is no value in con-\n\n! Consider, for example, Smith and Ricardo on accumulation and the stock of capital.\n? Vid. Baumol [2], and Winding [13].\n\n* Vid.

This means, however, that if the macro\ntheory were valid, any micro theory invented to explain the same universe would be either\notiose or wrong. In other words, aggregation which depends on postulating functional\nrelationships of the sort discussed between micro variables and macro variables is feasible\nonly if microtheory is irrelevant or impossible.\n\nThis conclusion, of course, is not at all surprising. If macrotheory is first of all\ntreated as subsidiary to microtheory, and is then expected to produce conclusions which\ndepend on the structural interrelations of micro variables, either contradictions will result\nbecause the demand is impossible, or the macrotheory will be successful and leave no\nplace for microtheory.\n\nThe difficulty may be removed, however, by generalising one stage further.

Conversely for the purposes of micro\ntheory the macro variables in 9. can be treated in the same way.\n\n3. FURTHER ELABORATION\n\nThe major implication of what has been said so far is that it is not worthwhile to\njudge any workable theory in terms of its being absolutely complete in the sense of being\nrelevant to every problem which might arise. Moreover, economic variables are not to\nbe judged in terms of which are of logically primary importance and which are secondary.\nIn the set of equations 9., for example, which variables are dependent and which are\nindependent, which are endogenous and which are exogenous will be determined by the\nparticular problem in hand.! \"Within this logical framework, therefore, macrotheory and\nmicrotheory are seen to be complements not substitutes. Indeed, since in 9. it is not\nnecessarily possible to make a logically rigid distinction between macro and micro variables,\na distinction between the two sorts of theory may not always be easy to make, or even be\nworth making.\n\nl'This in turn will allow the regression problem mentioned supra to be dealt with.\nThis content downloaded from\n\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 05:55:09 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

They are variables the meaning of which is a function\nof the theoretical system in which they are employed.\n\nConsider now the set of equations 6. which is necessary to perform the required aggre-\ngation. The question arises, What meaning is to be attached to them ? Theil [10, p. 13]\nsays that they are entirely formal. It is not at all clear what significance '* formality \"\nhas in this context. For example, Theil considers the possibility [10, p. 36] that individual\nincome is a quadratic function of total income, which to the ordinary everyday economist\nis a postulate so full of empirical content as to be as far from formality as possible.\n\nThe view might be held that it just so happens that micro and macro variables change\ntogether over time and that it is then possible to estimate a statistical coefficient relating\ntheir movements, but implying no causal hypothesis. Apart from the difficulty which\nmight arise in the use of regression analysis in estimating this coefficient, it would require\na curious act of self-abnegation on the part of scientific investigators to place the problem\nof why such a relationship exists in perpetual abeyance. While for the very good practical\nreason of the need to go ahead with some empirical work it would be foolish for econo-\nmetrists to hold their hands and wait for an explanation of such a relationship if it exists,\nit would be equally foolish for them to deny the value of an explanation if the explanation\ncan befound. Itis our view, therefore, that there is some point in endeavouring to provide\na theoretical foundation for the aggregating equations.?\n\nUnfortunately, there is a logical difficulty connected with the discovery of such a\ncausal hypothesis within the framework of the model as set out so far, and as employed\nby econometrists. The difficulty arises from the acceptance of the doctrine that micro-\ntheory is fundamental theory and all other theory must be built up from it.\n\n1 Tt is after all, always possible to work with the equation C \u2014 X e Y).\n\n?

For example, Klein [4, p. 93]\nrefers to ** the behaviour of individual households or firms which must form the basis of\nall theory of economic behaviour \". From this trivial proposition it is not a valid infer-\nence that a theory of individual behaviour must form the basis of all other theory. Indeed,\nit cannot be assumed (but must be demonstrated) that because all decision making is in\nsome sense done by individuals that a theory of individual decision making is even possible.\nIt is, perhaps, also of interest to note that Klein, anyway, is already dealing with aggre-\ngates when he mentions households and firms.\n\nIt will also be argued here that the aggregation problem is not primarily one of\nmeasurement, nor is it useful to follow Tinbergen [11] and look on macro relationships as\naverages of micro relationships ; rather economic theory at any level of aggregation\nexists on a par with economic theory at any other level, and if an aggregation problem\nexists, it is because economic theory at some level is unsatisfactory.\n\nThe argument which follows is based on the simplest possible problem.

Its usual formulation (as set out, for example, by Klein [4, 5], Balderston\nand Whitin [1], or Theil [10]) involves a comparison between the predictions obtained\nfrom a large economic model with many equations and variables and a smaller model in\nwhich the variables and parameters are aggregates of those in the larger model. In\nparticular, it is desirable that the aggregated predictions of the micro model should not\nconflict with those of the macro model. A simple example is provided by de Wolff [14].\nAssuming that an unambiguous meaning can be attached to the income elasticity of\ndemand of an individual consumer, he investigates those circumstances in which similar\nprecision can be attached to the concept when applied to a group of consumers.\n\nIn a recent book by Theil [10] it is shown that where a set of linear micro equations\nis to be aggregated into a single macro equation, aggregates can always be defined so that\npredictions from the micro equations do not contradict those from the macro equation.\nSimilarly, such *' perfect\" aggregation is frequently possible when the micro equations\nare non-linear?\n\nWhere there are several macro equations to be derived, a less satisfactory state of\naffairs prevails. While it is always possible to obtain macro reduced form equations from\nlinear micro reduced form equations, this situation corresponding to the single macro\nequation case, it is rarely possible to obtain macro structural equations in the same way.\nThe reason for this is that the same micro variables will usually be aggregated differently\nin different macro reduced form equations, but to obtain the macro structural equations\nit is required that these aggregates be identical?.\n\nThe position adopted in this paper is that the attempt to solve the aggregation problem\nby means of the definition of indices of micro variables is bound to be unsatisfactory,\nand leads to a mistaken view of the relationship between micro and macro theory. Apart\nfrom the possibility of the non-identity of indices*, the present view is unacceptable because\n\n''The author has benefited considerably from discussion of this topic with Professor Baumol of\nPrinceton University. He is also indebted to Messrs. Archibald, Lipsey and O'Leary of the London\nSchool of Economics for valuable discussion of an earlier draft.\n\n* An example is provided by Klein [4]. If each firm's production function may be represented by an\nextended version of the Cobb-Douglas production function, he shows how a production function of the\nsame type may be derived for the economy as a whole.\n\n* Theil [10, p. 152] discusses a situation in which two macro reduced form equations each contain an\nincome index, but these two indices are as a rule not identical.\n\n* [t is worth noting that in his reply to Klein Shou Shan Pu [9] pointed out that these indices may have\nonly the most tenuous connection with variables appearing in macro theory.\n\n58\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 05:55:09 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In Value and\nCapital terms, there is a ** dominance of complementarity \" between labour and capital.\n\nI am myself not much in love with *' golden ages\"' of this character ; to deprive\nan analysis, that is concerned with motion in time, of an anchor in time has always seemed\nto me to be a dubious proceeding. Nevertheless I would agree that the nature of the\nrestraint which is set by initial equipment is not usually such as to prevent a ** dominance\nof complementarity \". The more optimistic view (which shows the demand for lbaour\ngrowing\u2014and so, with an inelastic supply of labour, wages rising\u2014in the process of\nexpansion) is on the whole, without doubt, correct.\n\nConclusion\n\nI am well aware that I have been talking, in this last section, in a looser and vaguer\nway than in those which preceded ; the ground which I have just been covering, in this\nrather casual fashion, is ground which ought to be worked over more carefully. \"What\nI hope I have done is to provide an interesting technique by which some of these important\nmatters can be more fully explored. 1 think that the application of this technique would\nthrow some light upon them ; but I should like to make clear, before concluding, that I\nam under no illusions about the total that could thereby be achieved.\n\nThe questions which the present model is concerned to answer are by no means the\nsame as those which other model-builders (such as Harrod, Domar or Kaldor) have sought\nto answer by their models ; it is perfectly possible that what I have been saying may be\ntrue, and that what they (or some of them) have been saying may be true also. And even\nwithin the field of the questions which I have been trying to ask, the validity of my model,\nI would freely admit, is quite questionable. As has just been shown, it may be too much of\na \"\" diminishing returns\" model\u2014though it can be pushed, if we like, in a '' constant\nreturns \" direction. But it can hardly pass over (so far as I can see) into a world of In-\ncreased Returns ; yet the association of Increasing Returns with economic growth is a\nkey which may well unlock more doors than those which have here been causing us so\nmuch trouble.\n\nOxford.

What is\nimportant is the realization that the main contribution of stronger assumptions is not\nin the realm of theorems concerning behavior at the micro level.\n\nIn conclusion we believe that many of the seemingly troublesome axioms in the\ntheory of choice approach need not be stumbling blocks for the acceptance of the meaning-\nful theorems in this area.

The gain would be\npossible only if large numbers of workers were affected (which means in effect that the wage\nrate is raised by market forces over a wide area rather than the deliberate action of some\nemployers who have got together) ; while the fact that a concerted wage policy cannot be\nfollowed increases both the difficulty of anticipation of the workers' reponse and the risk\nattached to the anticipation.\n\nThus under the casual system of employment, the wage-efficiency relationship does\nnot operate, and consequently there is no floor. If everybody gets equal employment\n(which will happen in the long run with chance selection), then the wage will be driven\nto the point 4, where the work units supplied per worker is so low that the total demand\nfor work units is just met when everybody is employed.\n\nI\n\nIt may not be out of place here to indicate that the analysis presented above throws\nlight on one of the causes of the disparity in wages between agriculture and industry,\nand the maintenance of wage-rates in industry, in spite of widespread un-, or under-\nemployment of labour in agriculture. Industry is in quite a different position from\nagriculture as regards the system of employment. It has a limited number of employers\nand every individual mill has a core of workers who are attached to it and in continuous\nemployment throughout the year. Industry's wage policy will be concerned with its own\nspecial body of workers without any reference to the volume of surplus labour in the\neconomy asa whole. \"Thus either by individual or concerted action the industrial employer\ncan realise the most profitable situation by keeping the wage rate at the floor level (Z.).\n\nAnother possible reason for the agricultural-industrial wage differential has to do\nwith the productivity of casuallabour. Industry needs its labour force to be in continuous\nemployment throughout the year ; productivity of labour is affected seriously if casual\nunstable labour is used. But in agriculture the system of employment is the casual system,\nand, unless there is marked scarcity of labour in this sector, total employment usually will\nbe shared out among the job-seekers, with each putting in less number of days of work than\nare available in the year. This means that industry must pay a minimum wage which will\nenable the worker to attain physical efficiency sufficient to supply as many work-days of\neffort as are available in the year ; whereas agriculture, except under conditions of scarcity\nof labour, has no necessity to have this minimum. \u2014 On our supply curve of work units\nwith respect to wage, this minimum (which might be called the point of no idleness such\nas K) is likely to be above the floor wage (L) we have discussed before at which the\naverage cost per work unit is at its minimum.\n\nFor minimising labour cost the industrial wage will need to be not merely at the floor\nlevel, (L) but also at the minimum wage point of no idleness (K), and a positive wage\ndifferential with respect to agriculture will exist.\n\nLondon.

Thus, if the non-monopoly sector\nprice increases to k time marginal cost to match the monopolist's original price policy, the\nmonopolist will always react by further raising his price to something greater than K times\nmarginal cost.\n\nWe cannot, therefore, simply define a monopolistic policy by the relationship between\naccounting prices and costs, but must always consider the relationship between these\nrelative to their relationship elsewhere.\n\nThe difficulty is, which relationship to use ? Our original choice was the relationship\nbetween price and marginal cost in some industry chosen at random, but, as McManus\ncorrectly points out, the status of this industry is higher than that of a mere numeraire.\nIn effect, the * hidden assumption ' for which McManus searches but does not correctly\nlocate is that we have assumed it is to the price of the n'th commodity that the monopolist's\nreactions are geared. This is a useful enough assumption in many models\u2014the z'th\ncommodity might, for example, be a competitively produced good which is the chief\nsubstitute for the monopolist's output\u2014but it is not general. Perhaps the answer in the\ngeneral case is to assume the monopolist's relationship between price and marginal cost to\nall other industries, the functional relationship being ultimately determined by demand\nconditions. This will certainly confront us with some complex analysis.\n\nOur intent in writing the original article was to indicate that piecemeal application\nof single Paretian welfare conditions in a situation in which not al] such conditions could\nbe satisfied might well decrease, rather than increase, welfare.

                    "102 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nCURRENCY AREAS\n\nThe sterling and dollar areas have remained relatively homogeneous and stable but\nthe composition of even these was not entirely constant.\n\nThe sterling area included throughout the period all colonial possessions and dependen-\ncies of the United Kingdom except the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and Palestine ; in addition,\nAustralia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, South Africa, Ireland, Iceland, Iraq and\nBurma. Egypt and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan left the Sterling Area in July 1947, Palestine\nand Jordan in February 1948, Jordan (though not Israel) rejoining the area in July 1950.\nThe Faroe Islands were part of the sterling area until November 1948 and Libya has been\na member since January 1952.\n\nThe dollar area, in addition to Canada! the United States and her dependencies,\nincluded throughout Liberia,! the Philippines and the following thirteen Central and South\nAmerican countries : Columbia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador,\nGuatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, El Salvador, Venezuela.\nBolivia became a member of the dollar area in July 1947, Chile was a member from July\n1947 to July 1948 and Peru from July 1947 to August 1948. For purposes of the statistical\nanalysis imports from the last two countries were included in the dollar totals for 1948\nonly. Uruguay was in the dollar area only from July 1947 to March 1948 ; since this\nperiod did not include June 30th in either year, Uruguay is not treated as in the dollar area\nin 1947 or 1948.\n\nWhat has been termed the rest of the world is a heterogeneous collection of countries,\ntowards which import policy was generally far from uniform. From 1949/50 onwards,\nhowever, it contained one major component, the relaxation area, which enjoyed more or\nless uniform treatment, but as even this area was growing in size, figures for different\nyears would not be strictly comparable.?\n\nAs it stands, the *' rest of the world \" group is relatively constant in size, being affected\nonly by the minor changes in composition of the sterling and dollar areas already mentioned.\nIts composition by main import licensing groups since 1950 is indicated below :\n\nComposition of imports from the ** rest of the world\"\n(i.e., non-sterling non-dollar area)\n\n1950-58\n\nPercentages\n\nSoviet bloc 55, 55 64| 61| 59; 71. 65, T0| 68\nJapan 07| 09, 21/|07| 12; 1:6| L6 | 15, 105\nRelaxation Area 70-0 | 86:2 | 86:0 | 847 | 86:2 | 85-4 1 91:9 | 91:55 | 9177\nRest 2228 | T4 55 85/67, 59 | \u2014 \u2014 -\u2014\n\n1!

                    "IMPORT CONTROL IN THE UNITED KINGDOM SINCE THE WAR 101\n\n(a) On supply grounds : Licences to import essentials from areas (e.g., the dollar\narea) from which they are not on Open Licence are considered ad hoc in the light of advice\nfrom a responsible government department.\n\n(b) In relation to end use : Applications for licences to import machinery (and certain\ndollar materials) are considered individually in relation to end-use and alternative sources\nofsupply. The issue of licences to import goods either for re-export in the form imported\n(REX licence) or for ultimate export after processing (UX licences), depends largely on the\nnet foreign exchange earnings.\n\n(c) By quotas : In some cases quotas are established fixing a limit (by quantity or\nvalue) to total imports of a particular commodity for a particular period : sometimes\nthese apply to one source only (bilateral quotas), sometimes to a large number of sources\ntogether (global quotas). Within these totals, licences may be allocated to individual\nimporters in various ways. \"The most usual method is to share them out among established\nimporters in proportion to their share of trade in some specified past period when the\nimports concerned were not subject to restriction ; (in some cases, this had to be pre-war).\n\n(i) Bilateral quotas have generally been established under bilateral trade negoti-\nations largely as a concession to the exporting country, which has furthermore some-\ntimes been granted the right to administer the allocation of the quota. This applied\nin particular to the ** special hardship quotas \" granted to those O.E.E.C. countries\nwhich had suffered exceptionally from the British deliberalisation of 1951/2, and\nalso to licences under the Token Import Scheme. In such cases an import licence is\nissued automatically to the British importer who can produce the appropriate certifi-\ncate from his foreign supplier. Licences issued in respect of trade agreement quotas\nnormally have the validity of the period covered by the agreement.\n\n(ii).Global quotas were introduced on a large scale in respect of those commodities\noriginally liberalised in 1949 and 1950 which were deliberalised during the 1951/2\nbalance of payments crisis. Quotas mostly related to the whole *' relaxation area \"'\nand were announced for six months at a time ; applications for licences had to be\nmade within specified time limits and the licences were normally valid for the period\nof the quota (with possible extensions of three months). Only a few of these global\nquotas remain at the present time, most of the goods to which they were applied having\nbeen subsequently ** reliberalised ''.\n\nAI items subject to specific licences, however allocated, must be regarded as subject\nto quantitative control from the sources for which such individual licences are required.\n\n(4) BLock LicENCES\n\nThese were a way of regulating imports, now largely superseded, which bore a super-\nficial resemblance to open individual licences, but were in fact rather a form of restriction\nby quota. A limit was placed on total imports, but individual importers obtained licences\npermitting them to import the commodity in question freely from the specified source or\nsources until the overall limit was reached. All imports and commitments had to be\nreported at regular intervals and all licences were withdrawn as soon as the limit was reached\n(or expected to be reached on the basis of outstanding commitments). This system was\napplied to certain horticultural goods and to chocolate confectionery and biscuits in 1949/51.\nDespite the temporary illusion of freedom, it was clearly a form of restriction by quota,\nthe method of allocating licences being ** first come, first served \"'.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 06:18:55 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "100 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nfrom the sources indicated ; e.g., from the whole world, from the *'' British Empire \"',\nfrom particular countries, etc. In a few cases (mainly fruit and vegetables), the freedom\nfrom restriction has been confined to limited periods to avoid competition with home\nproduce. After the introduction of the O.E.E.C. liberalisation policy in 1949/50 the\nOpen General Licence contained two major Schedules : (1) a list of goods which could\nbe imported freely from all countries (World Open General Licence) ; (2) a much longer\nlist of goods (classified into 17 groups) which could be imported from all ** relaxation area \"'\ncountries ' (Relaxation Open General Licence).\n\n\"There were still, as before, a few shorter lists of commodities which could be imported\nfree of restriction only from British Commonwealth countries or other individual countries\n(e.g., lace from Malta, bulbs from the Netherlands, etc.). During the temporary deliveralis-\nation period in 1952/3 the Open General Licence included a third major Schedule con-\ntaining a substantial list of items which had been deliberalised from the *' relaxation\narea \" but could still be imported without restriction from the ** Scheduled Territories \"\n(Sterling Area Open General Licence). With further reliberalisation measures the latter\nlist became shorter as goods were restored to Relaxation Open General Licence. More-\nover, with the general unification in 1954 of sterling payments arrangements in the non-\ndollar world (extension of transferable account facilities to all non-dollar countries), a\nfourth schedule was introduced of commodities (mainly raw materials) which might be\nimported freely from all non-dollar countries (non-dollar Open General Licence).\n\nCommodities on Open General Licence from any source are in effect not subject to\ncontrol from that source.\n\n(2) OPEN IuDivipuaL LicENCE (O.LL.)\n\nThis is a licence issued to an individual trader permitting him to import specified goods\nwithout limit of quantity or value either from any country (World Open Individual Licence)\nor from specified countries or groups of countries (e.g., Dollar Open Individual Licence,\nNon-Dollar Open Individual Licence, Relaxation Open Individual Licence, etc.) The\nlicence may be valid for a finite period or until revoked. \"This particular type of open\nlicensing has generally been used in connection with the imposition of certain administrative\nobligations on importers (e.g., to make periodic returns of imports, contracts, or com-\nmitments) or for the purpose of limiting the freedom to import to certain categories of\ntraders (e.g., members of the commodity markets on which the goods in question are\ntraded). In many cases, however, such licences have been granted freely to any one apply-\ning for them. Such licences have never effectively restricted the quantity of the particular\ngoods imported and have often served as an interim stage on the way to an Open General\nLicence.*\n\n(3) SPECIFIC IMPORT LICENCE\n\nThis is a licence issued to an individual importer, permitting the import of a specific\nquantity of a particular commodity from a specified source or sources. Specific import\nlicences are valid for finite periods, generally six months, (twelve months for machinery) ;\nan extension of three months (six for machinery) may usually be obtained. The quantity\nadmitted may be determined in various ways :\n\n1 See p. 78 for definition of ** relaxation area \".\n? Cf.

They are all more complicated numerically than\nthe conventional method and would raise problems in devising efficient estimation pro-\ncedures (for example, is it better to estimate the democratic weights by calculating o and 5\nand then applying equation (7), or is the direct method preferable ?). A compromise\nalong the following lines is, however, worth considering. If it were explicitly recognised\nthat the index is to refer to a household with a '* median standard of living \", the sample\nof household budgets that are to provide the Weights could be confined to a fairly narrow\nrange of incomes and household sizes. Within these ranges, any variations in expenditure\nbetween households would largely be due to random elements, and very little of the vari-\nation would be correlated with income and family size ; a simple (conventional) averaging\nprocedure would therefore be justified on the grounds of numerical expediency.\n\nThe current practice of excluding '* untypical \" households\u2014those with very low and\nvery high incomes\u2014from the calculation of the index may be regarded as a step in this\ndirection (possibly subconscious).

One cannot of course say in the abstract\nwhat constitutes a proper scale of tax progression, but it may not be unreasonable to suppose\nthat these figures indicate rough justice as between Buganda and Kigezi but not as between\nTeso and Acholi. The poorer Acholi received half its income net of export duty whilst\nin the case of the more prosperous Teso the proportion was two thirds : this cannot be\nregarded as equitable on any principle.\n\nIV\n\nThere has been a good deal of discussion about the ways in which countries with high\nincomes can help in the development of those with lower per capita incomes. But a low\naverage income is not the only distinguishing feature of underdeveloped countries and to\nconcentrate on this one feature may deflect attention from the problems associated with\nregional income disparities such as exist in most parts of tropical Africa and in other\nunderdeveloped areas. Regional disparities in income were as conspicuous in England\nbefore the 19th century as they are in Africa to-day and since they are now much smaller in\nEngland it may be that they automatically disappear with economic growth. But this\nshould not be taken for granted : the experience of the past decade in Uganda, a period\nof very rapid advance albeit a short one from which to generalize, gives no ground for\noptimism. Regional disparities are obviated where there is mobility, but there are political\nand economic factors in most parts of Africa which inhibit the permanent movement of\npeople from the poorer to the richer regions of a country. There would be fewer poor in\nSouthern Italy if there were more employment opportunities in the North, but it cannot be\ntaken for granted that an acceleration of economic development in Buganda would auto-\nmatically enhance incomes in the other regions or bring about a permanent resettlement\nin Buganda. An increase in average income in Uganda brought about by an acceleration\nof economic development in Buganda might create as many internal problems and strains\nas it would solve.

As we might expect, the marginal capital-output\nratio moves at levels lower than those estimated for the advanced economies with their\nradically different factor endowments. Moreover, it is declining during the nineteenth\ncentury as the marginal output-labor ratio is climbing at a faster rate than the marginal\ncapital-labor relationship.?\n\nDuring the twentieth century, the second phase in Japan's development, higher levels\nof domestic income and savings, supplemented by the inflow of foreign capital, are reflected\nin the over-all higher level of the marginal capital-output ratio.

In this he is clearly correct : so long as consumer's surplus as measured by the\nquantity-compensating variation exists, it necessarily follows from the foregoing analysis\nthat it can be completely appropriated by the monopolist. It also follows that che extent\nto which discrimination can raise revenue is inversely related to the size of the income\neffect. It is largest in the case of constant marginal utility of money when the income\neffectis zero. The larger the income effect the nearer the area under the MR curve approach-\nes the area under the MY curve and the smaller the possible gain. his is only another\nway of saying that the size of the quantity-compensating variation varies inversely with\nthat of the income elasticity of demand. Professor Lewis's second point is therefore\nsubstantially correct. It is obvious however that given the usual indifference pattern, the\nquantity-compensating variation must be greater than zero, for equality of the areas under\nthe MR and MY curves implies either kinked or intersecting indifference curves. In general,\nas compared with single pricing, discrimination makes possible a larger total revenue\nfor any given volume of sales.\n\nFinally, even if, under single pricing, the consumer is spending the maximum he is\nprepared to devote to the commodity, so that the quantity compensating variation is\nzero, it may still be possible to increase monopoly profits by discrimination with a smaller\noutput.\n\nSheffield.

It follows that acceleration coefficient and marginal\ncapital coefficient are equal if both  \u2014 1 and 8 \u2014 1.

If we consider deviations from this dynamic equilibrium, however, the assumption\nof 1 \u2014 1l, and 8 \u2014 1 must be abandoned.\n\nVIII\n\nIn conclusion we must indicate another implicit assumption in our analysis. When\nwe spoke of investment we had in mind a particular type of investment, that is, induced\ninvestment creating productive capacity. But there are other types which can be dis-\ntinguished :\n\n(1a) Autonomous investment with capacity effect,\n(15) Autonomous investment without capacity effect,\n(2a) Induced investment with capacity effect, and\n(2b) Induced investment without capacity effect.\n\nWe do not want to put too much emphasis on this classification as a clear-cut distinction\nbetween induced and autonomous investment is by no means indisputable. Besides,\ninvestment of type (2b) has neither empirical significance, nor is it logically thinkable :\nWhy should investment which does not create new capacity be induced after all ? If we\ntake account of autonomous investment of the capacity creating type (1a), however, then\ninduced investment (/7^4) in the acceleration equation is less than investment in the equation\nfor the capacity effect (I^ -- I\"7).

The capital coefficient applies to autonomous and to induced\ninvestment. The acceleration coefficient, however, is applicable only to induced invest-\nment. The case of 8 and v being equal can be regarded as a mere coincidence under the\nhighly unrealistic assumption that the capacity effect of autonomous investment exactly\nequals that of induced investment.\n\nMunich.

The fact which they announce is well known, but their proof for a simple case\nis a nice pedagogical contribution. I would only make two further observations. First, the\nassumption of closure is inessential to my argument and to demand theory, one merely\nredefines the notion of compensation, so that the consumer is compensated if he receives\nthe greatest lower bound of incomes which permit him to reach a position at least as good\nas he could achieve under the initial conditions. The new function Mz (p) has the same\n\n; 2\nproperties as the old one. If ix exists, it is equal to d m , Where x is chosen at\n2\nP. Moreover, the second differential does exist for almost every P, and thus a unique\nbest combination of goods exists for almost every P and income Mz (p). (My discussant,\nFrank Hahn, and I independently noted this point when my paper was first presented\nto the Econometric Society.)

For even when allowance is made for the\nadjustment in the rate of taxation in consequence upon the enlargement of the tax base\n(due to the inclusion of capital gains) it is possible that the taxation of capital gains dis-\ncourages risk-bearing by more than the allowance made for capital losses encourages it.\nThis is likely to be the case if the relatively ** risky \"' securities are those which offer a definite\nprospect of capital appreciation, and where therefore the previously tax-exempt proportion\nof the expected yield (the portion represented by expected appreciation, and not by the\nprospective dividend) is relatively large. In other words, to the extent that prospective\ncapital appreciation is possitively correlated with uncertainty (so that the more risky the\nsecurity, and the higher the '* expected yield \"', the greater the element of capital appreci-\nation in that yield) an income tax which exempts capital gain undertaxes risky investments\nrelatively to safe investments (per unit of yield) and thereby counteracts the tendency of\nincome tax to discourage risk-bearing.\n\nThis was the basis for the conclusion in my book that *' the effect of the non-taxation\nof capital gains is to reduce the discrimination against risk bearing inherent in income\ntax \".! I still believe that there is a presumption to this effect, and that a British type\nincome tax, whatever its defects from the point of view of equity, is less discouraging to\nrisk bearing than a more comprehensive tax which includes realized capital gains in taxable\nincome, and allows realized capital losses as an offset against present and future capital\ngains. But in view of Messrs. Musgrave and Domar's findings with regard to the effect\nof a tax on Accrued Income with full loss offsets I no longer believe that this conclusion\nnecessarily follows. Since a tax on Accrued Income lacks the discriminating features of\na British type tax, a tax on Realized Income\u2014which could, after all, be regarded as an\nintermediate case between the two\u2014might, on balance, be more favourable to risk-taking\nthan the British type tax (due to the fact that it offers a certain relief for capital losses)\neven though it involves a shift in the tax burden towards more risky investments.\n\nThe above does not affect the conclusions stated at the beginning of this paper as\nregards the relative merits of a British type income tax, an annual capital tax and an\nexpenditure tax. But it does mean that the extension of the same reasoning to the case of\na tax on Accrued Income was erroneous. Given full loss offsets, and ignoring the indirect\neffects through savings, a tax on Accrued Income appears to be no less favourable in its\neffects on risk-taking than an expenditure tax. This latter conclusion also casts some doubt\non the proposition that the taxation of realized capital gains has adverse effects on the\nincentive to take risks as compared with the present British-type income tax.\n\nCambridge.

However, the force of this reversal of\ndirection is diluted by recognition, as in section 2.5, that the size of investment balances is\nnot independent of the current rate of interest r. In section 3.4 we have considered the\nproportionate allocation between cash and '* consols \"* on the assumption that it is inde-\npendent of the size of the balance. An increase in the rate of interest may lead an investor\nto desire to shift towards cash. But to the extent that the increase in interest also reduces\nthe value of the investor's consol holdings, it automatically gratifies this desire, at least in\npart.\n\nThe assumption that investors expect on balance no change in the rate of interest\nhas been adopted for the theoretical reasons explained in section 2.6 rather than for reasons\nof realism. Clearly investors do form expectations of changes in interest rates and differ\nfrom each other in their expectations. For the purposes of dynamic theory and of analysis\nof specific market situations, the theories of sections 2 and 3 are complementary rather\nthan competitive. The formal apparatus of section 3 will serve just as well for a non-zero\nexpected capital gain or loss as for a zero expected value of g. Stickiness of interest rate\nexpectations would mean that the expected value of g is a function of the rate of interest r,\ngoing down when r goes down and rising when r goes up. In addition to the rotation of\nthe opportunity locus due to a change in r itself, there would be a further rotation in the\nsame direction due to the accompanying change in the expected capital gain or loss. At\nlow interest rates expectation of capital loss may push the opportunity locus into the\nnegative quadrant, so that the optimal position is clearly no consols, all cash. At the\nother extreme, expectation of capital gain at high interest rates would increase sharply\nthe slope of the opportunity locus and the frequency of no cash, all consols positions,\nlike that of Figure 3.3. The stickier the investor's expectations, the more sensitive his\ndemand for cash will be to changes in the rate of interest.\n\nNew Haven, Conn. U.S.A. J.

A detailed examination of durable\ncommodities for the United Kingdom budget survey of 1937/38 is given by Prais and\nHouthakker [5], while estimates for the Dutch 1935/36 survey can be derived from a recent\narticle by Wit [6]. Various other sources were used, and in several cases adjustments\nwere necessary ; a detailed description is given in the appendix. The resulting figures\ngiven in table 5 all refer to the period before the war, and where budget surveys are used\nthe elasticities are evaluated at or near the mean working-class income.\n\nAs both methods and data differ, any agreement between the two sets of estimates is\ncause for surprise ; in fact there is rather more than one would expect. For three budget\nsurveys where sufficient data were available the weighted income elasticity for all durable\ngoods is close to unity, which corresponds to the assumptions about the relation of owner-\nship to long-term income elasticity made above. For clothing there is a fair degree of\nagreement generally, even including an estimate from time-series. For household effects\nand its constituent parts (the next four items) ownership elasticities do correspond roughly\nto the Dutch income elasticities, but they are consistently lower than the estimates for other\ncountries. National characteristics in the classification of necessities and luxuries might\naccount for this difference ; this is generally a poor explanation, but in the present case\nrather plausible. Among the other commodities major indivisible items are notable in\nthat the estimates from American time-series seem much more plausible than our estimates ;\nthe value of -75 is almost certainly too low, even for a long-term elastici.y.\n\nIf we concentrate on the Dutch cross-section estimates of demand elasticities, a com-\nparison with ownership elasticities shows no general or consistent divergence between the\ntwo. This suggests that estimates from cross-section data are closer to *' true\" long-\nterm income elasticities of demand than recent controversies may have led us to believe.\n\nCambridge. J. S.

For \u00a3 X t,, the stationary level of w,\nis W, \u2014 W, and if the stagnation has lasted for a while, the convergence property of the\ndifferential equation (8) has secured that the factual w, is nearer to W. As soon as the\n\npoint of time t, is passed, the stationary level for w, shifts to 9\u00bb, \u2014 y\u20145h. For the de-\nY\n\nvelopment of wi it is now reasonable to assume wi, \u2014 W and wi, \u2014 O as initial conditions\nfor the process following the point of time ty. w, will then either increase monotonically\ntowards the new stationary level, or converge to it through cyclical movements. It is\ntherefore possible that we for an industry such as the one under consideration now, shall\nobserve an increasing wage rate simultaneously with an increase in productivity. It is,\nhowever, obvious that it is impossible to find any definite relationship between changes\nin wage rate and changes in productivity. :\n\nWhen we have a period with rather definite and long lasting trends in productivity\nin different industries, we may expect the forces pointed out by the particular solutions\nsuch as, say, (14) and (16) to be dominating\u2014other components included in the model\nsolution having vanished through dampening. This suggests that we may expect not\nchanges in wage differentials, but the wage differentials themselves to be correlated with the\nchanges in productivity.\n\nAs for the employment, it is implied already by (4) alone that the level of the wage\nrate differential within the model is uniquely correlated with changes in employment.\n\nIn real life even this relationship between levels of wage differentials and rates of\nproductivity and employment changes may, however, be difficult to verify, because it is\nobscured by such things as unionism, local preferences, preferences for different kinds of\nwork, etc. Further the mechanism outlined above is surely less realistic under conditions\nof unemployment than under conditions of full employment.\n\nOslo.

Moreover,\na rigid price is quite consistent with profit maximisation in that each seller believes that\nan independent price policy will result in greater losses than gains. There is little evidence,\ntoo, that a low price policy by established firms will be successful in inhibiting potential\ncompetitors. The only certain and positive deterrent to entry is the presence in the\nmarket of energetic and progressive firms which are obviously exploiting all the possi-\nbilities. In the case of large firms external competition is reinforced by internal pressures.\nTop executives can seldom afford to relax for long or new men will take their places.\n\nLimited capital resources and uncertainty may make entrepreneurs cautious. For\nexample, the possession of liquid resources is essential but this consideration assumes far\ngreater importance for small firms than for large firms and is likely to be achieved by a\npolicy of short run profit maximisation. Borrowing on a large scale may involve loss of\ncontrol but profit maximisation must be understood as maximisation of one's own profits\nand not those of anyone else. Uncertainty may lead to conservative policies but risks\nmust be taken from time to time if the firm is to maintain its market position. The\nentrepreneur can never be sure that the risks he forswears will not be undertaken by others.\nInvestment is, after all, not gambling but action taken on the basis of informed knowledge.\n\nIn the absence of any objective test or criterion the answer to the question whether\nentrepreneurs maximise profits must lie in an examination of the market environment in\nwhich they work. To replace profit maximisation by utility maximisation is to render the\nanalysis meaningless and even misleading. \"We are in no position to assess the subjective\nprobability distributions in the minds of entrepreneurs or to know what is the utility of\nmoney to them. \"The one consistent and general influence upon entrepreneurs which the\neconomist is in a position to assess with any accuracy is the influence of competition. It\nis suggested that this influence must always work in the direction of maximum profits.\n\nSheffield. J. H.

Homo Economicus Neumanensis, the actor in the Theory of Games, applies the\nstrategy of minimaxing because he aspires to the maximum sure profit (m.s.p.) In the\nn-person zero-sum-game this endeavour leads to the formation of coalitions. In the\nnon-zero-sum-game it leads to the formation of a multilateral cartel between all real\nplayers.\n\n2. For the theory of peaceful oligopoly (differentiated or undifferentiated oligopoly)\nwhere coalitions are excluded by the prevailing standard of behaviour, the following policies\nwere examined :\n\n(a) '* Quasi-minimaxing \", i.e., the choice of that value of the strategic variable i\n(price or sales volume) that would yield the highest payoff if the other party maximizes\nits payoff for a given i. It was found that this policy does not yield m.s.p.\n\n(b) Ordinary minimaxing with strategies as elements (choosing e.g. the independence\nposition or the dependence position). It was found that the number of possible strategies\nto be considered is infinite\u2014each strategy of one party producing a new strategy of the\nOther party. Ofthe series of strategies thus generated, the series in one of the standard cases\nconsidered in this paper tended to the Cournot point as optimal strategy, the series in a\nsecond standard case tended to the dependence point.\n\nThis solution must be rejected as impractical.\n\n(c) A. Henderson's solution (quasi-minimaxing with strategies as element) does not\nyield m.s.p.\n\n3. If the parties act in a spirit of quasi-co-operation, they will try to increase the profit\nabove what will be actually obtained according to sub-section (25), by moving to a point\non the ** quasi-contract curve \", though only in exceptional cases this will happen to be\nthe point at which the joint profit is maximized. However, no procedure has been described\nby which, in absence of direct communication and agreement, the parties could reach this\ngoal. It proved impossible to extend the results obtained in the theory of bargaining to\noligopoly proper.\n\nNew York. H.

It might be objected that road transport is a small\nproportion of the total transport sector ; in fact, its net output was greater than railways,\nairways and harbours net output taken together.\n\nSeers emphasised the value of foreign trade statistics in the construction of an input-\noutput table. They are not as valuable as he imagined. For any class of imports we\nusually cannot separate into parts that which is merely passed, via a distributor, to final\ndemand, and that which is passing to various sectors in the form of intermediate goods.\nThus one usually has to rely on data from the demand side for imports, and we have seen\nthe difficulties there. Export figures do, of course, enable us to complete on entry in the\ndisposals side of a sector account, but naturally give no information for use in the inter-\nindustry transactions part of the table.\n\nWhen transactions between two sectors can be computed from data on one sector,\nbut not from the other transacting sector, as in the case of imports above, the valuable\nstatistical cross-checking properties of the technique are lost. Seers recognised that\n** one-sided \"' calculation would often be necessary, but did not mention the disadvantage\nof this.\n\nThese then were our experiences in attempting to compute sector accounts in Tangan-\nyika. We draw our conclusions in the final section.\n\nIV\n\nOn constructing both aggregates and sector accounts, we quite clearly found that the\nlatter required very much more work than the former ; in fact, as we have demonstrated,\noften it was statistically impossible to derive reasonable data on sector sales and purchases,\nwhilst fairly easy to estimate net output.\n\nThis meant that input-output analysis must be of a very great potential use to justify the\nexpenditure of large statistical resources on it. But, at least in Tanganyika, uses at present\nseem to be slight. For the lack of interdependence we suspected was amply confirmed.\nMany flows estimated after considerable work were negligible. Others could only be\nvery roughly quantified. And above all, a very high proportion of the elements in the\nmatrix were blank.\n\nIn view of the fact that considerable work is required for little result, we do not think\nunderdeveloped countries, with very limited statistical resources, should undertake input-\noutput work, before estimates are made of the national income, and possibly simple\nsocial accounts. The latter two sets of statistics offers the best return to scarce statistical\n$kill.

He, it\nwill be remembered, advocated the index because it best satisfied his various tests of mathe-\nmatical consistency, but there was no basis of utility theory in his advocacy, because the\nappropriate theory was not then available to him. It is remarkable that this index, develop-\ned originally without benefit of Slutsky, as it were, should now appear so strongly justifiable\nin the light of post-Slutskian demand theory, suitably aided by concepts taken from ordinary\ntheory as above. Perhaps the answer is that common sense, now supported by theory,\nmust always indicate that some average of **old\" and '*new\" weights is desirable ; any\nreasonable method of averaging will probably give an approximate result ; the proper\nmethod of averaging a pair of ratios is to take their geometric mean.

More\nplausible therefore would be random changes in proportionate expenditures. Now the\neffect of random changes in proportionate expenditures on our system would be much the\nsame as if proportionate expenditures were always constant, i.e., as if expenditure on any\nindividual commodity always changed by no more nor less than total expenditure. If so,\na certain specific result would be observed in equation (4.1). e; ey and e, no longer have\nindependent meaning, but it would seem that their sum would have to be unity. (This of\ncourse is the population value of the sum, the observed results would depend on the appli-\ncation of the law of converging probabilities, as elsewhere). Now this sum, which we might\nterm e, is always measurable by simple computation, since in all cases :\n\n! Professor Pigou also, it will be remembered, has strongly advocated the Fisher Index.

Nevertheless, an alternative solution may be obtained along marginal\nlines by substituting for the minimum liquidity constraint a utility function depicting the\ninvestor's preferences with respect to variance and expected yield. This utility function,\ncombined with the transformation function in variance and expected yield, gives the\nmarginal solution.\n\nThis solution may be obtained in the following manner. The basic equations of the\noriginal model were :\n(1) E \u2014 (e, \u2014 \u00a3j) Xo t.\nQ) V \u2014 (c\u00e0 \u2014 2005 o\u00bb -- 6?) X2 - X65 6, \u2014 9?)

(i) is shown with the earlier constraints\nupon X, The indifference curves are assumed to be of the normal shape, that is, concave\nto the E\u2014axis, and c, \u00ab c& \u00ab cy.

The riskiness of the portfolio is increased by the change in monetary\npolicy. In order to maintain his minimum liquidity standard, the investor must move\ninto Governments. This follows from the fact that Governments are still relatively less\nrisky than private securities. Thus, the investor must have recourse to Governments\nif he is to repair his liquidity position. A reduction in the availability of credit to the\nprivate sector ensures. If, at the time of the change in monetary policy, the investor were\nengaged in the process of unloading Government securities, the action of the central\nbank would either halt the unloading altogether or reduce the extent to which Govern-\nments could be sloughed off without endangering the investor's liquidity position.

                    "42 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nTwo kinds of risk will dominate the formation of the probability beliefs represented\nby the o's. First, there is uncertainty with respect to the prices at which the securities\ncan be sold before maturity. Secondly, there is the degree of certainty with which the\ninvestor may expect interest payments to be made and principal to be repaid. The first\nmay be designated as market risk, the second as credit risk. Private securities are subject\nto both kinds of risk. Government securities are not subject to credit risk. \"The degree\nof market risk to which they are subject depends upon monetary policy. The fact that\nGovernments are not subject to credit risk implies, however, a greater market risk for private\nthan for Government securities. Because of these uncertainty characteristics, the following\ncondition obtains :\n\n9; \u2014 op \u00ab 0.1\nIt may also be assumed that :\n\n\u00a3g \u2014 \u20acp \u00ab\u2014 0?\nand:\n\n0-\u2014cp-\u00ab13\n\n1 Thus, a fundamental assumption of the model is that, while changes in risk factors may affect the\nexpected values of the distributions of yields, they will always lead to changes in the dispersion of those\ndistributions, and, since risk must always be present to a greater degree in the private securities market,\nthat the dispersion of this distribution will always exceed that of the yield distribution for Governments.\n\nAlthough it is logically possible for changes in risk to affect only the mean value of the yield distribution,\nrealistically the possibility of this seems nil. For example, while the lessening of the credit risk on a given\nSecurity, say by the guarantee of principal and interest of the obligation of a smaller corporation by a\nlarge company, would lead to an upward shift in capital value and consequent downward shift in yield, it\nwould also decrease the anticipated range of fluctuation about that yield. To the extent, therefore, that\ncredit risk affects dispersion in this manner, only in its total absence would its impact on dispersion be\nzero. Hence, it seems reasonable to assume that, because of its presence in the private security market,\nthe above condition will hold.\n\nLastly, to the extent that investors expect central banks to put a floor and/or ceiling to fluctuations of\nGovernment security values, this conclusion is given further support from a direct truncation of the\ndispersion of the Government security distribution.\n\n? These conditions appear to be justified by the historical relationship among the yields of fixed interest\nbearing securities. The yields of equities, on the other hand, may bear a different relationship in a bull\n\nmarket.\n$8\n\npa \u2014 2(ed \u2014 2p eg op -- o3) Xs -- 2p ag sp \u2014 c3)\n\ndy\n\nax; \u2014 2(o; \u2014 2p og ap - 6?)\ndiy dy d*\n\u2014 is least when p \u2014 1, and then z 2(og \u2014 op) \u2014 0.

                    "The Availability Doctrine:\nTheoretical Underpinnings!\n\nThe availability doctrine has been cited in defense of monetary policy when the latter's\nefficacy has been questioned on the ground that borrowers may be insensitive to the cost\nof borrowing. According to the availability doctrine, a restrictive monetary policy\nmay cause a reduction in the quantity of credit supplied private borrowers by private\nlenders irrespective of the elasticity of demand for borrowed funds. \"This result would\nevidently imply a perfectly inelastic schedule of the supply of loanable funds and a shift\nof that schedule to the left.? The purpose of this paper is to formalize certain institutional\nfactors which may explain the characteristics of supply implied by the availability doctrine.\n\nThe pressures exerted by monetary policy upon lenders according to the availability\ndoctrine may be described in the following way. First, monetary policy may change the\ndegree of uncertainty in the Government securities market and hence affect the liquidity\nof the lender's portfolio. Secondly, there is the competitive effect upon the demand for\nprivate securities of changes in the prices of Government securities. The following model\ndepicts a particular equilibrium theory of assets suggested by these two aspects of the\navailability doctrine.\n\nAssume two kinds of fixed-interest bearing securities of equal maturity and given de-\nnomination to be available for selection, Government and private securities represented\nby g and p, respectively. Let X, stand for the proportion in par value terms of the portfolio\ncomposed of Governments, X, the proportion in private securities. Assume the investor\nremains fully invested ; that is, cash is zero. Also exclude short positions. These\nconstraints thus imply :\n\n1 \u2014 X,\u2014 X,\u20140\nand :\nX,20, X,20\n\nLet r4 and r, be the rates of return on g and p, respectively. The expected yield of\nthe portfolio is :\nE \u2014 X,c, P Xp tp\nwhere ej and e, are the expected values of r, and r,, respectively.?\n\nThe variance of the expected yield of the portfolio is :\nV \u2014 X2c 4- 2X, X, go, 0, - X2 o\nwhere o, and o; represent the standard deviations of r; and r,, respectively, and eo, o,\ntheir covariance.*\n\n1 This paper was first presented to the Economics Faculty Seminar of the University of Minnesota.\nIn addition to the members of that seminar, the author wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to Sterie\nT. Beza, Robert E. Kuenne, Alvin Marty, Emmet C. Stopher and Frederick C. Mosteller for helpful comments\nand suggestions.\n\n? Jn other words, if the schedule of supply is perfectly inelastic and if it shifts to the left, the elasticity\nof demand will not affect the extent to which the flow of funds is reduced. \u2014 This will be true even if demand\nis perfectly inelastic, for in that case supply takes precedence over demand.

It then becomes impossible to say whether\nsuch a tax would result in more or less risk taking than a comprehensive income or\nexpenditure tax without making assumptions about the relationship between risk taking\nand capital gains and losses. Where net capital gains are expected, such a tax will reduce\nyields less than in proportion to risk. \"Where net capital losses are expected, such a tax\nwill reduce yields more than in proportion to risk. If expectations and realizations always\nagreed, presumably these differences would disappear through proper adjustment of tax\nrates to equate revenue yields. But if they are not equal, then a genuine difference in\neffects on risk taking can persist.\n\n5. We conclude, then, that proportional comprehensive income and expenditure\ntaxes are theoretically similar in their effects on risk taking, and that it is very possible for\nthem to discriminate in favour of it rather than act neutrally like a capital tax. \"Whether\nor not comprehensive income and expenditure taxes are practically similar in their effects\ndepends ultimately on the design and feasibility of the two taxes and the actual reaction\nofinvestors.

            "found": "STAMP DUTIES AS A CAPITAL GAINS TAX: COMMENT 57\n\nWe turn now to situation (3) : a sales tax is substituted for the purchase tax. The\nsupply curve moves up to the left, by just the rate of tax. The demand curve, released\nfrom the immediate burden of this first payment of tax, moves up by just the rate of tax,\ncoming to rest at a position below the original pre-tax position by the discounted value\nof subsequent taxes ; that is to say, the discounting, to a present value, of the indefinite\nnumber of prospective tax payments continues to act as a depressant on the demand curve.\nIn terms of the numerical illustration above, the offer for 1,000 shares is now $80, not $79,\nsince a resale at $80, less $1 sales tax, would produce a loss of $1 that would bring the\nnet yield down to $4, or 5 per cent on the investment.\n\nSince both curves, under the sales tax, move up by just the tax rate, from where they\nwere under the purchase tax, the price rises, through this tax substitution, by just the tax\nrate, and the volume of transactions is the same under both taxes. The change in point\nof impact has not given rise to a change in true incidence.?\n\nIf, to borrow from the investor case, all but one of the speculators are exempt, there\nwill be no discounting of future taxes, even though speculators, by definition, look forward\nto resale. If the tax is on purchases, the prospective purchaser who is not a charitable\ninstitution, although he would like to be able to get his shares for less than $100, will not\nbe able to do so ; he must pay the $100, to compete with the mass of untaxed buyers.\nHe must accept a lowering of his rate of return on share investment, if he is to stay in the\nmarket. Similarly, a tax on sales, despite the prospect of its indefinite repetition whenever\na taxable seller appears, is not discounted ; it does not affect price. Accordingly, under\na purchase tax, the one taxable speculator bears the full burden of a tax that is a function\nof the purchase price paid by the preceding holder plus the gain or loss realized by that\nholder. 4A tax on sales, for that same speculator, imposes on him a burden that varies\nwith his own purchase price plus his own capital gain or loss.\n\nNew York. CanL S. SHoUP.\n\n? The opposite conclusion, reached by Mr. Kennedy, appears to be due to the fact that he seems not\nto take into account both sides of the next transaction. '' The shift of formal incidence from purchaser\nto seller does not release the speculative purchaser from having to pay the duty. For he will have to pay\nit when he sells the share he has bought ; since he is ex hypothesi a speculator, he will take the duty into\naccount when buying.\" Loc. cit., p. 242. But now his prospective purchaser will have no tax to pay,\nhence will be willing to pay correspondingly when the time comes, and will not this fact exactly counter-\nbalance, in our speculator's mind, the fact that he himself will have to pay a tax at that time ?\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 07:07:32 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

            "found": "Stamp Duties as a Capital Gains Tax:\na Reply\n\nI am greatly indebted to Professor Shoup for having so courteously drawn attention\nto the specious argument I used in my earlier note when I was considering the influence\nof speculators on the market. Professor Shoup is primarily concerned with the theory\nof incidence as such, and since I am entirely in agreement with his excellent analysis, I\nshall not comment further on this aspect. Perhaps I may be allowed, however, to add\ntwo points on the practical issue.\n\nProfessor Shoup, with the help of his numerical illustration (p.), argues that, when\nthe point of impact is shifted from buyer to seller, the speculative buyer will raise his offer\nprice by just the amount of the tax, because he will then obtain the same yield as before\non his speculative instrument. I agree in principle, but it seems to me worth pointing out\nthat it is a very nice calculation of yields which leads to this result. In terms of Professor\nShoup's numerical illustration, the speculator who buys at $80 and sells at $80 will get\n5 per cent on his money. If he bought at $79 and sold at $79 he would get 5:06 per cent.\nThe difference in yield must seem very small to someone not primarily interested in yield\nconsiderations. In my earlier note, I was clearly not justified in arguing that the presence\nof speculators would frustrate the rise in share price as a result of the change in point of\nimpact. Nevertheless, it would seem reasonable to hold that the speculator will not be\nvery important in determining the market's reaction to the change\u2014or, perhaps more\ncorrectly, that it will be his guess about the reaction of the rest of the market that will be\nimportant. And if the speculators are ready to acquiesce in the reactions of the rest of\nthe market, then the relative strength in the market of the tax-exempt dealers will be some-\nwhat enhanced, though I certainly would not pretend that this is very great.\n\nThe second point is perhaps more important. In my original note, I argued that\nthe authorities could achieve a rough and ready capital gains tax by raising stamp duties\nin times of high market values, provided the incidence of the tax was squarely on the seller.\nNow it seems to me clear, once again from Professor Shoup's very helpful numerical\nillustration, that the incidence of the tax is indeed on the seller, whatever the point of\nimpact. There seems to be therefore a prima facie case for a policy of this kind. If the\ncase were accepted, would there be any value in shifting the point of impact from buyer\nto seller ? I still think it would be a sensible thing to do : for, if the taxation of capital\ngains is regarded as just, justice must not only be done but also be seen to be done.\n\nOxford.

I have not been able to find any\nstatement either in his original article or in his Reply which would support this inter-\npretation. As, however, Mr. Pearce is the author of the model, his interpretation must\nbe accepted. And this means that all discussion of stability is precluded by the conditions\nof the model. We simply do not know what happens if the economy is not in equilibrium,\nand there is, therefore, no point in asking whether it moves towards or away from it.\n\nIf we neglect all minor misunderstandings due to unavoidable obscurities and in-\nconsistencies in formulation, the following points seem to emerge from our discussion :\n\n(1) In Mr. Pearce's model the monopolistic producers determine their demand and\nmarginal revenue curves by experimenting with different volumes of output in the conditions\nof full employment and of constant total money incomes.\n\n(2) The producers determine their cost curves on the basis of their production\nfunctions and on the basis of the prevailing prices of factors, which the producers expect\nto remain constant.\n\n(3) The consumers save a part of their incomes, but changes in saving and, therefore,\nin total spending have no effect on the amount of the productive resources employed\n(factor prices always change so as to accommodate changes in spending).\n\n(4) If savings increase (f\u00e1ll) with an increase (fall) in real income, no equilibrium\u2014\nin the sense of all producers! marginal costs being equal to their marginal revenues\u2014is\npossible at any point which is not the maximum welfare point.\n\n(5) Whether equality of marginal costs with marginal revenues is possible at the\nmaximum welfare point depends on the producers! manoeuvres by means of which they\nhave determined their demand and marginal revenue curves.\n\n(6) Equilibrium in the sense of all producers! marginal costs being equal to their\nmarginal revenues does not necessarily imply that their profits are at a maximum. It\nis possible that profits of some of them (or even of all of them) are at a minimum.\n\n(7) The conditions of the model do not permit us to say whether the producers tend\nto move towards the maximum welfare point or away from it (if they happen to be not\nin equilibrium).\n\nTo these conclusions I think we must nowallagree.

It has been shown that in my model there is a limit to the\nrate of price deflation if a monetary system is to exist, unless money balances can bear a\nnegative rate of interest. Further, there are no difficulties about a monetary equilibrium\nin the case of increasing productivity. There is no '' ever faster rate of price decline \".\nIndeed, there is no change in the relative advantages of holding money and other assets.\n\nIV CONCLUSION\n\nThe examination of the conditions required for the compatibility of any behaviour\nof the price level with equilibrium has been undertaken on the general assumptions of perfect\nflexibility of prices and perfect foresight. It has been shown that what is required is a\nmedium of exchange on which positive or negative rates of interest can be imposed. If\nmoney must bear a zero money rate of interest, it has been shown that there are limits\nto the rates of change in the price level beyond which the monetary system breaks down.\nFurther, in this case the rate of fall of the price level must not exceed some value which will\nbe below the marginal productivity of capital.  '\n\nAn important distinction between a change of prices due to changes in the quantity\nof money and in productivity is made. Its importance lies in the fact that the equilibrium\nmoney rate of interest must be higher than the marginal productivity of capital if an in-\ncreasing quantity of money is causing the price level to rise, as an allowance is required\nfor the depreciation in the value of money. A similar allowance is required in the case of\na stable price level when productivity is increasing. In both cases money balances bear\na positive rate of interest.\n\nSheffield. J. C.

If the central bank increases the quantity of idle money\n(without decreasing the supply of some other asset) the recipients of this money may be\nin varying degrees bulls or bears. The more bullish they are the more will the bond rate\nbe reduced. '' If, on the other hand, all receivers of the payments of the central bank are\nbears with respect to bond holding, no change in the rate of interest will occur . . .\"! In\nour terminology this means that k \u2014 1.\n\nIn his recent contribution Professor Patinkin also emphasises the wealth effect of\nchanges in the quantity of money on the demand for money and the effective demand for\nbonds. As the quantity of money increases '* there is a positive real-balance effect on the\nspeculative demand. However, since this effect operates in other markets as well this\nincreased speculative demand must be less than the initial increase in the amount of\nmoney.\"?\n\nIII\n\nThe conclusions of this paper can be summarised briefly. Its basic contention is\nthat the amount of money which people desire to hold as a store of wealth depends not\nonly on the rate of interest but also upon the total amount of wealth available. As the\nstock of idle money is part of that wealth changes in this stock may lead to changes in the\ndesire to hold money.\n\nIt is useful to distinguish between demand curves for money (drawn on the assumption\nof constant wealth) and interest-reaction curves (drawn on the assumption of changing\namounts of money, and, hence, wealth). The former shows the reaction of the rate of\ninterest to changes in the quantity of money effected by open-market operations ; the\nlatter shows the reaction of the rate of interest to ceteris paribus changes in the quantity\nof money. The two curves will coincide if the marginal propensity to hold money (X) is\nZero.\n\nSome presentations of the Liquidity Preference Theory seem to have implicitly made\nthe interest-reaction curve coincide with the demand curve. Mr. Turvey, on the other hand,\ndistinguishes between the two and their different applicabilities.\n\nThe general wealth effect of changes in the quantity of money (or bonds) the impli-\ncations of which this paper attempted to clarify has been treated implicitly or explicitly\nin several theories.\n\nLiverpool.

There is a different Leontief demand function for each type of index formula used.\nIn particular, the elasticity of aggregate demand depends upon the choice from\nalternative arithmetic and geometric formulae. If arithmetic indexes are used,\nthe elasticity of aggregate demand is essentially variable, even though the individual\nelasticities of demand are constant ; if geometric indexes are used, the elasticity\nof aggregate demand will be constant if the individual elasticities of demand are\nconstant.\n\nB. lf arithmetic indexes are used, there is a different Leontief demand function for\neach set of relative prices. If a geometric Laspeyres quantity index is adopted,\nand if the individual demand elasticities are constant, the elasticity of aggregate\ndemand is invariant under changes in relative prices.\n\nC. Only in special cases (see footnote 1 page 200) do geometric indexes satisfy the\nrequirement that PQ be proportional to the total outlay on the group. If\narithmetic indexes are used, proportionality can be achieved by the appropriate\nmatching of Laspeyres' and Paasche's indexes or by using '' ideal\" indexes.\n\nMcGill and Cambridge. MunnaY C.

From the point of view of instantaneous maximization at a given\ntime, the balance-sheet \u00eds indeterminate and merely a historical accident.\n\nIt can be suggested that in view of these arguments it is perhaps better to abandon\nthe principle of mazimization of utility at any given moment, and to introduce an altogether\ndifferent principle governing the individual's behaviour. Such a principle should presum-\nably control the movement from one stable point to another, or better still it should imply\nstability at * stable positions\" as a special case. 1 have experimented in this manner with\nthe maximisation of the speed with which the new stable position is attained, and with the\nmaximization of the rate of increase of utility at any given time ; but neither of these has\ngiven satisfactory results. \"There must be other assumptions which give a better per-\nformance and are at the same time intuitively acceptable ; but up to now I have not been\nable to find one.\n\nStill, the theory set out above suggests several verifiable relations which only depend\non the concept of stable positions ; and I think these need not be affected by the introduc-\ntion of a new principle. First, it is implied that the stock of a particular commodity held\nis a function of prices and net worth. \u2014Cross-section analyses should reveal some analogue\nto the Engel curve for individual stocks as a function of net worth. Second, if only\nstable positions are considered\u2014i.e., if we restrict ourselves to cases where no accumu-\nlation occurs\u2014there should be a functional relation between net worth and income.\nConversely, savings should depend on the actual ratio of net worth to income. \u2014 All such\nhypotheses hold, of course, strictly only for individuals with identical preferences ; it may\nbe expected that in this respect age-groups will do for a study of balance-sheets what\nfamily size grouping already does for the analysis of family budgets.\n\nAs for the suggested adaptation of demand to a change in income, it rests on one hand\non the assumption of a straight-line approximation for the path followed by the balance-\nsheet ; the introduction of a new principle governing the choice of this path may leave\nsuch an approximation unaffected. On the other hand, however, it must be pointed out\nthat the assumption of linear depreciation formulae enters to a large extent in the form of\nthe final results ; indeed, this strong assumption is the main factor making for the similarity\nof the present approach with the results of the model given by Stone and Rowe [5].\n\nCambridge.

Naturally it is a matter of degree : a\nsixpence-in-the-pound tax will not worry anyone very much. But if the large public com-\npany remains a maximum profit firm irrespective of the level of taxation, the same is less\nlikely to apply to the individual entrepreneur whose firm was a maximised profit firm\nlargely owing to his own personality, his peculiar attitude to money and income. There\nmust be many who previously restricted themselves to the same, rather frugal, standard\nof living irrespective of the prosperity of their firm, but who have reacted to the current\nhigh levels of taxation by sporting Bentleys and other unaccustomed luxuries. It is called\nan Expense and paid for by the firm, but the Inland Revenue know it more accurately as\nIncome, however disguised. It is not hard to show that an entrepreneur can be better off\nby spending more in the form of such expenses even though his residual profits are reduced.\nThus, the entrepreneur's standard of living may vary in inverse proportion to the profits\nof his firm. Theoretically\u2014and pace the Income Tax Inspector\u2014he is best off at zero\nprofit. Doubly so, because such expenses, being allowable for tax, cost just about half what\nthey would cost if paid for by the entrepreneur himself, quite apart from the personal\nIncome Tax he would be paying on his income.\n\nTaxation is the biggest influence counteracting the general modern tendency for firms\nto tend towards maximum profits. It may be a temporary phenomenon ; possibly it is\nnot the actual level of taxation which makes entrepreneurs behave like this, but the rapid\nchange in levels. If tax rates, however high, remain stable the system of bogus expenses\nmay gradually disappear, and the proportion of maximum profit firms will go on increasing.\nFrom the point of view of those who desire economic growth of the American type\u2014or\neven the Soviet type\u2014such a development is highly desirable. Maybe the economic solution\nfor Europe lies in the rapid elimination of utilized profit firms except as lacunae in the econ-\nomy ; and above all in the elimination of the utilized profit mentality.\n\nBradford.

The system outlined above does not claim to be a fully fledged theory of the rate\nof interest.

Examination of the equilibrium conditions of the market as a whole reveals certain\nrelationships which must hold between the total quantities of the two types of *' real\"\nassets, the margins of net worth employed by speculative holders of these assets\nand the price of bonds.

The\nquantity of ** real \" money is M, the amount of I.O.U.s outstanding is 7, and the aggregate\nvalue of bear bonds outstanding, valued at X, is B.

For the market as a whole,\ntotal net worth is B, 4- M, being of course equal to the total of those assets which are not\nat the same time liabilities of members of the market. The amounts of bear bonds and\nL.O.U.s outstanding need not be equal. It is quite possible for the market as a whole\nto be short on bonds, or on money. We define the extent to which it is as a whole short on\nbonds as w \u2014 B4 \u2014 I; if w \u00ab 0, the market is short on money.\n\n2. Now let the price of bonds decrease by y' to X'.

The only difference between the two expressions is that in (IVa) the magnitude a;\nappears in the denominator, while in (VIa) it has been moved up into the numerator.\nThus the relative deviation of X; (1) from X ; (f) can be found for the five cases 4 through E.\nThe three results, for 4 through C, have been tabulated in Table IV. The general impression\nto be gained from Table IV is that in the three cases considered, Y ; (7) is a far poorer approxi-\nmation to X;(f) than was Y,(r). At time 10, for example, in cases A4 and C the relative\ndeviations are still around 26 per cent, and it will take more than 50 time units from zero\nto reduce the relative deviation to less than five per cent.

I did not want to restrict myself to the condition of zero profits\nalthough this had been suggested as the natural consequence of free entry under competition\nand is associated with the efficiency criteria of linear programming theory. This, of course,\nis an old story. The second order conditions of profit maximisation do not hold for the\ncase of perfect competition with production functions homogeneous of the first degree\u2014\nexplicit form. 1t is the \"exhaustion of product\" problem associated with marginal\nproductivity rewards being paid to all factors, and I feel that it is unfortunate that Morishima\ndesires to base his argument on the peculiarities of this much discussed and much analysed\nproblem. \"Whether one gets maximum profits or not, it can be argued that factors are\nindividually paid according to their marginal productivity and that the total value of output\nis so distributed. Then all my equations hold ; the system of production functions are\nhomogenous of degree zero\u2014implicit form ; and Morishima's sought after property\nprevails. This is very nearly a generalisation of Samuelson's theorem to joint production.\n\nIam much interested in the extension of my interpretation of the Leontief input-output\nsystem to the realm of imperfect competition. This is surely the realistic case and is the\ncase in which the technological basis for constancy of input-output coefficients disappears.\nThe coefficients, in this case, are truly a m\u00e9lange of all types of economic parameters and\nsubject to all the variabilities of human tastes, attitudes, and beliefs, as well as to production\ntechniques. Under these conditions, the market structure of imperfect competition, there\nis no longer any necessary incompatibility between true profit maximisation and homo-\ngeneity of degree zero for the production function. 1t is then possible to have fixed pro-\nportions among physical quantities provided prices remain constant. However, with\nmarket imperfections it is even less likely than in a competitive economy that either relative\nor absolute prices will be unaffected by an /-fold increase in final demand ; hence my\nappraisal of Morishima's case as somewhat pathological.\n\nMorishima's paper serves the purpose of exposing the difficulties confronting input-\noutput theorists when they attempt to interpret their system of empirical regularities.\nIt is variously interpreted as a system of technological relations and as a system of general\nequilibrium equations in the Walrasian sense. It is, in fact, neither. The implicit con-\nfounding of prices and physical quantities without an explicit theory of either type of variable\nprevents the interpretation of input-output analysis along these lines. In a general\nequilibrium system there ought to be a genuine set of technological relations defined in\nterms of physical quantities. In addition, there should be price formation or determination\nequations. The lack of price formation theory and a technological foundation are precisely\nthe aspects forcing Morishima to go to the extreme of assuming prices constant in order to\nmake a statement about quantities. By assuming prices to be a set of constants, he, of\ncourse, avoids the complications they introduce in the system of equations.\n\nOxford. L. R.

Now the quantity of money must increase gradually during the period.\nSince there are no lags in Mr. Ritter's behaviour equations, income (regarded as an\ninstantaneous rate) will therefore do the same. Given all the other determinants, therefore,\nthe increment of income over the previous period will depend upon the average increment\nin the stock of money as compared with the previous period.!

To the extent that consumer sovereignty is one of our values, ought we to\nallow people to behave imprudently? Should we permit them the strategy of precom-\nmitment ?\u2014e.g., should a man be allowed to sell himself into bondage for the sake of an\nimmediate gratification of desires ?! What ought to be our view of the irrevocable trust,\nespecially if the maker tries to revoke it? At which date should sovereignty inhere in the\nmaker? And ought we to instruct people to substitute a log-linear discount function for\nthe true one ? If so, should the constant K be selected so that the derivatives of the log-\nlinear function and the true one are equal at / \u2014 \u00ab ? Why should this be the appropriate\nvalue ?\n\nMy view is that these questions are difficult to answer mainly because consumer\nsovereignty has no meaning in the context of the dynamic decision-making problem. The\nindividual over time is an infinity of individuals, and the familiar problems of interpersonal\nutility comparisons are there to plague us. The interpersonal aspect of the intertemporal\nproblem becomes clear if we think of a similar problem involving a family of brothers\nwhere each has a utility functional depending not only on his own utility but upon a weighted\nsum of the utilities of all of them. Suppose the oldest brother always has the power to\nallocate the annual proceeds of an estate, but with it being foreknown that each year one\nbrother will die off, the oldest next. The shifting of the discount function of the family head\ngives rise to the danger of inconsistent planning ; and the family head of the moment may\nconsider the alternative strategies of (a) an irrevocable trust, or (5) playing his favorites\nextra heavily now knowing that they will be out of favor at a later date. What can the\ndetached view of consumer sovereignty be in this context !\n\nPigou? and others have regarded ** myopia \" as an excuse for state intervention in\ndetermining allocations over time (investment). But on what basis ought the state to\nmake these decisions ? Ramsey? contended that all weights should be equal; but at\nleast for those problems involving the allocation of a limited stock of goods over time\n(i.e., the problem of ** conservation \"), this proposal becomes meaningless if one contem-\nplates future generations ad infinitum.\n\nMore questions have been raised here than I am prepared to answer ; but somewhat\nout of practical considerations I would suggest the following : The individual can probably\ndo as good a job as the state or any other agency in determining allocations for himself\nas of future dates, provided the future dates include none which are proximate. That is\nto say that I would have confidence in the judiciousness of a person to-day, if he is not\nignorant of future facts, to decide how much to save and how much to spend for the rest\nof his life, starting a couple of years from now. | Mr. Smith is probably in as good a position\nto evaluate the relative importance of the Mr. Smith of 1960 and the Mr. Smith of 1970\nas anybody else, and I would therefore permit him, in the absence of risk and uncertainty,\nto precommit his future allocations provided the period of precommitment did not begin for\na couple more years. The real decisions to worry about are those where an immediate\nor proximate satisfaction is gained at the expense of still-more-future costs.  Precom-\nmitment may be regarded as either good or evil depending upon whether the period of\nprecommitment begins now or later.\n\n! Typically, our common law has held many contracts that partake of this character to be unenforceablc.\nThe problem here, ethically, is akin to that of whether a body politic should be permittcd to vote itself into\na dictatorship.\n\n?

These lapses are the splurges, binges, and\nextravagances which we all know.!\n\nThis picture is typical, I suppose for most of us, but there are no doubt some who,\neither through lack of training or insight, have never learned to behave consistently and\nfor whom the intertemporal tussle remains unsolved. These people we call '' spend-\nthrifts.\"? By contrast, those who have taken on log-linear discount functions havc\nlearned to be '\" thrifty.\"\n\nSpendthriftiness, in the general sense of inconsistent or imprudent planning,? is by\nno means insignificant. It is especially among the lower-income classes, where education\nand training are commonly blighted, that one would expect to find imprudent behaviour\nof this sort.* In America, lower-income people tend to gorge themselves with food after\npay-day ; overheat their homes when they have money for a bucket of coal ; are extrava-\ngant, going on sprees on pay-day, not budgeting their money, and engaging in heavy\ninstalment buying ; do not keep their children in school ; and are freer in the expression\nof their sexual and aggressive impulses.? \"Their high birth rate is well-known. All thesc\nbehaviour characteristics can be explained as a failure to cope intelligently with the problem\nof the intertemporal tussle. Obviously, this is not the entire story ; but the observations\nare consistent with the hypothesis presented, and it would be upsetting if thc facts werc\notherwise.\n\nThe character of behaviour under precommitment is more difficult to label. Its\nresults are somewhat ambiguous. Sometimes precommitment causes an individual to\nsacrifice future pleasures heavily for the sake of present ones, e.g., to go into debt to make\npossible an expenditure providing mostly present gratification. But at other times precom-\nmitment seems more '* wholesome,\"? as when a person contracts to save a certain amount\neach month or goes into debt to buy a house. The distinction, I feel, is this : in the one\ncase the present is heavily favored at the expense of the future ; in the other an allocation\nis made among various dates of the future in accordance with weights given by the lower,\nbut more level portion of the A(t \u2014 4) function, as depicted in Figure 3. Precommitment\nthen has the effect of precluding grossly unequal allocation within that future period of time\nonce it moves into the present.\n\n! To one who would say that to discount the future for remoteness at all scems to him foolish and\nirrational, I should reply that he is one who received very strong training as a child which went beyond\nsimply teaching him the strategy of consistent planning and effected such a change in his tastes that he\nnow finds it unnatural to discount the future on this account. | Moralizing against discounting the future\nin this way has, of course, found its way into the prominent literature on this subject. See, e.g., B\u00f3hm-\nBawerk, op. cit., pp. 253-255.\n\n? If the X(t\u20145) function rose to the right of \u00ab, inconsistency between plans and behaviour would lead\nto ** miserliness \" with the individual saving for a Tuture planned expenditure which he continuously post-\npones. True miserliness would, however, appear to be better explained in other terms, money or wealth\nbecoming an object of desire per se.\n\n* The '* spendthrift \" might, of course, also be defined as anyone who discounts the future because of\nits remoteness, but I think this catches somewhat less satisfactorily the essence of the term because such a\nperson may behave quite prudently\u2014empty moralizing aside. | Mr. Thore has pointed out, however, that\nmy spendthrift might display more conservative behaviour than another person who has a lower k even\nthough he plans consistently.\n\n* Perhaps in some underdeveloped economies this problem would take on its most serious dimensions.\nThe notion that the incidence of the sharp discounting of the future is greater among \"' primitive races,\nchildren, and other uninstructive groups in'society \" was asserted clearly by Fisher in The Theory of\nInterest, ch. I\" $8 9, and earlier by Jevons in 7T/te Theory of Political Economy, ch. II and B\u00f3hm-Bawerk,\nOp. Cif., p. .\n\n$ See W.

Winch, 7T/ie Modern Familv, 1952, pp. 93-94. These authors ascribe these behaviour patterns to anxiety\nfeelings stemming from the insecurity that results from low and irregular income. It is not clear to me\nwhy this anxiety should lead to spendthriftiness rather than to miserliness or to painstaking family budgeting.\nIf the facts were the opposite, would one feel any less comfortable with the explanation given?\n\n5$ The word is in quotes because we do not intend to provide moral judgments at this point.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 15:29:20 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

THE DISCOUNT FUNCTION\n\nSpecial attention should be given, I feel, to a discount function, such as that shown\nin Figure 3, which differs from a logarithmically linear one in that it '* over-values \" the\nmore proximate satisfactions relative to the more distant ones.! Such a function suggests\nthat individuals who precommit their future actions or who naively resolve now what\nthey ** will do \" in the future, commonly do not schedule the beginning of austerity until\na later date. How familiar the sentence that begins, * I resolve, starting next . . .\" ! It\nseems very human for a person who decides that he ought to increase his savings to plan\nto start next month, after first satisfying some current desires ; or for one to decide to\nquit smoking or drinking after the week-end, or to say that '* the next one is the last one.\"\n\nIt has been customary for the United States Army to offer voluntary enlistees a\nfurlough starting with the date of enlistment. This practice is not needed to enable a\nman to put his affairs in order\u2014he can do that first and then enlist\u2014but it does serve\nas an enticement to those who want the paternalism ('* security \") of the army, but do not\nwant it right now.? The many schemes for instalment buying (notably of used automo-\nbiles in the U.S.) which require * no down payment and nothing due for two months \"\nare evidence of the effectiveness of enticements of this same kind. Indeed, all purchases\non credit can be viewed as precommitments that often (although not always) exchange\nfuture costs for a present pleasure.?\n\nMy own supposition is that most of us are *' born\" with discount functions of the\nsort considered here, that precommitment is only occasionally a feasible strategy (because\nof risk and uncertainty), and that we are taught to plan consistently by substituting the\nproper log-linear function for the true one. Children are known to discount the future\nmost precipitously and the *' virtue \" of frugality is something to be instilled when building\n* character.\" True discount functions become sublimated by parental teaching and\nsocial pressure, and the inconsistency problem considered in this paper becomes lost from\nsight. \"There is a rationale for discounting at a constant rate of interest. In some cases\ntraming may be so effective that the individual's original discount function can no longer\nbe said to be his \"true\" one. His tastes have changed and his discount function has\nbecome log-linear or perhaps even constant. Hisis the '* harmony \" case. Precommitment,\ntherefore, is never attractive to him\u2014even under certainty. In other cases,* however, we\nmay say instead that a person has been taught to plan and behave consistently and not\nthat his tastes have been molded. His is not the harmony case. Such a person will, from\ntime to time, depart from the consistent pattern of behaviour, sometimes because pre-\ncommitment becomes feasible (and this is always his preferred strategy under conditions\nbecause precommitment becomes feasible (and this is always his preferred strategy under\nconditions of certainty) and sometimes because of lapses that result when the true weight\n\n! As an empirical supposition, there is a precedent for this in B\u00f3hm-Bawerk, op. cit., pp. 257-258,\n. the original subjective undervaluations are, in the highest degree, unequal and irregular. 'In particular,\nso o far as the undervaluation is caused by defects of will, there may be a strong difference between an enjoy-\nment which offers itself at the very moment, and one which does not ; while, on the other hand, there may\nbe a very small difference, or no difference at all, between an enjoyment which is pretty far away, and one\nwhich is farther away.\" Tn context it is clear that he is'r eferring here to changes in the rate of discount.\nThis same possibility was considered by Marshall, op. cit., Mathematical Appendix, Note V.\n\n*Since marriage was mentioned earlier alongside joining the army as a possible precommitment\nstrategy, I cannot avoid remarking facetiously that marriage too is commonly preceded by a period of\nengagement!\n\n3 There are, of course, other important reasons for buying on credit.\n\n* For the distinction made here I am indebted to Mr. W.

It is not enough that these should be monotonically increasing functions\nof one another because of the variational nature of the problem. Each must be a positive\nscalar multiple of the other, so that the scalar can be factored out of the integrand function\nand placed in front of the integral sign. Thus, if (t \u2014 * \u2014 A\u00ab) \u2014 constant x X(t \u2014 4),\nthe solution to which is X(1 \u2014 \u00ab) \u2014 K'\u2014*, with the constant ratio equal to k^ ^7, we have:\n\nT\nOQ.

Should\n1 enter the problem in a more general way than by merely causing a linear shift of the\ndiscount function, the problem of consistent planning becomes more involved. However,\neven though the instantaneous utility function or the basic constraints do change with the\npassage of time, if the individual does not take these future changes into account in deciding\nwhat to do now, our analysis will still have validity for any fixed point of time.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 15:29:20 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "MYOPIA AND INCONSISTENCY 173\n\nVI. TWO STRATEGIES IN THE FACE OF INCONSISTENCY\n\nAn individual who because he does not discount all future pleasures at a constant\nrate of interest finds himself continuously repudiating his past plans may learn to distrust\nhis future behaviour, and may do something about it. Two kinds of action are possible.\n(1) He may try to precommit his future activities either irrevocably or by contriving a\npenalty for his future self if he should misbehave. This we call the strategy of precommit-\nment. (2) He may resign himself to the fact of intertemporal conflict and decide that his\n* optimal\" plan at any date is a will-o'-the-wisp which cannot be attained, and learn to\nselect the present action which will be best in the light of future disobedience. This we\ncall the strategy of consistent planning. \u2014'T'hese possibilities will be discussed in order.\n\nl. The Strategy of Precommitment. 'To-day it will be rational for a man to jettison\nhis * optimal \" plan of yesterday, not because his tastes have changed in any unexpected\nway nor because his knowledge of the future is different, but because to-day he is a different\nperson with a new discount function\u2014the old one shifted forward in time. Yet it is also\nrational for the man to-day to try to ensure that he will do tomorrow that which is best\nfrom the standpoint of to-day's desires. Unpleasant things which to-day we want to do\nsometime in the future are continually put off until tomorrow (the *' mafiana effect ^\")\nunless we can find some way of precommitting ourselves to actually doing the task tomorrow.\nConsequently, we are often willing even to pay a price to precommit future actions (and\nto avoid temptation). Evidence of this in economic and other social behaviour is not\ndifficult to find. It varies from the gratuitous promise, from the familiar phrase *' Give\nme a good kick if I don't do such and such \" to savings plans such as insurance policies\nand Christmas Clubs which may often be hard to justify in view of the low rates of return.\n(I select the option of having my annual salary dispersed to me on a twelve- rather than on a\nnine-month basis, although I could use the interest!) Personal financial management\nfirms, such as are sometimes employed by high-income professional people (e.g., actors),\nwhile having many other and perhaps more important functions, represent the logical\nconclusion of the desire to precommit one's future economic activity. Joining the army\nis perhaps the supreme device open to most people, unless it be marriage for the sake\nof *' settling down.\" And, of course, regretting either course later on (at least for the\nmoment) is to be expected, for otherwise precommitment would have had no purpose.\nThe worker whose income is garnished chronically or who is continually harassed by\ncreditors, and who, when one oppressive debt is paid, immediately incurs another is\ncommonly precommitting. There is nothing irrational about such behaviour (quite the\ncontrary) and attempts to default on debts are simply the later consequences which are to\nbe expected. Inability to default is the force of the precommitment.\n\nWhat needs to be explained is not that people do precommit their future actions, but\nthat the practice is not still more wide-spread. The reason it is not, I believe, is because\nof the presence of risk and uncertainty, both as to future tastes and future opportunities.\nBecause of risk and uncertainty, people are also willing to pay for options permitting them\na greater range of choice at future dates! and this is of overwhelming importance, especially\nas it affects the detailed aspects of future behaviour.\n\n2. The Strategy of Consistent Planning. Since precommitment is not always a feasible\nsolution to the problem of intertemporal conflict, the man with insight into his future\nunreliability may adopt a different strategy and reject any plan which he will not follow\nthrough. His problem is then to find the best plan among those that he will actually\nfollow.\n\n! See Tjalling C. Koopmans, ** Utility Analysis of Decisions Affecting Future Well-Being,\" (abs.),\nEconometrica, April, 1950, 18: 174-175, and *' La notion d'utilit\u00e9 dans le cas de d\u00e9cisions concernant\nle bien-\u00e9tre futur \", Cahiers du S\u00e9minaire d'Econom\u00e9trie, ed.

It requires that the discount function be of a very\nspecial form, namely that all future dates should be discounted at a constant rate of interest.!\n\nThis is what our intuition should lead us to expect. In the language of the discrete\ncase, a discount function of this sort means that the relative importance of 1957 and 1958\nis the same in 1957 as in 1956. Consequently, when in 1956 one decides how to apportion\nconsumption between 1957 and 1958, this is the same decision one would make in 1957.\nThus, in 1957 the plan laid down in 1956 is confirmed.\n\nBut so far we have adduced no reason why an individual should have such a special\ndiscount function, i.e., no reason why the defect in the telescope that Professor Pigou\nspoke of should be logarithmically linear with respect to the distance of the object being\nviewed. Indeed, if it is believed that this special case is realistic, a rationale is needed.\nWe provide one in the next section.\n\n! The reader is cautioned that this is not the same as the familiar proposition that the marginal rate\nof substitution between present and future consumption is determined in equilibrium by discounting at\nthe market rate of interest. The marginal rate of substitution between consumption at time 0 and at time\nt is, for the utility functional used here, equal to:\n\nu ! Ou\nX 3c ! X9 3c\nand not to X(?) / (0).

At one limit, the apprehension curves merge with the straight\nline TT which indicates a total disregard for uncertainty and hence has been named the\ncurve of complete temerity ; the resulting DR curve is a horizontal line at OP (\u2014Or)\nabove the horizontal axis, which indicates that a// the trader's resources are committed\nat a/] market prices which differ from the future price. At the other limit, the apprehension\ncurves merge with the horizontal axis, the trader being unwilling to commit any resources\nat all.

The apprehension curve will shift and change its shape if on different '** days \"\nthe same future price is expected by the same trader with differing degrees of certainty.\nNevertheless, given the position, shape and stability of the expectation upon a certain\noccasion, the relationship which we suggest exists between uncertainty and commitments\nrationalizes such accounts as Marshall's of the behaviour of traders.\n\nToronto.

It may however\nbe pointed out that if the changes in the exchange rate were regular but not rapid the incen-\ntive to speculate would not be very great ; and any short period fluctuations in the balances\nresulting from movements of the exchanges in short steps, e.g., once a year, could be\naccommodated by movements in reserves or short-term finance, or prevented by offsetting\nfluctuations in the stringency of controls or tariffs.\n\nIn any case it is not necessary for changes in the relative prices of non-traded goods\nto come about exclusively via alterations in the exchange rate (r). All the results above\nmay be rewritten so as to allow for the effects of variations of home or foreign prices of\nnon-traded goods ; if we define the proportional rates of change of home and foreign\nprices of non-traded goods in own currencies as :\n\n1 dph 1 dpf\neph \u2014 ph d and epf \u2014 \u00bb d\nthen any result for eT or eP which was achieved by eph \u2014 epf \u2014 0 and er \u2014 er, will equally\nbe achieved by any set of these such that :\neph \u2014 er \u2014 epf \u2014 er (18)\n\nThus it is possible to modify the model to allow for the influence of * autonomous \"\ntrends of prices set up under full employment, and also to allow for the influence of the\nprices of exports and imports in each country on the price level of non-traded goods, so\nlong as this influence is not so strong, in either country, as to make any effective devaluation,\nor other change in the relative prices of non-traded goods, impossible.\n\n19. It is hoped that the model set out above will, for all its limitations,! prove helpful\nin analysing some of the problems set by the long run development of relations between\ndifferent sections of the World Economy, by describing these in a form which makes it\npossible to combine a devaluation analysis of the best-known variety, with information\nabout the market prospects of trade in particular commodities and by particular countries,\nwhich forms the real counterpart of the assumptions about the growth of A-parameters\ndescribed above.\n\nOxford.

The provision of ''finance\" for the purpose of economic\ndevelopment of the colonies by Parliament was in itself a meaningless gesture unless the\nGovernment fully intended to take the requisite steps to release the real resources necessary\nto fulfil the task assigned to the C.D.C. in the Overseas Resources Development Act. This\nis a striking example of the consequences of the Government's failure to integrate into a\ncoherent plan the economic development of her colonial territories.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nIn my review of the achievements of the C.D.C. during the period 1948-54, I indicated\nthe sort of answers which British policy makers have given in practice to our initial set\nof questions : To what extent should a development corporation undertake projects in\npartnership with private enterprise and local governments ? Under what conditions\nshould such a corporation undertake the management of development projects directly ?\nWhat test or tests should the development corporation apply in selecting projects? And\nshould a development corporation finance projects solely by means of loans to private\nenterprise and colonial government authorities ?\n\nThe review of the Corporation's operations has revealed how the C.D.C. has attempted\nto answer the questions raised in the preceding paragraph : (1) Since 1952 association\nwith private enterprise and/or local colonial governments has been a normal requirement\nfor capital sanction for all new C.D.C. undertakings. (2) Prior to 1951, the Board of the\nC.D.C. managed directly most of the Corporation's projects. After that date, '* deliberate\npolicy was to look for experienced private enterprise partners to share in investment and\nmanagement.\"! (3) The Corporation was supposed to act for financial purposes as a\ncommercial concern\u2014to become self-supporting '* taking one year with another.\" And (4)\nthe Corporation committed by the end of 1954 approximately 30 per cent of its total capital\nin the form of loans\u2014ostensibly to cover '* some part of overheads and abortive pilot\nschemes and investigations.\"?\n\nOn the basis of the information I have been able to examine, I do not think that it is\npossible to dismiss in one bold stroke the Corporation's \u00a310 million loss as the result of\ninattention or laxity in administering the financial and other provisions of the Overseas\nResources Development Act, especially since, as I have attempted to show, the provisions\nof the Act are subject to more than one interpretation. And during the initial period\n1948-50, no clear and concise criterion for capital sanction was provided either in the\nOverseas Resources Act or by the responsible Ministers in Parliament. The Board's\nfirst Chairman, Lord Trefgarne, can argue with some justification that the Board of the\nC.D.C. was adjusting its interpretation of Section 15 (1) of the Act to an object and purpose\nunfamiliar to the administrators of the nationalized industries ; that is, as a guide to the\nselection of new enterprises rather than as a guide to the operation of existing ones.\n\nBloomington, Indiana.

            "found": "A NOTE ON THE COLONIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION 231\n\ncolonial governments are therefore not well equipped to undertake them,! so that '* public\nenterprise \" is needed. The avowed purpose for which the C.D.C. was set up was that of\n** improving the standard of living of the colonial peoples by increasing their productivity\nand wealth \".? But it was to do this within the limits imposed by the requirement to\nbreak-even in the longer-run, and it was also to keep the dollar shortage in mind.? This\nmay be a ** vagueness of the mandate \". One may, perhaps, question the compatibility\nof the first two requirements, and the relevance of the third (the colonies being the main\ncontributor to the sterling area dollar pool). But there seems nothing which invites failure\nof the projects undertaken.\n\nThe failures, it seems to me, have resulted from a combination of managerial incom-\npetence and of the high risks inevitably attaching to untried ventures in the colonies, though\nthese two elements are in practice not easy to separate. Incompetent management is of\ntwo kinds : the people responsible for the carrying-out of particular projects doing the\nwrong thing ; the people responsible for selecting the projects making too optimistic an\nassessment of the risks, and doing so on the basis of inadequate investigation. Deficiencies\nof both these kinds existed in full measure, and are well illustrated by the story of the\nGambia poultry-farming scheme. It may be that the atmosphere of 1948 was conducive\nto an urge for speed and a heavy discounting of risks, although the Corporation had ex-\npressed its intention '* to avoid all embracing and grandiose economic development plans \".\nBut it was surely right to accept Bagehot's precept that '* caution is the life of banking,\nbut venture is the life of commerce \". To blame the failures on ** vagueness of the mandate\"\nor on the financial rules puts things the wrong way round. And it is relevant in this con-\nnection to emphasise that the failures were not merely financial (an inability to break-even)\nbut physical (no eggs and dead chickens).\n\nThe real part played by the break-even rule was to compel a sharp contraction in the\ngrowth, and a change in the character of the Corporation's activities once large sums\nof money had been lost early-on through bad. management. The Corporation had itself\nfully appreciated that it would need, on some of its undertakings, to earn more than what\nI have called the modest return to be earned overall : '* it hopes and expects that some of\nits undertakings will make substantial yields in order to counterbalance low yields and\nlosses \". But when large losses were experienced in the early stages, venture had to give\nway to caution. In an effort to fulfil its financial obligations the Corporation had to\neschew risks, to cut its losses, and to concentrate on well-paying projects. Hence the\nchanges which Mr. Wicker describes : increasing participation with private capital ;\nincreasing importance of debenture loans as a form of financial participation by C.D.C.\nThe Corporation became something very different from its original conception.\n\nIt seems probable that if the Corporation had started more cautiously, and had selected\nprojects which, though small, were a financial success, nothing would have been heard\nof the vagueness of the mandate or of the difficulties inherent in the rules under which the\nCorporation operated. The difficulties would have been there, but they would have been\nconcealed. They were brought into prominence only by the early failures, which were\nthemselves the result of quite other causes. However, a less venturesome policy would\nhave brought its own problems, for it would no doubt have been asked whether the oper-\nations of the Corporation were not too limited to do much good for the colonies.\n\nOxford.

We may now say something more on the economic meaning of our results. The\nexpression (b' \u2014 A'A) is a vector of net profitabilities of activities\u2014the difference, in each\ncase, between revenue and cost, where the latter is evaluated at the '' efficiency \" prices\nof the productive factors. Each element in this vector is necessarily zero or negative ;\nand when it is negative, the activity level of the corresponding activity is zero. On the\nface of it, (1*) says that whenever there are changes in the parameters 5 and 4, the resultant\nchanges in 4 and x are such that each activity which has become more profitable (the net\nprofitability has become less negative, or has become zero) as a result of all these changes,\nwill have increased its activity level if this level changes at all, and conversely ; and like-\nwise, if either one has changed in the negative direction, so has the other. This seems reason-\nable enough : the more profitable activities have increased their output, the less profitable\nones have decreased it, insofar as they have changed at all. Similarly, (2*) says that each\nproductive factor whose unemployed residue (always positive or zero) has increased will\nhave suffered a fall in price, and conversely ; and each factor whose residue has decreased\nwill have enjoyed a rise in price, and conversely ; but in each case a definite change in\nthe one variable does not exclude a zero change in the other.\n\nIn evaluating these results, we must note the following points : Whenever an element\nof the vector (b' \u2014 2'4) is changing, the corresponding x is almost always not ; and vice\nversa. If the former is changing, then the activity level in question is zero either before or\nafter the change, and will be zero both before and after the change if net profitability is\nnot zero either before or after. To take an example of a case when both are changing,\nsuppose that net profitability rises from a negative value to zero while the activity level\nrises from zero to a positive value, for a particular activity; the conclusion that both must\nhave changed in the same (algebraic) direction is a perfectly straightforward result of the\nassumption, basic to linear programming, that negatively profitable activities have zero\nactivity levels. The interpretation of (2) and (2*) is exactly analogous.\n\n8. The results just arrived at are very helpfully illustrated by Marshall's train-boat\nexample,! used by Beckmann in the preceding note. First it is necessary to note that the\nrestraints applying to the dual of the form of the problem given by Beckmann are :\n\n\u2014h, \u2014 n Q, \u2014\u2014 \u00c0o\n\u2014b, \u2014 A, ds \u2014 3\nwhenever both kinds of transport are used ; this gives :\n\n!

The expression (6) then tells us that the indi-\ncated sum of this particular set of tendencies must not be less than the sum of the tendencies\nof efficiency prices and utilizations of factors (including those not directly affected by the\ntechnological change) to move together for every factor (if they move at all).\n\n5. This result may be generalised in terms of the matrix equations (1*) and (2*) :\n\n&(b' \u2014 1A) 8x 2 0 2 8X XXe \u2014 Ax).\n\nDistributing the operators and rearranging, we obtain :\n(7) 8b' 8x -- 82 84. x \u2014 A 84 8x 2 9X 8(Ax) 2 9X 8c. (8)\nWe may now consider some interesting special cases. Consider, for example, 85 \u2014 3c \u2014 0,\ni.e., where the only changes are in technology, this gives :\n\n84 84: x \u2014X 84 8x 2 9X 9(Ax) 2 0, (6*)\nwhich is the generalization of (6). Its economic interpretation is the same as that just\ngiven for (6). Another interesting case is $44 \u2014 3c \u2014 0, i.e., when the only changes are in\nthe activity revenues. Here we obtain :\n\n8b 8x 293 A8x 20 (9)\nwhich is a sharpened form of the inequality obtained by Samuelson.\n\nIt should be noted that there are no term by term inequalities behind (7), (8), (6*),\nand (9) in the same sense that there are such inequalities behind (1*) and (2*), namely\nthose given in (1) and (2). By (1) and (2) we know that for every k and every n respectively,\nthe indicated inequality holds for the kth term of the product of the two vectors 3p' and\n8x on the left hand side of (1*) and for the nth term of the product of the two corresponding\nvectors on the left hand side of (2*). No such statement can be made about the inequalities\n(7), (8), (6*), and (9) because the rearrangement of terms necessary to obtain them has\nobliterated the term by term relations.\n\n6. It is of interest to note when it may be expected that the strict inequalities hold, and\nwhen not.

In the preceding note, Beckmann shows how the conclusion given by Samuelson!\nthat 3b' 8x z\u00bb 0, where the vector of activities x changes as a result of a change of the vector\nof revenues b, can be generalized to include changes in the vector of factor availabilities c\nand in the technology matrix 4. These results are arrived at solely by consideration of\nknown relationships among the vectors in question, not by any explicit consideration of\nthe restraints applying to the individual elements of these vectors. It is the purpose of\nthe present note to show the further considerable sharpening of these results which may be\nobtained by taking into account the specific restraints on the individual variables. We shall\nfind, in fact, (a) that the two quantities in Beckmann's expression (9) are individually\nsubject to a corresponding restraint ; (b) that the restraint applies not merely to the vector\nproducts shown but to each term in the vector products ; and (c) that a simple rule separates\nthose cases in which the equality sign holds in these expressions from those cases in which\nthe inequality sign holds.\n\nIn section 2 the assertions (a) and (5) will be simultaneously demonstrated ; in sections\n3 and 4 the consequent sharpening of Beckmann's result will be applied to the special\ncase he considers in his section 2 of a change in a single technological coefficient ; in\nsection 5 some further consequences of (a) are examined ; in section 6 the rule mentioned\nin (c) is set out and demonstrated in detail ; and in section 7 the rule (c) is illustrated using\nthe example from Marshall given by Beckmann in the preceding note.\n\n2. Consider an activity analysis problem 5b'x \u2014 max subject to Ax \u00ab c, x Z 0, and\nx\n\nconsider some arbitrary changes in the parameters 4 \u2014\u2014- A 4- 84, c \u2014 c 4- 8c, b \u2014 b\n.- 8b, giving rise to the corresponding changes in the solutions for activity levels and\nefficiency prices x \u2014\u2014- x 4- 3x and 4 \u2014\u2014- A 4- 84. To simplify the presentation of this\nsection, we shall define a vector of net revenues p, where the typical term of this vector is :\nPy \u2014 by \u2014 X ay &\u00ab O.\nn\n\nand where the change in net revenue of the kth activity, as a result of the changes in para-\n\nmeters, is :\nSP, \u2014 S(by \u2014 X s ak)\n\n\u2014\u2014 Oby \u2014 X 9Ao * \u00fckn \u2014 X \u00c0n Saks.\nn n\n\nNow the efficiency price theorem states that all activities for which net revenue is\nnegative have zero activity levels ; that is, if, for any k, Pk \u2014 0 then x\u00ab \u2014 O0, and if\nPy 4- SP, \u2014 O then x; 4- 8xy \u2014 0. Hence it is evident that if xi \u2014 0 and xy -- 3x\u00ab \u2014 0,\nthen 3P& \u2014 0, because then Py \u2014 0 \u2014 Py 4- 3P&.. Similarly we know that if P& \u2014 0 and\nPy 4. 8Py \u00ab 0, then 3x, \u2014 0 \u2014 xx.\n\nHence if both 3xy z& 0 and 8Py z^ 0 for any k, it must be true for that Kk either that\nXk \u2014 O0 and 8xy \u2014 O or that xx -- 3xx \u2014 O and 3x, \u2014 0.

His C, and C, are two kinds of\nequipment, but nothing is said about the time which it takes to produce them (gestation\nperiod) or the period over which they are expected to be useful (service life). It is no\nargument to dismiss a problem as antiquated until it has either been satisfactorily solved\nor shown to be uninteresting.\n\nIn my opinion Professor Solew is barking up the wrong tree in seeking either the\nproblem or the solution amongst index numbers. Let us postulate a world in which\nthere is only one kind of machine, and let us abstract from working capital. Then the\nproblem with which Professor Solow is concerned evaporates. Now compare two machines.\nIf one is older than the other and has a shorter prospective remaining service life, its value\nis less, and the difference in value varies with the rate of interest.\n\nNext, compare two machines exactly alike in all respects (including age) except that\none is drawn from an economy with a higher product-wage rate. The value of the two\nmachines is different, and the investment required to create them is different. A difference\nin value remains if we deflate them by the wage rate (obtaining what I have called *' real\ncapital \" or capital in terms of labour time), for in two economies with different product-\nwage rates the rate of profit and therefore the rate of interest are different (under the\nassumptions on which the argument is set out). I am sorry to have given the impression\nthat ** it does not seem to bother \" me that two exactly similar pieces of equipment may\nrepresent different quantities of accumulation. I was trying precisely to show what there\nis to be bothered about.\n\nAgain, if the wage rate has altered during the life time of a machine, its historic cost\nand its reproduction cost differ.\n\nFinally, two machines, though physically alike may require different quantities of\nlabour to produce or to operate them (because of technical progress).\n\nNone of these questions can be dealt with in terms of an index of physical equipment,\nand each of them is important for the analysis of distribution and of capital accumulation.\n\nCambridge.

These empirical studies provide, moreover,\ncertain goals at which the theory ought to aim. For these studies have indicated that\ncertain behaviour patterns are extremely common among the firms of the real world.\nIt would seem then that one important test of any theory of the firm should be its ability\nto show such behaviour as a normal consequence of the assumptions it makes. The\ncomplex of phenomena known as full cost pricing appears to me to be a sensible and even\nlikely outcome of my assumptions. This seems to me to provide an independent check\non the plausibility of the assumptions themselves.\n\nTo turn now to some of the criticisms which are rather more specific to my paper.\n(1) Mr. Davis objects to my use of the concept of an industry on the grounds that such an\nentity is, in practice, indefineable in terms of either technological similarity or substitu-\ntibility.| But, in the simplest form, the concept of an industry is merely a way of stating\nthat any particular firm, is, in most respects, compelled to give the policies of other firms\nvery great weight in forming its own. Whether the firms it must watch are the producers\nof close substitutes, or technologically similar products, is not really very important ;\nnor is it important just where the line is drawn in our theory. As long as the firm does in\npractice act as though a defineable industry existed we are justified in having introduced\nthe concept. The fact that it requires refinement to apply to particular cases does not remove\nits advantages.\n\n(2) Mr. Davies suggests that it is anomalous that consumers who are *' largely price\nconscious \" can be appealed to by means of sales expenditure and product variation.?\nBut it does in fact appear to be common to seek these '* advantages \" as long as no price\nis attached to them.\n\n(3) Mr. Davies finds some difficulty in my assumption that. all firms may maximize\ntheir profits, while only the price leader (i.e., the firm willing to accept the lowest price)\nwill be able to obtain the highest possible profits. \"The difference is that the non-leaders\nmaximize profit subject to the constraint that price is selected for them by another firm.\nThe leader is under no such constraint : he selects the price to suit himself. The situation\ns stable because those who are dissatisfied with it cannot raise their prices without losing\ngoodwill, whereas lowering prices still further will, by hypothesis, make them less com-\nfortable than they already are.\n\nFinally, Mr. Davies is doubtful whether theory has any role at all to play in unravelling\nso complex a picture. Whether or not he is right will, ultimately, only be revealed by\npatient application of both theoretical and empirical approaches. Butit would seem prema-\nture to abandon the attempt to see certain genera] rules underlying business conduct simply\nbecause the categories employed by theorists do not find exact parallels in the real world.\nEconomic theory is, after all, a tool of research and not a body of settled knowledge,\nand in no field is this more true than in the theory of the firm. It is the task of the applied\neconomist to adapt the tools provided by the theorist (often perforce the same man!)\nto his particular problem, and it would be foolhardy for the theorist to usurp that function.\n\nToronto.

In addition he may expect\na short hedge to be unprofitable, 5, \u2014 0, but he may be sure of this, \u00ab b] \u2014 m, \u00bb O0.\nIf this is true, then the constraint set is no longer concave to the origin but is, instead,\na hyperbola opening upward. In Figure 2 we see that if a combination of hedged and\nunhedged stocks are held we may hold an unlimited total quantity of stocks provided\nthe two are increased proportionately. This proportion is given by the slope of the\nstraight line PQ in Figure 2.\n\n6. We have reached the point where a summary of our assumptions and conclusions\nwould be in order. We asserted that if merchants maximise their expected income,\nsubject to the constraint that the probability that their actual net income falls below\na disaster level should not exceed a certain value, then under certain conditions they\nwill either hold cash, hold a combination of short-hedged and unhedged stocks, or a\ncombination of long-hedged commitments and unhedged stocks. In order to find these\nconditions we showed that the probability constraint could be approximated by means\nof the Tchebycheff inequality without making any assumptions about the form of the\nprobability distribution. We are able to reach our conclusions in terms of the second\norder moments of the probability distribution of prices of spots and futures. In addition,\nwe argued that the forward price will always equal the spot price plus carrying costs,\nand that the futures price will never be greater than the spot price plus carrying costs.\nThis permitted us to conclude that the expected gain from a long hedge is the negative\nof the expected gain from a short hedge.\n\nThe detailed conclusions are as follows :\n\n(a) If we expect the spot price and the basis to move in the same direction, then\nwe will hold short-hedged and unhedged stocks only if we expect both actions to be\nprofitable. The basis and the spot price will move together if the futures price and the\nspot price move in opposite directions.\n\n(b) If we expect the spot price and the basis to move in opposite directions, then\nwe will hold unhedged stocks and long-hedging commitments if we expect both actions\nto be profitable. The spot price and the basis will move in opposite directions when the\nfutures price and the spot price move in the same direction.\n\n(c) We will hold short-hedged and unhedged stocks when one of these actions is\nexpected to be unprofitable if the basis and the spot price are expected to move in\nopposite directions. Hence we would expect short-hedged stocks and unhedged stocks\nto occur simultaneously during the part of the year when no new stocks are expected\nto be forthcoming (when the spot price and the futures price will move together).\n\n(d) Similarly we will hold unhedged stocks and long-hedging commitments when\none of these is expected to be unprofitable when the basis and the spot price move in\nthe same direction. Generally this occurs when the spot and futures prices move in\nopposite directions. This is most common in that part of the crop year when new\nsupplies are expected to be forthcoming.\n\n(e) We will hold only one type of commitment when it is expected to be very\nprofitable with respect to the other.\n\nChicago.

The two index numbers are, therefore, negatively\ncorrelated. It follows that the variance of log Q';(/) will be less than half as great as the\narithmetic mean of the variances of log Q',(r) and log Q',(r.. Hence, in view of (10),\nthe residual variance obtained by using ^ ideal\" index numbers in the demand equation\nfor a group of commodities will be less than half as great as the arithmetic mean of the\nresidual variances obtained by using the two alternative combinations of Laspeyres' and\nPaasche's index numbers.  Symbolically we have:\n\n(15) var. ua(t) \u00ab \u00a3i (var. u,(\u00a3) 4- var. uy(2))\nwhere u4(t), u,(t) and uj(f) are obtained by substituting Q'4(t), Q',(r) and Q';(t) respectively\ninto (10).\n\nThe inequality (15) has been derived from the assumptions 4 B and C and the\nassumption that consumers behave rationally in the sense that they make consistent\nchoices.! \"We can relax assumptions (A4) and (B) provided that the factors which are no\nlonger assumed to be constant can be introduced into the demand equation. In practice\nit will be possible to introduce into the demand equation only a few of the variates which\nhave an influence upon demand, and part of the stochastic element in the equation will\nbe due to the omission of the remaining variates. Hence the variances of the variates\nu'a(t), u',(t) and v',(r), which are obtained by adding to wu;(t), (t) and uj(f) the stochastic\nelement \u00ab(f) resulting from the omission of certain variates from the demand equation,\nwill not necessarily satisfy the inequality (15). Nevertheless, the less restrictive inequality :\n\n(16) var. u'a(t) \u00ab &(var. w's(t) -- var. u's(f))\n\nwill probably be satisfied.?\n\nFrom (16) it follows that, if the residual variances resulting from the use, in the\ndemand equation, of the two alternative combinations of Laspeyres' and Paasche's index\nnumbers are approximately equal, then the residual variance resulting from the use of\n* ideal\" index numbers will be smaller than either of them. It is possible, however,\n(depending upon the shape of the indifference surface) that the residual variance obtained\nby using one of the combinations of Laspeyres' and Paasche's index numbers will be much\nsmaller than the residual variance obtained by using the other combination ; and, in this\ncase, it could be smaller also than the residual variance obtained by using ** ideal index\nnumbers.\n\nIt should be remembered that the conclusions reached so far concern the residual\nvariance in the structural equation and not the estimated residual variance obtained by\nleast squares regression or any other particular method of estimation. . Provided, however,\nthat the statistical methods used lead to unbiased estimates of the parameters of the equation,\nwe should expect the inequality (16) to apply also to the estimated residual variances\nobtained by these methods.\n\nThe practical importance of this conclusion will depend upon the relative magnitudes\nof the variances of the stochastic elements u(z) and e(t). The element (f) will be greater\nthe greater is the change in the relative prices of the different members of the group and,\nas can be seen from (10), the greater is the group parameter [1 -- 5b]. Hence the choice\nof index numbers is likely to be important in cases where the relative prices of the different\nmembers of a group of commodities vary considerably and where the elasticity of demand\nfor the group is either much greater or much less than unity.\n\n!

                    "The Use of Index Numbers in\nDemand Analysis\n\nI\n\nIn most empirical demand studies it is necessary to deal to some extent with groups\nrather than individual commodities. In fact, in order to avoid grouping, one should have\nnot only to distinguish between all the different brands and grades of a given commodity,\nbut also to use such small units of time that quantities purchased, at different points of\ntime, within a unit period could be regarded as perfect substitutes. It is seldom possible\nto adopt such a procedure, and, consequently, the demand functions whose parameters\nwe attempt to estimate from empirical data are not, usually, identifiable with the demand\nfunctions of economic theory. Indeed, the so-called parameters of such equations are,\nin most cases, not parameters at all ; for, even if the tastes and income of every consumer\nin the market and the prices of all commodities outside the group were to remain constant,\nthere would, generally, be no constant relation between the price and quantity indices for\na given group of commodities.\n\nThis leads to the question of what we are trying to measure when attempting to esti-\nmate the parameters of stochastic demand equations involving groups. Are we trying\nto estimate the values of certain constants which, assuming a complete knowledge of con-\nsumers' preferences, could be deduced from economic theory, or are we performing\nmeaningless arithmetical operations?\n\nConsider the n demand equations :\n\n(1) qi \u2014 f(pi (D, Pa (D, . \u00abPu Psi (0, pao m) i \u2014 1... .n\n\nin which q(f),p.(t) and m(r) are the quantity of the ith commodity, the price of the ith\ncommodity and money income respectively in period z. | Let P(t) be any index of the prices\nof the first \u00bb? commodities which varies in proportion to these prices when they all change\nin the same proportion, and let Q() be the quantity index defined in such a way that P(f) Q(1)\nalways varies in proportion to the expenditure on the group.

The consumption *' steps \" are however not in the same order for all consumers :\none may place lighting, wireless, cooking and iron in that order of preference in the\nelectrical way of life, and another may have a totally different order (or none at all) after\nlighting. The supplier may therefore feel unjustified in attempting more than two or three\nblocks, especially as he will be faced with a situation where the prices of electrical appliances\nwill vary considerably from time to time (and so almost certainly shift B and C if not A).\n\nConcluding Comment\n\nSince tariffs cannot be adjusted to individual surpluses or to changes in the surpluses\nover time, the two-block tariff advocated by Mr Gabor would not appropriate all consumers'\nsurpluses, and it would deny electricity to some who could afford it under another form\nof tariff. These arguments seem to apply equally to the case of gas. Since most consumers'\nindifference curves for electricity apparently are not continuous and do not originate on\nthe income axis, a multi-block or a conventional two-block tariff may collect more of the\nsurpluses in total than can the Gabor type. 1f electrical apparatus were more readily\navailable in homes, these ** curves \" would more closely resemble the normal type of indiffer-\nence curve, and in the case of gas this position may already have been reached with many\nconsumers : the minimum gas service normally contemplated is cooking, for which gas\nis not so indispensable as electricity is for lighting since it may be supplemented or sup-\nplanted by fuels using inexpensive apparatus or apparatus already in the possession of\nthe housewife\u2014 coal fires, electric kettles and toasters, etc. In consequence some consumers,\nespecially those with gas rings, may have indifference curves more resembling the continuous\ndownward sloping curves of Diagram I, and in these circumstances the Gabor type tariff\ncould have advantages. But some consumers might not contemplate using gas for any\nservice other than cooking, whether occasional cooking on a gas ring or full scale cooking\non a cooker. These would more resemble consumer A4 on Diagram II in that a single\npoint fully charted their gas indifference *' curves\" so that a single price could extract\nmost of their consumers' surplus. The difficulty analogous to (i) above however would\nthen arise : a single price aimed at the householder with a gas cooker might leave a large\nunexploited surplus with the gas-ring customer, and a single price aimed at the latter might\nforce the gas cooker customer to use another fuel.\n\nThis comment has followed Mr. Gabor in assuming that the more a supplier can exploit\nthe consumer's surplus the higher his net profit, or the lower his net loss, will be. If,\nhowever, as seems likely, the cost per unit supplied to a consumer varies with his level of\nconsumption, then the supplier would have this additional factor to take into account\nin deciding the form of his tariff. For example a supplier would presumably only want\nto supply consumer 4 in Diagram II if AQ were greater than the specific costs attributable\nto the supply. However, the assumption is probably on the whole a useful first approxi-\nmation when the form of the block tariffs is under consideration ; it would have to be\nabandoned when quantities and prices for the blocks had to be fixed, or if it could be shown\nthat the specific costs of supplying a consumer were not a monotonic decreasing function\nof consumption.\n\nLondon.

When in office,\nfor the first year or so which concern us here, there was no major change of policy in this\nfield, which might have made the plan irrelevant. Moreover, had there been such a change\nof policy, it would not necessarily follow that the plan would forthwith have ceased to be\nsignificant. It is the thesis of this article to suggest that if the plan and its virtual achieve-\nment have significance, it is to show that the economy cannot be directed quickly towards\nany particular end. If it takes a year or two to induce the necessary alterations in policy,\nand make them effective in the behaviour of firms and individuals, it is likely to take at\nleast as long for a political decision to change the policy to become effective. Fortunately\nfor our present purpose, the change of Government came late enough before the plan-year\n1952/53 to make the possibility of a major change of policy of little importance.\n\nTo summarise then, the only conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence is that\nthe success of the Long Term Programme, our only 4-year plan, can at present be neither\nproved nor disproved. To argue either way, it is necessary to make non-verifiable\nassumptions. The assumptions are likely to seem plausible and justified or not according\nto the political opinions, knowledge, experience or prejudice of the holders. At least\nit can be said that the evidence does not show any prima facie case for the anti-planners\nor the cynics.\n\nOne conclusion arising clearly from this study is that if planning of this kind is to be\ntaken seriously it should be more carefully and precisely formulated. If we are interested\nin plans we must be interested in their results. 1t is only possible to discover the results\nat all exactly if somewhere (not necessarily all of it for publication) there is an account of\nexactly what the plan meant.\n\nA more important inference from the somewhat surprising success of the plan, if\nsuccess be conceded, is that the distinction between planning the real, and relatively stable,\ncomponents of the economy needs to be distinguished more clearly and explicitly from the\nmonetary, and unstable, components. At worst, the distinction might help to make the\nmeaning or limits of plans more clearly understood ; at best, it might help towards making\nplans more effective. Having distinguished the more stable and predictable elements,\na plan for them should allow a longer time for its operation than has so far been\ncustomary.\n\nNottingham.

CONCLUSION\n\nThe general conclusion seems to be that, if population is growing, accumulation\nof capital has strictly limited powers of raising real wages, in the absence of technical\nprogress. Under constant returns, with a constant fraction of national income accu-\nmulated, it is possible for labour, capital and national income all to increase at the\nsame rate, maintaining a constant level of real wages. But in order to increase real\nwages, capital must increase faster than labour. This entails a rising accumulation-\nfraction, which cannot, however, increase indefinitely, since there is an upper limit to\nthe proportion of its national income that any community can accumulate. Under\ndiminishing returns, capital must increase faster than labour in order to keep real\nwages from falling (let alone raise them) ; except in the improbable case where an\nincrease in both labour and capital is accompanied by a fall in the amount of rent\n(even so, rent cannot become negative). In order that capital may increase faster than\nlabour, the accumulation-fraction must continually rise, as in the previous case. Under\ncertain circumstances (such as the existence of rather odd kinds of national-income\nfunction) this increase in the accumulation-fraction may be postponed. If population\ngrows at a diminishing rate, it is possible that the accumulation-fraction, even if it\nrises, may approach asymptotically an upper limit that is practically possible. These\ngeneral propositions may be qualified in particular cases ; but it appears probable\nthat these qualifications will cease to apply with very high rates of capital growth.\n\nAll these limitations on the raising of real wages can be removed if we postulate a\nsufficiently high rate of technical progress. Thus, technical progress is a necessary\ncondition for a permanent and continuous increase in real wages. (This conclusion is\nexpressed in terms of real wages. Similar propositions would hold good of real income\nper head. Even if we assume that the State has an unlimited power to redistribute\nreal income, we cannot escape the conclusions reached here.)\n\nBristol, H, D, DickINSON,\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 15:53:53 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The criteria which it has\nsupplied are not especially attractive ethically ; and the incentives that we may\nassociate with them fall far short of the incentives of the hypothetical ordinal standard,\non either interpretation.\n\nThe Kaldor-Hicks verbal criterion is not expressed in terms of ordinary economic\ndata ; and it is difficult to imagine precisely what sort of data available to economic\nresearch would indicate that the criterion was in any given case fulfilled!

Even if a man eventually chooses a distribution which shows that he is averse\nfrom taking large risks, the selected distribution may include one or more component\nrisks which, if faced in isolation, would be regarded as gambles. Thus simultaneous\ninsurance and gambling may not necessarily be inconsistent with the use of the distri-\nbution function of a unimodal income distribution as a utility function.\n\nThe compatibility of the present theory with others is perhaps less important\nthan its possibilities as a. fruitful tool of analysis. A convincing demonstration of its\nemployment must await another occasion, but a brief account of some of its qualities\ncan be given. Firstly, the basis of the theory is essentially competitive ; it can be\nused to show how a man should strive to scale the social ladder or how a firm should\nattempt to maintain its predominance in an industry. The man and the firm do not\nmaximise utility and profits in a vacuum, but condition their actions according to\nboth their present status in their respective societies and their expectations about the\ncollective results of their rivals' activities. Secondly, the theory is flexible because we\nare free to vary the quality or quantity on which an individual's rank in a given society\nis deemed to depend and to re-draw the boundaries of this society according to the\nproblem in hand. The relevant rank may depend on income, wealth, or marks in an\nexamination, while the society may be co-extensive with a nation, a village, an\nindustry, or a profession. Thirdly, the theory explains a great variety of behaviour.\nIt tells us why small firms must take risks if they want to get on and why large firms\nare likely to avoid doing so. Used in conjunction with a simple model applicable to\nagriculture, it indicates the degree of crop diversification desirable with large holdings\nand explains why smallholders may concentrate on a single crop, the nature of the\ncrop varying again with the size of holding. It shows under what circumstances some\nland may be left idle.\n\nLastly, but not least in importance, the theory is based on a principle that is\nsimple and easy to understand. The great advantage of profit maximisation is that its\nimplications are easily intelligible ; perhaps for this reason there is considerable\nreluctance' to abandon the principle even when its limited applicability has been\ndisclosed. The idea of a firm attempting to secure the highest position in the hierarchy\nof an industry can be grasped without the necessity of removing our feet from solid\nground. The principle is not simply a restatement of the nebulous assertion that\nexpected utility is or should be maximised.\n\nVI.\n\nThe earlier disquiet about the relationship between two kinds of utility has led\nus by devious ways to a position where we can prescribe a rule of conduct for those\nwho aspire to social eminence, in so far as this is determined by position in the income\ndistribution. The principle expounded seems to hold some promise of yielding useful\nresults when applied to specific problems. At worst we have shown that a new parlour\ngame can be played with the aid of no more than a Report of the Commissioners of\nInland Revenue and a slide rule.\n\nCambridge. A. D.

Such economies usually have highly *' elastic \" capacities at the margins.\nIn these economies so-called '' social overhead capital \"' is not a limiting factor, and an\nexpenditure programme to fill a deflationary gap is likely to elicit a production response\nleading to increased employment. For such economies national income figures are most\nuseful. On the other hand, the underdeveloped countries are precisely those for which\nthe structural insights provided by sectoral accounts are of first priority, and structural\nconsiderations have this top priority, not only because bottlenecks bulk so large, but\nalso because the aggregate consumption and investment functions lack autonomy due\nto shifting boundaries between the monetary-non-monetary sectors (see footnote !\nbelow).

This lack of '' autonomy \"' of the aggregate relations reflected by National Income figures is,\nof course, an analytic basis for the general vote against their use in the study of underdeveloped economies.\n\n* We must again recall our cautionary remark, above, that we realise that we are being over pedantic\nin our distinctions.\n\n3 Conference Papers on the Current Economic Problems of Burma, 1951, p. 79.\n\n* The writer is \u00e0 member of The Center for International Studies, Massathusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 15:56:45 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

There is, in fact, some evidence to the contrary for\nNigerian farmers.\n\nHe will, no doubt, object that I am missing his main point, namely, whether the\nestimation of national income aggregates should take precedence over an account for\nforeign trade, government, statutory boards and public companies as a guide to policy.\nThe answer is that when trying to piece together information on the output of food-\nStuffs, which /s the single most important sector, it is exceedingly helpful to use the\nnational income approach in order to compare the estimates of various crops with\nestimates of other outputs and to check total output of food by comparison with\nindependent estimates of aggregate food consumption.\n\nIt is \u00e0 commonplace that the aim in underdeveloped countries is to raise real\nincome. Is it not possible that nice considerations of inflationary or deflationary\ntendencies are really less vital to the welfare of these countries than is information\nwhich may enable adequate steps to be taken to improve the productivity of labour\nand the fertility of the soil? If there is not available some indicator, however crude,\nwhereby to assess such progress\u2014and it is comparisons of this kind rather than fore-\ncasts which the administrator requires to make\u2014then statistical policy is being\ngoverned too much by the considerations which are only apposite to advanced or\nindustrial economies.\n\nSimilarly, it is this undue emphasis on national income and sector accounts as a\nstatistical kind of machine tool which leads Mr. Hollinger into a misconception.\nPerhaps Indonesian experience justifies great expectations of national budgeting;\nall I can say is that Nigerian experience does not. Although it is tempting to look for\nconsumption functions, they need not provide the sole or even the principal motive\nfor calculating aggregate consumption figures. Neither do sectoral or inter-industry\naccounts really assist the policy maker to break specific '' bottlenecks \" in an under-\ndeveloped area where \"' bottlenecks \" such as inadequate port facilities or a shortage\nof skilled technicians are either localised and easily pin-pointed for improvement\nwithout statistical.advice, or so general and fundamental a feature of the economy\nthat no division of them into sectors will illumine the problems they present. Mr.\nHollinger puts a much stronger case where capital formation is concerned if, by his\n\"* sectoral accounts,\" he means to indicate the type of investment and whether financed\nprivately, by business or by government. He seems to go further than this, however,\nby suggesting that an accelerator or multiplier can be given some empirically meaningful\ncontent. This is over-optimistic in an economy where the boundary between '' pro-\nductive \" and '* welfare \"\" capital is difficult to define, as in West Africa.\n\nAggregate and sectoral.accounts are of first-rate. importance in the statistical\npolicy of an underdeveloped country because together they form the least unreliable\nmethod of providing the administrator with a sense, by no means commonly found, of\neconomic proportion, and with a logically consistent ' intelligence report\" without\nwhich exaggerated notions of relative sizes tend to linger as an obstacle in the way of\nsound judgment. If it is unwise to claim for the approach, as. Mr. Hollinger tends to\ndo, rather more than can reasonably be expected, it is no service.to underdeveloped\nareas to argue, as Mr. Seers has done repeatedly, that practically all the administrator\nneeds in the way of economic advice can be had by adopting what is too often in effect\na line of least resistance to the shortage of statistical information.\n\nCambridge.

It may be the firm\nwith the longest trading record, the greatest prestige; or the most forceful entrepreneur ;\nor it may be a firm which, although not occupying a dominant position in the '' indus-\ntry \" under consideration, yet is extremely important in other fields.\n\nThe profit margin included in full cost must not be so high as to attract new\nentrants.

This is in sharp contrast with the results that follow from the type of\nmodel in which the actual rate of growth is not directly affected by the natural rate of\ngrowth ; in such a model, for example, an autonomous increase in the rate of population\ngrowth tends to increase the amount of unemployment, and the only balancing factor\nis what may be provided by any induced decline that may follow in the rates of growth\nof population or productivity.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe argument has been conducted throughout at a relatively high level of abstrac-\ntion, and many qualifications would have to be made before it could be applied to the\nexplanation of any particular phase of historical experience. Subject to this, the main\nconclusions may be summarised as follows. The hypothesis that the proportion of\nincome saved depends on the amount of unemployment leads to the inclusion in the\nsaving function of a negative term that grows $ari $assu with population and pro-\nductivity. The presence of this term causes growth to take place in the type of system\nthat would in its absence fluctuate about a stationary level. The growth that takes\nplace will be at the natural rate, i.e. the rate at which the maximum physically possible\noutput is growing. The shape of the saving function may, therefore, be regarded\nfrom one point of view as not so much the cause of growth of income as the explana-\ntion of why the increase in saving does not prevent income from growing at the\nnatural rate of growth. The average level of activity over the cycle will be such as to\nlead to an average ratio of saving to income equal to the average ratio of investment\nto income required by the natural rate of growth. Complications arise if the saving-\nincome ratio at full employment is below that required by the natural rate of growth ;\nbut for various reasons this does not normally occur. The natural rate will probably\nin practice depend in part on the average level of activity, so that anything that\nserves to raise the average level of activity will also raise the growth rate.\n\nCambridge.

The problem is not one of \" reverting,\"\nbut of the appropriation of surplus value for purposes of investment or consumption\u2014\nin short, of '\"' exploitation.\" This cannot be performed without the alienation of the\nconditions of production from labour-power. The collectivisation of the peasantry and\nthe liquidation of the Kulaks? was not necessitated by the difficulty of \" reverting \"'\nbut by the difficulty of '' exploiting.\" In fact, even in spheres where large-scale pro-\nduction is economically wasteful, the socialist governments have shown little solicitude\nfor encouraging them or even letting them be. It has generally remained unnoticed\nthat the theoretic structure of Marxian economy can equally well lead to an attempt\nat the widest possible individual ownership of the means of production based upon the\ninvention of a technology which can simultaneously improve production and be of\nsuch relatively low costs as to be affordable by most individuals or little groups of\nindividuals. Those areas of production where such a technology is impossible of\nachievement can be owned by the state which should '' represent \" the people, not in\nsome metaphysical sense, but in the ordinary sense of common political usage.\n\nIt seems, therefore, that neither the so-called difficulties of ' reverting \" nor the\nreal \"' representative \" character of the state do, in the least, mitigate the '' exploita-\ntion \" on which the economic development in a socialist economy is based. Nor is the\nsituation any different with respect to the privileged consumption-position of persons\nwho themselves do.not create any value. If anything, the facts are more clear and the\nveil more thin than under capitalist conditions. The differences, we suggest, emanate\nprimarily from the fact that the economic development under socialism is ?mitated\nrather than created and not because it is socialism rather than capitalism. In any case,\nthe differences are relatively minor when compared with the basic similarities revealed\nby an analysis that uses the Marxian concepts to illuminate the phenomenon of economic\ndevelopment under its various forms.

If E is the\nposition of equilibrium, '' 2\" points \"' specialise \" on x and \"' b\" points on y.\n\n1f instead there are only the '\" 4\" points, but an additional amount, OG, of x\ncan be obtained on a specific ration, the x\u2014y possibility line is H/A, with 47 equal\nto OG and H parallel to A'A.! This case is similar to the last, except that the specific\nration is not fully taken up if an M.P.I.C. touches H/A between / and A.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nOn page 1 it was mentioned that this geometrical analysis can be derived from\nan ordinary three-dimensional model with the three goods measured along three\nrecti-inear axes. The two-dimensional point price lines, the money price lines, the\nguide lines and the M.P.I.C.s are then projections on to the Oxy plane of, respectively,\nthe point budget planes, the money budget plane at various levels of z, the inter-\nsections of pairs of money budget planes, and the curves formed by the intersection of\nthe various indifference surfaces with a money budget plane.\n\nThe technique may prove useful in economic fields other than that of rationing.\nFor instance, in the theory of consumer's choice without rationing it can illustrate two\naspects which cannot be dealt with in the usual two-good model. These are comple-\nmentarity and the theorem that a group of goods behaves as a single good for pro-\nportional price changes.\n\nThe theory of rationing is but a simple extension of the theory of consumer's\nchoice without rationing. It is more difficult to analyse satisfactorily by geometry, but\nthe additional complexity is due more to the need to consider a three-good model\nthan to the introduction of an extra budget constraint. In this paper, the three goods\nare treated asymmetrically as regards the indifference curves, M.P.I.C.s and the\nration group. This makes the model easier to represent in two dimensions and the\nasymmetry is a virtue rather than a necessary evil in so far as rationing never covers\nall goods in practice.\n\nLeeds. M. McMaNvs.\n\n! Something like this case occurred in Britain during the war, when points relating to goods such as\njam, dried fruits and tinned foods could be used during fruit glut seasons to buy extra sugar which was\nalready subject to a specific ration.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 17:59:09 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Extensive involuntary\nunemployment raises the coefficient of wealth and lowers that of the wage rate, without\nnecessarily producing an appreciable effect upon the level of consumption corresponding\nto given levels of wealth and the wage rate (except through the decline in wealth due\nto the concomitant underemployment of physical assets).\n\nEspecially significant, in view of the indiscriminate lumping of property income\nwith labor income in many consumption functions, is our conclusion that wealth and\nthe interest rate affect consumption in opposite directions, even though they affect\nproperty income in the same direction. Furthermore, property income may vary\n(over moderate time periods) without producing any change in wealth or the interest\nrate or, by our hypothesis, in consumption.\n\nThe adverse effect of an interest rate rise upon consumption may be greatly\naugmented through its effect on wealth. Unless they are offset by equivalent changes\nin the expected earnings of assets, interest rate changes produce opposite changes in\ntheir market values. But induced changes in the earnings of assets depend upon the\nresponsiveness of investment to interest rate changes. Consequently, to the extent\nthat (expected) investment fails to respond to, say, monetary measures, consumption\nresponds that much more strongly. Our analysis therefore tends to reaffirm the effective-\nness of the rate of interest as a means of implementing economic policy.\n\nThe fiscal policy implications of our discussion are far from novel. lt indicates\nthe necessity of distinguishing fiscal measures that affect expectations (e.g., permanent\npayroll taxes) from those which affect consumption only through the transfer of\nwealth. In this connection, the inferior effectiveness of transfers not embodied in\npermanent programs as compared with government purchases of goods and services\nis apparent. Our analysis also serves as a reminder that transfer (tax) measures are\neffective before payment is made or even accrued, the effect upon wealth, human\nwealth, or the rate of interest beginning when adoption of the measure is first recognized\nas likely. In short, the lack of evident response to the culmination of such measures\ncan often be ascribed to leads, rather than lags, and speed in their execution (e.g., in\ntax collection) may not be very vital to their effectiveness.\n\nStanford, California.

(12)\n\nWork on these lines is now being undertaken; though the assumption that \u00ab is\nindependent of prices may be assailed on theoretical grounds and may not be justified\nfor wide price variations. The question can be decided only with empirical tests, of\nwhich the most important will be the study of Engel curves for different periods.\n\nWithout such further experimental work it seems idle to do more than sketch a\npossible theory of the factors influencing the value of saturation expenditures. These\nfactors will include most of those which are usually classed as sociological or taste\nfactors. In particular those taste factors associated with the age-sex composition of\nhouseholds are of great importance. Some preliminary analysis of data on post-war\nfood consumption suggests, as is to be expected, that the value of \u00ab differs according\nto the size and composition of the household. On the basis of a separation between those\neffects of composition which are specific to the commodity and those which affect the\nstandard of living as a whole, the obvious formulation is\n\ngi \u2014 XkgnjA(y[Eajm) ......eeeeseeeee\n\nwhere qi is the household expenditure on, or consuniption of, the /^^ commodity, y is\nthe household income, s; the number of individuals of the j'^ category in the household,\nand xij and oj coefficients corresponding to the specific and income effects respectively.\nThis formulation is particularly attractive in that it allows, in principle, for the separate\nestimation of the coefficients xij and ej, by comparing Engel curves for groups of\nfamilies of constant composition.\n\nRecently, demand analysts have been devoting more attention to those factors\nwhich influence consumption but are not included in the classical categories of\neconomics. In particular, attention has been paid to the possibility of rigidities in\nconsumer behaviour, as evidenced by the irreversibility of demand functions through\ntime [5], the influence of previous peaks in the level of consumption [9], and, recently,\nthe concept of a set of expenditures to which the consumer is committed before he can\nmake any free purchasing decisions [13]. The present paper and the ideas it contains\nare put forward as a contribution to this line of thought.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe following are the main conclusions of the paper.\n\n(/) The idea of a saturation level of expenditure on a commodity leads to\nthe concept of a sigmoid Engel curve; the form of curve adopted implies that a\ntypical commodity behaves as a luxury at low incomes and as a necessity at high\nincomes.\n\n(4) An analogy may usefully be drawn between such Engel curves and the\nsigmoid response curves used by biologists to describe the effects of measurable\nstimuli on the behaviour of living organisms.\n\n(4) A specific mathematical form for the curve, based on the cumulative form\nof the normal curve of error, is suggested in equation (1) and a simplified form in\nequation (8). Efficient procedures are available for estimating the parameters.\n\n(iv) \u00c0 very satisfactory fit was obtained when the simplified curve was used\nto analyse working-class expenditures for 1937-8.\n\n(v) The two parameters \u00ab and \u00ab of the simplified curve are referred to as the\nparameters of saturation and of cheapness; this interpretation arises from the\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:00:29 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "A SYNTHESIS OF ENGEL CURVE THEORY 43\n\nThe concept of elasticity is therefore to be used with extreme care: for many purposes\nit may be preferable to work explicitly with one of the above forms rather than with\nany derivative measures.\n\nIV. SUGGESTED EXTENSIONS OF THE ANALYSIS\n\nWe turn now to a more general discussion of the implication of our system of\nEngel curves. First, the system of curves described by (8) is not additive: that is,\nthe sum of expenditures predicted by the individual curves is not identically equal to\ntotal expenditure, at least if the curves are fitted with the assumption of independent\nerrors which we have used. The calculation of the differences, however, confirms the\nimpression to be gained from Fig. 3, namely that these are of a very small order, in\nmost cases below 1 per cent of total expenditure. Thus it would be very difficult if\nnot impossible to distinguish between the present system and one which included the\nadditional restraint of additivity, since the discrepancies are within the errors of the\nestimates. Secondly, in our discussion we have not so far taken account of inferior\ngoods; that is, those possessing a negative income elasticity. If the good is inferior\nover the whole range of income, it may be analysed with the use of equation (2), in\nwhich case the numerical value of f will be negative. But it must be admitted that our\nsystem of curves cannot easily be adapted to the case of a commodity which, whilst in\nthe lower ranges of income it behaves like a necessity or even a luxury, is treated by\nthe very rich as an inferior good. This phenomenon is considered by Wold [16, p. 276)\nthough the interpretation of the examples he gives is not unambiguous.\n\nModel (8) may be transformed for the investigation of market data (aggregated\nover consumers) by means of a suitable assumption about the distribution of consumers'\nincomes. Elsewhere [1] the writers have put forward arguments for using the lognormal\ndistribution in such a context, and its application here is particularly simple. For if\nincomes are distributed lognormally with parameters y and c?, the distribution function\nbeing written 4(ylu,c2), the total quantity demanded by the community is given by\n\ng- j[sA (p) 2 (Qrlese?) dy\n\n\u2014 kA(al\u2014u, Ide?) \u2014\u2014....... e \u00dc\u00d3II\n\nBefore investigating market data of this type we must make provision for the\neffect of prices, both of the commodity itself, and of possible substitutes and comple-\nments. It is tempting to suggest that prices enter the model analogously to income:\n\nMN:\n\nq \u2014 kA Na'yfy dq. iliis Bu B e\nwhere $ is the price of the commodity and 4,........ $\u00ab are the prices of the *\u00bb\nremaining commodities in the system.

AN APPLICATION TO THE 1938. INQUIRY INTO WORKING-CLASS\nEXPENDITURES\n\nThere exists a maximum likelihood method of estimating the parameters x, \u00ab\nand p in (4) which is moderately easy to apply: it involves essentially an iterative\nprocedure which seems suitable for computation on modern automatic computers.\nThe method of maximum likelihood applied to equation (5) is similar except that new\ntables of working probits and weighting factors are required; these will be published\nelsewhere [2].\n\nIn order to test the validity of model (4) a preliminary graphical analysis using\nlogarithmic-probability paper was carried out on data for a number of individual\ncommodities which included pre-war expenditure and consumption figures for beef\nand veal, bacon and ham, all food, and expenditure on meals outside the home. All\nbut the last mentioned yielded Engel curves which flattened in the higher ranges of\nincome, suggesting that the saturation level was nearly attained, but the last mentioned\nshowed a highly elastic relationship over the whole range of incomes. All were closely\napproximated by model (4) and a striking feature was that for all curves the value of\nthe 8-parameter appeared to be closeto unity. This was confirmed by numerical analysis,\nfor in all cases the divergence between the estimated value of 8 and unity was less\nthan the standard error of the estimate, itself less than o.r.\n\nThe analysis was therefore extended to a classification of commodities which\nincluded those other than food. Graphical analysis again suggested that the value of 8\nwas close to unity, and the final numerical analysis? which we present below was\nbased on the following model, in which the assumption 8 \u2014 1: is made.\n\nq\u2014kA(xy) - \u20ac lee\nLater a full variance analysis confirmed that the assumption of a multiplicative error\nwould have been better founded, but the loss is but a slight one in the efficiency of the\nestimation procedure.\n\nThe data used are those of the 1937-38 budgets collected from industrial working-\nclass households by the Ministry of Labour for the purpose of revising the Cost of\nLiving Index, and we have to thank the Ministry for making them available. The\n\n1! The analyses in this paper were carried out on desk machines; the number of iterations required\nwas very small.\n\n? See Appendix for an account of the method of estimation.\n\n3 The data have been classified into ten income-per-person groups; about 200 households fall into each\ngroup.

For the parameter \u00ab\nis seen to be a parameter determining the scale, for the individual commodity, on which\nincome is to be measured.

The value of the parameter \u00ab therefore controls the\ndegree to which a consumer with a given income is able to approach his saturation\nexpenditure for each commodity, and for this reason we term it the $arameter of\ncheapness; the measure is relative since \u00ab includes a factor depending on the monetary\nunits in which income is measured.

The writers are at present investigating the use of such a model in the\nmarket for television sets; a model with similar features has recently been applied\nto the American market for motor cars by Farrell [6].\n\nThe case of a divisible consumers' good is, however, more closely paralleled by a less\nwidely known development in biology of the same type of analysis. Finney [7] has\ndescribed an experiment in which honey bees were allowed to take honey from a number\nof pots to which varying amounts of a repellent had been added. The saturation level\nof consumption was in this case estimated partly from a control pot containing no\nrepellent, and partly from the shape of the normal sigmoid curve which was again\nfound to describe the relation between the mean consumption of honey and the\nconcentration of the repellent. The closest economic parallel to this experiment would\nof course be provided by the replacement of the repellent concentration by a monetary\nprice, in which case the assay would take the form of a controlled economic experiment\nto determine the variation of demand with respect to price. But there is no reason\nwhy the positive stimulus of income should not be investigated in a similar way. The\ntheory is, as its counterpart in biology, rooted ultimately in the Weber-Fechner law\nof logarithmic reaction to stimuli. It may be that consumers' purchasing decisions\nare in fact based on psychological mechanisms of this type, modified by the imposed\neconomic constraint that the budget must ultimately be balanced ; this is not inconsistent\nwith the decision systems usually proposed in the pure theory of consumers' behaviour.\nThe purpose of this paper is in fact to present the results of such an investigation and\nto discuss the economic significance of the estimates obtained.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q is the average quantity consumed, x the saturation level of consumption and\n\nThe mathematical form of the sigmoid relationship used in this investigation may\nz \u2014 log\u00ab-4-plog y, y being the consumer's income; \u00ab and f are parameters to be\ndetermined along with \u00ab.

Of course, one of these countries may be taken to be '' the rest of the\nworld,\" but this is largely a subterfuge, for we are still left with a problem of specialisa-\ntion within \"' the rest of the world.\"\n\nThe deficiency of the classical methods, the method of comparative labour costs\nin early days, the method of alternative costs as displayed in production possibility\ncurves in later times, is their dependence on bilateral comparison. They are admirably\nadapted to demonstrating that there are gains to be made from trade when countries\nbegin with different rates of transformation between outputs. But it is not possible\nthrough merely bilateral comparison to develop a complete theory of efficient multi-\nlateral specialisation.\n\nGraham detected the error of classical ways and introduced a genuinely multi-\nlateral method into the study of international trade. We have seen that the efficiency\nof free trade in his model can be proved through an analysis of the role of substitution\ncircuits. Indeed, the basic theorem on efficiency in linear models can be demonstrated\nfor his model with elementary techniques.\n\nHowever, we have found that this simplicity is bought at the expense of prohibiting\nall trade in intermediate products (with a slight exception), which is indeed a heavy\nprice. When the further degree of interdependence which results from trade in inter-\nmediate products is recognised, there is no recourse but to use the general methods of\nactivity analysis.\n\nDurham, North.

The possibility of a decline in\ndemand or goodwill can be met by increasing the number of products sold by the firm,\nor by accumulating large reserves in cash to tide the firm over difficult periods. The\npossibility of new entry can be greatly lessened by keeping prices low. The actual\noperations of any firm will depend on how important, relatively, the entrepreneur\nthinks each of these three risks to be.\n\nMoreover, the amount which an entrepreneur assigns to payment for risk-bearing\ndepends, among other things, on his estimate of the increase in the risk of the appearance\nof a new entrant that an increase in this payment exposes him to.

If the price of X is low (say, it is on the level corresponding\nto the slope of the parallel price-lines AE and GK), then the income needed for reaching\nthe curve 4 \u2014 r is less in the second situation than it was in the first (0'G \u2014 OA).\nBut, if the price of X is high (say, for example it corresponds to the parallel price-lines\nBD and HJ), then the opposite is true (O'H \u2014 OB). (A converse change in the con-\nsumer's indifference map would, of course, again have an opposite economic meaning.)\n\nTo sum up, there are taste changes that are favourable, and there are taste changes\nthat are unfavourable, to any income group and in any price situation whatever. On\nthe other hand, there are taste changes that are convenient to one income group, but\nare inconvenient to another, or that are convenient in one price situation, but are\ninconvenient in another\u2014which all agrees, of course, with common-sense observation.\n\nV\n\nThe modern methods of propaganda and education offer a powerful tool for pro-\nducing substantial changes in people's tastes at relatively low costs. For this reason,\nto-day the Economic Problem of a community\u2014whether of a highly industrialised\ncommunity or of an industrially backward one\u2014does not consist merely in finding the\nbest uses for its scarce resources so as to gratify people's actual wants to the highest\npossible degree. Rather, it includes also the question of how these scarce resources\nshould be divided between productive operations for sa/isfying people's actual wants\nand measures for changing these wants. It must be decided again and again whether\na given amount of resources benefits the consumers more if it is used for gratifying their\npresent tastes in food, in housing, in music etc.\u2014or if it is used for educating these\nconsumer's tastes, for altering their irrational likes and dislikes (whether these result\nfrom primitive superstitions or from \"' civilised \" prejudices), and for habituating them\nto new consumption goods.? The purpose of this paper has been to find a tool of analysis\nfor problems of this kind.\n\nIt should, of course, be clear that the welfare criterion proposed judges consumers'\ntastes only on the basis of which tastes these consumers themselves would prefer to\nhave. The evaluation of these tastes on the basis of a given moral or aesthetic standard\nmay possibly furnish rather different results.\n\nBrisbane, Australia. JouwN C. HansANYi1.\n\n! In effect, it corresponds to an upward shift in the consumer's demand schedule for X which he enjoys\nif the price of X is low enough to make this commodity easily accessible to him, but which he dislikes if\nthe price of X is too high for that.\n\n? There is a particularly strong Prima facie case for an attempt to change people's consumption habits\nand norms if these substantially hinder the utilisation of some of the country's basic economic resources,\nsuch as would be the case, for instance, if a primitive tribe had tabooed the consumption of the most plentiful\nfood-stuff of its territory. (This conclusion, of course, would not apply if there were reasons to believe that\nthis hypothetical tribe preferred the maintenance of its old ways of lite to the economic advantages of such\n\u00e0 change, in awareness of the costs entailed.) .\n\nBut quite apart from such extreme cases, the standard of living in probably every country, including\nthe most civilised, could be considerably raised by making people more familiar with, and less averse to,\na few easily accessible refinements in consumption habits, in preparing food, in building and furnishing\nhouses, etc., devised by other nations.

Only the second\nstep brings an increase in utility inasmuch as it means the satisfaction, to a certain\nextent, of this new want. The usual concept of price-compensating variation considers\nonly the second step and so over-states the consumer's net gain in case (3). We have\nseen that in case (3) the consumer's final position, U, may be either superior or inferior\nto his original position B. The former applies if the disutility of the first step is out-\nweighed by the utility of the second step, while the latter applies in the opposite case.\n\nIn case (2) the adjusted price-compensating variation is always less than the\nordinary price-compensating variation ; indeed, it tends to be negative. Only in the\ncase when VW is the equivalent of BE and at the same time X is a free good, is the\nadjusted variation nil (while the ordinary variation is, of course, positive).\n\nIn case (1) the adjusted variation tends to be larger than the ordinary variation\nand, consequently, positive (since in that case even the first step tends to involve\npositive utility). In the limiting case, however, when IM itself is the equivalent of\nBE, the two variations are equal. If in addition the price of X is prohibitive, both of\nthem are equal to nil.\n\nAn adjustment for a change in the consumer's taste can be made in the price-\nequilibrating variation by a similar method. It can beshown that in the most interesting\ncase, in case (3), such an adjustment is likely to reduce the price-equilibrating variation\nin the same way as in this case it tends to reduce the price-compensating variation,\nthough this is not necessarily so, but rather depends on certain properties of the con-\nsumer's two indifference maps.!\n\nSimilar adjustments can be made in these quantities in the case when finite price\nchanges occur together with a change in a consumer's taste.\n\nIV\n\nChanges in a consumer's taste in general fall into three classes.\n\n(i) The change may alter his indifference map between a certain commodity X\n(measured along the abscissa) and money (measured along the ordinate) so that each\nindifference curve of the right-hand map lies, over the whole of its course, in relation\nto the axes, lower than (to the left from) its equivalent on the left-hand map (see Fig. 3).\nIn this case this change 1s favourable to the consumer whatever his income and whatever\nthe price of X. This is so because, irrespective of the price of X, he can reach an in-\ndifference curve representing a given utility, in the second situation with a lower\n\n1 The price-equilibrating variation in the usual sense can be defined for our case as the amount of\nmoney that would have raised a consumer with the taste T,, before the introduction of the new commodity,\nto the same level of well-being to which the introduction of this conrmodity has raised him. It is equal to\nIK since at K the consumer would be as well off as he is at U.\n\nThe price-equilibrating variation adjusted for the change in the consumers taste, on the other hand, is\ntheamount that would have raised a consumer tih the taste T,, before the introduction of the new commodity\nto the same level of well-being to which the introduction of this commodity, together with a change of his\ntaste from T, to T,, has raised him, i.e. it is the sum that would have raised him from B to C (since C repre-\nsents the same utility as U does, viz. & \u2014 3). This sum is, of course, BC.\n\nWe have assumed that BC \u00ab IK, i.e. that the adjusted price-equilibrating variation is less than the\nordinary price-equilibrating variation. This is likely to be true in case (3), but is not necessarily true. We\nknow that OB \u00ab\u20ac O'J since OB \u2014 O'I and O'I & O'J. This means that on the ordinate of the left-hand\ngraph the point corresponding to w \u2014 2 is nearer to the origin than the point corresponding to the same\nutility is on the ordinate of the right-hand graph. This makes it likely that the same applies to the points\non the two ordinates representating 4 \u2014 3, i.e. that OC \u00ab O'K, which would imply that BC \u00ab IK since\nOB - Q'I. But this argument is not conclusive.\n\nOn the other hand, in case (2) the adjusted price-equilibrating variation tends to be negative since in\nthe second situation (at U) the consumer tends to be worse off than he was in the first (at B).\n\nIn case (1) the adjusted price-equilibrating variation tends to be positive and is likely to be higher\nthan the ordinary price-equilibrating variation.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:06:07 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

This means that U is a position of higher utility than B, or at worst, of equal\nutility to B. (It will be a position of equal utility only if the equivalent of BE is IM\nitself and at the same time the price of X is probibitive for the consumer.) The con-\nsumer tends to enjoy his new taste for its own sake even if a prohibitive price of X\nprevents him from gratifying this new taste\u2014except for a limiting case. But even then\nhe is only indifferent to the change, not expressly hostile to it.\n\n(2) The curve equivalent to BE may be VW or a curve even higher than that.\n(VW is the highest indifference curve that has a point in common with the horizontal\nline drawn through 7.) In that case U is a position of lower utility than B, or at best of\nequal utility to B. (It will be a position of equal utility only if the equivalent of BE\nis VW itself and at the same time the price of X is nil) The consumer tends to dislike\nthe change in his taste even if the free availability of X permits him to gratify his new\ntaste to the saturation point\u2014except for a limiting case, when he is indifferent to this\nchange.\n\n(3) The indifference curve equivalent to BE may lie between 7M and VW. In\nthis case U is a position preferred to B if it lies above the curve equivalent to BE, is a\nposition less preferred than B if it lies below that curve, and is equally preferred to B\nif itlies exactly on that curve. Since the position of U depends on the slope of the price\nline IQ, this implies that U is a position preferred to B if the price of X remains below a\ncertain limit and a position less preferred than B if the price of X is higher than that.\nIn other words, in case (3) the consumer enjoys his new taste if the price of X permits\nhim to gratify his new taste to a sufficient extent, but dislikes it in the opposite case.\n(There is also a unique intermediate price of X, which makes the consumer indifferent\nto the change.)\n\nIn the real world case (3) seems to be the most common. A new want tends to be\nan additional source of satisfaction if it can be duly gratified, but tends to be a source\nof dissatisfaction if it cannot.\n\nWe have assumed that case (3) applies to Fig. 2. The indifference curve equivalent\nto BE is JP, which lies between 7M and VW. Moreover, the price of X is assumed to\nbe low enough to raise the point U above the critical curve /P. Consequently U is a\nposition preferred (\u00bb \u2014 3) to B (u \u2014 2).\n\nThe price-compensating variation in the usual sense can be defined for our present\npurposes as the highest amount of money that a consumer with the taste 7, could pay\nafter the introduction of the new commodity, without becoming worse off than he\nwould be 2f he had the same taste T, but if this commodity were not available to him\n(i.e. the amount he could pay without becoming worse off than he would be at the\nposition 7). This amount is ZG. Had the consumer to pay out this sum, he could still\nreach R, which represents the same utility as I does.\n\nThe price-compensating variation adjusted for the change in the consumer's taste,\non the other hand, is the amount that the consumer could pay after the introduction of\nthe new commodity, when his taste is T,, without becoming worse off than he was\nwith the taste T, before the introduction of the new commodity (i.e. without becoming\nworse off than he was at the position 5). This amount is only ZH. In effect, had the\nconsumer to pay out as much as IG, he could reach only R (wu \u2014 r1), which is a position\ninferior to B (s \u2014 2). On the other hand, if he pays only IH, he can still go to S (& \u2014 2),\nwhich involves the same utility as B did.\n\nWe might imagine that the consumer moves from B to U in two steps : first he\ngoes from B to I, which corresponds to the change in his taste, and then he goes from\nI to U, which corresponds to the appearance of the new commodity on the market.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:06:07 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The usual definition of these con-\ncepts assumes that the consumer's taste is the same both before and aft\u00e9r the emergence\nof this commodity.\n\nIn the real world, however, this condition quite often fails to be fulfilled. The\ndemand for a new commodity tends to be created simultaneously with its appearance\non the market. We shall, therefore, attempt to generalise these two concepts so as to\nmake them cover this case as well.\n\nFig. 2 shows a consumer's indifference map before, and after he has acquired a\ndemand for the new commodity X. Money is measured along the ordinate and the\ncommodity X along the abscissa. In the first situation the indifference lines are all\nhorizontal owing to the fact that the consumer has no demand for X.\n\nFig. 2\n\nThe consumer's money income is OB \u2014 O'I. In the first situation his equilibrium\nposition is B. In the second situation he moves along the price line 7Q to the position U,\nwhere he touches KZ, the highest indifference curve open to him.\n\nDoes the position U represent for him a utility higher than the position B did ?\nThe answer obviously depends on the correspondence rule between the two indifference\nmaps, in particular on which indifference curve of the second map is equivalent to the\nline BE of the first map.\n\n1 See J.

Moreover, the nearer the two\ndates compared, the smaller this margin of doubt.\n\nUsually not only the person concerned can form a judgment as to whether his\nwelfare has increased or decreased from one time to another, but a careful observer\ncan also form a reliable opinion on that matter on the basis of this person's expressive\nbehaviour. Furthermore, psychology offers various projective techniques, which can\nusefully supplement simple observation in deciding the question of whether an indi-\nvidual's subjective well-being has risen or fallen.\n\n* * *\n\nThough utilities in terms of two different tastes of an individual are comparable\nonly with a certain margin of indeterminacy, we shall base our theoretical argument\non the simplifying assumption that they are exactly comparable. In this we shall only\nfollow the example of ordinary welfare economics (of constant tastes). In effect, the\ncomparison of utilities in terms of a given taste is also always subject to a certain\nmargin of doubt, yet welfare economics assumes their exact comparability. (Only on\nthe basis of this assumption can indifference, for instance, be regarded as a transitive\nrelation.!)\n\nA simplifying assumption like this does not do any harm and is fully permissible,\nif, in the case of applying our conclusions practically, due allowances are made for an\nappropriate margin of error. Welfare economics, both of constant and of variable\ntastes, can confidently judge that one state of affairs is preferable to another only if\nthe difference in their theoretical welfare indices is sufficiently large, that is, is larger\nthan the estimated margin of indeterminacy. But within the course of our theoretical\nreasoning this complication may be safely disregarded.\n\nIn practice, the problem of whether a certain change in the consumers' tastes is\ndesirable or not, can be best decided by experimenting with a representative sample\nof these consumers. If this sample in general enjoy being habituated to spending their\nincome in a different way and to re-arranging their expenditure accordingly, then this\nmay be considered as being a good thing, and in the opposite case as being a bad thing.\n\nOn the other hand, if the sample are divided on that matter, their opinions may\nbe subjected to statistical analysis. A part of the variation may be explainable by\ndifferences in these consumers' relevant individual characteristics. For example, the\ndisagreement may be found to result from the fact that consumers of a certain sex,\nage, income, occupation, education etc., tend to favour the proposed change in their\ntaste, while consumers of the other sex, or of another age, income, occupation and\neducation tend to disfavour it. In such cases the proposed measure may be recom-\nmended for the former group of consumers alone.\n\nAnother part of the variation in the 'consumers' opinions may be impossible to\naccount for in this way. In this case it must be assumed that even some of the statis-\ntically not-further-analysable groups of consumers are still divided on that issue.

Similarly, CD may rise to the utility level 4 \u2014 3 and EF to\nthe utility level 4 \u2014 4.\n\nSuch a change in the consumer's taste would not appear in his market behaviour,\nbut (apart from his subjective experience) only in his verbal statements and his ex-\npressive gestures. He would make the same choices in the same market situations,\nexcept that he would say he was, and would look as if he was, more happy in the same\nobjective situations with his second taste than with his first taste. This implies that\nthe operational meaning of the proposed concepts of '' taste \"\" and of \"' utility \" cannot\nbe defined in terms of the consumer's market behaviour alone, but must involve a\nreference to his verbal and expressive reactions (see below, Section 2).\n\nIt may often be to some extent arbitrary, which factors affecting an individual's\nwell-being are included in the concept of his '' objective situation \" and which are\nincluded in the concept of his '' taste.\" We may choose, for instance, to include all the\nnon-economic variables in the concept of his '' taste,\" and to speak of a change in a\nperson's '' taste \"' if his well-being is reduced by sickness or increased by a new friend-\nship. Alternatively, these factors may also be included in the concept of '' objective\nsituation \". In any case an individual's '' taste '\" may be regarded as a complementary\ngood to the commodities consumed by him in so far as the latter's utility for him depends\non the presence of an appropriate taste and may change with a change in his taste.!\n\nII\n\nWe have assumed that a given consumer is in general able to compare the utility\nhe derived from a certain group of commodities when his taste was 74, with the utility\nhe now derives from another group of commodities when his taste is T.\n\nIn effect, many people who have recently acquired a taste for French food, for\nclassical music, for drinking or for travelling etc., have often quite a definite opinion\nas to whether this change in their taste has been worth while or not. Admittedly,\npeople may be unable to tell whether a given change in their taste has s/ighily increased\nor slightly decreased their welfare, but they seldom seem to be in doubt as to whether\na given change has greatly raised or greatly reduced their welfare. Though any com-\nparison between one's well-being at two different dates involves a certain margin of\n\n1 Professor Sydney Schoeffler has recently suggested two alternative methods for dealing with changes\nin the consumers' tastes in welfare economics (see his '* Note on Modern Welfare Economics,\" American\nEconomic Review, Vol. LXII, No. 5, December, 1952, pp. 880-7). Both of his methods, however, suffer\nfrom the fact that he assumes that a consumer's welfare is uniquely determined by his system of preferences\n(by his '' ordering \" in his terminology) and the objective situation. We have seen that this is not the case.\n\"Though a consumer's welfare may be said to be uniquely determined by his taste and his objective situation,\nthis applies only if his '' taste \"\" is defined so as to include information additional to his system of preferences.\n\nProfessor Schoeffler assumes also that, if the objective situation changes from X, to X, while the taste\nof a certain individual at the same time changes from T to T,, and if X, is preferred to X,, both in terms of\nT, and in terms of T,, then the welfare of this individual must be higher in the second position than it was\nin the first. This need not be so, however. Let w (X,,, T) be the utility the individual derives from the\nobjective situation X,, if his taste is T,. Then from w (X,, Tj) \u00bb w (X, Tj) and wu (X, Tj) \u00bb w(X, Ty)\nit does not follow that \u00ab (X,, T,) 9 w (X4, T3).\n\nIn effect, the individual's capacity of satisfaction may have fallen so much (when his taste has changed\nfrom T, to T;) that both \u00ab (X,, T,) and \u00ab (X,, T,) are less than \u00ab (X, T).\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:06:07 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "Welfate Economics of Variable astes\n\nI\n\nWelfare economics in its present form has to make the unrealistic assumption\nthat the consumers' tastes remain constant in the period under investigation. The\npurpose of this paper is to try to find a method of dispensing with that assumption,\nand of dealing with changes in the consumers' welfare when their tastes change, with\nor without changes in other economic and non-economic conditions.\n\nFor this purpose we must go beyond the assumptions of the usual ordinal utility\ntheory. We shall assume, not only that consumers are able to compare the utilities\nthey would derive from different groups of commodities at a given moment (on the\nbasis of given taste), but also that they are able to compare the utility (subjective\nsatisfaction) they derived from one group of commodities at the time /A,, when their\ntaste was T, with the utility (or subjective satisfaction) they now derive from another\ngroup of commodities at the time Z,, when their taste is T,. The empirical justification\nof this assumption will be examined in Section 2.\n\nIt should be noted that this assumption, though it goes beyond the usual ordinal\nutility theory, does not depend on the concept of cardinal utility since it by no means\nrequires that differences between different levels of utility should be comparable. The\nconcept of utility that we shall use is an ordinal utility concept, though an ordinal\nutility concept of a special kind.\n\nAdopting this assumption, one may still describe a given taste T, of a certain\nindividual in terms of any arbitrarily chosen ordinal utility function with the only\nrestriction, as usual, that preferred positions must be assigned a higher value of the\nutility function, and that equally preferred positions must be given the same value.\nOur assumption entails an additional restriction only in the case when this individual's\ntaste changes (say, to 7), for this new taste must now be described in terms of a utility\nfunction consistent with the one defined for the taste T,. In other words, if certain\nobjective situations have the same value for the individual on the basis of his present\ntaste T, as certain other situations had on the basis of his previous taste T4, they must\nbe assigned the same value of the utility function as the value ascribed to the latter\nsituations.\n\nFor instance, let us assume that the left-hand graph of Fig. r represents an\nindividual's indifference map belonging to the taste T4, and that the right-hand graph\nof the same Fig. shows his indifference map corresponding to the taste T',. If we\ndisregard the utility indices appearing on the graphs, it is impossible to tell whether a\ngiven point of the right-hand map represents, in terms of the taste 7;, a utility higher\nor lower than, or equal to, the utility of any particular point of the left-hand map in\nterms of the taste T,. To decide this, we need the additional information as to which\nindifference curves on the one graph and which indifference curves on the other graph\nare equivalent to each other, i.e. represent the same level of utility for the individual.\nThis piece of information may be called the correspondence rule between the two in-\ndifference maps. Our assumption of the comparability of the utilities corresponding\nto two different (subsequent) tastes of an individual implies the existence of such a.\ncorrespondence rule between his subsequent indifference maps.\n\nThis correspondence rule is expressed by the utility indices of the two graphs of\nFig. r. The indifference curves AB, CD and EF of the left-hand graph have been\narbitrarily assigned the utility values 4 \u2014 I, 4 \u2014 2 and w \u2014 3 respectively.

The wrong way to go\nabout things is to assume that the sort of national accounts prepared in Western Europe\ncan be transferred lock, stock and barrel to these countries.\n\nAlthough Mr. Seers occasionally gives the appearance of being fascinated by\nLeontief matrices and the like fer se, I should judge that he would accept the general\napproach I suggest. Where we appear to disagree is, firstly, in the relative emphasis\non different policy issues (for example, Mr. Seers concentrates largely on income\nstability ; I raise such issues as the equity of the fiscal burden as well) ; secondly, in\nour analysis of the economic structure of underdeveloped territories (for example, the\npossibility of separating off the transport sector, the importance of '' non-Western \"\nactivity) ; thirdly (and consequently), in our assessment of the usefulness of construct-\ning accounts for the '' Western \" sectors only. Finally, we disagree in our appraisal of\nthe net additional work involved for the statisticians in the preparation of aggregate,\nas distinct from '* Western \"' sector, totals.\n\nCambridge. A. R.

                    "A REJOINDER 231\n\nThis controversy is, in a way, rather unreal, because we agree on what statistics\nare desirable\u2014both detailed ''sector\"' statistics and '' aggregative \" statistics. The\nquestion is one of the order of work. I do not want to name particular territories, but\nI doubt whether many people will deny that, in the flush of enthusiasm for the '' national\nincome,\" attempts to put together aggregative estimates, of very doubtful definition\nand accuracy and of very little use, have in fact been given a priority above the improve-\nment of basic statistics.! A set of \"sector\" accounts allows a coherent statistical\npolicy to be drawn up, with scarce professional resources allocated between the basic\nsector statistics according to three criteria : (2) how intrinsically important is a sector ? ;\n(b how important a contribution towards improvement of other sectors, and of\naggregative statistics, will be made by improving this sector's statistics ? ; (c) how\nmuch work is involved in improving its statistics ? (\" Importance \" in the first two\nquestions depends on the country's economic problems.)\n\nIt may be that asking these questions will lead to the same balance of statistical\nwork as is involved in proceeding directly to estimate the national income. But this\nwould be just a coincidence.\n\nNew York. DuonprEv SkERs.\n\n! To avoid an unbalanced picture, I should add that the demand for national income estimates has\ngiven a great stimulus to official statistics and led to much valuable work that would otherwise have been\nomitted. It could certainly be argued that, when everything is considered, some excessive emphasis on the\n'' national income \" has been necessary. But possibly the harm done now outweighs the advantages. (A\ncynic might add that there is no need, anyway, for economic statisticians to believe their own propaganda.)\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:08:45 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "230 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nbe drawn will depend, of course, on the extent of savings institutions, whether corporate\nor not. How to treat ' voluntary \" savings is one of the most awkward problems of\npractical economics in all countries, and all I would assert is that somebody responsible\nfor an economic policy will be in a little better position if calculations of this sort are\nmade than if they are not made. Stabilisation policy in underdeveloped areas may be\nin many cases even more speculative than in developed countries (although I suggested\nsome special advantages of certain underdeveloped areas), but would Mr. Prest seriously\nargue that this procedure for indicating quantitative aspects should be abandoned\nmerely on the ground that, as he rightly says, it is unrealistic to hope to forecast the\ninflationary gap ?\n\nI do not wish to seem pedantic in continuously rejecting Mr. Prest's versions of\nmy argument, but the statement that '' variations in export prices are often to a large\nextent\" absorbed by increases in public or corporate savings, is not a '' universal\ngeneralisation \" covering all countries, nor does it state that such variations are fully\noffset. Handling the export surplus may raise considerable difficulties, but the one\nmentioned by Mr. Prest, the uncertainty about Marketing Board policy, does not seem\nrelevant, since in West Africa this is under Government influence, and one of the main\npurposes of such calculations would be to show the implications of various prices which\nthe Boards may pay farmers.\n\nLet us now take up the main issue\u2014whether to aim at '' aggregative,\" rather than\n* sector,\" accounts, The question of whether a savings-and-investment account can,\nor cannot, be used in the way I suggested is in any case not of great importance for\nthis issue. One major weakness of Mr. Prest's position is that he assumes that reliable\nestimates of local food sales can be readily obtained. In fact, he goes as far as to deny\nthat price collection is a large net additional burden on colonial statisticians, on the\ngrounds that '\" they already need to collect them for the compilation of retail price\nindices.\" Surely for price indices a statistical office will usually confine the coverage\nto a few towns, the number of items priced to a few representative foodstuffs, and the\ncollection to, at most, daily market visits. This would constitute a tiny and biased\nsample of the total of sales. It would seem rather inadequate as a basis for the uses to\nwhich Mr. Prest suggests income aggregates may be put\u2014such as assessing how much\nthe area concerned needs grants-in-aid or how fair its tax burden is.\n\nThe prices of food require a good deal of field work, and so do volumes of output\n(unless there are good crop surveys, for example, for land revenue assessment).! My\nmain point is that this work should not be allowed priority above extracting the clues\navailable in trade statistics and Government accounts (including tax statistics). These\nare fields of research which yield very highly per man-hour of research : the basic\ndata can usually be considerably improved, much information can be extracted from\nthem without a great deal of work, and these statistics are important in themselves for\nthrowing light on policy.? My original paper was not concerned, as readers of Mr.\nPrest's reply might have assumed, with whether the national income was worth\nestimating, but with the question of what the balance of statistical policy in under-\ndeveloped areas ought to be.\n\n1 Perhaps I should take this opportunity \u00f3f correcting one point in my paper : I implied that total\nfood output would be estimated by adding cash and subsistence estimates. For many underdeveloped\nterritories this is true, but in others total agricultural output can be estimated directly from crop censuses,\nand the problem is how to split it into '' cash \" and '' subsistence.\" It is probably easier in such cases to\ninclude '' subsistence \"' food in items of the sector accounts.\n\n? For example, reclassification of trade returns yields information on the value, volume and prices of\nimports of consumer goods, capital goods, etc.\u2014these are important clues on the value, volume and prices\nof consumption and investment.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:08:45 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "A Rejoinder\n\nMr. Prest's summary of my argument is hardly fair in detail or in general\nimpression. While I do hold that calculations of aggregate national income figures are\nsubject to severe limitations, for policy decisions, among other reasons, I specifically\nemphasised that they are o\u00a3 '' useless \". It also seems unreasonable of Mr. Prest to\nattribute to me sweeping generalisations such as that '' model building is a mirage,\"\nthat '' evaluation of local food sales is not of much interest,\" or that attempts \"' should \"'\nbe made to forecast food production. I would, moreover, point out : (r) High labour\nturnover in particular industries is not inconsistent with resources being specific : men\nmay, and do, move between agriculture and mining without being available for skilled\nbuilding jobs. (2) To say that lack of development involves reliance on the proceeds of\nexports, is not to define '* underdevelopment,\" still less does it imply that the United\nKingdom or New Zealand is underdeveloped.! (3) To accumulate several years' data\none need not wa?! several years : one can estimate tables for past years. (4) Discrep-\nancies between movements of aggregates make it difficult to pass from '' demand \"\nto \"supply \" analysis : this difficulty is not removed by calculating both aggregates.\n\nTwo of Mr. Prest's arguments are based on misunderstanding. My point about\n\" a large fraction of all economic transactions\" being covered by readily available\naccounts was meant to refer to the '' transactions \" one has to estimate for tables of\nnational accounts. The total of such '' transactions \"' is indeed of virtually no interest,\nbut this is irrelevant to the question whether a set of such tables can usefully be con-\nstructed, which was the question under discussion.\n\nSecondly, what one includes in an account depends largely on statistical conve-\nnience. The account for the \"transport system \" will, admittedly, be confined to\ntypes of transport for which statistics are readily available, mainly public transporta-\ntion, and I should perhaps have made that clear. Such an account may well be of\nlimited significance in some territories, but, fortunately, it will in many cases cover a\nlarge proportion of the transport of exports, and thus help to show how income from\nexports spreads through the economy\u2014which I believe to be one of the main purposes\nof national accounting in underdeveloped areas.? Incidentally, the fact that transport\nmay be undertaken by the same man who processes or distributes the commodity does\nnot necessarily make meaningless the attempt to show the '' transport \" component\nseparately. In the example given by Mr. Prest, the canoe may carry other things\nbesides dried fish, and the question of substituting a lorry for the canoe may arise one\nday. However, I agree that one can sometimes leave a large undifferentiated category\nin the national accounts without too much loss.\n\nTo turn to the issue of application of national accounting in underdeveloped\nareas, Mr. Prest once more exaggerates my position. It would certainly be incorrect\nto make an '\"' assertion that voluntary personal saving can be taken as zero.\" What I\nactually said was that '' we might not be far wrong to assume as a working hypothesis\nthat voluntary savings will be zero.\" The procedure suggested is to forecast various\nitems of a '' savings-and-investment \" table, and to show what demand for personal\nsavings will be implied by various sets of,policies for development, the budget, etc.\nIf the demand is large, this suggests certain dangers of inflation, and it is in this sense\nthat one uses a \"' working hypothesis \" of zero savings. The practical conclusions to\n\n1 This implication is a nice illustration of the fallacy of the undistributed middle.\n? However, the work of Mr. Maunder in Jamaica, shortly to be published in Social and Economic Studies,\nshows how extensive a picture of transport can be built up from fragmentary data.\n\nE 229\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:08:45 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

It is difficult to see\nthat such a formalisation serves any useful purpose.\n\nConditions (a)-(c) are not exceptions to this generalis\u00e1tion. The appeal of condition\n(c) should depend on the individual's estimate of the likelihood that he will find himself\nin the position of '' dictator.\" This likelihood will vary from choice situation to choice\nsituation. Similarly, whether or not an individual should accept condition (b) should\ndepend entirely on whether or not he is likely to be better off if he submits to it\u2014and\nthis depends on the particular choice situation and on the '' imposed \" choice. Finally,\nan individual's appraisal of condition (a) should depend on the likelihood that changes\nin preferences, combined with condition (2), will produce an improvement in his position\n\u2014Aand this depends on the set of alternatives and on the direction in which preferences\nare expected to change.\n\nII\n\nEven if the argument of Section I has failed to remove the appeal of conditions\n(a)-(c), the General Possibility Theorem may founder on the implausibility of other\nconditions. In this Section it will be argued that it should not be required of choice\nprocedures that they determine transitive orderings.\n\nConsider, as Example (7), three social alternatives, A, B and C, and assume that\nin A some individuals are better off than in B, some worse off, and that a similar relation\nholds between A4 and C and between B and C. Then there exists no generally accepted\ncriterion for choosing between them. Any choice is a pure compromise choice. The\nfact that A (or B or C) is chosen does not indicate that it is '' better \" than the other\nalternatives in any sense other than that it is chosen. Choice is just choice and does not\nconfer any ethical distinction on the chosen alternative. Hence no ethical contradiction\nis implied by intransitivity. That a social choice procedure chooses 4 in preference to\nB, B in preference to C, and C in preference to A 2n :/self should not excite apprehension.\n\nTo this argument there is an apparent objection. Consider, as Example (72), three\nalternatives, A, B and C, and assume that in A all individuals are at least as well off\nas in B, some better off, and that in B all individuals are at least as well off as in C,\nsome better off. Then it follows from the basic criterion of welfare (individual pre-\nference) that A is '' better than \" both B and C, and that B is \" better than \" C. 1f,\nthen, the social choice procedure were to choose 4 in preference to B, B in preference\nto C and C in preference to A, we should consider the third choice undesirable. Does\nthis not show that transitivity is a desirable property of social choice procedures ?\nNot at all. In Example (4?) it is not intransitivity that is shown to be undesirable, but\nthe fact that C is chosen in preference to A when it is known, from other sources, that A\nis \" better than \" C. Of course any acceptable social choice procedure wowld ensure the\nchoice of A over C. But this is not the same as building transitivity into the procedure ;\nrather it amounts to imposing an alternative condition on the procedure.\n\nThis argument will not be conclusive for those to whom transitivity is an end in\nitself. Intransitivity introduces into social choice an arbitrary element which may be\nuncomfortable to some people. If intransitivity is present, choice is not independent\nof the order in which the alternatives are '' fed \" into the choice procedure. Returning\nto Example (7), if the procedure is \"' intransitive \" and A4 and B are considered first,\nC will be chosen ; but if B and C are considered first then A will be chosen.\n\nBut if the argument is accepted, it removes any sting from Arrow's theorem. For,\nif transitivity is not required, there exist many social choice procedures which satisfy\nthe remaining conditions, for example, majority voting. It might be noticed, too, that\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:09:50 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The consideration of '' all conceivable alternatives \"' yields no relevant informa-\ntion ; a decision based on the consideration of all conceivable alternatives would be\nno better informed than a decision based on the consideration of no conceivable\nalternatives. Some notion of the relative likelihoods of occurrence of alternatives is\nneeded. At any moment the community is faced, not with all conceivable alternatives,\nbut with a few of the attainable alternatives. Only the latter, and those likely to\nbecome attainable in the near future, are relevant to the selection of a social choice\nprocedure ; only in the light of particular choice situations can an individual appraise\na condition or set of conditions.3 Discussion of '* democracy,\" '' totalitarianism \" and\nother (partial) choice procedures remain without meaning until applied to particular\nchoice situations.\n\nThe implication of this discussion is that the conditions upon which individuals\nmight agree, and the choice procedures satisfying those conditions, should change from\nchoice situation to choice situ\u00e1tion.

It is not very long since economists believed\nthat there was a unique '' natural \"\" choice in which individual interests converged and\nwhich could be brought to light by the application of pure reason. Nowadays the\npresumption of a natural harmony of interests is discredited and '' the social problem \"'\nis viewed as that of effecting a compromise between chronically conflicting private\ninterests. Many, including the author, would go further and deny that there is any\nuseful sense in which the economist can speak of a '\"' best \" compromise. About all\nhe can do, without committing himself to w$obular value judgments, is uncover\nblatant inconsistencies among social choices\u2014as when the community fails to adopt\na course of action which would further the lot of everyone.\n\nProfessor Arrow has considered? the possibility that people may agree, unanimously\nand beforehand, on the minimum conditions which must be satisfied by a procedure?\nfor arriving at community choices. He states several conditions and concludes that\nthere does not exist a procedure which satisfies all of them. If the conditions were\nindeed '' worthy \"' of general acceptance, the conclusion would be useful but, in view of\nthe remarks of the first paragraph, hardly surprising. If, on the other hand, the con-\nditions can be shown to be unworthy of general acceptance, the significance of the\nconclusion vanishes.\n\nMany economists have found the conclusion both surprising and significant. This\nis evidenced by the tendency in the literature to focus attention on the mathematical\ndetails of Arrow's proof\u2014on the effects of relaxing certain conditions, of placing restric-\ntions on the set of alternatives, in general on the mathematical possibilities of cir-\ncumventing the conclusion.* We shall argue that Arrow's conditions are unreasonable\nand that the conclusion is uninteresting.

Where technical progress is neutral and accumulation\ngoes on at just such a rate as to keep the ratio of capital to output constant, the share\nof capital and labour in output and the rate of profit on capital remain constant and\nthe model is free from '' internal contradictions.\"1\n\nIn other cases the complications arising from changes in the distribution of income\nbetween classes and. changing expectations of profits are too great to be digested by\nthe assumptions of equilibrium, and it is idle to pursue the argument any further\nwithout taking account of the problem of effective demand.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe tenor of our argument has been mainly negative and the level of abstraction\nmaintained in the analysis is very high. Nevertheless, we can draw some general\nconclusions from it. The conclusions sound obvious enough, but perhaps that is all\nto the good, as it shows that the propositions drawn from the abstract argument are\nnot in conflict with common sense.\n\nThe rate of profit on capital will tend to be higher, and real wages lower :\n\n(i) the more plentiful are the technical opportunities for mechanising pro-\nduction ;\n\n(2) the slower is the rate of capital accumulation in relation to the growth of\npopulation ;\n\n(3) the weaker is the force of competition (and the weaker is the bargaining\npower of the workers, when competition is weak).\n\nGiven the degree of competition and the rate of growth of population, the course of\nthe rate of profit over the long run (abstracting from short-period fluctuations) depends\non the interaction between technical progress and the rate of accumulation. Technical\ndiscoveries (unless extremely unfavourable to capital) are continuously tending to\nraise the rate of profit and accumulation is tending to depress it. Prosperous capitalist\neconomies are those where the rate of profit is falling in spite of rapid technical progress,\nand miserable ones those where the rate of profit is high in spite of technical stagnation.\n\nCambridge. JoaN RonBiNsoN.\n\nAPPENDIX\nTHE FAcTOoR-RATIO CURVE AND THE CAPITAL-RATIO CURVE\n\nThe relations between the factor ratio and the ratio of capital (in terms of product)\nto labour employed discussed above (p. 93) can be set out diagramatically as follows :\n\nThe upper half of Fig. ITI (overleaf) repeats Fig. I. Theslope of thestraight line, \u00bb, B,\nis the ratio of an increment of output to the increment of real capital with which it is\nassociated, and at a constant wage rate an increment of output isan increment of profit ;\nthus this slope is the ratio of the increment of profit to an increment of real capital.\nTherefore, by producing f y; to cut the y axis in wyg we find the wage rate, OW s, at\nwhich Gamma and Beta techniques are indifferent. When output is OC, W.gC is\nprofit per man employed, and when output is OB, W,gB is profit per man. Similarly,\nOW ga (when af, cuts the y axis in Wg;) is the wage rate at which Beta and Alpha\ntechniques are equally profitable.\n\n!

And I must concede that when we\nstudy this, the paradox in large measure disappears. For Dr. Roosa turns out not to be\nconcerned, as Prof. Williams was in the passage referred to, with the holders of idle\nmoney, but rather with the institutional holders of Government securities. These, he\nsays, are nowadays so numerous and so sensitive that if the Central Bank can produce\neven a small change upwards or downwards in the price of such securities, they will in\nthe first case sell when they would otherwise have held, in the second case hold when\nthey would otherwise have sold ; in the one case offering the proceeds of sale in the\nprivate capital markets, in the other withholding from these markets offers of funds\nwhich they would otherwise have made. Thus, so the argument runs, a change in\nofficial rates is more easily and smoothly transmitted than used to be the case from the\nshort market to the long, and from the market for governments to the markets for\nprivate bonds, mortgages and equities. This all seems highly persuasive, provided we\ncan dismiss as a bogey the Keynesian alternative of money leaking away to, or welling\nup from, the earth on such a scale as to break the chain of causation. and thwart the\npurposes of the Monetary Authority. And personally I do not see why, in most normal\ncircumstances, we should not do so\u2014I do not think Dr. Roosa is claiming the ability\nto control earthquakes.\n\nThere still remain, however, to my mind, certain difficulties in the argument. At\nseveral points in its course it is hinted that the efficiency of the whole process depends\non the formation by lenders of an expectation that a small change in rates will be\nfollowed by further changes in the same direction\u2014Mr. A, who was thinking of lending\nin the private markets, will hold off those markets if he thinks he will be able to get\na better return on his money a little later on. Here I have two difficulties. First, I can\nsee the force of this argument if Mr. A is a holder of idle money ; but if, as Dr. Roosa\nis assuming, he is a holder of Government securities, does not the argument cut both\nways? For if Mr. A is expecting a further rise in private loan rates, he will also be\nexpecting a further fall in the price of his Government securities, and might as well\nperform his ex hyfothesi projected switch straightaway. Secondly, it is usual to\nassume that a rise in rates operates on borrowers partly by generating the offosite\nexpectation, namely that rates will be lower again in the future than they are now ;\nand Dr. Roosa in his text does not seem to dissent.! Yet it seems somewhat paradoxical\nto suppose that lenders and borrowers should consistently draw opposite inferences\nfrom the fact of an accomplished rise in rate. In a private letter which he has been\nkind enough to write me, Dr. Roosa seems rather to take the view that borrowers will\nshare the '' elastic \"' expectations of lenders, but will not, in the most important cases,\nbe in a position to act upon them by rushing in to borrow now ; i.e. borrowers will be\nmore affected by the ac\u00edual rise in the rate of interest, and lenders by its expected\nfurther rise. If this can be accepted, what I will still venture to call the Roosa paradox,\nnamely that a small rise in rates will both diminish the stream of loanable funds deman-\nded and the stream of loanable funds offered, can remain intact. At the back of my\nmind, however, I still cannot help wondering whether budgetary considerations are\nnot still leading the monetary authorities in both Britain and the United States to\ntake a more optimistic view of the restrictive effects of small changes in official rates\nthan in the long run will be found to be justified.\n\nCambridge.

This approach, however, wishes to evaluate different\ngeneral policies or situations independently of judgments on the distribution of welfare\nIt does this by making statements which do not conflict with a wide range of such\nfinal judgments. If the utility-possibility curve of one situation lies entirely outside\nanother so that everyone could be made better off for any initial distribution of welfare,\nthis analysis concludes that the first siiuation is potentially superior to the other.\nIf economists desire to have as little to do as possible with distribution judgments,\nthey should, it would seem, restrict themselves to this type of analysis. Of course, if the\npotentially superior general policy change is carried out, the selection of the particular\nwelfare position to which the move should be made requires a distribution judgment.\n\nThe economist might enlarge somewhat the scope of his study from this approach\nby considering only a range of possible welfare distributions. Many welfare positions\nmay be generally unacceptable for political reasons at the time a change is considered.\nThe relation of the situation utility-possibility curves in this range would be irrelevant.\nSince a distribution judgment is finally required to make a particular change in welfare,\none might go still further and decide that the relation of the curves within the politically\nfeasible range is relevant only to the extent that no welfare position should be judged\nto be the best under the circumstances, if it is possible to improve everyone's welfare\nover that position. But the choice of a welfare position satisfying these conditions\nmust be left to the investigator. Of course, this amounts to the Bergson approach\nexcept that social welfare functions, whose maximum welfare positions are within\nthe politically unacceptable range, are excluded. This would appear to be a more\nrealistic approach than that suggested by Little.\n\nIV\n\nIn current discussions of economics, one seldom hears a kind word for welfare\neconomics. The disillusionment caused by the destruction of the original claims that\nwelfare economics could be based on objective economic criteria, independently of\njudgments about interpersonal distributions of income, has led to general cynicism\ntowards the subject. Successive qualifications and retrenchments made in the field\nseem to have left only an idle plaything\u2014useful perhaps for learning certain general\nequilibrium relationships but little else. Basically, many of the objections reflect the\nsterility of static general equilibrium analysis, which has dominated economics for\nyears, as a concept for analysing the real economic world. Economists have much to\nsay which is useful concerning the allocation of resources, but in the real world the\nproblem is much more complex than the traditional approach can lead one to believe.\nThese differences between the model and reality and the importance of the non-\neconomic factors point up the insignificance of the contribution from the ''new\nwelfare \" economics for reaching policy decisions. Until the dynamic aspects of con-\nsumer behaviour and production theory can be handled better by economists, modern\nwelfare economics cannot be expected to make much of an analytical contribution\nto policy-making. Furthermore, welfare economics can never be more than ''a\nsystematic way of introducing from outside of economics various ethical norms.''?\nBut this in itself is a worthwhile objective. For almost every economist recommends\npolicy, and, unless the value judgments underlying the recommendations are presented\nin an orderly manner, we will continue to have those frustrating arguments which\nappear to be about economic analysis but often turn out to be a matter of ethics.\n\nCambridge, Mass.

Here Mr. Rees overlooks the fact that the greater the fall in prices\nin A, the more will the value of investment in A decline. Now Mr. Rees has not specified\nany assumption concerning real investment. But even if he has assumed that real\ninvestment remains constant (a reasonable starting assumption), it is completely\ninconsistent to allow the general level of home prices to fall and yet not allow for the\neffect of the fall in the money value of investment. If this inconsistency is removed\none finds that \"* there is in every period a fresh injection of an investment multiplier.''!\nIn fact, Mr. Rees' analytical inconsistency may extend further than this for he may\nnot.even be assuming that real investment remains constant after the initial auto-\nnomous change in expenditure, as can be seen from the quotation from his article\nmade in the second paragraph of the. present article.?\n\nParis. W. BECKERMAN.\n\nJournal, December, 1951, especially pages 816\u201417. This difficulty was not removed by the method adopted\nby the present writer of defining price-flexibility without reference to real income. For the definition of\nreal income as implicit in the formulation of the consumption function provided by the present writer\n(op. cit.) did not allow for the effect of changes in the relative price of imports on real income. In short, in\nthe formulation of foreign trade multipliers without the usual limitation of fixed prices, the problem of the\ndemand for imports is not solved merely by introducing the relative prices of imports and home goods\ninto the demand equations, for the concept of real income to which the marginal propensity to import\nmust be related also needs modification. But the effect on real income of changes in the relative price of\nimports depends on the relative weights given to import prices and home prices. These relative weights,\nunfortunately, cannot be assumed constant in a multiplier analysis dealing with finite changes (as distinct\nfrom the analysis of the type presented by A. C. Herberger, and Laursen and Metzler ; see H. G. Johnson,\nop. cit., p. 817n, for references), for the object of such an analysis is, in part, the examination of how they\nwill change. In other words, when the analysis is concerned with finite changes the demand equations need\nto be completely specified.\n\n1 See W. Beckerman, op. cit, page 411. In the published formulation by the present writer of the\nconditions determining the changes in the trade balance where prices are allowed to vary, the resulting\nformule for the foreign trade multiplier were not included. For the use of Mr. Rees or any other economists\nwho may be interested, these formule are as follows :\n\nThe final change in income (A) of countries 1 and 2 are (in the converging cases) :\n\n\u2014-YX\n(1 \u20147) a1 \u20147\") \u2014 9*9\"\nX\n\"\u00e0a-\"va-r)-ww\n\nWhere X \u2014 an initial change in income in country 2, and the other symbols have the meanings attached\nto them in the article referred to above. The actual change in the trade balance is thus equal to the change\nin the inne of each country times its total propensity for the balance of trade to change as income\nchanges (wu\n\n? The problem of allowing for a fall in the value of investment in models in which price changes have\nmuch wider implication of course than those mentioned above. Much work has already been done on\nmultipliers in which rea? investment is allowed to vary, particularly in trade cycle theory and also in foreign\ntrade multiplier theory (see W. Beckerman, op. cit., page 411 n., for references). But in most models in\nwhich prices have been allowed to vary the purely price effect on the money value of investment (i.e.\nignoring induced effects on '' real\" investment) has still not been fully allowed for. It would certainly\nappear that in so fat as trade cycle theory still relies heavily on the concept of the multiplier it must some\nday: include a serious attempt to incorporate price changes into the specific concept of the multiplier, and\nuntil this is done it is not possible to make much progress with the special probl\u00e9m of the foreign trade\nmultiplier.\n\nkb\u00e0-\n\nand \u00c0'\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:16:06 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Scrutiny of our system shows that if (1) to (5)\nholds, and if all but one of the commodities in (5) show a balance between total world\nproduction and consumption, then the remaining commodity cannot fail to be in\nbalance. The interested reader may verify this in the general case or in the case of a\nfew goods, factors and countries. With one of our equations dependent and redundant,\nour worries over the over-determinacy of the system are at an end.\n\n27. Of course the quality as well as the quantity of our equations must be taken\ninto account. It is for this reason that the inequality signs were included in (2) and (3).\nWhen comparative advantage or technology decree that the amount of some input\nis to be zero in some industry, we lose a marginal productivity equality, replacing it\nby thestatement that the wage must not beless than the value of marginal productivity.\nSimilarly, if supply and demand should cause a factor to become a free-good with\nzero :, we would no longer in (3) require more than that its sum in all uses should not\nexceed the total available. Within the production sphere we could perhaps rule out all\nindeterminacy if the production functions all had nice regular curvature properties,\nwith every marginal productivity running the gamut from infinity to zero.\n\nSo long as we are no longer striving to prove the geographical equalisation of\nfactor prices, it is no longer necessary to require that there be as many goods as factors,\nor that the goods differ in their factor intensities ; but if we do assume inelastic\nsupplies of the factors and fixed coefficients of production, singular cases can arise in\nthe production sphere where inelastic supplies may overlap with inelastic demands\nwith a resulting indeterminacy of pricing. But contrary to what some of the older\nwriters thought, the inequalities in our equations make it quite impossible that\nnegative prices or negative production should ever result.\n\n28. Our equations are not complete if we do not go beyond the production sphere.\n'The demand-supply relations of (4) were shown by Walras and Marshall to be quite\ncapable of intersection more than once, so that multiple equilibria are possible both\nin the domestic and international sphere. In terms of a rudimentary theory of dynamics,\nor the laws of motion that govern the way a system out of equilibrium behaves, we\ncould distinguish between locally-stable and locally-unstable equilibrium points.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n37. 1 need scarcely add the caution that the above description is of a very\nidealised, statical, competitive situation, where monetary considerations scarcely\nraise their ugly heads. Yet, both from the standpoint of insight into the nature of\npricing and into the normative aspects of laissez-faire not here discussed, I think that\nthis particular set of idealised assumptions has much to be said for it\u2014not only for\nquasi-aesthetic reasons, but also for the light it casts on so many of the often-confused\nissues of economic theory.\n\nCambridge, Mass.

Mr. Henderson\nsuggested that one way to compare direct and indirect taxes was to discover that\nsystem of indirect taxes which yielded, at each level of income, the same amount of\nrevenue as a progressive income tax.* He then showed that, Zf money income is held\nconsiant (if leisure is held constant) the direct tax proves ' superior\" in the con-\nventional sense of this term. But if leisure is 40? held constant, we know that the\nindirect tax can be the \" superior \" tax. The comparison of direct and indirect taxes\nwith the same '' tax formula \"' then becomes difficult. For, one reason why a change\nfrom direct to indirect taxation can increase a man's real income, is that it reduces\nthe proportion of his income paid in tax. In other words, it reduces the progressiveness\nof the tax system. Mr. Henderson is, therefore, right, in a sense, when he claims that\n* jt is not the change of method which is causing the change in output but the chang\u00e9\nin the tax formula from the point of view of the tax payer.\"? Once one moves away\nfrom a two-dimensional world, however, it is no longer true that there will be a direct\ntax system which has the same formula from the point of view of the Exchequer\nand is always '' less onerous to the payer.\"'?\n\nMr. Henderson is perfectly correct in claiming that a direct tax system can always\nraise a g?ven amount of revenue from a given money income more painlessly than an\nindirect tax. But once the amount of leisure is allowed to vary, money income will\nvary too. The best way in which the problem can then be approached is by discovering\nwhich tax system raises a given revenue most efficaceously from a given '' potential\nincome \"' or a given '' income earning capacity.\" It will then be found that a direct\ntax system will nearly always impose an '' excess burden \" as compared with some\nsystem of indirect taxes.\n\nLet us now sum up the argument and consider some implications of our results.\nWe have seen that some form of indirect taxation will be superior to direct taxation\nif individuals are able to decide how much they work. The discovery of the goods on\nwhich indirect taxes are required remains unsolved until we have more adequate\nstatistical information about demand equations. Only in particular cases\u2014such as the\npractically unimportant one of com$letely inelastic demand\u2014can one make dogmatic\nstatements about the '' optimum \" system of indirect taxation.\n\nIt should, however, be made quite clear that nothing in our analysis conflicts\nwith the acknowledged superiority of the poll tax over all other forms of tax. Nor, of\ncourse, does anything in this article deny that a change from direct to indirect taxation\nmight well reduce the progressiveness of the tax system, without enabling anyone to\nprove that it was less progressive. Such a proof is obviously impossible because no\none knows the shape of all indifference maps.\n\nLondon. W. J. ConrErT.\nD. C. HAGUE.\n\n! Op. cit., pp. 541-3.\n?

Once this is achieved all disequilibrating elements disappear\u2014the\nsystem is in equilibrium.!\n\nThe difference between this approach and Dr. Hansen's should be clearly noted.\nIt is more than a mere reversal of the order of the disinflationary measures suggested\nby the latter. The first phase of the policy is not a measure to extinguish inflationary\nexcess demand\u2014it is a move to re-establish the equilibrium relationship between\nprices and wages. Only the second phase is genuinely disinflationary.\n\nThe foregoing discussion should not be construed as denying the possibility of the\nexistence of a labour shortage. This term is generally understood to mean that there\nis not enough labour to produce an output which would fully satisfy the total demand.\nThe entrepreneurs may desire to employ additional workers even if that implies\nincreasing their wages because they expect that at least a part of the currently un-\nsatisfied demand will remain active at a higher price. The labour shortage in this\nsense is caused by the existence of the excess demand for commodities, and so it is\nbound to disappear as soon as the entrepreneurs realise that the excess demand for\ncommodities has itself disappeared. On the other hand, Dr. Hansen's approach implies\nthat the capitalists, in order to secure additional labour, may agree to pay higher\nwages even if they are not allowed to raise prices. (The rise in prices mentioned by\nDr. Hansen is not caused by the marking-up designed to offset the wage concessions\nbut by the re-opening of the commodity gap due to the increase in demand resulting\nfrom the rise in wages.)\n\nIt appears to the present writer that it is legitimate to assume that if wages are\ncontrolled they are normally so fixed as to correspond, at least approximately, to the\nmarginal productivity of labour, and that wage increases necessary to establish and\nmaintain a healthy price-wage relationship may be allowed for in advance.? In these\ncircumstances the neglect of the factor gap is perfectly justified\u2014the persistence\nof labour shortage after the deflation of the demand for commodities is only possible\nas a result of miscalculations and other frictional causes which the ordinary operation\nof market forces may gradually eliminate.\n\nThe foregoing discussion of Dr. Hansen's models suggests that his denial of the\nsignificance of the excess of ex-ante Investment over ex-ante Saving for the analysis\nof inflation is valid only within the framework of his particular approach to this prob-\nlem.? But as this essay has sought to show, the traditional approach remains superior\nbecause the concepts it uses have, under the conditions of suppressed inflation, real\ncontents of great significance while the majority of Dr. Hansen's concepts are, under\nthese conditions, purely formal. The usefulness of the concept and analysis of the\nInflationary Gap lies in that it expresses the magnitude of the restriction of demand\nwhich must be. enforced if the inflationary forces are not to generate the spiral of price\nand cost increases. It follows that the problem cannot be analysed in terms of aggre-\ngated private (erroneous) expectations, but must be dealt with in terms of global\nmagnitudes. Thus, the traditional approach provides a better explanation of the\nnature of the phenomenon and a sounder theoretical basis for policy.\n\nLondon. K. K. F.

Once controls are removed the bargaining\npower of labour obtaining under conditions of full employment may tempt them to press for higher wages,\nthe capitalists retaliating by means of a price rise rather than by a reduction in output and employment.\nThe desire of the workers to raise wages above the level dictated by marginal productivity may, however,\nbe treated as a new and extraneous inflationary shock.\n\n?

Apart from the difficulties of interpreting movements in\nthe national product discussed above, such movements are only indirectly linked to\ndevelopment\u2014they may be due to other causes than the development programme and\n(more important) the effect of development is far more extensive than can be indicated\nby short-run changes in the national income. Thus, building \u00e0 factory permits an\nincrease in national income when the factory is ready for production, but it also provides\nexperience for the building industry during construction, and leads to new industrial\nand technical jobs, raising the technical level of the local population, and at a further\nremove it reduces the dependence on imported supplies and (possibly) the sensitivity\nto cyclical fluctuations. But it may make the shortage of housing and other social\namenities more acute, particularly if the factory attracts to a town more workers than\nit can employ, and urbanisation helps to destroy the existing social structure, with\nall that this implies. In brief, many of the main effects of development are on variables\nwhich are conventionally excluded from the national product, but, nevertheless, are\nof great, perhaps overwhelming, importance.\n\nIt is, in fact, probably safer not to claim that development problems can be\ndecided statistically, let alone on *' national product \" criteria.

A structure of production which permits excess flows of\nintermediate products from one activity to be used in another, rather than be wasted,\nis obviously more efficient than one which does not.\n\nThe existence of a barrier to transfer is not alone sufficient to create differences\nin the efficiency of alternative structures of activities. There must also be present\nsufficient '' complexity \" in the technology. More formally, the conditions created by\nbarriers to transfer may, as far as this example is concerned, be treated as follows.\nIgnoring disposal activities and distinctions between sectors, the technology matrix A\nis of order NxK, where N is the dimension of the commodity space, and K the dimension\nof the activity space. If A; is the matrix consisting of the rows of A which map x\ninto intermediate products, we require :\n\n(5.0) 0 \u2014 Aux X Zo.\n\nThere will be 7 \u2014 K \u2014 p; linearly independent solutions x satisfying (5.0), where\npr is the rank of A; and is at most equal to the dimension of the space of intermediate\nproducts. (The number r is obviously unaffected by the restriction x 2 o.) Thus, if\nthe number of linearly independent rows of A, is increased relative to K, the rank, pr,\nwill be in general increased relative to K and the number of linearly independent\nvectors x satisfying (5.0) will be decreased. If p; is too large relative to K, disposal\nactivities must be joined to A4, to permit positive levels of activity to be found without\nviolating (5.0).\n\nThe distinction between sectors, and the introduction of a barrier, in the example\njust analysed have the effect of making p; large relative to K ; conversely, the intro-\nduction of transfer activities for the intermediate products decrease p; relative to K,\nconsequently enlarging the set of attainable points.\n\nIt should be noted that the enlargement of the achievable point set is accomplished\nby introducing new facets in the boundary. This phenomenon is typical of the general\ncase, and its analysis is the main mathematical problem which confronts a theoretical\ntreatment of technological structures in models additive only over sectors.\n\nStanford, California.

The complications are due partly to special peculiarities\nof the particular type of firm under study, and partly to the large number of variables\nintroduced. As a result the model bears some resemblance to firms of this kind in the\nreal world, and has been found by the writer to be a useful tool in studying newspaper\neconomics. The lesson might be that provided we are prepared to introduce sufficient\nvariables and assume reasonably realistic relationships between them, the models of\npartial equilibrium can be as useful as those of macro-economics.\n\nThe features of our model which have complicated the analysis may be summarised\nas follows :\n\nI. Our firm produces (at first) two products, the quantities supplied of one of\nthese determining the quality of the other. At the end a third product is introduced.\n\n2. On the non-advertising side, quality rather than price has been assumed to be\nvariable. This assumption is justified purely because newspaper managements are in\npractice constantly varying the quality of their products, while regarding prices as far\nless variable. The assumption of constant quality and variable price would have\nproduced a far more simple and orthodox picture.\n\n3. On the advertising side we have assumed price and quality, as well as quantity,\nvariable.\n\nMelbourne, Australia. W. M.

Can we accept an\nargument which makes the facts a doctor must consider irrelevant to the patient's\nchoice ?\n\nSecondly, there is a more abstract argument. In all such cases we may take two\npoints of view : ex ante and ex post. Looking ahead, we do seem to be in a quandary.\nIf, however, the occurrence permits us to look backward\u2014if, for instance, death does\nnot intervene\u2014we may note that only that sub-class of these events which ended in\nfailure were really crucial. For all the others we are able to go on and perform the\nexperiment again. Hence we may generalise that decisions of this class will turn out\nto be crucial contingent upon negative outcomes. Whenever we look upon an event as\ncrucial we should keep in mind that if a desirable outcome presents itself we will face\nother events of the same sort. If we lose, this is cold consolation, but we will not always\nlose. Here, for once, it is wise to accept an argument analogous to Descarte's argument\nfor belief in God. We should base our decisions on probable knowledge, for if that\nfails to save us we have lost nothing which could be reliably saved by any other method ;\nbut if it succeeds we will have acted wisely. In the long run of such action\u2014if there\nis a long run\u2014we will have maximised our chances of success, and indeed we will\nmaximise our prospects for a long run itself.\n\nFinally, to. test one lingering doubt on the matter of the relevance of probability\nto crucial choices (even in the death case), imagine how one's responses might be\naffected if one supposed the values for the probability were heavily on the side of\nfailure (or death) for some particular choice. How long could one remain indifferent\nto such probable knowledge ?\n\nIf we accept the preceding analysis we will apply probable knowledge to single\nevents. We may assign the probability of the class of events to a single event by\n\"' positing \" that event with a weight equal to the class probability. Then, if we act on\nthe basis of the posit, we will maximise our chance of success in the long run of all\nsuch decisions.!\n\n(4) The material discussed in this paper is not broad enough in scope for a theory\nof choice since it lacks, for example, any consideration of the varying extent to which\nsome measure of utility attaches to one alternative or another. But such matters are\nnot part of the task of replying to the attack against probability, and they may,\ntherefore, be omitted here.\n\nIn the preceding discussion we have been led to the conclusion that knowledge\nbased on probability calculations may be applied legitimately to apparently singular\nevents. For the problem of inadequate evidence the argument clarified the subtle\nmeans that we have to make efficient use of a larger amount of evidence. For the\nproblem which arises when our interest centres upon a single event the argument\nshowed that interest is rarely so narrow, and when it is properly conceived in terms of\nrelevant classes the application of probability to such a case is justified.\n\nNew York.

For example, the monopolist would gain little by offering to\nsell. electric refrigerators at a quantity discount.

If longer periods are taken into account, the effects\nof quantity discounts may not be as significant.

To the consumer it will always be inferior to P,\u2014\nwhich, however, is an irrelevant comparison because, \u00e0s already noted, the consumer\npays a different total tax at the two points ; but as compared to P, we can distinguish\nthree possibilities. (a) If the previous rate of the excise tax on Y is equal to the rate\nof the new excise tax on X (as it is in Fig. 4), the new equilibrium point P, for the\nconsumer, under the combination of excise tax on Y with income tax, must lie at the\npoint of intersection of the new budget line D'E' with the budget line AC, passing\nthrough P, AC, which represents the consumer's opportunities when the two excise\ntax rates are equal and levied at the same time, will be parallel to the no-tax budget\nline WB. At every point on this line the consumer would pay the same total tax,\nequivalent to AW. Therefore, the consumer will pay the same total tax under either tax\nstructure only at the point where the two budget lines, AC and D'E', intersect. Given\nthe convexity of indifference curves, P, must be on a lower indifference curve than P4,\nas it is in Fig. 4. The consumer would prefer the addition of the excise tax on X to\nthe addition of the equivalent income tax.\n\n(b) If the previous rate of the excise tax on Y is greater than the rate of the new\nexcise tax on X the consumer will still prefer the addition of the excise tax on X to\nthe addition of the equivalent income tax, that is, an income tax yielding in con-\njunction with the changed revenue from the old excise tax on Y the same total revenue\nas the two excises together. The consumer's new equilibrium point, with the income\ntax and the excise tax on Y in force, will lie below P, (his equilibrium point with the\ntwo excise taxes in force) and to the left of the budget line AC. This equilibrium\npoint will always be inferior to P,.\n\n(c) If the rate of the old excise tax on Y is smaller than the rate of the new excise\ntax on X, the consumer will reach a new equilibrium position which may be inferior,\nequal or superior to P,. There is a certain ratio between the rate of the old excise\ntax on Y and the rate of the new excise tax on X for which P, lies on the same indif-\nference curve as P,.! At this ratio, therefore, the consumer will be indifferent as to\nwhether he has to pay the excise tax on X or the equivalent income tax. For a ratio\nsmaller than this, the consumer will prefer to pay the equivalent income tax, rather\nthan the excise tax on X. The consumer always prefers the tax combination which\ncauses the least divergence from the equilibrium price ratio of X for Y that would\nexist without taxes. When excise taxes on both X and Y are imposed, the two distor-\ntions of the price ratio that will result from the two excise taxes will cancel out when\nthe rates are equal, and only partially cancel out when the rates are unequal.\n\nWe now see that the usual '' proof \" of the superiority of the income tax, the\ncontention that the excise tax places an excess burden on the consumer, is valid for\nall situations except Case (4). It is never valid if the consumer has initially been\npaying an excise tax on Y at a rate equal to or greater than the rate of the new excise\ntax on X, and it may or may not be valid if the rate of the old excise tax on Y is\nsmaller than the rate of the new excise tax on X. To sum up the entire analysis, the\nconsumer always prefers the tax combination which causes the least divergence from\nthe equilibrium price ratio of X for Y that would exist without taxes.\n\nBaltimore.

Nevertheless, it might be instructive to go\nback to Fig. 1 to see how the '' objective \" risk function fits into the '' subjective \"\npreference scheme.!\n\nLet us first start with Kalecki's assumptions of constant returns to scale, and\nconstant risk to scale. As we have seen, as loan capital is added to the entrepreneur's\nown capital, initially only the entrepreneur's risk increases, and only after a certain\nminimum loan-to-asset ratio part of the risk is shifted on to the lender. If the entre-\npreneur's own capital were greater than OT, the entrepreneur would, therefore, have\nno incentive to borrow.? Thus, under Kalecki's assumptions, we have to postulate\nthat the entrepreneur's own capital is smaller than OT, say, OA. In such a case, by\nborrowing, the entrepreneur can reach a higher indifference curve. If, however, we\nabandon the assumption of constant risk to size, the rationale of contracting loans\nbecomes clearer : as the entrepreneur borrows, the whole x'y' plane, which represents\nthe risk to the enterprise, shifts in a way favourable to the enterprise.\n\nKalecki's analysis leaves another puzzle : if constant returns to scale prevail,\nand if risk remains constant regardless of the size of the firm, while the entrepreneur\nprefers, other things being equal, not to commit all of his capital in one enterprise,\nwhy is it that firms grow, and what determines their minimum size ? It appears that\nto answer that question one has to fall back on an explanation based on indivisibilities,\nor else to admit that risk declines with size.\n\nIn the case of large, widely held corporations, the analysis presented in Fig. 1\ndoes not apply, as the individual's holdings of the stock of a large enterprise is usually\ninsignificant compared with the total outstanding stock, and forms a small fraction of\nthe individual's total assets. The floatation of equity capital is not limited, therefore,\nby the individual's dislike of committing himself too far in one enterprise. Kalecki (6)\npostulates that the existing stockholders insist on stock dilution in order to retain\nfor themselves monopolistic profits. It seems more likely, however, that equity issues\nare limited mainly because the state of the market puts a limit on potential expansion.\nThis explanation seems more plausible than Kalecki's, which would still leave the\npuzzle of the low loan-to-assets ratio in large enterprises.\n\nIV\n\nKalecki postulated the '' Principle of Increasing Risk '\"' in order to give a general\nexplanation of the limit of investment per unit time, both in the individual firm, and\nin the aggregate. The '\"'principle \" was also meant to supplant the explanations\ngiven by the theory of monopolistic competition. It does not appear, however, that\nincreasing risk does, in fact, provide us with such a general explanation, for while the\nentrepreneur's risk rises as his commitments increase, and while the entrepreneur's\nand the lender's risk increase with increasing loan-to-asset ratios, the risk faced by\nthe enterprise declines with size.\n\nEmpirical data suggests that the principle might be more relevant in the case\nof small than in the case of large enterprises. The most realistic explanation of the\nrate of expansion of the latter is still given by monopolistic competition.\n\n1 As long as we can assume that with given odds the individual prefers a greater gain or a smaller loss\nto a smaller gain or greater loss, and with given gains and losses the more favourable odds are preferred,\nthe analysis conducted in ''objective '\" terms applies to ''subjective \" decisions. Where '' subjective \"'\npreferences fail to coincide with mathematical probabilities, arbitrage becomes profitable, as in the case\nof investment trusts.\n\n? Beyond OT the entrepreneur would be unwilling to invest his own capital, because of the risk involved.\nBut if he borrows, the risk would increase even faster, and hence there would be no incentive to borrowing.\nWhen, however, the lender's risk increases, the risk premium paid by the entrepreneur is equivalent to an\ninsurance premium : a small absolutely certain loss is exchanged for a possible large one, which might\noccur if the entrepreneur invested more of his own capital, instead of borrowing.\n\n8 Vol 20\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:32:39 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "II2 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nIt is difficult to find examples of totally uncorrelated risks : the drilling of wildcat\noil wells is possibly the best one. The risk of total failure in a one-well wildcatting\nenterprise is very high. The risk of total failure of a large oil concern is very low,\nthough the risk of any one well being dry is the same for a large and for a small concern.\n\nThe assumption of total lack of correlation between the risks attached to individual\nunits of investment made by the same enterprise is clearly unrealistic, but it is equally\nunrealistic to assume that the risks are perfectly correlated, which is the condition of\nconstant risk to size.! Available evidence shows that small enterprises are more risky\nthan large ones : their discontinuance rate is higher, the variation of profits over the\ncycle is greater, and, at any given time, the range of profitability is higher. The overall\nprofitability of large and small enterprises over the whole cycle seems roughly equal.?\nIt is, therefore, reasonable to assume that risk declines with size and that riskless\nprofit remains the same. The declining risk at constant returns to scale is shown in\nFig. 4 by the dotted lines. Lines AG, B'E' and F'Q' replace now the lines 44\", BE and\nFQ respectively.\n\nIf \" increasing risk \" could be used as a universal explanation of limitation of\nexpansion per unit time, we could expect higher loan-to-asset ratios in the case of\nlarge than in the case of small enterprises, which would permit larger enterprises to\nexpand faster than smaller ones. Facts do not support this hypothesis. Although\nlarge enterprises contract their loans at much lower cost than small firms do (which\nis in keeping with the theory, for risk is less in large enterprises) :\n\nThe equity capital of the small firms provided only about r/2 of their total\nassets, compared with about 2/3 or 3/4 of the assets of the large corporations.\u2014\n[Osborn (xo).]\n\nObviously, the principle of increasing risk does not explain the difference between\nthe financial structure of large and small corporations. Moreover, if increasing risk\ndid provide an explanation for the limit of expansion per unit time of small corpora-\ntions, it clearly does not do so in case of large corporations where the loan-to-asset\nratio is lower, and the weighted risk is smaller.\n\nTo solve our dilemma we have to fall back on explanations based on considera-\ntions of market imperfections and monopoly elements. Small firms do not have a\nready access to the equity market, and the potential lenders are in a strong monopoly\nposition, as shown by Nicholson (9) and others. A large proportion of small firms'\nloans are contracted on a short-term basis, an expensive source of capital, because of\nthe difficulty of floating long-term obligations. Large firms, on the other hand, are\nin a strong position on the finance market ; there is no evidence that large firms\nwould expand faster if more finance were available, as the expansion rate is very\nlargely regulated by considerations of potential demand. Another factor also has to\nbe taken into account: small firms are mostly closely held corporations, and the\nsmall entrepreneur might put a high financial value on ownership and control. The\nissue of equity shares might involve the loss of control. Thus the small entrepreneur\nmight be more willing to contract loans than to issue equity shares. In large enter-\nprises ownership is usually divorced from control, and, therefore, the deterrent against\nthe issue of equity shares does not exist.\n\nThe *' risk function \" of the entrepreneur and of the lender as developed in this\nsection is seen to be much more complicated than the simple Kalecki-Klein function\ndescribed at the beginning of this paper, and it cannot be adequately described by\n\n1 The advantages of size increase the faster, the greater is the probability of large loss per unit invest-\nment, and the smaller the correlation between the risks. Very large concerns can take great risks without\nendangering their position, which incidentally disposes of the frequent claim that high taxation of profits\n\nwipes out risk capital.\n?

Klein and Kalecki assume that point M always\noccurs. It is obvious that the condition of occurrence of M, namely \u00c9 max 4- Q max - P,\nwill always be satisfied for some L in case of diminishing returns where P can be made\narbitrarily small by increasing total investment. Under constant, and a fortiori, under\nincreasing returns, there is no logical reason why the condition should be fulfilled.\nIf finance acts as a limiting factor, it is more probable that it does so in either of the\ntwo following ways : (1) market imperfections put an absolute limit to the amount\nof finance which any one enterprise can obtain, or (2) at a certain point, the supply of\nfinance in the form of loan capital becomes very inelastic, because of the preference\nof loan-capital owners for low-risk, low-reward investments. The latter limit has\nalready been discussed in Section 2 above.\n\nThere is much evidence, that, contrarily to our assumption, the weighted risk of\nthe firm does not remain constant with size, but on the contrary that it declines. If\nrisk were attached to individual units of investment in a random fashion, we could\nwrite a binomial expansion to indicate the decline of risk with size. To illustrate : if\nthere are two identical units of investment, and if in each case there is a 0.8 probability\nof a 20 per cent profit and a o.2 probability of a 1o per cent loss, then the weighted\nrisk for each unit is o.02. If the two events are totally independent, the weighted risk\nfor both investments taken jointly is o.0004.

A determinate\nsolution arises only under special assumptions, but the investigation of the \"risk\nfunction \"' is fruitful in that it sheds light on the differences in financial structure and\nin the rate of growth of undertakings operating under different risk conditions.\n\nI\n\nUnder the assumptions of perfect competition the size of the individual firm and\nthe rate of expansion of the firm are indeterminate. The Theory of Monopolistic\nCompetition attempts to explain how investment per unit time is determined, but the\nexplanation is clearly inadequate :\n\nImperfect competition . . . operates to limit the portion of & (the available\ncapital) invested in any particular field, but not the limit to the total amount of &.\nOn the other hand, imperfect competition cannot account for the fact that in a\ngiven industry large and, small enterprises are started. [Kalecki (6, p. 98).]\n\nIt seems dangerous to assume that monopolistic competition prevails in all fields\nof economic activity without exception, and yet investment per unit time is clearly\ndeterminate in all the fields. According to Kalecki (4, 5, 6) the limiting factor is the in-\ncreasing risk attached to the marginal unit of investment, and not the declining\nmarginal efficiency of capital :\n\nThere are two reasons for the increase of marginal risk with the amount\ninvested. The first is the fact that the greater the investment of an entrepreneur\nthe more is his wealth position endangered in the event of unsuccessful business.\nThe second reason is the danger of ''illiquidity \" . . . the amount invested &\nmust be considered as a fully illiquid asset in case of a sudden need for '' capital.\"\nIn that situation the entrepreneur who has invested in equipment his reserves\nand taken '' too much credit \" is obliged to borrow at a rate of interest which is\nhigher than the market one. . . . If, however, the entrepreneur is not cautious\nin his investment activity it is the creditor who imposes on his calculations the\nburden of increasing risk charging the successive portions of credit above a certain\namount with rising rate of interest. [Kalecki (5, p. 442).]\n\nInvestment is thus determined by the intersection of the marginal efficiency of\ncapital curve with the increasing risk curve. The smaller the initial capital of the\nentrepreneur, the greater is the entrepreneur's risk at any given level of investment.\nThe smaller the entrepreneur's investment, the less can be borrowed, and hence the\nsmaller the maximum absolute expansion per unit time. The maximum aggregate\ninvestment per unit time can be readily obtained by summing up the individual\ninvestments.\n\nIO5\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:32:39 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

As the period proceeded, additional domestic\nresources had to be utilised in the form of an increased quantum of exports to obtain\nthe same previous quantum of imports.\n\nIf the long period deterioration in the terms of trade had been due to a greater\nrate of increase in productivity in the output of primary commodities than of manu-\nfactured articles, the deterioration would not have been so significant from the view-\npoint of the primary producing countries' '' real sacrifice.\" There are, however, some\nindications that productivity increased more rapidly in industrialised Britain than in\nprimary production in the countries from which Britain imported.! It can then be\nargued, in conformity with the Singer-Prebisch thesis, that the more rapid rise in\nBritain's standard of living than in the underdeveloped countries exporting to Britain\nmeant that the underdeveloped countries helped to maintain, in the prices which they\npaid for their imported manufactures relative to those which they obtained for their\nprimary products, a rising standard of living in Britain, without receiving, in the\nprice of their own products, a corresponding equivalent contribution towards their\nown standards of living.* This is a provocative hypothesis, but without additional data\nit cannot be verified. It must, of course, also be observed that had population not\nincreased so rapidly in underdeveloped areas the rise in fer cafita real income would\nhave been substantially greater.\n\nFurther, the confinement of our analysis to the commodity terms of trade makes\nthe fall in the prices of foodstuffs and raw materials appear exceptionally unfavourable.\nAfter all, the export volume of primary producing countries expanded notably during\nthe period when the commodity terms of exchange moved against primary producing\ncountries. We may, therefore, want to correct shifts in the commodity terms of trade\nfor changes in the volume of exports. The '' income terms of trade \" is then the more\nappropriate measure, for such an index shows the volume of imports obtainable from\nthe income of the country's exports. When there is considerable expansion in the\nvolume of a country's exports, the income terms of trade will indicate less deterioration\nthan will the commodity terms of trade, given the same degree of change in export\n\nrices.\n\nP Finally, while the offer curve analysis can suggest what forces should be examined\nto determine why the terms of trade change, such an analysis cannot yield unambiguous\nwelfare conclusions when, as in the present problem, we have to consider the distri-\nbution of gains and losses over time. Difficulties in assessing the distribution of gains\nand losses over the path of change will be appreciated and will be recognised as the\nmain reason why our discussion of the relevance of changes in the terms of trade to\neconomic welfare is necessarily less conclusive than the usual static analysis as repre-\nsented by a production frontier-cum-community indifference map. We have con-\nsidered some of the qualitative tendencies which improvement in Britain's terms of\ntrade implied for Britain's gains from trade, but we cannot quantify these gains, and\nthey must always be considered along with the limitations we have discussed.\n\nWilliamstown, Massachusetts.

In a free\neconomy this increase of demand leads to rising prices and so to rising costs and\nincomes ; ie. it sets off inflation. In a controlled economy it is theoretically possible\nthat there will be no such repercussions upon prices, and hence no secondary effects\nupon incomes, because controls succeed in stifling the initial increase in demand.\nBut, as has already been noted, controls can be effective only if they do not pull too\nstrongly against market forces, which are now strengthened by the increase of demand.\n\nCost inflation occurs in its purest form in a controlled economy. In this case an\nautonomous rise in costs, e.g. a rise in the real wage rate or in prices of imported\nmaterials, can set off inflation only if there is already excess demand to absorb this\nrise of costs into prices, or if the rise in costs itself swells aggregate demand. This\nlast possibility depends upon business expectations and credit policy, and, more\ndirectly, upon whether the rise in costs leads to an immediate rise in incomes. Such\na rise occurs if there is an increase in real wages, but it does not occur if the rise in\ncosts is caused by an increase in import prices. It appears, therefore, that directly or\nindirectly demand is the fundamental factor in all inflationary processes, and that\nmeasures to restrain or reduce aggregate demand are fundamental for the control of\ninflation.!\n\nAuckland, New Zealand.

The threshold prevents the. indifferenc\u00e9 curves from\nmeeting the X axis. But this mild restriction merely affects the area covered by the\ncurves, and leaves unaffected their shape and form. The indifference maps concerned\nwill still look very much like ordinary indifference maps.\n\nThe same conclusions hold when both commodities are indispensable. In Fig. 2\nboth Y and X are indispensable goods (so no saturation loci can appear in this finite\nrepresentation of the indifference map). Let OP be the smallest amount of Y needed\nfor survival when X is considered as a variable, all other goods held fixed as given.\nSimilarly, let OQ be the smallest amount of X necessary for survival. If these minimum\namounts are independent of the quantities of X and Y held, the threshold loci will be\nstraight lines parallel to the axes, such as PP' and QQ'. All the indiffereuce curves will\nbe contained within these two lines and so prevented from meeting the axes.\n\nIf X and Y can be substituted for each other in meeting the survival needs of the\nindividual, their threshold amounts will vary. The threshold loci will then approach\nthe axes somewhat in the manner of the curves O'Q\"' and O'P\" in Fig. 2. If X and Y\ncan never completely replace each other in meeting the need for survival (so that\neven with an infinite amount of Y, say, some X would still be required), the threshold\nloci will never meet the axes and neither will any of the indifference curves. The\ntwo threshold loci may lie entirely on the same indifference curve, depending on the\ngeneral shape of the indifference curves and the location of the point O' from which\nboth loci start. That is, the two loci may, in effect, form an indifference curve. This,\nagain, is not likely to be the general case.\n\nIf X and Y can completely replace each other? for finite quantities in meeting\nthe need for survival, the threshold loci meet the axes. Then the ends of some indiffer-\nence curves may lie on both axes, the ends of others may lie on one axis and one\nthreshold locus, and the ends of all the others may lie on both threshold loci unless the\nloci coincide with an indifference curve.\n\nHowever, on all indifference maps for two indispensable goods (as on the maps for\none indispensable good) the effect of indispensability is the same\u2014\"'' empty \"' regions\narise in the neighbourhood of the axes over the range of values for which the goods\nare indispensable. It is as if the end portions of some (if not all) of the indifference\ncurves were erased. This only affects the extent of the curves and not their shape or\nform.? The restriction can easily be removed by merely shifting the origin of the\nindifference map affected. That is, the origin may be redefined to include the threshold\namount(s) of the indispensable good(s) with the other impounded quantities.* Thus,\nin Fig. 1 the origin could be shifted to the point P and in Fig. 2 to the point O'. If\nthis were done these indifference maps would be perfectly regular.\n\nOttawa, Canada. J- \u00c0. GALBRAITH.\n\n1Professor Hart, however, treats this as the general case. He looks upon the two threshold loci as\nalways forming an indifference curve\u2014his curve of ''zero satisfaction \"\u2014 and proceeds from there to\nbuild up his indifference maps for two indispensable commodities. (Cf. '' Peculiarities of Indifference Maps\nInvolving Money,\" op. cit., pp. 127-8.) 1\n\n? The possibility that X(Y) can completely replace Y(X) while Y(X) cannot completely replace X(Y)\nis easily handl\u00e9d. One threshold locus will meet an axis while the other will not.\n\n? Professor Hart concluded that the effect of indispensability is to '' restrict us considerably in our\ndrawing of indifference curves \"' (ibid., p. 127). The conclusion of this note is that if indispensability\nplaces any constraint on the choice behaviour of the individual that constraint can easily be dealt with\nby appropriately cutting off the extremities of a regular set of indifference curves.\n\nWhere the threshold loci are not straight lines this procedure would entail eliminating from the\npreference maps the end portions of some of the indifference curves.

                    "158 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\n6. This last section will discuss briefly the significance of the integrability con-\ndition in utility theory. Georgescu-Roegen, in an important paper published in 1936,!\ndemonstrated that the possibility that indifference elements could be integrated into\ncurves or surfaces did not, of itself, guarantee that those curves and surfaces were\nindifference curves and surfaces.? The condition that the two types of surface, integral\nsurface and indifference surface, should coincide is that indifference should be a\ntransitive relation. If transitivity is assumed, however, Georgescu-Roegen showed\nthat that condition alone is sufficient for the indifference elements to be integrable.\nThus the integrability conditions as such are irrelevant, for if they are obeyed when\nthe transitivity condition is not fulfilled, then the integral surfaces are not necessarily\nindifference surfaces ; and if the transitivity condition is satisfied, then the integra-\nbility conditions are redundant. It is the transitivity condition alone that is im-\n\nortant.?\n\nP This line of reasoning may be applied to the revealed preference theory. The\nHouthakker theorem establishes the transitivity of revealed equivalence. Once this\nis established, the integrability of the '' equivalence \" elements follows almost as a\nby-product of the theorem. If it were demonstrated only that the ''equivalence \"\nelements were integrable, without at the same time demonstrating that the '' equiva-\nlence \" is transitive, then the existence of a consistent total utility function would\nnot be proved. Put in another way, the integrability conditions are a necessary but\nnot a sufficient condition for the existence of a total utility function ; while the\ntransitivity condition (the other conditions for equivalence being satisfied) is both\nnecessary and sufficient.\n\nLondon.

The error in this proof lies in the italicised phrase above. It is true that we\ncould construct a superior income-sequence from P!X! to P?X? -- D, but it does not\nfollow that it will be possible to do so from P!X1! 4- D to P?X? -- 2D.

This will not in general be true, for there are no special restrictions\non the behaviour of such a boundary line implied by the assumptions of the problem.\n\n4. The proof can, however, be corrected. In order to do so, it is necessary to\nmake use of the result from the theory of differential equations? that the solution of\nthe differential equation for the boundary line is continuous in P9X?.\n\nThe economic meaning of this result may be put in the following manner : Let\nXy, and X, be two batches (incomes) on income-consumption curves /, and /, respectively,\nsuch that X, is revealed neither superior nor inferior to Xy. Now increase the batch\nX, by an infinitesimal amount of goods, to the new batch X,!. Thenthe batch X,! on /,\nwhich is revealed neither superior nor inferior to X,, can differ from X, only by an\ninfinitesiminal amount of goods. It cannot differ by a finite amount.*\n\n5. Equipped with this result, we may now give an alternative proof of the\nerroneous stage in Mr. Houthakker's argument. For ' presumably equivalent \"'\nbatches at prices P! and P?, the theorem above states that P?2X? is a continuous\nfunction of P1X!, If P?X? 4- 8 (for prices P?) is presumed equivalent to PX! -- e (for\nprices P), (8, e \u2014 o), it follows that there is an e, \u2014 0o such that 8 \u2014 2D for all e \u2014 e.\nWe can thus construct superior income-sequences from P9X? to P1X1 -- 3e,, and from\nPX -- 4e, to P?X? 4- 2D, and the proof proceeds as before.5\n\n1 The italics are ours.\n\n?

Franklin, A4 Tveatise on Advanced Calculus (Wiley, 1940), pp. 520-4.\n\n* In terms of the ordinal preference theory, the corresponding result would rule out the possibility of\ntwo indifference curves lying infinitely close in one section, and at a finite distance apart in another section,\nof the relevant range.\n\nIt is worth observing that the theorem on the existence of the '' presumably equivalent\" income,\nwhen translated into ordinal preference terms, appears as the second part of Wold's Axiom V in his exposition\nof utility theory. See H. O. A.

The main purpose of this note is to draw attention to what appears to be an\nerror at one stage of Mr. Houthakker's proof that integrability is implied by the axioms\nof revealed preference theory.! We shall amend his proof, and take the opportunity to\ncomment on the significance of the transitivity condition in utility theory.\n\n2. The first steps of Mr. Houthakker's proof, which build upon the work of\nSamuelson? and Little,? may be quickly summarised as follows :\n\nLet P' be a set of prices of \u00bb goods (f, 5f, . . ., $45), with the condition 5j! \u2014 1\nimposed to avoid complications due proportional price sets. Similarly we let Xs be a\n\nLO\nset of quantities of the goods (x,5, x95, . . ., x45) and we write P'!Xs \u2014 Z ji!xi5, the\ni1\nincome required to buy X5 at prices P*.\n\nUsing the axioms of revealed preference theory, and an assumption that demand\ncurves have continuous derivatives with respect to prices and income,* Mr. Houthakker\nshows how to construct superior and inferior income-sequences from quantities X?\nbought at prices P? to quantities bought at another price-set P!. These sequences\nare all constructed through intermediate price-sets that are linear combinations of\nP? and P!. As the difference between successive prices decreases, the superior and\ninferior income-sequences are shown to tend to the same limit determining quantities\nX! at prices P!, Mr. Houthakker then attempts to demonstrate that X? and X! are\n'' equivalent \" in the sense of formal logic, i.e. that the relation connecting them is\n(a) reflexive, (b) symmetric, and (c) transitive.\n\nIt is relatively easy to demonstrate (a) and (b). In order to prove the third relation-\nship, transitivity, it is required to introduce a third price set, P?, at which quantities\nbought, X?, are obtained, by similar reasoning to that above, as '' presumably\nequivalent \" to X1.

                    "22 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nThe significance of this modification becomes apparent when we consider the\npossible efficacy of a policy designed to keep the economy moving along the full employ-\nment ceiling. Suppose that the level and rate of growth of autonomous investment\nare sufficient to set the system moving along its ceiling. In the Hicksian model this\nwill involve induced investment growing at the same rate as autonomous investment ;\nfor P must be \u2014 o with & \u2014 o. Thus, if autonomous investment is only just sufficient\nto achieve the ceiling, a collapse may occur through the difficulty of securing smoothly\nincreasing autonomous investment : a sudden \" trough \" in the autonomous invest-\nment '' line \" would be enough to cause a collapse of induced investment and a slump.\nFor safety, therefore, autonomous investment would have to be sufficient to keep\nemployment '' over-full \". (Trade Cycle, p. 167). Once we recognise, however, that the\nvolume of induced investment depends on the magnitude of 5, another possibility is,\nin theory, available, that autonomous investment may be sufficiently productive for\ninduced investment to be practically zero along the ceiling. If this were so, a sudden\ntrough in autonomous investment would be unable to do m\u00fcch damage, and over-\nemployment would become unnecessary. Our modification points the way, therefore,\nto a greater faith than Dr. Hicks himself has in a policy designed to eliminate cyclical\nmovement rather than one which aims merely to quieten it. Its advantage over the\nover-employment solution is that induced investment is eliminated not by repressing\nan existing desire for it, but by preventing the emergence of the desire. But the prac-\ntical difficulties are obviously very great.\n\n(b) Deviations from Equilibriwn. An exhaustive analysis of this subject will not\nbe attempted.

If g were equal to h (x \u2014 \u00cd \u20ac (y) e-? dy)\n\nprices would be constant along the equilibrium path and induced investment zero.\n\nIt is interesting to compare this last result with our earlier analysis of capital\naccumulation in the Keynesian model. There we found that prices would be constant\nif investment grew geometrically at the rate A (1 \u2014 c).

Even when entrepreneurs are d/sfosed to carry out large investment\nprogrammes in response to current increases in the conditions of demand for their\nproducts, they will not have the ncentive to do so if the economy is on its equilibrium\npath and autonomous investment is sufficiently productive to prevent prices from rising\nin relation to costs.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:37:03 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

There are really two questions here : (1) is the magnitude\nof h sufficient to make the Hicksian equation (39) gravely inaccurate, and (2) what kind\nof difference in behaviour of the economic system is involved when we substitute\nequations (41) and (42) for (39) ?\n\n(r) We discussed the limits between which the coefficient A must lie in Section 3\n(in particular equations (16)-(18)) There it was shown that, for the individual\nfirm, ^ must be positive but less than the ratio of equilibrium output capacity to\nequilibrium capital. For the economy as a whole, however, a further limitation is\nimplied : A must be less than unity ; for in a macroeconomic system output and\ncapital are measured in terms of the same units, for example units of value, and it is\ninconceivable that an increment in capital should increase the value of output by as\nmuch as the value of the investment itself. Indeed at a guess we might suppose that /\nis of the order of magnitude of 5 per cent per annum. This means that the degree of\ninaccuracy involved in the implicit assumption of Dr. Hicks and others that / is zero\ncannot be very large.\n\n(2) However, it is still worth while to investigate the ind of difference made by\nthe recognition that A is positive, especially as, to the extent that investment is con-\ntrolled by central policy, its productivity is to some degree susceptible of choice. We\nshall consider first the effect on the equilibrium path, and then the effect on the devia-\ntions from equilibrium.\n\n(\u00ab) The Equilibrium Path.

Moreover, although it is recognised that this\nresult depends upon the assumption of constant prices, the implication is that the\nrelaxation of this assumption would not materially affect the conclusion.? Our own\nanalysis indicates that the whole purpose of geometrically growing investment is to\nkeep prices from falling ; if they were allowed to fall, this would not disrupt the\nequilibrium between demand and supply\u2014they would fall in order to preserve that\nequilibrium\u2014but it would discourage investment and the creation of capacity, and\nmight discourage employment of labour, if there were not a sufficient offset through\nincreased consumption. Further, the sag of prices might equally well be avoided by\nincreasing 405-productive expenditure, that is by means of projects that would create\ndemand without adding to supply. It can be shown that in this case only arithmetically\nincreasing autonomous expenditure and income are implied.

The annual increase in Government expenditure will have to be\nh (x \u2014 c) times the constant level of investment.\n\nThus it is not true that geometric growth is implied by the very nature of\ncapitalistic production, if equilibrium is to be maintained, even if by '' equilibrium \"\nwe mean '\"' constant prices.\" And even if all expenditures except private consumption\nare '' productive,\" geometric growth is required not to maintain equilibrium between\ndemand and supply, but to keep prices constant, if that is desired.

Their intersection determines 7. Diagram 6\ntells us the level of employment corresponding to the level of income '' determined \"'\nin Diagram 5.\n\nThe analogy with price-determination in a particular industry is clear. Indeed,\nthe analogy only fails to be complete because the aggregate demand curve is completely\ninelastic with respect to ?\u2014which would certainly never be the case in a particular\nindustry. The result is that Diagram 5 determines only the ratio of prices to wages,\nthe level of income being predetermined by the saving-investment relation. But the\nassumption of complete inelasticity of aggregate demand with respect to 5 is certainly\nnot necessary, nor indeed is it likely to hold in reality. Quite apart from the effect of\nchanges in $ on investment we should expect consumption-saving decisions to be\nsomewhat affected by the level of real wages. In fact the original Keynesian formula-\ntion, in which the equalisation of saving and investment determines income in terms\nof wage units, amounts to the assumption that Y? is a rectangular hyperbola, that\naggregate demand has an elasticity of unity with respect to f.\n\nExcept in the case where entrepreneurs keep enough reserve capacity in hand\nto render 7 zero, the equation for Y5 is dependent on Q as well as $, so that our aggregate\nsupply curve's position will alter if Q alters. Strictly speaking, Q cannot be constant\nso long as I is positive ; but Keynes supposes that it can be treated as constant in\nshort-period analysis.\n\nSuppose, however, that we wish to analyse the effects of capital accumulation\non f, Y and N. The investigation would be worth while only if it could be held that T,\nthe \"' investment period,\" is long enough for the economy to move towards stationary\nequilibrium within that period. Let us assume that this is so.\n\nThe curve Y5 will shift to the right by an amount 7 per unit of net investment,\nand will go on moving to the right until net investment becomes zero. It is perhaps\nless immediately obvious that changes in Q will also affect Y?. We have already\nmentioned the reason for this (Section 4 above) : it is due to the fact that the invest-\nment equation itself is not independent of the aggregate supply function. For, under\nthe assumption of linearity and neglecting the rate of interest, the original form of\nthe investment equation is, from (25) above :\nit by equation (29).

SUMMARY\n\nA survey of the literature reveals that there has been a great deal of confusion\nin the matter of external economies and the downward-sloping supply curve, and that\nnowhere have the conditions of the interrelationships been worked out in detail.\nThis paper has attempted to work out these interrelationships, and its main points\nmay be summarised as follows :-\n\n(i) When there is a circular interdependence among the supply curves of the\nfirms in an industry, it is impossible to obtain the industry supply curve by the process\nof simple summation. A unique industry supply curve may be obtained, however,\nby the solution of a set of simultaneous equations, either directly or by successive\napproximations.\n\n(2) When such circular interdependence exists, the industry supply curve may\nbe either more or less steep than the supply curve derived by blowing up the supply\ncurve of the typical firm\u2014depending upon whether there exist external diseconomies\nor external economies.\n\n) The necessary condition for the industry supply curve to be actually forward-\nfalling is that there be present external economies of such magnitude that any increase\nin industry output sets in motion forces which make all firms together wish to increase\ntheir output more than the original increase.\n\n(4) This forward-falling supply curve is not a true supply curve in the sense of\ntracing out the quantities that will be supplied with shifts in the price offered to the\nindustry ; itisrather the locus of price \u00e0nd quantity traced out by shifts in a sufficiently\nsteep demand curve. \u2014\n\n(5) The question of stability of equilibrium between demand and forward-falling\nsupply was investigated, leading to the familiar condition that the demand curve\nmust cut the supply curve from above. If, however, the demand curve cuts it too\nsteeply, the possibility exists that an unstable cobweb might be generated.\n\nNew York, N.Y. RosERT W. A\u00c1pAMs.\nMinneapolis, Minn. JouN T.

In one industry only (IX-9, Confec-\ntionery) there was a marked upward trend in the ratio, and in two industries\n(IX-6, Biscuits; XVIB, Electricity) there were abrupt rises in the ratio, presumably\nthe result of innovation (and in each of these cases the trend of output was again\nupward). In all cases the trend, where continuous, appears to be linear. However, to\nascertain the value of the trend parameter is an exercise of dubious usefulness until\nmore direct and detailed information is ascertained regarding the character and\ndevelopment of the industries concerned.\n\n5. The materials coefficients show several marked characteristics. They tend on\nthe whole to be approximately constant for short periods of a few years. For half\nthe industries examined, at least the major coefficient is approximately constant for\na long period, usually a decade or more. There is significantly little evidence of sub-\nstitution relations between inputs and still less of diminishing technical marginal\nrates of substitution. Moreover, where definite evidence of substitution was found\nthis appeared, with few exceptions, to be associated with a change in the nature of\nthe product, e.g. bakeries, biscuits, confectionery.?\n\n6. It does seem after all that production functions tend to be of a fairly simple\nform. The hypothesis of a constant employment coefficient is certainly incorrect for\nthe majority of industries examined (measuring labour in man-years), but this is\nbecause a portion of the labour force is fixed over significant ranges of output\u2014a\ncomplication of which account may readily be taken. Evidence of price substitution\nis surprisingly meagre and, at least in the short period, very many materials coefficients\ntend to be constant. However, this is certainly not universally true even if only\nbecause the output of the recorded '' industries \" is sometimes not homogeneous.

Thus, in the special case where the ith commodity is either a good consumed\nor a good transformed (but not both), the demand (or supply) function of the :;th\ncommodity will have precisely the same formal properties as the corresponding function\nin ordinary consumption theory. More generally, if the ith commodity is a good which\nis both consumed and transformed, then one has always to deal with a situation where\ntwo prices change simultaneously (since the ;th x and the sth z have the common price\n$i). Hence, the effect of a change in any p; upon the demand or supply of any x; or zi\nwill always be ambiguous ; firstly because income effects (which apply in producer-\nconsumer theory to the demand and supply of all commodities, whether they are\nconsumed or transformed) will be ambiguous in size and sign, secondly because even\nwhen 7 \u2014 j and the usual second order stability conditions are satisfied, the demand\nor supply of, say, x; (taken alone) may move in either direction.! However, the combined\ndemand for (supply of) xi and zi (viz., xi -- zi) will change in the opposite (identical)\ndirection to a comQensated change in their common rice, 5i.* The only ambiguity regard-\ning combined demand and supply is due to income effects. Graaff reaches a different\nconclusion (see his discussion at pp. 84 and 86) because he does not use all the second\norder stability conditions at his disposal? 1f the proper condition is applied, the\nsubstitution term in Graaff's equation (9) will, in fact, be found to be negative for\n$ - j.* Still arguing by analogy with ordinary consumption theory, therefore, it\nappears that 2\u00bb $roducer-consumer equilibrium analysis, substitution effects alone cannot\nossibly be a source of (Hicksian) instability.5 Indeed, this follows as a special instance\nof the following completely general proposition : \u00a3o every theorem in ordinary consum$-\ntion theory there corresponds a theorem in producer-consumer analysis. The previous\ndiscussion will suffice to indicate the lines along which a rigorous proof of this statement\nmight proceed ; the proof itself will be dispensed with here.

Market imperfections, non-rational elements\nin both producers' and consumers' choice, ignorance of the best techniques and\nunwillingness or inability to accept the consequences of a policy of decentralisation\nprobably represent the most important factors in the survival of the small unit.?\n\nCardiff.

We cannot attempt such\nan investigation here ; it would not be profitable to do so without looking also at the\nsupply side and the distribution of consumers' incomes, and this would take us much\ntoo far. The preceding analysis, combined with the extensive work on imperfect\ncompetition in the theory of the firm, may be helpful as a starting point.\n\n* * *\n\nWe have so far discussed cases in which the quality of a commodity was described\nby one variable, its unit price under some basic price system. This approach clearly\nhas severe limitations, most of which we have already indicated. A\u00c0 much greater\nflexibility can be attained by introducing more variables to specify a variety of an\nitem of consumption. If we are speaking of an overcoat we may, e.g., give quantitative\nexpressions for its size, weight, colour, warmth, etc. The consumer will then be sup-\nposed to have preferences for various combinations of these characteristics, rather\nthan for overcoats which are only described by their price. On the other hand, the\nprice of the coat will also depend on these characteristics, since they are produced by\ndifferent factor inputs (in the widest sense). Here we again meet a situation where\nthe supply side cannot be ignored ; in the single-variable case this was only possible\nbecause supply problems were implicitly assumed to be solved in the form of a price\nschedule which could only shift or tilt.\n\nAn adequate discussion of the multi-quality case will therefore have to await\nfurther reconnaissance, in the area between consumption theory and the theory of the\nfirm. Some of the methods used in the present paper can easily be extended to these\nproblems.\n\nFinally, we should remark that the multi-variable specification as just outlined\nrepresents a fundamental change in the approach to consumption theory, since attention\nis paid to the reasons why consumers want certain goods. This may also prove interest-\ning for studies of the demand for newly invented goods.

But, in practice, security values appear\nto approximate the discounted value of their future yields ; and, again in practice,\nthe demand for money seems to move in rough proportion to aggregate expenditure.\nHence, while the Duesenberry argument on this point is logically weak and is lacking\nin generality, assumption (e), taken as a premise rather than as a theorem, seems\nplausible enough.\n\nFinally, the empirical validity of assumption (f)\u2014that elasticities of supply are\nall infinite\u2014is open to suspicion. But this assumption seems to be approximately\nsatisfied in practice over the long run. When historical periods are being considered,\ntherefore, the Duesenberry theorem should not be greatly affected even if this assump-\ntion is not strictly valid. The same observation does not apply so clearly, however,\nto the micro-economic theorem presented in this paper.\n\nTaking all of the above assumptions together, everyday empirical knowledge\n\nforces one, at the very least, to assume an ambivalent attitude toward the micro-\neconomic theorem presented above. The Duesenberry constant-savings-ratio theorem,\nhowever, seems to have a fairly sound empirical basis; and while the Duesenberry\nresult obviously provides no more than a partial explanation of the empirical mystery\nfrom which it stems, the explanation is elegant and powerful as far as it goes.\n5. This brings us to the end of our argument. As we have seen, on the elementary\nlevel at which the preceding argument has been conducted, interdependent preference\nanalysis differs but little from ordinary consumption theory ; hence, while one some-\ntimes gets different and slightly more general results in \"' interdependent \" as com-\npared with '\" independent \" preference analysis, it is only in this very limited and\npractically unimportant sense that the two kinds of theory may be said to be at\nvariance with one another. One gets the impression, therefore, that the interdependence\npostulate is comparatively innocuous as concerns established doctrines; but this\nremark may require considerable qualification in the light of subsequent, and perhaps\nmore sophisticated, inquiries.\n\nOf course, the general interdependence postulate is so general as to be completely\nuseless ; but as Professor Duesenberry has tried to show\u2014and our discussion seems to\nsupport his findings om the whole\u2014by making special assumptions the concept of\ninterdependent preferences can be made into a useful tool for dealing with a variety\nof practical problems. The empirical validity of some of these assumptions is open to\nquestion, since, in the nature of the case, they are partly arbitrary. But this is a\ndifficulty that is present in almost all special economic studies ; it does not really\ndetract from their interest or explanatory usefulness.\n\nSo far as the present investigation is concerned, then, the interdependence postu-\nlate seems to satisfy the pragmatic criteria set forth earlier (p. 166). And while\nsome of the implications of the postulate will require further study before being fully\nadmitted into the society of respectable doctrines, there seems to be no reason why\nthe basic Duesenberry ideas should not be accepted as an integral part of the pure\ntheory of consumer behaviour.\n\nOxford.

Hence there will be no substitution effect but only an income effect. As\nis well known, nothing can be predicted from income effects alone (except, of course,\nthat less of something will be consumed).\n\n(3) Thus even if the rise in prices were to lead to a fall in the demand for goods,!\nwe could still not say that it would lead to an increased demand for bonds and money\ntaken together.

This ensures either substitution of money for goods or money for\nbonds, and hence the familiar conclusions that an equi-proportionate rise in all goods\nprices (nominal cash balances remaining constant) will tend to raise the rate of interest,\nOf course, if expectations are introduced this result may be modified.\n\nBirmingham.

If wages and the quantity\nof money are rigid, or saving and investment are insufficiently interest-elastic, then\nliquidity preference will be a determinant of the rate of interest ; if wages are flexible\nand saving and investment sufficiently interest-elastic, then liquidity preference will\nbe a determinant of the price level, and will not affect the rate of interest.\n\nWhich assumption is more realistic will depend on the stage of development of\nthe economy under consideration, and the length of the period of analysis.

Then, arguing along familiar Keynesian lines, the outcome will\nbe a fall in income and a consequent reduction of the rate of interest. As this lower\nrealised rate of interest repeats itself over a period of time, it will come to dominate\nthe average of past rates on the basis of which expectations of future rates are formed,\nand so in the long run the expected future rate will fall, bringing down with it the\nKeynesian liquidity preference curve. Productivity and thrift would thus, over a\nlong enough run, determine the expected future rate even if their future movements\ncould not be predicted at all. This result would only fail to follow if security-owners\nwere so firmly attached to their expectation of the future rate of interest that they\nabsolutely refused to lend at a rate lower than the expected rate, and rushed to lend\nat any higher rate. This would be an extremely difficult assumption to justify, and\nwould make interest theory completely uninteresting. ]\n\nIn consequence of these considerations, Professor Robertson seems justified in. his\nconclusion that liquidity preference, as Keynes formulated it, is unlikely to exercise\nany important influence over the long-run trend of the rate of interest. If, however,\nas he suggests, the liquidity preference concept is broadened to include the demand\nfor money to hold for precautionary motives, then liquidity preference does become a\nlong-period phenomenon.\n\nThe question which then arises is whether liquidity preference in this extended\nsense will be interest-elastic in the long run (Professor Robertson agrees that it will\nbe interest-elastic in the short run). In dealing with this question, Professor Robertson\nprefers to argue in terms of the relation between the rate of interest and K, the propor-\ntion of their resources over which people wish to keep command in monetary form,\nrather than in terms of the relation between the rate of interest and the absolute\namount of purchasing power people desire to hold as an asset. Since wealth will be\ngrowing over the course of time, the former is a more convenient form in which to\ncarry on the discussion.!\n\nProfessor Robertson's argument on this score is extremely difficult to grasp, but\nit seems to run as follows: the wealth owner, in deciding what proportion of his\nresources to hold in the form of money, equates the marginal '' convenience and\nsecurity \" yield obtained by holding cash with the marginal satisfaction derived from\nthe rate of interest earned on investment. As capital.accumulates and the yield on\ninvested capital declines, the marginal '' convenience and security \"' yield from holding\nmoney is equated with the (lower) marginal satisfaction gained from the lower rate\nof interest. Therefore, Professor Robertson concludes, in the long run the proportion\nof resources held in the form of cash will be influenced little, if at all, by the rate of\ninterest.\n\nIf this is Professor Robertson's argument, then he has failed to prove his point,\nfor the conclusion does not follow from the argument. Indeed, what he seems to have\ndone in this argument is to confuse two propositions. The first is that the marginal\nconvenience yield from holding money will be equated with the marginal satisfaction\nderived from the interest earned on investments ; as the rate of return on investment\nfalls, the marginal convenience and security yield of money holdings will also fall,\nthrough the adjustment of cash holdings to equalise the two marginal rates of return.\nThis proposition is quite valid. The second proposition is that as the rate of return on\ninvestment falls, the marginal convenience and security yield from a g\u00e9ven money\nholding will also fall, so that the equalisation of marginal returns from investment and\ncash holding will require little or no increase in the cash holding. This proposition,\n\n1 Professor Robertson's definition of K as a fraction of resources is rather unusual, since K in the\nCambridge equation is defined as a fraction of income. Perhaps Professor Robertson wrote '' resources \"'\nwhere he meant to write '' real income \"; in any event, the ensuing discussion can be applied to whichever\ndefinition is intended.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:46:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In short, the appropriate monetary policy in face of rising\ninterest rates depends not only on the cause of the rise, but also on the results the\nmonetary authorities desire to achieve.\n\nThese considerations raise the question as to how far Professor Robertson is\njustified in his claim that Keynes fell into the trap of confusing the two causes of\nrising interest rates in his comments on the boom of 1936-7. Keynes does qualify\nhis recommendation to increase the public's supply of idle balances by the phrase\n\" unless we deliberately desire to raise the rate of interest,\" which allows for the possi-\nbility that the monetary authorities might wish to do so; it is also possible that he\nfelt that the boom of 1936-7 had not gone far enough to justify the monetary authorities\nin allowing rising interest rates (whatever the reason for which they rose) to exercise a\nrestricting influence. Further, since Keynes does not specify what ' change in the\natmosphere or the circumstances \" would permit the extra idle balances to be subse-\nquently withdrawn, there is some room for difference of opinion over what he had in\nmind.\n\nWhat Keynes meant is, therefore, not absolutely clear. It may be that, as Pro-\nfessor Robertson claims, he did fall into the trap of confusing the two reasons for\nwhich interest rates may rise, and advocating an increase in the quantity of money\nwhenever the rate of interest tends to rise, and a decrease whenever it tends to fall.\nEven so, this would not be equivalent to advocating the creation of money in the\nboom and its destruction in the slump, unless it is assumed that the rate of interest\nrises only in response to expanding trade and falls omjy in response to contracting\ntrade. If, in any slump, the rate of interest were to rise as a result of Professor\nRobertson's ''fear\" cause, the Robertsonian interpretation of Keynes' meaning\nwould lead, not to the destruction, but to the creation of money in that slump.\n\nXIII LIQUIDITY PREFERENCE IN THE LONG RUN!\n\nProfessor Robertson is correct in his contention that Keynes, in basing the demand\nfor idle balances almost exclusively on the speculative motive, unduly restricted the\nliquidity preference theory to short-period phenomena. If the demand for idle balances\ndepends entirely on the prospect of a rise in the interest rate, then the liquidity prefer-\nence curve will depend on the rate of interest expected in the future; in other words,\nit will describe the liquidity demand for money, not as a function of the ruling rate of\ninterest, but as a function of the difference between the ruling rate and the rate expected\nin the future. The expected rate of interest is itself left undetermined.\n\nProfessor Robertson contends that the rate of interest expected in the future\ndepends ultimately on the forces of productivity and thrift. This is obviously true if\nthe owners of securities can estimate fairly accurately the future course of the rela-\ntionship between these forces. But it will also be true (in the long run) if the owners\nof securities can form no judgment at all about the future course of the willingness to\nsave and the opportunities for investment, and rely instead on the expectation that\ninterest rates in future will be some average of the rates ruling over some finite past\nperiod. For suppose that expectations are formed in this way and that, starting from\na position of equilibrium in which the relation between the marginal efficiency of\ncapital, the propensity to save, liquidity preference and the quantity of money is such\nthat the rate of interest expected on the basis of past experience is actually being\nrealised, there is a fall in the marginal efficiency of capital schedule or a rise in the\n\n1 Robertson, op. cit., pp. 25-7.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:46:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

INCREASED VELOCITY AND THE RATE OF INTEREST IN A CUMU-\nLATIVE PROCESS!\n\nAs with an increase in the quantity of money, the effect on the rate of interest\nof an increase in the velocity of circulation depends on the subsidiary assumptions\nmade. A decrease in the desire to hold idle balances must, if nothing else is assumed\nto change, have the effect of lowering the rate of interest to the point at which the\nincreased transactions balances required to circulate the increased income generated\nby the increased investment produced by the lower rate of interest, plus the increased\nliquid balances held as a result of the lower interest rate, together become equal to the\n(unchanged) stock of money. Only if there is full employment before the change\noccurs will the rate of interest ultimately be the same as it was before. If, on the\nother hand, it is assumed that the reduced desire to hold idle balances is accompanied\nby an increased desire to invest (or consume), which is what is involved when an\nentrepreneur \"' activises \"\" an idle balance by purchasing commodities or hiring labour,\nthen the increase in velocity will raise the rate of interest by raising income and draining\nmoney out of idle balances into transactions balances. But the rise in the rate of\ninterest must be attributed to the decision to increase investment, not to the decision\nto hold a smaller idle balance.\n\nPut another way, a decision to reduce idle balances may be eher a decision to\nhold another kind of asset instead (i.e. to hold securities) or a decision to reduce one's\nassets in order to increase current expenditure. In the former case the rate of interest\nis lowered, in the latter case it is raised. In both cases the conclusion will only follow\nif the decision is taken as the result of a lasting change in attitude.\n\nIt is true, as Professor Robertson points out, that the Keynesian theory does\nthrow the emphasis on substitution between money and securities. But this does not\nprevent analysis in Keynesian terms of decisions to reduce idle balances in order to\npurchase goods : the decision needs merely to be separated into its two parts, and the\nsame conclusion about the effect on the rate of interest will follow.\n\nXIIL KEYNES ON THE BOOM OF r936-7?\n\nIt is certainly true, as Professor Robertson maintains, that the rate of interest\nmay rise et/her as a result of an increase in business confidence, leading to an increased\ndesire to invest, or as a result of a decrease in investors' confidence, leading to an\nincreased desire to hold money. This conclusion, however, also follows from the\nKeynesian theory: ceteris paribus, either a rise in the marginal efficiency of capital or\nan increase in liquidity preference will bring about a rise in the rate of interest, though\nin the former case there will be a rise in income and employment, in the latter case a fall.\n\nA rise in the rate of interest may, therefore, mean two things, according to the\ncausal forces at work. Which of the two causes is operating is obviously an important\nquestion in deciding on the appropriate monetary policy to pursue, and it would be\nfatally confusing to assume that a rise in the rate of interest is always the result of\nthe same cause.\n\nHowever, an equally important question in choosing the appropriate monetary\npolicy is the result which it is desired t\u00f3 produce. If, for example, the rate of interest\nis tending to rise as a result of increasing confidence, the monetary authorities might\nwish to prevent this rise in order to permit activity to increase still more; they might\nfear that rising rates of interest would choke off the rise of income before it had reached\na satisfactory level.

The\nincreased volume of output and possibly higher level of prices consequent on the\nincreased rate of investment willlead to the absorption of some of the increased\nquantity of money into transactions balances, so that the rate of interest will subse-\nquently rise above its initial (reduced) level. But it will not rise to its previous level,\nbecause at that level the volume of output and level of prices would be what they were\nbefore the quantity of money was increased ; the community would only desire to\nhold the amount of money existing before the increase was made ; and so the supply\nof money would exceed the demand for it at that rate of interest. Put another way,\nunless there is full employment the increased quantity of money will not be entirely\nabsorbed by the bidding up of prices, but must be absorbed in part by a rise in the\nlevel of output ; but a rise in output will only occur if the rate of investment is higher,\nand, given an unchanged willingness to invest, this requires that in equilibrium the\nrate of interest be lower than before. This is approximately the argument of Mrs.\nRobinson, to which Professor Robertson refers, and it is perfectly valid on the assump-\ntion that the willingness to invest (marginal efficiency of capital) remains constant.\n\nIf, on the other hand, it is assumed that the willingness to invest rises as a result\nof the increase in the quantity of money, for example, as a result of more optimistic\nexpectations generated by the rise in prices or output, then there is no reason why the\nrate of interest should come to a halt at or below its previous level. Furthermore, if\nthe willingness to invest rises cumulatively, the rate of interest will rise cumulatively.\nHowever, a cumulative rise in the willingness to invest is not an automatic accom-\npaniment of the increase in the quantity of money ; it must result from some sort of\nadditional assumption being introduced into the analysis. If the same assumption is\nintroduced into both theories, the Keynesian and loanable funds theories will yield\nthe same conclusions.\n\nIn short, the difference between the conclusions reached by Professor Robertson\nand Mrs. Robinson respectively results from a difference between the assumptions they\nmake. Mrs. Robinson assumes that the increase in the quantity of money has no\ninfluence, direct or indirect, on the marginal efficiency of capital: Professor Robertson\nassumes that the increase in the quantity of money indirectly produces a cumulative\nrise in the willingness of traders to borrow from the banks.\n\njust how this occurs is not made explicit in the argument under consideration,\nsince Professor Robertson does not offer his own explanation, but instead quotes two\nand a half sentences from Marshall. The Marshallian fragment, however, is not an\nexplanation but a declaration, since it merely states that the rise in the rate of interest\nis cumulative, without offering any reasons. Professor Robertson would have been\nbetter advised to advance his own explanation, or at least to have presented a more\nsatisfactory quotation from Marshall.\n\nX. KEYNES ON FISHER!\n\nIt seems fairly evident that, as Professor Robertson maintains, Keynes misunder-\nstood the mechanics of Fisher's argument ; this is the more surprising as Fisher's\ntheory is closely analogous to Wicksell's, and Keynes in the Treatise drew rather\nheavily on Wicksell's work. But it is difficult to see what sort of inhibition in Keynes'\nthought is implied by this misunderstanding.\n\n!

For the analysis of the problem under discussion, the\nRobertsonian concept is more clear-cut, since abstention from consuinption which is\nperformed in order to increase one's holding of cash implicitly includes an increase in\nliquidity-preference, which tends to complicate the analysis. The assertion criticised\nby Professor Robertson, that increased saving only reduces the rate of interest and\nstimulates investment \u00a3hrough reducing aggregate income, implicitly assumes that the\nincreased saving is being performed in order to build up cash balances\u2014i.e. it relies\non a hidden increase in liquidity preference. For the case in which an increase in saving\nis an increase in the demand for securities, it can easily be shown (e.g. by use of the\nfamiliar Hicksian 1S-LM diagram) that the reduction in income and employment\nwhich follows an increase in the propensity to save results, not from the increase in\nthe propensity to save as such, but from the fact of liquidity-preference, which partially\nprevents the increased desire to save from leading to increased investment.\n\nThe version of the sequence of events presented by Professor Robertson, however,\nis only one of a large number of possible dynamic sequences ; it assumes a one-period\nlag between the receipt and disposition of income, but no lags between reduced con-\nsumption and increased purchases of securities, between increased purchases of\nsecurities and increased issues by borrowers, and between increased issues and increased\nreal investment. It would seem to be more realistic to assume lags of some length in\nthe last three stages, in which case it would be true to say that the ultimate reduction\nof the rate of interest and stimulation of investment comes about /rough a. (transi-\ntional) reduction in income and employment. In any event, Professor Robertson's\ncriticism does not invalidate the main Keynesian point (with which he agrees) that,\ngiven liquidity preference, an increase in saving will reduce income and employment.\n\nIX. THE QUANTITY OF MONEY AND THE RATE OF INTEREST IN A\nCUMULATIVE PROCESS. (THE GIBSON PARADOX)!\n\nAny theoretical explanation of the fact that rising activity and rising interest\nrates generally go together must postulate that the incentive to invest is rising over\ntime. This assumption may be expressed in various ways, e.g. that the demand for.\nloanable funds is increasing, that the '' real\" or '' natural\"' rate of interest is rising\nso as to remain consistently above the '' money \"' rate of interest, or that the marginal\nefficiency of capitalis rising. If this assumption is not made, then an increase in the\nquantity of money cannot lead to a rise in the rate of interest above its previous level.\nThe most that can happen is that the rate of interest returns to its previous level, the\nsequence of events being as follows: the initial increase in the quantity of money\nleads to an initial reduction in the rate of interest ; this in turn stimulates investment\n(and possibly reduces the willingness to save); the resulting increase in effective\ndemand leads to a bidding up of prices, so that the increased quantity of money is\nabsorbed into transactions balances; and this goes on until the rate of interest rises\nto its previous level, at which point the stimulus to activity which resulted from the\nincrease in the quantity of money disappears. This sequence, however, will only occur\nunder conditions of '' full employment,\" defined as a condition in which any increase\nin effective demand leads to a cumulative rise in the prices of goods and factors of\nproduction. Under conditions of other than '' full employment \"' in this sense, on the\nother hand, the increased investment stimulated by the initial reduction of the rate\n\n!

                    "SOME CAMBRIDGE CONTROVERSIES IN MONETARY THEORY 97\n\nWhat Keynes actually argued was that, since individual saving from a given\nincome might rise or fall with the rate of interest, on balance aggregate saving from a\ngiven income is unlikely to be affected by the rate of interest. This implies that in\nequilibrium the rate of interest does influence individual saving as well as individual\nwillingness to hold idle balances; so that implicit in the Keynesian theory is the\nthree-fold marginal equivalence to which Professor Robertson refers. But since\nchanges in the rate of interest are assumed not to affect total saving from a given\ntotal income, this dependence of the rate of saving on the rate of interest is of purely\nformal significance, and does not affect the determination of the equilibrium income\nand rate of interest. If, in place of Keynes' argument, one were to argue that savers\nsave from habit or other non-interest-calculating motives (e.g. the Duesenberry theory)\nthen there would be no three-fold marginal equivalence of the rate of interest, the\nmarginal utility of not-consuming, and the marginal convenience of holding money ;\nthere would only be an equivalence of the marginal convenience of holding cash with\nthe rate of interest.\n\nHowever, the important issue between the Robertsonian and Keynesian theories\nis not over the question as to whether the rate of interest influences the level of saving ;\nsuch a relationship is explicitly introduced in most post-Keynes models of the General\nTheory. The fundamental issue is whether saving is sufficiently positively interest-\nelastic for saving from a full-employment income to be equal to investment at some\npositive rate of interest ; this question is discussed more fully in the last section of\nthese notes.\n\nVIII. INCREASED THRIFT AND THE RATE OF INTEREST!\n\nWhether Professor Robertson is right or wrong in his contention that Keynes\nbelieved that an increase in thrift would lower the rate of interest and promote an\nincrease in investment only under full employment conditions is a matter of opinion\non which it is hard to find convincing evidence one way or another. Keynes certainly\nmade statements in the General Theory which implied this view, but the formal logic\nof his theory shows that, whatever the state of employment, an increase in thrift will\ntend to reduce the rate of interest and so promote an increase in investment.\n\nThe steps of the analysis are as follows : a rise in the propensity to save means that\nin equilibrium income will be lower for any given volume of investment ; consequently\nmoney will be released from transactions balances to idle balances, and this will lower\nthe rate of interest (assuming that liquidity-preference is not infinitely interest-elastic) :\nthe fall in the rate of interest in turn will lead to an increase in the rate of investment\n(assuming that the marginal efficiency of capital is not completely interest-inelastic).\nThis particular controversy is therefore a dead issue.\n\nProfessor Robertson, however, disagrees with the Keynesians over the causal\nsequence by which the act of thrift lowers the rate of interest. Specifically, he claims\nthat it is misleading to say that an increase in thrift lowers the rate of interest t/yrough\nlowering total incomes ; rather, he argues, the increase in thrift lowers the rate of\ninterest directly, through swelling the demand for securities, thus raising their prices\nand.lowering the rate of interest: the fall in the rate of interest induces people to hold\nlarger idle balances, so that the money put onto the securities market by the increase\nin thrift does not all find its way out again in the form of increased investment ; invest-\nment is less than saving and income falls as a result.\n\nProfessor Robertson's criticism of ' the Keynesian version \"' is logically perfectly\nsound, once it is realised that his concept of \" thrift \" (which is nowhere explicitly\n\n!

The notion that they are would seem to spring from the\ndynamic nature of Professor Robertson's approach, which apparently leads him to\ninterpret '' zero idle money \" to mean that idle money can never exist, even moment-\narily. On that interpretation the two assumptions would be inconsistent; but it\nseems obvious from the static nature of the Keynesian theory that Keynes was thinking\nonly of the equilibrium positions before and after the increase in the quantity of\nmoney, and on this interpretation no inconsistency arises.\n\nProfessor Robertson's arguments on this score also reveal a difference of assump-\ntion between Keynes and Robertson as to how new money comes into existence.\nKeynes assumes that new money is created by the purchase of securities by banks\n(particularly the central bank), which means that the banks are giving the public\ndeposits in exchange for some of its holdings of existing securities. As a result, the\npublic is left with an increased stock of money and a decreased stock of securities ;\nnew money is therefore in its origins an addition to the stock of money held as an\nasset, ie. a contribution to idle balances. Professor Robertson, on the other hand,\nassumes that new money is commonly created through increased lending by banks to\nbusinesses to meet increased working capital requirements ; new money therefore\noriginates as an increase in active balances, in response to an increased demand for\ncapital.\n\nF The difference is an important one (see section IX below, on '' The Gibson Para-\ndox \"). It is partly explained by the fact that Keynes is thinking in terms of monetary\npolicy, operating in a framework in which it is assumed that the willingness to consume\nand to invest is given ; Professor Robertson is thinking of normal commercial banking\noperations, responding to an increased demand for capital. On a more general level,\nthe Keynesian theory assumes that bank-financed investment is not an independent\nsource of economic change, whereas the Robertsonian version assumes that it may be.\nPart of this difference of opinion is doubtless a difference in the situations which the\nrespective authors have in mind, Keynes thinking almost exclusively of the 1930s\nand Professor Robertson thinking more of the history of industrial fluctuations; part\nof it is a difference of opinion over the importance of bank-financed investment as an\nindependent variable. The latter difference is a question of fact, to which the answer\nmay be different for difference historical periods.\n\nVIL. THE THREE-FOLD MARGIN!\n\nProfessor Robertson is quite right in arguing that the proposition that the rate\nof interest governs the desire to hold idle money is not inconsistent with the\nproposition that the rate of interest may also govern saving.\n\nIf saving does depend in some way on the rate of interest as well as on the level\nof income, however, this dependence can very easily be introduced into the Keynesian\ntheory. It merely means that instead of one propensity to consume (or to save) there\nwill be one for each rate of interest: and the relation between saving and interest\nwill have an influence on the determination of the equilibrium levels of income and the\nrate of interest. When income is in equilibrium, the rate of interest will not only\nequate the demand for money at that level of income with the existing stock of money,\nbut will also equate the rate of investment with the saving that the community is\nwilling to do from that income at that rate of interest. Nor does it matter, within the\nlimits stated by Professor Robertson, whether saving is assumed to rise or fall as the\nrate of interest rises.\n\n1 Robertson, op. cit., pp. 16-8.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:46:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "SOME CAMBRIDGE CONTROVERSIES IN MONETARY THEORY 95\n\nand prices are usually, in fact, associated with rising rates of interest,\" is also irrelevant.\nKeynes is describing a logical system in which it is assumed that the propensity to\nconsume and the marginal efficiency of capital are given: on the first assumption,\nincome will only be higher if the level of investment is higher ; on the second assump-\ntion, investment will only be higher if the rate of interest is lower. Consequently a\nhigher level of income is necessarily associated with a lower rate of interest. Professor\nRobertson is referring to a historical situation in which the quantity of money is\nrigid or sticky and income is rising as a result of a rise in the marginal efficiency of\ncapital or the propensity to consume. On these assumptions, the Keynesian theory\nwould also show rising output and prices associated with rising rates of interest. The\ndifference of assumptions is the key to the solution of this particular disagreement ;\nthe same difference of assumptions reappears in the controversy over the relation\nbetween the quantity of money and the rate of interest (fra, section IX).\n\nV. THE CONFUSED STATEMENT FROM THE GENERAL THEORY, p. 165!\n\nProfessor Robertson is entirely justified in denouncing Keynes' statement that\n* the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital may be said to govern the terms\non which loanable funds are demanded for the purpose of new investment; whilst\nthe rate of interest governs the terms on which funds are being currently supplied.\"'\n\nThe sentence seems to assume that the rate of interest is fixed by the quantity\nof money in conjunction with liquidity preference, independently of the level of invest-\nment ; in fact, the rate of interest in the Keynesian theory depends on the quantity\nof money in conjunction with boh liquidity preference and the level of income, and\nthe latter in turn depends on the level of investment as determined by the marginal\nefficiency of capital and the rate of interest. It is, therefore, not possible to analyse\nthe determination of investment in the Keynesian theory in the way implied by the\nsentence, since the rate of interest is not determined independently of the level of\ninvestment. Most of Keynes' chapter 14 is rather confusing for this sort of reason ;\nthe subject is more easily understood with the help of the Hicksian IS-LM diagram.\n\nVI. THE ALLEGED INCONSISTENCY IN THE SCHEME OF THE GENERAL\nTHEORY?\n\nThe inconsistency in the scheme of the General Theory consists, according to\nProfessor Robertson, in the fact that in the theory the banks can only operate by\nincreasing \"idle money \" ; but that on certain pages Keynes assumes that, even if\n* jdle money \"' is zero, total money can be increased and the rate of interest pushed\ndown. This alleged inconsistency turns out on inspection to be groundless. If the\ndemand for idle money is nil, then one of the characteristics of all positions of ultimate\nequilibrium is that the stock of idle money will be nil; but, even if the banks are\nrestricted to creating idle money (e.g. by purchasing securities), this does not mean\nthat they are powerless to increase the quantity of money, as Professor Robertson's\nargument would imply. The effect of such purchases of securities would be initially\nto create idle money, whose holders would immediately seek to reinvest in securities ;\nthe result would be to drive up the prices of securities, and drive down the rate of\ninterest to the point at which the increased investment induced by the lower interest\nrate raised the level of income sufficiently to absorb the unwanted idle money into\nactive balances. In the new position of equilibrium, idle money would again be zero ;\nbut the rate of interest would be lower and the level of income would be higher. The\n\n1 Robertson, op. cit., p. 11.\n?

Now I realise that one man's gnat is another man's camel, and that Mr.\nPearce's standards of literary rigour may very properly be higher than my own.\nTherefore, in the second paragraph of Mr. Pearce's paper, where he is setting up what\nhe regards as a fallacious literary argument, we should perhaps add the word '' always \"'\nbetween '' those goods \" and \" which.\" \"With this addition, the argument seems to me\nto be acceptable for the printed page\u2014or for the classroom, where the whole discussion\noriginally started.\n\nCambridge, Massachusetts.

When (1) was reprinted in\nReadings in Theovy of International Trade (1948), Stolper and I omitted the second complete sentence of\np. 59 because we discovered that we had stubbed our toes in the manner attributed to Ellsworth in (2).\nThe surrounding sentences we recognised to be inexact but we let them stand because they correctly portray\nthe Ohlin-Heckscher view. The bracketed sentence added by me on p. 355 of the 1948 reprinting is too\nsweeping and unqualified. In (2) the third complete sentence on p. 170 is too sweeping and particularly\nneeds qualifying in the many-factor case. In (2) the footnote on p. 175 is properly qualified by the footnote\non p. 188 of (3) ; and theliterary argument on p. 175 of (2) is made perfectly clear by the figures on p. 188\nof (3). In (3), p. 193, the statement that almost equal factor intensities makes for uniform cost ratios and\nreduces the need for trade is correct; but the possible implication, that this fails to impair the Ohlin-\nHeckscher point that goods mobility is an effective compensation for factor mobility, is false. To ensure\nthat the equations on p. 188 of (3) have a single solution, the second footnote should have added to it the\nhypothesis that a diagonal element of A is one signed ; see Meade, op. cit., p. 133, fn. r, for my restatement\nto meet this point. The possibility of increasing marginal productivity mentioned on (3)'s p. 196 and\nfootnote can be ruled out if we are willing to make the '' additivity assumption \" of linear programming.\nThe important empirical issue of identical production functions seems in no need of expansion; the\nempirically less important, but logically interesting, case of changing factor intensities seems worthy of\nstress to theorists.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:47:50 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The distinction between a producer selling a single product at\ndifferent prices and one selling different products in varying markets at differing\npercentages of profit is a distinction of degree only. What a firm has to sell is not a\nproduct, but rather its capacity to produce. In so far as firms are motivated by the\nmarginal principle, there is a tendency to push production towards the point where\nmarginal cost is equal to demand price for the least profitable unit produced. In this\nmanner \"' capacity \" operation is achieved. The limits to the process are institutional\nrather than theoretical. Under conditions of monopolistic competition this probably\nresults in a situation where only normal profits are obtained. Whatever the amount\nof profit, it is obtained only by constant manipulation of the price and product line.\nThe theory of price discrimination must be viewed as the heart of price-cost theory\nrather than a peripheral case.

The\ntransactions function, equation (e), says that the portion of the money supply devoted\nto transactions is determined by the level of income. An increase in spending, or\nincome flow, is a manifestation of an increase in activity and, hence, involves an\nexpansion in the community's requirements of money for transactions. The linearity\nof this function and its zero intercept mean that the velocity of active balances is\nassumed to be invariant with respect to income. An increase in the slope of the function\nimplies an increase in this velocity of circulation. In addition, the shape of the trans-\nactions function is affected by the community's credit structure and system of pay-\nments.\n\nThe liquidity function, equation (f), shows that the rate of interest is determined\nby the schedule of liquidity preference and the quantity of money held as an asset.\nAt a low rate of interest, the liquidity function becomes perfectly elastic,! portraying\nthe tendency for the rate of interest to be rigid downward at low levels. The shape of\nthis function reflects the community's preferences with respect to the risk and incon-\nvenience which accompany illiquidity as compared with the cost of maintaining\nliquidity. Any change in the community's expectations as to the prices of assets other\nthan cash will also affect the shape of the function.\n\nIt is assumed throughout that the prices of commodities and services are constant,\nperfect competition reigns in all markets, the stock of capital is quite large relatively\nto its annual increment, and that the rate of technological change is zero. Then, given\nvalues for g and sm, the six equations determine the level of income and employment.\n\nII.\n\nSubstituting F(Y) for C in (a), we may write :\n\nMM Y-FY)-I-g;\nOr, Since g is a parameter,\n\nY \u2014 H (I)?\n\nEmploying this new relation between Y and J, we have a system of equations :\n\n(2) M,\u2014T (Y)\n\nG) Y-H )\n\n(3) I-E(R)\n\n( R-L (My\n\n.( M,\u2014m-\u2014M,\n\nwhich is more suitable for a diagrammatic solution of the model?

                    "\u00c0n Exposition of the Keynesian System\n\nI.\n\nThe rudiments of the Keynesian system as applied to a closed economy may be\npresented to beginning students by means of a simple, linear model consisting of six\nvariables, two parameters, and six equations. The variables are Y, C, 7, R, M, and M;.\nY is the aggregate flow in income during a specific period. C represents aggregate\nexpenditures by the private sector of the community on consumer goods and services.\nI represents net expenditures by the private sector of the community on investment\ngoods. R, the rate of interest, symbolises the structure of interest rates rather than\n\" the \" rate of interest.? M, stands for that portion of the money supply held for the\npurpose of satisfying the transactions and precautionary motives. M, represents\nmoney held as an asset\u2014that is, to satisfy the speculative motive.\n\nThe parameters of the model are \u00bb and g, representing the quantity of money and\ngovernment expenditures on goods and services, respectively. These parameters are,\nconsequently, exogenous to the private economy. Changes in the parameters indicate\nintervention by the government through monetary and fiscal policy.\n\nThe system of equations which connect and determine the six variables is :\n\n(a) Y-\u2014CcI-c-g\n\n(b m-\u2014M,r-M,\n\n(6) C-F(Y)\n\n()  I\u2014E(R)\n\n(6) M,\u2014T(Y)\nR \u2014 L(Mj).\n\nEquation (a) states that aggregate income is composed of consumption and invest-\nment expenditures on the part of the private economy plus total government expendi-\ntures on goods and services.? Equation (b) gives us the Keynesian classification of\nmoney balances.\n\nThe consumption function, equation (c), is a schedule of consumption expenditures\nat various levels of income, where O \u2014 dC/dY \u2014 r. The shape of the consumption\nfunction depends upon a host of other variables assumed to be constants in the model.\nThese constants include: the community's attitude toward thrift; expectations\nregarding prices, the supply of consumer goods, and the level and certainty of income;\nthe tax structure ; the social security system ; the distribution of income and wealth,\nand the form in which wealth is held ; population size and distribution ; the extent\nof foreign trade ; corporate dividend policy ; education; and advertising.\n\nEquation (d) is the investment demand function, or the schedule of the marginal\nefficiency of capital. This function shows the relation between R and 7. That is, given\nthe schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital, the rate of interest determines the\nrate of investment. Other variables, for our purposes assumed to remain constant,\nwhich determine the shape of this function include: entrepreneurial anticipations\nwith respect to market demand, the algebraic rate of change in the level of income,*\nthe community's stock of capital, the rate of innovation, the marginal physical pro-\nductivity of capital goods, and the tax structure.\n\n1'* Investment \"' in the sense of an addition to real capital should be distinguished from '' investment \"\nin popular usage which includes the purchase of securities and existing real assets.\n\n* It would perhaps be more realistic to treat R as an index of the availability of capital rather than as\na structure of posted interest rates.\n\n3 Since taxes have not been introduced explicitly, government expenditures are financed by borrowing\n\nor by printing paper money. Hence a change in g may effect a change in s.\n1 It follows that the acceleration principle appears only implicitly in the model.\n\n12\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:50:31 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

It follows that, with regard to their respective\nsystems of units, G and H have the same corresponding elasticities. Now the physical\nnumber pattern of G may be obtained from that of H merely by altering the system\nof units. But elasticities are invariant with respect to changes in the system of units.\nHence the basic properties of a system of production of this type, as described by its\nelasticities, are uniquely determined by the relative value pattern of all outputs. This\ntour de force permits Leontief to employ a system of units based on the quantity bought\nby one dollar at date zero.!\n\n9. In conclusion, it may be pointed out that Professor Leontief has hitherto been\nforced to aggregate '' industries \" into a very few groups indeed.? While this is no\ncriticism of the theoretical schema, it is to be expected that the values of the elasticities\nobtained were appreciably affected.?\n\nIn the articles published since the epoch-making '' Structure \", Professor Leontief\nhas manipulated his system in various ways\u2014including the separation of wage and\nprofit incomes. Two characteristics in particular have marked these later analyses :\nthe rejection of fixed consumption coefficients in favour of an assumed '' bill of goods \"' ;\nthe maintenance of the assumption of fixed technical coefficients.

A similar pattern, although at a generally higher\nlevel, prevailed with regard to strawberries (see Table IV). In both cases the price\nelasticity was apparently higher at the beginning of the season than at its end. While\naccording to Table I annual price elasticities exceeded seasonal ones, there are some\nweekly elasticities which exceed the seasonal and annual values.\n\nThe question arises how to explain this pattern of weekly price elasticities. A\ntentative and, at best, partial explanation may be offered. It appears that the pattern\nof price elasticity changes closely resembles that of seasonal price changes of many\nperishable fruits and vegetables. The latter can be explained in terms of changes in\nthe supply; availability of effective (technical as well as economic) substitutes ;\nseasonal demand, etc. One may consider supply variation as the most important\nsingle factor. Early in the season most products are offered in small amounts, which\nincrease as the season proceeds only to decrease at its end. The price pattern is inverse.\nThe seasons of most fresh fruits and vegetables begin a few weeks apart, each one\nhaving a similar supply and price pattern. Thus, when early in the season a product\nreaches the market in small quantities and its price is high, it faces numerous effective\nsubstitutes in the form of other fruits or vegetables whose season had started earlier\nand which now are in larger supply and sell for relatively low prices. A similar argu-\nment can be used with regard to the end of the season, the only difference being that\nthe competition comes from products whose season started later than that under\nconsideration. With regard to the price elasticity during the mid-season, one could\nargue that the product's relatively large supply and low price keeps the number of\neffective substitutes to a minimum.\n\nIn summary, most commodities for which empirical demand analyses could be\nprocured, are inelastic in demand. In many instances the high (or low) price elasticities\nappear to go hand in hand with the availability of good (or poor) substitutes. However,\nsubstitutability alone does not appear to offer a sufficient explanation. The price\nelasticity of demand of the same product is higher, the closer the selling stage to the\nultimate consumer. Storability appears to have little effect on price elasticity. The\nfew industrial goods for which demand analyses are available are all highly inelastic.\nOf the farm products, most staples have inelastic demands while many fresh perishable\nfruits have elastic ones. The relation between the price elasticity of a whole product\nor group of products and part thereof appears quite complicated and requires more\nevidence before conclusions can be reached. The weekly demand elasticity of perishable\nproducts in seasonal supply is relatively high at the start of the season, then declines\nas the season progresses, and finally increases during its later part.\n\nJerusalem.

Because of this high elasticity the rate charged by\nthe banks appears to set a maximum to contango rate.\n\nIt is also possible for bear carry-over to exceed bull carry-over since money may\nbe borrowed in return for payment of contango (or for receipt of backwardation), i.e.\nshares may be given on, not only by bulls, but also directly by others (mainly jobbers)\nwho are long of shares.? They will presumably be prepared to do this, not only if there\nis a backwardation, but also if contango rate is somewhat below the rate (per fort-\nnightly account period) on loans to the Stock Exchange. It follows that an excess of\nbear carry-over against bull carry-over does not necessarily involve a backwardation\nand thus that the existence of a contango does ^oi necessarily mean an excess of bull\ncarry-over. On the other hand, a backwardation does necessarily mean an excess of\nbear carry-over and probably also an excess of bears over al] bulls, since most bulls\nwill find it profitable to carry-over when there is a backwardation.\n\nBear carry-over can only exceed bull carry-over by a limited amount equal to\nthe maximum number of shares that those with shares will give on, while bull carry-\nover can exceed bear carry-over to a very great extent since money can be attracted\ninto the market from outside. Consequently, while there is the fairly low and definite\nupper limit to contango mentioned above, there is no such limit to backwardation\nwhich may rise to extreme heights if the bears cannot cover themselves easily by\nreversing their transactions. A high backwardation will be accompanied by a rise in\nshare prices at the end of the period, for the covering purchases by bears will send up\nprices which they had themselves depressed earlier by their sales.\n\nLondon.

Where demand becomes negative the curve repre-\nsenting this aggregate schedule wil be very much steeper than summation would\nindicate, since the carry-over of bear speculators can only exceed the carry-over of\nbull speculators by a limited amount (for reasons explained in Section III) and back-\nwardation, unlike contango, has no limit.\n\nThe aggregate speculative demand curve will be flatter the greater is the number\nof speculators, the flatter is each individual curve and the smaller is the dispersion\nof height between the individual curves. One factor which will make for flat individual\ncurves is a large capital (so that v increases relatively slowly with size of commitment).\nThis and the first condition mentioned above can be included together as a large\ntotal capital of all speculators together. Another factor which will make for flat\nindividual curves is a small dependence of P^; , upon P;, and a small and slowly\nincreasing 7 due to low uncertainty in those expectations. Finally, differing heights\nof individual curves may be caused by differences in price expectations. Thus, in\nsummary, we can say that the total speculative demand curve will be flatter and lie\nfurther to the right as :\n\n(r) The total capital of all speculators is greater.\n\n(2) The supply-demand curve of short-term loans to/from the Stock Exchange\nis lower and flatter and speculators consider the bond market less profitable.\n\n(3) Expectations are less affected by short-run movements in share prices.\n\n(4) Expectations are held with a higher degree of confidence.\n\n) The degree of unanimity among speculators is greater.\nIt is unlikely that the curve will remain unchanged from one period to the next,\nfor any of the following will alter it :\n\n(ri) A change in conditions in the money market.\n\n(2) A different price expected for the next period or an altered degree of\nuncertainty.\n\n(3) A different shareholding at the beginning of the current period.\n\nIII.\n\n\u00c0 buyer who, instead of paying and receiving delivery when the settlement\ncomes at the end of the fortnightly account period, makes arrangements to postpone\npayment and delivery until the following settlement is said to carry-over. If he wishes\nhe can carry-over again at the following settlements. In effect, these facilities enable\nhim to obtain shares without paying for them, thus borrowing money, for which he\npays contango rate. Similarly, a seller is said to carry-over if he makes arrangements\nto postpone making delivery of and receiving payment for the shares he has sold.\nThus in effect he is lending money, and for this he receives contango. \u00c0 negative\ncontango rate is called a backwardation.\n\nThe factors which determine the total holding of bulls have been listed in\nSection II. It is evident from what was said there that as contango rate falls (or\nbackwardation rises) ceteris $aribus the total carry-over of bulls will increase for two\nreasons. Firstly, their total holding will be stimulated, and secondly, the proportion\nof it which is carried-over will rise.\n\nBears, on the other hand, have to carry-over! the whole of their short position, so\nthat the elasticity of bear carry-over with respect to contango (backwardation) rate\nwill be entirely due to the effect of changes in that rate on their total position.\n\n1 Ignoring dealings for '' New Time.\"\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 19:02:15 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

This is only relevant if the\nspeculator can secure carry-over facilities.\nThis assumes that the bull has not already got the shares, for if he has then Stamp\nDuty will have been paid and so be irrelevant. Furthermore, it is extremely unlikely\nthat he would sell his shares, buy them back and carry over.\nIf we take the case of a bull, it is evident from what has been said that his desired\nholding will be greater :\n\n(7) The greater is P^; ., in relation to P;, i.e. the more he expects the price\nto rise ;\n(4?) The smaller is d, i.e. the cheaper he can borrow, lend or carry-over ;\n(41) The smaller is v, i.e. the larger is the speculator's wealth, the less vague\nare his anticipations and the less is his uncertainty-aversion ;\nand similarly for the bear.\n\nBy varying P; we can obtain the stock demand schedule of the individual specu-\nlator, given his 4 schedule and his P7, , ,. In doing this we must remember that\nchanges in P; will affect the value of 7 corresponding to any given shareholding (with\na given P^; | ,) in two ways. Firstly, such changes alter the value of that number of\nshares, and thus the size of commitment, and, secondly, if part of the speculator's\nassets was held in the form of shares to begin with, price changes will alter his wealth,\nwhich also will affect \u00bb.! This latter point means that the number of shares a bull\ndesires to hold at any given price depends partly on the number he already has and\nsimilarly for the bear, his short position being a liability. In spite of these two com-\nplications, however, the demand schedule is still determinate, given the composition\nof the speculator's initial asset holding as well as its total and the other factors men-\ntioned above. The schedule will have a discontinuity at a shareholding of zero, i.e.\nthere will be a range of prices at which the speculator will be neither bull nor bear.\n\nWe must now consider two complications concerning the anticipated price, P^; |. ,.\nThe first is the question of whether only the price expected for the period immediately\nfollowing is relevant. Suppose, for example, that price is expected to rise, but not\nuntil 2 4- 2. Since the speculator can make a gain whether he buys shares now (/) or\nin Z 4- rz, which of these two alternatives he chooses depends on the net advantages of\nholding the shares over the time up to the end of \u00a3 J- 1. So P^; , , alone is relevant\nto what he does in 4. This assumes that the speculator thinks he knows when price\nwillrise. If he does not he will act as 7f he expects it to rise next period.\n\nThe second complication is that anticipated future price may not be independent\nof current price, P;.? Here we may usefully distinguish two types of speculative\nexpectation. Firstly, that which is based on market movements and may change\nfrom period to period. In this case we may expect P^; .. , to move in the same direction\nas P;, and the speculator's demand curve will be steeper than if his expectations are\nof the second type: based more on external factors (such as dividend prospects), so\nthat movements in the current price have no effect on his P^;\n\nThe aggregative speculative demand schedule cannot be obtained by simple\nsummation of the individual schedules because ceteris paribus the holding of any\nindividual speculator will change if 7 changes, and whether this be contango rate or\nthe rate on short-term loans it is not independent of total speculative commitments.\nBut if the supply-demand schedule of short-term loans to/from speculators is given\nthere will be a determinate aggregate demand schedule for shares and a determinate\n\nl'This point is made in terms of the liquidity preference curve by Kragh in his ''Two Liquidity\n\nFunctions and the Rate of Interest : 4 Simple Model\" (REviEW or Ecowouirc Srupres, Vol. XVII, No. 2).\n\n?

The magnitude of \u00bb depends on two\nseparate factors: firstly, it will be greater the less confident is the speculator that\nP^;..4 is a good guess; secondly, given his uncertainty aversion, it will be greater the\nlarger is the value of his shareholding (in the case of a bull) or of his short position (in\nthe case of a bear) in relation to his total wealth. It follows that, ceteris paribus, in the\ncase of a bull, \u00bb will rise as he acquires more shares, while in the case of a bear (a\nspeculator who is short of shares) it will rise as he extends his position.\n\nIf the speculator is a bear, d is the contango rate he receives?

                    "Ihe Speculative Demand for Securities\nand Carty-Over\n\nI.\n\nNearly all writers on interest theory, whether they favour a stock approach or a\nflow approach, seem now to be agreed that the demand for securities of speculators\nmust be included in any analysis of the formation of interest rates. There is perhaps\na smaller degree of agreement as to whether analysis in terms of the demand and\nsupply of money is permissible. This latter problem boils down to the question of what\nassumptions are made. If bonds and money are the only assets held by wealth-owners\nand if the aggregate demand for both goods and factor services equals their aggregate\nsupply, then any excess demand for money must reflect an equal and opposite excess\nsupply of bonds. In such circumstances, we can say indifferently that the bond-rate\nof interest is determined by the demand and supply of money or by the demand\nand supply of bonds. An analysis restricted by such assumptions can, however, only\nbe a first approximation. Where we wish to consider, say, shares and short-loans as\nwell as bonds and money, discussion of the price-formation of any of the first three\nis best carried out in terms of the demand and supply of the asset in question.\n\nNo analysis of speculative demand can be satisfactory unless the existence of a\nmoney-market is assumed. Only if short-loans to the Stock Exchange exist can the\nactivities of bull speculators be adequately included, since if there is no short borrowing\na speculator's money balance can only be positive and never negative, thus making\nthe analysis asymmetrical. Granted this, the case is made for analysing the price of any\nsecurity in terms of its demand and supply.\n\nThis paper is concerned with only one type of demand, speculative demand.\nFirstly, an attempt is made to restate the main determinants of the position and shape\nof the stock speculative demand curve for shares which, as this is a second approxima-\ntion only, are assumed to be homogeneous. Secondly, having assumed carry-over\nfacilities to exist for share transactions, an analysis is given of the determination of\nthe contango (or backwardation) rate.!\n\nII.\n\nTo start with we must explain the meaning given in this paper to the term\nspeculator. As Dr. Wilson? has pointed out, Keynes' \" speculators who are trying to\nbeat the gun are a very different type from Mr. Kaldor's careful arithmeticians with\ntheir eyes fixed on the relationship between expected short-term rates and the yield\non high-grade bonds.\" Here we shall define a speculator as a person or institution\nwhose security transactions are made largely in order to secure short-run capital gains.\nThis is nearer to the Keynesian type than to Mr. Kaldor's.\n\nBy the stock demand curve or schedule of a speculator we mean the curve or\nschedule relating the number of shares he wishes to hold at the end of the current\n\n1! Much of the analysis is based on Mr. Kaldor's '' Speculation and Economic Stability \" (REvrgWw or\nEconouirc SrupiEs, October, 1939), though there is the important difference that his equations seem to\nrelate to the market as a whole, whereas my equations relate to an individual speculator and no unanimity\nis assumed.

It lies rather in the fact that the political unpalatability\nof significant decreases in government spending is matched only by that associated\nwith meaningful increases in tax rates. The crucial aspects do not rely upon the too\nexclusive use of one particular method, but upon the popularity of moderate inflation\nresulting in the failure to employ any effective alternative.\n\nMichigan. LAWRENCE S. RITTER.?\n\n! Nor is it suggested that sole reliance upon fiscal policy would be adequate to insure stability. Macro-\nanalysis tends to obliterate many significant interrelationships : in the words of Arthur F. Burns, '' the\nturbulent life that goes on within the aggregates \" is glossed over. Some form of aggregative approach is\nusually the fount out of which stability creating fiscal recommendation flow, and yet the hoped-for results\ncan hardly be more accurate than the theoretical analysis upon which they are based. For instance, the\ninternal structure of government expenditure and taxation\u2014their composition\u2014vwill be an important\nmatter. Various types of taxes will have varying effects upon consumption and investment decisions and\n\u00a3overnment expenditure will have effects in part dependent upon the specific channels into which it is\n\nirected.\n\nIn addition the existence of leads and lags within the structure of the price and quantity components\nof consumption and investment can hardly fail to affect the results. A static theory concentrating upon\neventual equilibrium positions is not adequate to deal with the process of change. In a very real sense,\ntherefore, the above is no more than a first approximation to policy, its main value resting in the broad\ntendencies and principles elucidated rather than in the quantitative refinements of detail. The fact that the\npurpose of this paper is quite restricted, with limitations of space prohibiting discussion of these factors,\nShould not be taken to imply unawareness of their presence. Considerations regarding forecasting difficulties,\ntiming, and flexibility reinforce the view that fiscal policy alone can hardly maintain stability, assuming\nsuch to be the goal. For an able presentation of these problems, cf. Albert G. Hart, '* Model Building and\nFiscal Policy,\" American Economic Review, Vol. XXXV, No. 4 (September, 1945), pp. 531-58.\n\nThe particular models above, finally, are not meant to represent the detailed complexity of the real\nworld. In addition to the assumptions of a linear net tax withdrawal function, constant investment, no net\ncorporate savings, a closed non-war economy and a stable consumption function (which depends only upon\ndisposable income), others do equal damage to reality. Thus it is implied that output is of unit elasticity\nwith respect to effective demand up to full employment, from which point the elasticity of the price level\nwith respect to effective demand becomes unity. The existence of bottleneck areas is likely to raise prices\nlong before '' full employment \"' is realised. On this cf. the still fresh discussion of L. M. Lachmann, '' Invest-\nment and Costs of Production,\" American Economic Review, Vol. XXVIII, No. 3 (September, 1938),\npp. 469-81.\n\n?

To demonstrate that interest was a reward for the act of saving, rather than an\nincome in the nature of a surplus, it was necessary, first, to discover some aspect of\nthe saving process which could plausibly be presented as involving a real cost or\nsacrifice on the part of the saver, and, second, to posit a direct functional relationship\nbetween the volume of saving and the rate of interest. It is sometimes assumed by\nhistorians that the idea of a functional connection between the supply of capital and\nits return (involving the recognition of a real cost lying behind accumulation) was a\nnecessary element in the Ricardian theory of equilibrium.! This does not appear to me\nto have been the case : the idea was not, in fact, developed until it was found desirable\nto stress the existence of such a cost.\n\nThe tendency to think of saving as a function of the rate of interest, then, may at\nleast in its origin have been associated with the desire to show, first, that the economic\nsystem was fundamentally stable, and, second, that it was not founded on the exploita-\ntion of the labourer. But one other factor of some importance intensified the tendency,\nand was largely responsible for the failure of orthodox economics to exorcise it before\n1936. Professor Myint has recently drawn attention to the significant difference\nbetween the economic problem with which the Classical economists were concerned,\nand that with which we are mainly concerned to-day.? The Classical economists were\nchiefly interested in the problem of zncreasing the wealth of the nation\u2014in securing\nabundance. Modern economists, on the other hand (at least since the 1870's), have\nbecome interested primarily in the problem of allocating a. given pool of resources as\n*' efficiently \" as possible\u2014in making the best of scarcity.? Now, for obvious reasons,\nthe idea that saving should be regarded as a function of the rate of interest has usually\nbeen associated with theories which think in terms of the amount saved out of a given\nincome. The idea that saving should be regarded as a function of income, on the\nother hand, has usually been stressed by economists who were mainly interested in the\ncauses of variations in income.

This may\nbe considered the limiting case of a model with a labour market wholly insensitive to\nmarket forces. At the other extreme may be postulated a Walrasian model of a purely\ncompetitive labour and resource market which would yield a set of factoral prices and\nincomes untouched by the influence of social power. One could start with the Marxian\nversion and re-work by including elements from the Walrasian version ; or contrari-\nwise, more insight might be achieved by commencing with the Walrasian version as\nthe most general case subsequently modified by intrusion of the specific Marxian\nlabour market with its distortionary effects, its open-ended areas, and the element of\nclass struggle which it provides.\n\nThe Marxian analysis of the social power patterning of the working process within\ncapitalist enterprise and of the productive and distributive process of the capitalist\neconomy comprises one of the many focal centres of interest for modern theory in the\nMarxian corpus. Though this patterning was elucidated in the setting of the Mehrwert\napproach there is no logical connection between the two. Whether income be rigidly\ndichotomised or differentiated into many fluid groupings would be relatively indifferent\nto the question of the social power patterning of workshop behaviour in all its dimen-\nsions and of the functioning of the labour market generally.\n\nThus the continued adequacy for purposes of present-day social and economic\ntheory of the Marxian Mehrwert approach and concept of pure capitalism remains a\nhighly dubious one. Its primary field of application\u2014that of the elucidation of exposure,\nboth of exploitation and of the ideological mystification involved in a vulgar bourgeois\nideology\u2014has to a very great extent been outmoded by the transformation in social\nideology and popular mentality on the one hand and by the far-reaching permeation\non the other hand of anti-bourgeois outlook into the thought-categories of current\nsocial science. The very subject matter of analysis has been thoroughly transformed in\nmany crucial aspects involving the formation of new institutional Gestalt patterns.\nTo be sure the Marxian organon retains its full measure of logical validity and analytical\ncoherence vis-\u00e0-vis its subject matter and with given purposes in view. \"We found the\norganon to be only slightly dependent upon the labour value theorem whose presence\nor modification would not occasion significant logical disturbances and constituted a\nsource of not unfruitful insight.\n\nYet our paper has not suggested that the Marxian organon can simply be neglected.\nIf our theory had developed in keeping with the development of its materials, the\nMarxian organon would have been fully assimilated into a body of workable theory\nand knowledge differentiated into more complex and revealing patterns than either its\nprecursors or raw materials. Only a person with a live sense of humour would suggest\nthat this has been the case. We have innumerable beginnings but few completions ;\nwe have a vastly enriched body of materials but more discordance; we have a pro-\nliferation of departmental enquiries with impoverished integration as social study with\na socio-economic core. So long as this is the case both the Marxian Mehrwert concept\nand analysis of capitalism can be neglected only at one's peril. From Marx, too, one\ncan derive not only an elucidation of a phase of capitalist development, but an analytic\nmethod rich with fruitful possibilities: the art of abstraction to isolate essential\nreality, deliberate integration of psychological-social-economic foci of interest into\nunified logical structures, the disclosure of a developing complexus of activity.\n\nCambridge, Mass.

This is in fact what\ntranspired in the earlier discussion of Lange's definition.\n\nWhat Mr. Ichimura has shown is that there is more to it than that. This looseness\nor unfirmness only holds with respect to the original relation between changes in\nmarginal valuations\u2014which is a matter, in terms of the distinctions made in the\npreceding paragraph of this note, of the movement from situation 7 to situation I7;\nComplementarity and competitiveness are not a matter of that movement; they are\nconcerned with the movement from situation /7 to situation 777. Here it is much\nmore reasonable to expect that we shall find the firmness we seek. We are digging\ndown nearer to the level at which we have to say : '' If, for whatever reason, I want\nmore 4A, I shall want more B too.\" But we can never quite get to that level, for it is\npossible that the reason for which I want more A, may be such that it carries with it\na diminished demand for B. That special case cannot be ruled out.\n\nIt is not surprising that variations in prices, being general, unbiassed sorts of\nthings, not tied up with particular reasons, should dig down as near to this level as\nwe are likely to get. That is, I think, the fundamental meaning behind Mr. Ichimura's\ntheorem.\n\nThe careful reader will have noticed that the movement from II to III always\nrelates to the system of wants which exists affer the change in wants has taken place,\nand that therefore it is not the same system which exists after one initial change\n(J to II) as would exist after an initial change which had been different. Thus it is\nnot inevitable that complementarity of X and Y with respect to one parameter should\nimply complementarity with respect to another. Certainly there is a lack of firmness\nfrom this cause; but if the change in wants is not too great, it seems fair to say that\nthis difficulty is comparable with the difficulty which persists in the case of price-\nchanges with given wants (when there is a movement from one part of a given indiffer-\nence-map to another). We can therefore accept the conclusion that Ichimura-related-\nness and indifference-relatedness are identical in more than the formal sense; they\ndo both represent something which we can expect to use as a fairly firm classification\nof consumers' behaviour.\n\nOxford. ].

MEADE'S THEORY OF COMPETITIVE SPECULATION 189\n\nIn the presence of organised commodity speculation utilising a futures market, a\nspecialisation of function occurs in which the purely speculative functions of price-\nappraisal and of risk-taking are divorced from the physical holding of stocks. The\nspeculator deals in contracts for future delivery and, in the pure case, never handles\nthe actual commodity ; he carries no physical stocks which might produce a con-\nvenience yield, nor does the nature of his business permit gaining a convenience yield\nif he did hold stocks ; he has no costs of holding except commissions for executing the\nfutures contracts, and interest on the required ' margin \" to guarantee his financial\nresponsibility, and these costs do not '' increase \"' as is necessary for emergence of a\n'\"' speculators' surplus.\" The physical holding of stocks, in this situation, is left to\nhedgers, and it is the hedgers who benefit from the '' surplus \" that Mr. Meade finds\naccruing in the presence of speculative holding.\n\nApart from this divorcement of functions, and consequent separation of the\nrecipients of speculative profit (or loss) from the recipients of holders' surplus,\nspeculation through a futures market may produce the same effects as speculation\nthat involves physical holding of the commodity by the speculator. If the effects are\ndifferent, it is because in the presence of a futures market the pure speculation is to a\nconsiderable extent done by different people, and because the holders of physical\nstocks act under the guidance of a rather accurately known prospective return for\nholding, instead of having to be guided only by their appraisals of prospective price\nchange.1\n\nApart from the need for this supplementary observation, I find Mr. Meade's\nanalysis and conclusions penetrating and sound in theory, and highly pertinent to the\nreal world. As applied to organised commodity speculation, the assumptions conform\nwell with reality except as regards their neglect of the separation that then occurs\nbetween speculation and the physical holding of stocks; and the conclusions are\nreadily modified to conform to that situation.\n\nIt is interesting to observe in passing that statistical studies indicate that in\nmarkets where futures trading has been prominent, the general conditions of perfect\ncompetitive speculation have been closely approximated. As regards wheat in the\nUnited States, which historically has been the great holder of the excess stocks in\ntimes of world wheat surplus,? the tendency seems to have been slightly on the side\nof somewhat excessive willingness to hold in times of surplus.? This suggests a slight\ndegree of '' excessive \" speculation in Mr. Meade's sense, though not necessarily exces-\nsive speculation in the popular sense in which excessive speculation is associated with\nunwarranted price fluctuations over short periods.*\n\nStanford, California.

Whether or not he was the original selecting agent it thus appears\nlegitimate for the economist to take at least a negative part in the process of formulating\nends.\n\nFurthermore, it can be argued that the rejection of given end(s) on grounds of\ninconsistency and insufficiency is an important step towards the choice of a new set of\nends. Repeated rejection of all ends which do not meet these two requirements would,\nin fact, place recognizable boundaries\u2014relative ones to be sure\u2014within which the\nunchosen but necessary ends would have to fall. Since the formulation of ends in our\nsociety is a continuing process, the restriction of the economist to a '' negative \" role\nis a fairly meaningless limitation. If the argument of the last two paragraphs is\ncorrect, Mr. Henderson (along with Lionel Robbins) has presented much too narrow a\npicture of the economist's role in policy formation.\n\nIII.\n\nWe have seen that Mr. Henderson cannot legitimately give the job of end-selection\nto the Cabinet (or to any other group) without exploring the problem of who should\nchoose the ends for society. If we operate within the framework of a '' mass demo-\ncracy,\" Mr. Henderson has indirectly placed his finger on one requirement which must\nbe fulfilled by the end-selecting agent. The democratic process can be pictured as one\nin which the voters of the community choose between alternatives which are\npresented to them, but cannot themselves set up these alternatives.? For obvious\nsociological reasons, the agent who presents the alternatives must be an individual or\nsmall group. In addition, the voters must be supplied with the information on which\nto judge between alternatives. This function must also be performed for the electorate\nrather than by it. Even though the Cabinet is a small group there is no reason to\nsuppose that any single group will present all the alternatives and all the information\nneeded. The democratic process implies not one but a series of such groups.\n\nUnfortunately, there is nothing in this process which insures that the choices\nmade by the voters will form themselves into a usable ranking of alternatives for the\ncommunity (community preference system). This becomes clear when we consider\nthat: (r) the individual voters may be ignorant, apathetic, or possessed of ill-defined,\nnon- or irrational preference systems ; (2) the original set of alternatives on which\nthe vote was cast may have been incomplete ; (3) as Professor Arrow has pointed out,\nthe community preference system need not be \"rational\" even if the preference\nsystem of each voter is rational? ; and finally, (4) the voting process is discontinuous\nso that it is necessary between elections to judge what the electorate would desire if a\nvote were taken.*\n\nProblems of this order may have been in the back of Mr. Henderson's mind when\nhe elevated the Cabinet to the position of end-selecting agent and relegated the\neconomist to the job of passive deducer. Certainly, the existence of such problems\n\n! Even if the economist were not permitted to initiate ends, in our society he is free to choose his place\nof employment. Thus he is free to reject any set of ends by rejecting employment offered by a given end-\nselecting agency. He can choose another set of ends by finding a new job.\n\n2]. A.

                    "*'The Economist and the State \"\u2014\nAn Addendum\n\nI.\n\nIn his short note, '' The Economist and the State,\" Mr. I. M. D. Little objects\nstrenuously to some remarks made by Mr. A. M. Henderson in a recent issue of this\nReview. Mr. Henderson put forward the notion that the Cabinet is the proper agency\nto translate '' the national interest \"' into a series of specific goals. Further, he implied\nthat as economists we must wait for the Cabinet's interpretation, accept it, and then\nproceed with the construction of our deductive systems.\n\nTo all this Mr. Little protests. After stating that the role of the economist is (hope-\nfully) broader and less servile than Mr. Henderson implied, Mr. Little goes on to argue\nthat the value premises used by the welfare economist can originate in a great many\nplaces: in the Cabinet, Parliament, the local pub, or in the mind of the individual\nperforming the deductions. For this reason he feels that Mr. Henderson was wrong\nin restricting the economist to those value premises enunciated by the Cabinet.\n\nIt is my contention that Mr. Little was right in objecting to the Henderson\nposition\u2014but for inappropriate reasons. If I have read the arguments of these two\nmen correctly, there is no necessary antagonism between their positions. Mr.\nHenderson probably accepts the idea that '' value conclusions can only be deduced\nfrom value premises.\" Further, he undoubtedly realises that these premises can arise\nfrom any of a wide variety of sources. The problem, however, is not where they could\narise but where they should arise.\n\nTo reach the conclusion that the Cabinet should select the detailed ends toward\nwhich the whole society ought to move, Mr. Henderson must have had some set of\npostulates about the political system in the back of his mind. But Mr. Henderson has\nshrouded in secrecy the postulational system from which he deduced his conclusion\nabout the Cabinet. Both Mr. Little and I are inclined to disagree with Mr. Henderson's\nchoice of the Cabinet as the end-selecting agency, but until he is more specific about\nthe reasons for his choice, it is impossible for me to state with any certainty the nature\nof my objections. They could either be with his postulates, his deductions, or with\nboth.\n\nII.\n\nWhether or not Mr. Henderson had stated explicitly his assumptions concerning\nthe political system, it seems to me that one may still object to the narrow role assigned\nthe economist. Let us suppose that initial ends (postulates) have been given to the\neconomist (by himself or others) and that he has accepted the task of performing\ndeductions. This is the conventional picture of the economist's role and is, therefore,\nsuitable for analysis. Notice that in his generally accepted capacity of deducer, the\neconomist is permitted at most to restate the ends and then only in a manner which\nwill not influence the choice of the agent who does the selecting. But what if the ends\nturn out on examination to be inconsistent ? Surely the economist has a right to\nmention these inconsistencies. Presumably, the economist can also tell the selecting\n\n1I. M.

In the usual theories of the consumer and the firm, it will be\nrecalled, the second order conditions for a maximum (of utility or profit) enable us to\ndetermine quite unambiguously the sign of such substitution terms. In the present\ntheory, however, all we know is that D must be the matrix of a quadratic form, negative\ndefinite under constraint ; and this does not enable us to attribute a definite sign to\nco-factors of off-diagonal elements in the determinant of D. Thus the substitution\nterms are less well behaved than in a general equilibrium theory based on utility\nmaximisation for consumers and profit maximisation for firms. It is not difficult to\nsee how this leads to additional chances of instability, but there would be little point\nin pursuing the matter further at this juncture.\n\nCambridge. J. \u00bb& V.

                    "A THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL OF THE SHACKLE $-SURFACE 117\n\nThe possibilities of the given course of action are represented in the model by a\ncurve (Ae potential surprise curve) drawn on the base-plane ; this curve can be seen in\nthe north-east quadrant in the photograph, and is marked by the bottom of the paper\nupright visible in the south-west quadrant. It will be noticed that the lower branch\nof the potential surprise curve is drawn to the north of the east-west axis representing\nzero potential surprise, whereas the upper branch is drawn to the south of that axis.\nThe reason for this lies in the logic of the contours of the $-surface : when a particular\noutcome involving potential surprise is to be compared with a lower outcome associated\nwith zero potential surprise, the southern section of the $-surface is the relevant one,\nbut when it is to be compared with a higher outcome associated with zero potential\nsurprise, the northern section of the $-surface is relevant. Consequently, the branch\nof the potential surprise curve representing outcomes greater than the outcome regarded\nas neutral when associated with zero potential surprise must be drawn in the south-west\nquadrant, and the branch representing lower outcomes must be drawn in the north-\neast quadrant.\n\nThe projection of the potential surprise curve on the $-surface, which is traced\nout in the south-west quadrant by the paper upright, is the stimulation function; it\ndescribes the stimuli experienced by the individual in considering the various possible\noutcomes of the given course of action. According to Mr. Shackle's theory, the\nindividual evaluating the attractiveness of the given course of action is influenced by\nonly two of the possible outcomes, namely those giving the maximum and minimum\nstimulus. These are the highest and lowest points on the stimulation function, and are\nshown in the model by the tangency of the stimulation function to a contour of the\n$-surface. The two points are termed respectively /he jrimary focus-gain and the\njrimary focus-loss. For comparison with other possible courses of action it is convenient\nto \" standardise \" them by finding the zero-potential-surprise outcome which would\ngive the individual the same stimulus ; this is facilitated in the model by the projection\nof the east-west axis vertically upward on to the $-surface.\n\nThe determination of /he standardised focus-gain and the standardised focus-loss is\nonly the first step in Mr. Shackle's analysis of economic decisions taken in the face of\nuncertainty ; the next step is the analysis of the decision between different possible\ncourses of action, each with its standardised focus-gain and focus-loss. This decision\ndepends on the individual's attitude towards uncertainty, which Mr. Shackle describes\nby means of /he gambler-preference map. The present model, however, relates only to\nthe first step of the analysis; but it may be useful to conclude by comparing it with\nMr. Shackle's own treatment of the $-surface.\n\nThe difference between the two is most readily appreciated by comparing the\ncontour maps of the two surfaces. Fig. 2 presents the contour map of the present\nmodel; it is viewed from the opposite direction to that of the photograph, but the\ndirections of the photograph have been retained for convenience. Fig. 3 is the contour\nmap employed in Mr. Shackle's book.? From a comparison of the two maps, it is clear\nthat Mr. Shackle has suppressed all the contours of the $-surface lying to the east of\nthe neutral-outcome contour and south of the east-west axis, and all the contours\nlying west of the neutral-outcome contour and north of the east-west axis. He has\nthen rotated the north-east quadrant through 180 degrees to bring both segments to\n\nl'There is, of course, no need to assume that the possible outcomes vary continuously : one could\nequally well assume that the potential surprise curve and stimulation function consist of a finite number of\npoints. The analysis would be exactly the same, except that it would no longer be possible to describe\nmaximum and minimum positions in terms of tangencies. Mr. Shackle does not make this point, although\nit increases the generality of his technique.\n\n3 Tbid., p. 23.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 08:04:01 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

It increases with movements away from the east-west line in\neither direction, up to a limit corresponding to absolute disbelief.\n\nThe intensity of the stimulus to the individual considering the possible course of\naction imparted by his imagining any particular outcome in conjunction with any\nparticular degree of potential surprise is measured in the vertical direction. The\nbase-plane is taken to represent the degree of stimulus corresponding to a neutral\noutcome, so that points corresponding to greater stimuli lie above it, and those corres-\nponding to lesser stimuli lie below it. The $-surface, which is the locus of all these\npoints, consequently intersects the base-plane along a curve which passes through the\npoint corresponding to a neutral outcome with zero potential surprise, i.e. the inter-\nsection of the east-west and north-south axes.\n\nThe shape of the $-surface itself is such that any horizontal cross-section of it\n(e.g. by the base-plane) resembles an elongated S or the summation sign of the integral\ncalculus, and intersects the east-west axis from the south-west direction at something\nless than a right-angle. The reasons for these characteristics are as follows. If we\nconsider those combinations of outcome and potential surprise which will give the\nindividual the same stimulus as a given outcome with zero potential surprise, it is\nobvious that the same stimulus will be imparted ezher by a more valuable outcome\nwith some degree of potential surprise, or by a less valuable outcome with some degree\nof potential surprise. Thus the contours of the $-surface cut the east-west axis from\nthe south-west direction. The S-shape arises from the fact that no finite outcome can\ncompensate for, or be compensated by, infinite potential surprise (absolute disbelief).\nConsequently, the contour lines must approach asymptotically to the outer limits\ncorresponding to absolute disbelief. It is also obvious that, in moving from south to\nnorth across the surface, successively higher contours will be encountered ; conse-\nquently, the contours corresponding to successively higher stimuli must lie inside one\nanother south of the east-west line, and outside one another north of the east-west line,\nthroughout their length.! On both the upper and lower sides of the model, the contour\nlines are drawn directly on the $-surface when it lies above the base-plane, and pro-\njected on to the base-plane when the $-surface lies below it.\n\nAny vertical east-west cross-section of the $-surface as it is represented in tbe\nmodel would be a curve, concave to the base-plane when above it and convex to the\nbase-plane when below it. This would imply that the marginal intensity of stimulation\ndiminishes as the value of the outcome increases. This implication is purely a result of\nthe limitations of the material from which the model is constructed ; it is not required\nby Mr. Shackle's theory, which assumes only that the intensity of stimulation is\norderable.\n\nThe \u00f3-surface represents the psychological attitude of the individual towards all\nconceivable combinations of possible outcomes and degrees of potential surprise.\nTo analyse his evaluation of a particular possible course of action, it is necessary to\nintroduce into the model his estimation of the possible outcomes of that particular\ncourse of action, and the degree of potential surprise associated with each. It is\nassumed with Mr. Shackle that there will be an '\"' inner range \" of such outcomes,\nassociated with zero potential surprise, and that outside this range successively higher\nor lower outcomes will be accompanied by increasing potential surprise.\n\n1 The instructions of footnote 2, supra, ensure this result. For reasons of simplicity, the contour lines\non the model are not drawn in sufficient extension to show their relationship to one another as they approach\nthe limit of infinite potential surprise.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 08:04:01 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

There it would break the smooth downward sweep of all the profiles except\nthat at y \u2014 o (the curve M AL itself), and would thus, according to my feeling, appear\n\" unnatural'\" In Mr. Mars' diagrams the assumption would be represented by a\nplatform between two cliffs, one above and one below it, while in my diagrams it is\nsimply the flat floor of a valley from which. the sloping sides rise on either side.

Johnson's version of the $-surface, and here again I incline\nto think that zsthetic considerations have played some part. Mr. Johnson has actually\nconstructed in wood a physical representation of his variant, and has written an\nexplanatory article with diagrams and a photograph.? At a first glance, Mr. Johnson's\nversion appears simpler than my own, and has a quasi-symmetry which, even apart\nfrom the pedagogic advantages claimed for the model, is undeniably attractive. A\nmore important characteristic is that this variant gives us a certain extra scope, in\nthat it allows us, if we wish, to assume that \u00f3 is an ?ncreasing, instead of a decreasing,\nfunction of potential surprise, over some range of x, without having to resort to any\nodd-looking or complicated form for the $-surface. I am doubtful whether such an\nassumption would ever be appropriate, but the possibility of pointing to the parts of\nthe model relevant to such an assumption, and asking why the potential surprise\ncurve avoids them, might be valuable didactically. At any rate, the inclusion (and the\npossibility of including) these regions is as justifiable and useful as the inclusion, in a\nCartesian diagram, of all four quadrants when perhaps only one or two are going to be\nassigned a role and meaning in the particular argument.\n\nG.

A third, and possibly even larger,\nsource of economy arises from the fact that with commodities marketed under the\ndistributors' brands the manufacturer is relieved of selling costs? and, consequently,\nthe chain and mail order houses are able to secure extra discounts ('' advertising\nallowances \") from the manufacturers.? In the case of electric refrigerators, for example,\nthe price of Sears Roebuck's brand in the U.S. was lower, for all models, than that of\nmanufacturers' brands, by anything between 15-30 per cent. The distinguishing\nfeatures of \" retailers' domination\" ' are, therefore: (a) that advertising and other\nselling expenses are low, because the manufacturer is relieved of them, while the\nretailers' advertising and other brand-promotional costs are much lower, and generally\ndo not exceed a small percentage of the retail price; (5) there are other sources of\neconomies in distribution costs, due to the chain-store type of organisation, notably a\nhigher volume of turnover per store and a higher rate of stock-turn, both in the retail\nstage and in the wholesale stage.\n\n43. The question whether these economies in distribution costs could be matched with\na high degree of efficiency in production, if this system of marketing organisation\nbecame general, ultimately turns on whether the number of independent wholesaling\nunits, existing side by side, would turn out to be large or small. If the functions of\nwholesaling could be concentrated in a few hands, there is no reason why the degree\nof concentration and standardisation of production achieved should be any less (it\nmight even be greater) than with manufacturers' oligopoly. The available empirical\nevidence certainly suggests that manufacturers' brand control, whatever its advantages\non the production side, is generally associated with wasteful methods of distribution,\nand that there are strong inherent advantages in a system which separates the functions\nof wholesaling from that of manufacturing.\n\nCambridge.

This is certainly so when the elasticities of demand\nfor imports and exports are high ; owing, however, to the influence of the first term of\nthe numerator of (2), a favourable change in the terms of trade may be more likely than\nMrs. Robinson's result would suggest, when the elasticities of demand for imports and\nexports are low.\n\nLet us collect our results in this section. We have seen that if the supply elasticities\nand the elasticities of demand for imports and exports are all low, the change in the\nterms of trade is very uncertain. It may be adverse or favourable, large or small. We\nhave seen that, if the supply elasticities are sufficiently large compared with the demand\nelasticities, then the change in the terms of trade will be adverse ; but that in this\nconnection Mrs. Robinson's formula underestimates the likelihood of an adverse\nchange for high values of the elasticities of demand for imports and exports, and may\noverestimate it for low values of these elasticities. Lastly, we have seen that for high\nvalues of these elasticities of demand the change in the terms of trade will always be\nsmaller than the fall in the exchange rate.\n\nVII.\n\nOne can but conclude this article on a negative note. In the foregoing paragraphs\nwe have taken only the first and perhaps most essential step towards a comprehensive\ntreatment of the problem. We would be wise to remind ourselves of the many simpli-\nfications we have made. We have reduced the very large number of types of com-\nmodity in the real world to four only. We have taken no account of the import content\nof exports. We have assumed that changes in the distribution of income have no\neffect on the demand for commodities. We have left unconsidered all reactions on\nrates of interest and on opportunities to invest. And we have made further special\nassumptions as we went along. Yet with the help of all this simplification and of a\ngreat deal of tedious, if pedestrian, mathematics, we have achieved regrettably little\nin the way of positive result.\n\nThis I believe to be in the nature of the problem. It turns out indeed to be a far\nmore complex problem than the simplicity of Mrs. Robinson's treatment would\nsuggest. Nevertheless, so long as factors of production are not fully employed, it is a\nreal problem, and one which may have considerable practical importance. The\nKeynesian nature of the problem should, I think, be emphasised. We saw in section V\nthat any classical approach was entirely inapplicable. However, the unfortunate truth\nremains that as soon as we dispense with the classical assumption of full employment\nin the field of international trade we find ourselves in very difficult waters. Possibly,\nin the end, inverted commas may prove to be our only practicable means of support.\n\nOxford. CHARLES KENNEDY.\n\nNOTES.\n\n1! Cowles Commission : The Principia Press, Inc., 1944.\n\n? F.

A shift in liquidity preference\u2014brought about by a proportionate change\nin the preference of each individual\u2014will leave (x), (2), (5), (6), (7), (8), and (9)\ninvariant. In both cases (3) changes proportionately.\n\nThe invariance of (7) under both changes is trivial, inasmuch as by definition\nthis is always zero in equilibrium. The invariance of (5) is also trivial for any exchange\neconomy. For in such an economy we start off with given quantities of initial stocks ;\nthe only thing that might change is their distribution among the individuals in the\neconomy. Hence, as long as we continue to assume that a consistent solution exists,\nand as long as the initial stocks of the commodities in question are assumed to remain\nconstant, this invariance must hold by definition. Correspondingly, invariance (9)\ncannot hold for a change in the amount of money ; and it must hold for a change in\nliquidity preference which leaves the initial stock of money constant.\n\nInvariance (5) becomes non-trivial only in an economy in which production as\nwell as exchange takes place. For such an economy it would be significant if a change\nin liquidity preference or in the amount of money left the equilibrium owifuts of goods\nand services invariant. In the classical production-exchange economy this, of course,\ndoes happen ; for the production decisions of the firm depend only on relative prices ;\nand, as we have seen, these remain constant. The crucial question here is whether\nthis dependence of the firm's decision on relative prices alone will remain once we\nmake the theory of the firm more realistic by introducing into it considerations of\nliquidity and asset holdings. This is a question that requires, and is receiving, much\nfurther investigation. (See recent and forthcoming papers by W. W. Cooper, A. M.\nHenderson, J. Marschak, and others.) Intuitively it seems to me that from this analysis\nwill emerge something analogous to the '' distribution effects \" discussed in Section 5\nabove; and that if we abstract from these effects, invariance (5) will remain\u2014 provided\nresources cannot be diverted to the production of money.\n\nThe invariance of (r), (2) and (5)\u2014relative prices, the rate of interest, and the\nquantities of goods\u2014is the essence of the classical theory of interest. These invariances\nare the bases of its insistence that the long-run rate of interest is a real, and not a\nmonetary, phenomenon ; that the rate of interest can be affected (comparative statics)\nonly by changes in one of the real underlying factors of the economy\u2014say, changes\nin the initial stocks of one of the commodities ; and, finally, that it is independent of\nchanges in the '* monetary sector \"' of the economy\u2014changes in the amount of money\nand the level of liquidity preference.

If the curves did not coincide, the subject\nwould be shown the divergence and allowed to redraw the curve(s).\n\nSuch a sensitivity test is in some sense a type of validation of the curves drawn, but\nmore direct validations could be proposed. The indifference curves obtained could be\nused to predict choices among commodities not lying on one of these curves. This could\nbe done by simple extrapolation or interpolation. Another possible attempt at validation\ncould be performed if a constant marginal utility of a common commodity could be\nassumed and two sets of indifference curves would be used to predict the third set, as\nThurstone attempted to do.\n\nA more interesting test would be to form pairs of individuals and put them together\nin a barter situation with some fixed amount of two commodities and allow them to leave\nwith whatever division they agree upon. By putting their indifference curves together\ninto an Edgeworth box one could see how close they come to the contract curve. That is,\none would predict that in a one-shot situation they would form a division on the contract\ncurve and the actual division would form a test of the accuracy of the individual in-\ndifference curves. Alternatively, they could be started on the contract curve and any\nmovement away would be noted and would be evidence of the lack of validity of the\nindifference curves.\n\nAnother attempt to validate the indifference curves by direct prediction would be to\nmake the appropriate assumptions to get numerical utilities and then these could be used\nto predict choices. Any discrepancy though could be attributed to either poor indifference\ncurves or the invalidity of the assumptions made. \"This topic will be explored in some\ndepth in a forthcoming paper (MacCrimmon and Toda [8]).\n\nMost of the discussion above is directed to determination of indifference curves in\nsituations that an experimenter constructs. However, we might wonder whether these\nprocedures can be used in real world choice situations where preferences could be reflected\nby indifference curves, for example, the bombs and bombers trade-off of Hitch and McKean.\nIt should be obvious that the emphasis on training, reflection, and checks on consistency\ncould be part of any consideration of preferences. Also, the complexity reduction tech-\nniques based on admissibility can easily be used. This, then, only leaves the question of\nwhether the payoff part of the method is useful in real world choices. Note that as we\nuse it in experiments it is particularly effective because the subject will actually receive a\ncommodity bundle based on his positioning of the indifference curve. Clearly there are\nmany situations, not only bombs and bombers, in which we are not prepared to give the\nindividual one of the commodity bundles. This leads to the question of whether the payoff\npart of the method is of any use when applied hypothetically\u2014for example, ** suppose\nafter you draw the indifference curve we randomly select a combination of bombs and\nbombers, if it is in your accept region we will give you that combination, if it is in your\nreject region you get the reference bundle.\" Whether such hypothetical payoffs are\neffective is an empirical matter, but in any case it is probably as good as any other pro-\ncedure in these contexts. Since all important decisions involve a representation of prefer-\nences in some form or other, it would be useful to explore the possibilities of applying these\nexperimentally based procedures in real world choice situations.\n\nCarnegie-Mellon University K.

Yet\ntwo persons more tolerant of risk would be apt to expand capacities independently, actions\nthat would continue to be in conflict with their collective interests. Thus cost variability\ncan influence behaviour in the strategist's dilemma, but its influence varies with the risk\nattitudes of participants.\n\nIt should be noted that although preliminary games were played to reduce its effect\nin the joint cooperation experiment, learning is apt to have greater effect in some conditions\nthan in others. In the joint cooperation experiment, risk averse subjects are often re-\ninforced in their behaviour because they are always paired with subjects who also tend to\ncooperate. Risk tolerant subjects find their competitive behaviour unrewarded, because\nthey are paired with other risk tolerant subjects. Thus, the design of the joint cooperation\nexperiment gives risk tolerant subjects more motivation to depart, based on experience,\nfrom the behaviour expected of them. The departure would tend, however, to confirm the\nnull hypothesis rather than a proposed alternative hypothesis. A similar effect of learning\nis present in the differential competition experiments, but there is no reason for it to be\nmore important in one comparison than another.\n\nUniversity of Bristol and RoGER SHERMAN.\nUniversity of Virginia\n\nFirst version received 15.4.68; final version received 15.12.68\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nProcedures\n\nSubjects were male undergraduates recruited ** to earn money in a research project \"\nat the University of Virginia.

Each session lasted from one to\ntwo and one-half hours. An attempt to assign subjects randomly to sessions was only\nmodified slightly by occasional conflicts in subject's schedules. In each session, the SRP\ntest was carried out first; then subjects read instructions explaining the number and letter\nchoice matrix-game. They were situated so that none could see another's work space,\npayoff tables, decisions, or earnings.\n\nThirty-six subjects were formed into subject-pairs from the same SRP class for the\njoint cooperation experiment. To minimize the learning that might occur, similar (letter\nand number choice) games were played first, before Payoff Tables IV and V were used\nfor the joint cooperation experiment. Assignments of subjects to pairs were made\nrandomly for the preliminary games, and fifteen of these pairs involved differential SRP\nscore classes, which were used in the examination of differential earnings within pairs.\nTwelve other differential SRP class pairs were observed at other sessions solely for this\npurpose. A total of 60 subjects participated in the experiments.\n\nWhen the joint cooperation experiment was begun subjects were told that the other\npersons with whom they were matched would definitely be different than in the preliminary\ngame. Subject pairs were then drawn from identical risk classes. Half of the subject-\npairs within each SRP class started the experiment in Payoff Table IV, the other half in\nV.

We have noted\nthat the RTP of a bargainer has a significant impact on his bargaining process itself as\nwell as on the outcomes consequent to this process. \"These effects of RTP seem to be\nsignificantly moderated by the structural context within which bargaining occurs; namely,\nthe environment of information, communication and power.\n\nViewed from an additional perspective, bargaining as a theoretical construct and\nbargaining behaviour as an empirical focus play an important role in organizational\nbehaviour and organizational theory. In this regard, the research reported in this paper\ncan be viewed as relevant to several current issues in organizational behaviour and theory.\nFirst, much of the recent work by Homans [6], Adams [1] and Weick [10] has indicated\nthe powerful role that the equity of a reward plays in influencing attitudes and performance\nin organized settings. The role of differential attitudinal and behavioural results in a\nbargaining task is central to this stream of work. Our results on the differential affect\ntoward the bargaining task and toward earnings generated by the power and information\nvariables generally support this stream of research and add to the task generality of\nprevious results. Second, an important issue in organizational behaviour and organiza-\ntional theory is the relative value to be attached to increments in information available to\nbargainers in an organizational setting. Our results, generated through experimentally\nvarying the amount of information available to a bargainer regarding the possible monetary\npayoffs to his opponent associated with any given bargaining contract, are relevant to this\ntheme. Our data support the suggestion in the literature that under specified bargaining\nconditions information regarding a counterpart's payoffs may possess negative value.\nThird, the role of personal characteristics in determining the bargaining behaviour of a\ntriad is a critical area for research in organizational behaviour. We view the risk-taking\npropensity of the participants as particularly relevant to understanding their behaviour on\nbargaining tasks. Our results indicate that there are significant individual differences in\nthe manner in which high and low risk-takers handle information, power and communica-\ntion in a competitive setting. Fourth, the role of differential power associated with hier-\narchical status in determining bargaining processes and results is crucial to our under-\nstanding of behaviour in organizations. Our results indicate that possessing a terminal\nposition in a bargaining exchange (e.g. who has the last offer in a superior-subordinate\nnegotiation regarding salary, duties, discipline, etc.) does generate significant differences\nin bargaining processes and results. .Fifthly, the literature of administration and, more\nrecently, organizational behaviour has been concerned with the behavioural and affective\nconsequences of the degree to which communication channels are ** open \", both vertically\nand laterally, in an organization. Our experimental variations of the availability of\ncommunication are relevant to the issue of whether communication necessarily increases\nthe profitability and/or the perceptions of satisfaction associated with bargaining.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe feel that laboratory simulation of organizational processes of the type described\nin this paper is a useful but certainly not exclusive strategy for investigating bargaining\nbehaviour in a triad relationship. It does, however, seem particularly appropriate at\nour present state of knowledge in specifying the determinants of bargaining behaviour\nand their interrelationships. Based upon the findings reported here, our research is\nmoving in two directions; (1) the investigation of the determinants of bargaining in an\nasymmetric bargaining triad and (2) the experimental control of bidding behaviour and\nthe contents of written communications in order to investigate the effects of competitive\nvs. cooperative bargaining strategies.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin L.

This cannot be so, since the demand for money is a function of\nwealth and is therefore related to the amount of assets owned.\n\nWhile the currently used approach contains fundamental theoretical deficiencies, the\nconclusions as to the conditions under which monetary policy will be effective under fixed\nand flexible exchange rate are essentially correct (although the analysis, by confusing\nstocks and flows, tends to focus attention on the level of the money stock rather than on\nits rate of change as the major policy instrument). In the case of fiscal policy, however,\nour analysis indicates the fallacy of Mundell's conclusion that fiscal policy is ineffective\nunder a flexible exchange rate; rather, fiscal policy will be effective in both the short and\nthe long run under both fixed and flexible exchange rate systems.

Finally, one result on which we did\nnot dwell in the text may be stated here as a concluding comment. Since the choices\nmade by each firm under the rules specified in this paper are different from those which\nthe firm would make if it had full information about its demand function, and since under\nthe latter circumstances the profit of each firm would be less than what it could earn under\na cartel arrangement, it follows that the actual level of profit earned under conditions of\nlack of information may be higher than that earned under full information.

Finally, it seems to me that the appeal of the welfare criterion followed in\nthis paper lies in our being able to make the moral judgment that if an individual can be\nintroduced into the world at a desirable level of well-being, and this without affecting\nthe welfare of others in any way then it is desirable to have him. But this poses the serious\ndifficulty of the welfare criterion not necessarily yielding an optimum policy. Suppose,\nthen, that in the world described by the model in section 2 the welfare subsistence level\nis indeed very low. What are the policy makers to do? \"They are faced with the un-\ncomfortable fact that no matter how ** good \" a development policy they can think of\nthere is a yet better one. Ought they to revise their judgment and raise the welfare sub-\nsistence level to the region where an optimum exists? This, to my mind at least, is surely\nillegitimate.\n\nTrinity Hall, Cambridge P.

It can easily be shown that this leads to a\nconstant term ( \u2014 d) ! on the right hand side of equation (3.2), so that its effect is equivalent\nto raising the rate of population growth. But from (3.3), raising the rate of population\ngrowth will raise the equilibrium share of profits and hence raise 0. If (a--n--d) were\n6 per cent instead of 4 per cent, the values of 0 in Table 3.1 would be raised by 16 per cent\nand (\u2014P\") \u2014 1-0 would imply 0 \u2014 25:3.\n\n\"These results were based on a linear expansion about the equilibrium; this approxi-\nmation is only valid, however, for small deviations. As a check on the accuracy of these\nestimates, we can apply to equations (3.1) and (3.2) the technique of numerical integration\nused in section 1. This gives values for the period very similar to those based on a linear\nexpansion about the equilibrium. As we move further away from the equilibrium, there\nis a tendency for \u00d3 to rise, but within the likely range of unemployment levels this makes\nvery little difference to the results.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this section I have used two alternative methods to estimate the period of the\ncycles likely to be generated by Goodwin's model of cyclical growth. Both methods show\nthat with reasonable values of the parameters, the period is considerably longer than the\n4 or 5 years of the typical recent trade cycle. A cycle with this period is only likely to be\ngenerated if all profits are saved, if the capital-output ratio is very low (less than 2), and\nreal wages respond very strongly to a fall in unemployment. In fact the model as it stands\nmay be better suited to explaining the 16-22 year '*' Kuznets \" cycle than the postwar\ntrade cycle.\n\n4. CONCLUDING COMMENTS\n\nIn this paper I have discussed three quite different models of economic growth and\ntried to show that in each case examination of the timescale provides useful information\nabout their behaviour. This is not altogether surprising, since some kind of time dimension\nis implicit or explicit in our thinking about any real economy; and we should expect the\ntimescale of these models to be important for understanding their relationship to the real\nworld.\n\nIn the course of the paper I have made considerable use of numerical methods of\nanalysis, and in particular of numerical methods to solve differential equations which\ncould not be solved analytically. This technique seems to have been relatively little used\nin recent economic literature, although similar methods were used in the 1950's to analyze\nthe behaviour of trade cycle models. While such numerical methods cannot yield results\nof the strength which economists have come to expect, I hope that the present paper has\ndemonstrated that this capital-intensive approach can have considerable value.\n\nSt John's College, Cambridge A.

Wage-\npush by unions must eventually spread to nonunion sectors of their industries through\nthreat responses in order to preserve the relative union-nonunion wage differential.\n\n(2) It has become a commonplace observation that unions appear to increase wages\nmore when they are first organized than later on [2], and the usual explanation is in terms\nof increasing substitution over the long-run. Section IV provides an alternative explana-\ntion for this phenomena. At any given level of organization, a union's ultimate ability\nto raise wages depends on threat responses on nonunion firms. G(W,) will rise if threats\nare high and that will result in higher union (and nonunion) wage rates. Nonunion\nmanagers! evaluation of the threat, p, is a highly subjective matter and will be far less\ncertain and more apt to change if there has been a short history of unionism in the industry\nrather than a long one. It follows that it will sometimes pay a newly organized union to\npress for higher immediate wage increases than it would otherwise try to sustain, in an\neffort to increase the apparent threat to nonunion firms. This is a kind of * demonstration\neffect. Needless to say, bluffing does not always pay off. Another factor is that the union\nis also likely to be highly uncertain about nonunion responses and this may be one way\nof learning what they are.\n\nUniversity of Rochester and S.

We refer to such production functions as generalized production functions.\nSome implications of several such functions for the behaviour of labour's share have been\nexplored. In addition, we have provided an illustrative example to show how the para-\nmeters of a generalized production function can be estimated by the maximum likelihood\nmethod. This approach can be utilized quite readily in the analysis of the particular\nfunctional form utilized herein and of other generalized production functions.\n\nUniversity of Chicago A.

CONCLUSION\n\nIn his discussion of liquidity preference and portfolio choice as behaviour towards\nrisk, Tobin has been careful to emphasize that the mean-variance analysis must be regarded\nas an approximation (e.g., Tobin [17], pp. 12-14). This paper has shown that even his\nrather plausible simplifying assumption that the investor's subjective probability distribu-\ntion has only two parameters is insufficient for deriving the indifference curve convexity\nproperties that facilitate the analysis of investor behaviour. Moreover, if there is more\nthan one asset, an analysis in terms of only mean and variance is not strictly possible unless\nutility functions are assumed quadratic or probability distributions are severely restricted.\n\nBut the inability to obtain unambiguous a priori conclusions about liquidity preference\nor portfolio choice behaviour does not diminish Tobin's contribution in emphasisizing\nthe importance of analyzing this behaviour as optimization under uncertainty. Rather\nit emphasizes the need to develop empirical research in this direction.\n\nHarvard University M. S.

So, although capital equipment may change with use or age, it must be specific to\nthe particular commodity it is designed to produce, once it is established. It is not neces-\nsary that new capital goods be specific to a particular purpose; only that they cannot be\nshifted from one use to another during their lifetime. It must be admitted that this\nkind of specificity is more commonly found in economic models than in real economies.\n\nThe dynamic nonsubstitution theorem is only an indication of the restrictions imposed\non possible relative prices in a dynamic economy when we assume constant returns, a\nsingle non-produced input, and no joint products. We could ask the more general question,\nunder what circumstances prices in one period are determined, independently of consumer\ndemand, given the history of prices and interest rates. The assumptions necessary for this\nresult seem, however, to be considerably more stringent than are required for the theorems\nstated in this paper. Consider, for example, the economy assumed in Theorem 2. 1f the\nmatrices 42; always had non-negative inverses, we could deduce the desired result; but\nthat is, in general, a more stringent requirement than those of the theorem.\n\nEven so, the assumptions that we have needed are rather stringent. Besides the\nfamiliar assumptions of constant returns to scale and a single non-produced input, we\nhave had to assume that the rate of interest is greater than the actual rate of growth, and\nsmaller than the maximum possible rate of growth; that no eligible production processes\nproduce consumer goods or new investment goods jointly; that fixed capital is specific\nto the particular commodity produced; and that in no industry does a capital good increase\nas rapidly as the labour force in the course of production. At any rate, it has turned out\nthat the nature of the ** No Joint Products \" assumption necessary is rather less restrictive\nthan has sometimes been thought. \"his is hinted at by Paul Samuelson in his second\npaper on the subject, but proofs are not given there.\n\nIt is perhaps fair to say that the heterogeneity of labour emerges as the main reason\nfor distrusting the proposition that the rate of interest determines relative prices in the\nlong run (though fixed mineral supplies may not be unimportant). The presence of joint\nproduction of the kind that has to be excluded hardly seems to be very important. No\ndoubt, that is what intuition suggests.\n\nNuffield College, Oxford J. A.

These conditions include knowledge of the trajectories\nof prices, income, and quantities, and of the numerical magnitudes of certain elasticities.\nThe approach taken provides a ranking for all consumption vectors on the trajectory.\n\nAn analytical expression is given, showing the effects on the marginal utility of income\nof changes in income and in relative prices. These effects depend on the income elasticities\nof commodities and on the income elasticity of the marginal utility of income. A link\nis thus provided between a number of concepts and parameters of consumer theory.\n\nThe result also lends itself to empirical application. Estimates of the demand\nelasticities are available from many econometric studies. The less well known elasticity\nof the marginal utility of income plays a role in intertemporal utility maximization. Follow-\ning Samuelson we show how it may be estimated from data on total consumption\nexpenditures over time.\n\nSECTION I\n\nConsider a consumer facing a given price vector P(r) \u2014 (P!(t), ..., P'(t)) and money\nincome M(t), where the P' and .M are continuous functions of time. At every instant\nof time, the consumer maximizes for given P, M the utility function U \u2014 F(X),\n\n1 The author received helpful comments from his colleague J. Hadar, from Professor M. K.

It will suffice to say two things about them in the present context.\n\nFirst, the amount of some labour employed by one firm and not by another may as\nwell be considered as a parameter of that firm's production function when dealing with\nthe Leontief conditions relative to the labours employed by both. This means that those\nconditions (essentially (3.8) and (3.9) with appropriate notational changes) must hold\nfor all values of such labour employment. Even if the firm's production function was\nhomogeneous of degree one in all employed factors it will not generally be so in the factors\nother than the special labour type in question, so it will not be possible to solve the Leontief\nconditions with respect to the labours employed in common as was done in the proof of\nTheorem 4.1. Indeed, those conditions can perfectly well fail to be satisfied for a given\nfirm no matter what the other firm's technology looks like.!\n\nA similar statement holds even more forcefully when dealing with the Leontief condi-\ntions relative to the labour type in question itself. Here the existence of a total capital\naggregate requires that the production function of the firm which employs that labour\nsatisfy a special condition ensuring that the direct effects of an increase in the amount\nof the labour in question on the marginal product of fixed capital be exactly offset by the\nindirect effects of the reallocation of the other movable factors.? Such conditions are very\nstrong.\n\nThus, it is clearly most unlikely that the nonemployment of a particular labour type\nby a particular firm and hence the nonequalization of that labour type's marginal products\nmakes total capital aggregation any easier. Closed-form results for this particular aspect\nof the problem are very hard to come by, however.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology F. M. FISHER\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Diamond, P.

If there are no other movable factors, i.e., if the sets of labours (and movable capitals)\nemployed by the two firms are disjoint, then capital aggregation requires each firm's production function\nto be additively separable into a function of capital and a function of labour.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:15:31 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

If the former satisfy the aggregation conditions so must the\nlatter. But, without optimality, the form of the allocation functions is influenced by\nbehaviour and institutions. Technology may satisfy the aggregation conditions, but aggreg-\nation will only follow if the allocation functions also take the requisite form. The fact that\na combination of two largely-independent and individually-unlikely conditions is required\nfor aggregation suggests that its achievement may well have probability zero.\n\nTo justify the use of aggregates, we appear to have to go in other directions: either\napproximation or a more symmetrical treatment of capital and labour. For instance, if\nwe may regard Xy, \u2014 Y as a fund of capital which, like the available fund of labour, is\nsystematically allocated amongst firms, we can deduce allocation functions x, \u2014 A,(X, Y),\ny, \u2014 CK(X, Y). Hence:\n\nZ -\u00bb xf [A((X, Y), C(X, Y)] 5 F(X, Y), ...(59)\n\nand aggregation is automatic. A special case of this is when the allocation of the funds of\nboth labour and capital is optimal. The early paper by Pu [6] is instructive on this.\n\nAn alternative possibility would be to admit more general forms, 0(z) and y(x), for\nthe output and labour aggregates. Such a weakening of (26) would obviously relax the\nstringency of aggregation requirements, without making aggregation automatic. The\nretention of a labour allocation process makes Kleinian aggregation sufficient but not\nnecessary. It should be noted, however, that, unless the allocation process is of the shibbo-\nleth form (21), a generalized labour aggregate V/(x) will depend upon the capital vector y\nas well as on the total amount of labour available.\n\nBristol University and J.

Clearly, however, it cannot arise when the tariff is optimal in both\nsituations or only in the latter.\n\nTake, for example, the case where there is monopoly power in trade and the economy\nhas acquired an optimum tariff. In such a case if finite growth occurs, the specific tariff\nwhich was optimal in the initial situation will, in general, become sub-optimal in the new\nsituation. And the loss from the sub-optimality of the tariff may out-weigh the gain that\nwould accrue from growth (as measured at optimal levels in both situations). This pos-\nsibility is illustrated in Figure 3.\n\nAQBisthe pre-growth production possibility curve, OMCR the given foreign reciprocal\ndemand curve, QC the international price-ratio (Py), and Pp the domestic price-ratio\nunder an optimum tariff. AQ'B' is the post-growth production possibility curve and\nQ'C' the new international price ratio (Pz)\u2014which yields a volume of trade, with production\nQ' and consumption C' at domestic price-ratio P, that is consistent with the foreign recip-\nrocal demand curve, as seen by reference to QM.

The resulting welfare levels show that U'\u00ab U, which implies\nimmiserizing growth.!\n\nNote further that this case does not depend on ''freakish \" phenomena such as\ninferiority of either good in social consumption; it does however require that the growth\nbe ultra-biased against the production of the exportable commodity X, such that the output\nof X falls at constant commodity price-ratio. Thus, the case can arise when there is:\n(i) neutral technical progress in the importable industry, or (ii) the factor in which the\nimportable industry is intensive increases, or (iii) biased technical progress occurs in the\nimportable industry, with the bias in favour of (i.e. increasing the relative use of) the factor\nin which the exportable industry is intensive.2\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology JaGDisH N.

Reaction Function Equilibria as Nash Non-cooperative Equilibria\n\nThe equilibrium points found in section 2.2 are almost, but not quite, non-cooperative\nequilibrium points in the sense of Nash. 1f the strategies of 4 and B are, respectively,\nthe choice of the functions 0 and y, then a pair of reaction functions 0* and y*, which are\neverywhere mutually optimal against each other are Nash equilibrium strategies.

As a result, the decisions of the duopolists converge to decisions\nwhich would issue from Nash equilibrium strategies as the number of concluded periods\ngo to infinity.\n\n3.4. Final Comments\n\nThe treatment of reaction functions presented here gives a theoretical foundation to\nsupport those who believe it is possible for a pair of firms forming a duopoly to make\nprofits, without collusion or cooperation, similar to those which might be earned with\ncooperation. Such outcomes need not occur, and among all the possible outcomes is the\nsingle period non-cooperative.\n\nGeneralizations which would be desirable have been mentioned at various points.\nSeveral additional generalizations could be made. Reaction functions might be allowed to\ndepend on more past periods behaviour of the rival than one. A general n-firm version\nmight be developed. Or a more complex convergence problem might be posed in which\neach firm begins with an arbitrary reaction function, then each selects a new one which is\noptimal against the old one of the rival, and so on.

This is due to the fact that the government is taking\npart of the risk by letting him offset losses against profits.\n\n4. CONCLUSION\n\nThe effect of a proportional tax on the investment decision has been studied previously\nby several authors. These authors have used utility functions of various forms. The results\nindicate that increased taxation would increase risk-taking in the society.\n\nSince many formulations of decision-making under risk exist in the literature, and\nsince no one can be judged correct under all circumstances, it is important to see whether\nthis conclusion is always true. Therefore some new models and one old but frequently\ndiscussed model are extended by including a proportional tax. Specifically, the chance-\nconstrained programming formulation is discussed both for the case of one riskless asset\nand several risky ones, and for the case when all assets are risky. For the former case the\nimportant separation theorem due to Tobin is proved to hold.\n\nThe principal conclusion of the paper is that increased taxation will in general increase\nrisk-taking in these models, but in some cases the opposite is true.\n\nThe analysis presented here could be carried out for the expected value of a quadratic\nfunction. Since we already have quadratic constraints, this would not complicate matters\nvery much. Finally, it would be interesting to study the effect of a graduated tax.\n\nStockholm University B.

Condition (4.10) is pertinent and suggests that for perfect symmetry\nin a C problem for which a; \u2014 0, it is also necessary that a, equal zero. Therefore, if\nthe differential equation (1.2) lacks the term q\" then it also cannot include the term q'.\nIn other words there is no perfectly symmetric first order linear differential equation.\n\nThis interpretation explains the paradoxical role of the interest rate in the continuous\nproblem by showing that in its original form the C problem was insufficiently symmetric.\nBy introducing condition (4.10) the dynamic demand relation becomes symmetric in the\nsame sense as the classical static demand schedule. The most important moral to be\ndrawn from this is why symmetry of a demand relation over time is unreasonable in the\nreal world. This is because such symmetry would destroy the distinction between the\npast and future. Symmetry in the static case arises essentially because the order in which\nthe goods are chosen does not matter. But in choices over time the order in which goods\nare chosen does matter for two reasons. First, it is impossible to change the decisions\nof the past. Second, the impossibility of changing past decisions would not matter only\nif there were perfect foresight because then there would never be need of changing past\ndecisions. Perfect foresight implies the absence of mistakes. In the real world there is\nuncertainty and perfect foresight is impossible. Hence current choices depend on the\nfact that one must adapt to new unforeseen circumstances as well as possible.

In such a situation, our theorem assures us that the Golden Rule Path is\napproached, provided that the production process is of the Hayekian type. The theorem\nwill illuminate the desirability of decentralization from a certain welfare point of view.\n\nIt is also remarked that the dynamic path yielded by our consumption-investment\npattern may be dominated by another dynamic path. \"hat is, there may exist another\ndynamic path which starts from the same initial point, and yields at least the same amounts\nof per capita consumption for all moments of time, and a larger amount of it for at least\none moment of time.\n\nTokyo Metropolitan University K.

G. HiINES.\n\nThe Dynamics of the Number of Firms in an\nIndustry '\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nAn explanation of the rise and fall of firms' output levels is not sufficient to account\nfor the changes in the quantity produced by an entire industry, since these will often be\naccompanied by changes in the number of firms. It seems plausible that the factors govern-\ning the creation or annihilation of a firm are somewhat different from the factors which\ngovern the adjustment of an existing firm's output level to changes in demand or cost\nconditions. The latter type of adjustment depends on demand and cost functions and\nperhaps on some assumptions about the behaviour of competing firms as in the Cournot\nmodel; the former type of adjustment may also depend on the magnitude of the reward\nthat can be expected upon entry into the industry.\n\nThe treatment of the problem of entry and exit is seldom formalized. The typical\nargument in the case of perfect competition is as follows: if firms in the industry are making\nprofits in excess of normal profit, new entrepreneurs will be induced to enter the industry.\nTheir entry shifts the industry supply curve to the right and the market price falls. Each\nfirm in the industry then reduces its output and profits fall. The process continues until\nprofit in excess of normal profit becomes zero. Similarly, if losses are being incurred\nsome entrepreneurs leave the industry, the aggregate supply is reduced, market price rises\nand profits rise to zero. The equilibrium number of firms is determined by the condition\nthat profit equal zero ([3, pp. 96-8, 192-5].\n\nThe analysis of entry and exit will rest on several assumptions which are as follows:\n\n(1) In the absence of a complete specification of the cost functions of potential firms\nnot yet producing, it will be assumed that all firms, actual or potential, are identical with\nrespect to costs.\n\n(2) Marginal costs are assumed to be rising.\n\n(3) Although the number of firms is a quantity which is essentially discrete, it will\nbe assumed that the rate of change in the number of firms over time can be suitably\nanalyzed by means of difference or differential equations, even in those cases in which the\nsolution to these equations indicates that at some particular time the number of firms is\nfractional. In fact, this assumption is equivalent to saying, as appears perfectly reasonable,\nthat a fractional firm for the given time period, say a year, is equivalent to a whole firm\n\n1 'The authors are indebted to William J.

CONCLUSION\n\nOn the basis of fairly general assumptions about the form of demand and cost functions\nand about the way in which firms go about maximizing profit, it has been shown that the\nequilibrium number of firms in an industry is globally stable. This conclusion holds under\na Cournot-type decision rule as well as in pure competition. The introduction of expecta-\ntions which are not perverse and of external diseconomies does not upset the stability of\nequilibrium. External economies may, however, render the equilibrium unstable.\n\nIt is not difficult to extend the models described here to two or more industries. In\nthe two-industry case it is necessary to introduce a number of assumptions concerning the\nbehaviour of the system at the boundaries.

The\nmodel assumes that expected price equals actual price in the previous period, that supply\nis a function of expected price, and that actual price adjusts to demand so as to clear\nthe market. The relative slopes of the supply and demand functions determine whether\nor not the sequence of prices will converge to the equilibrium price [3].\n\nThe unstable cases arise not only because of a relatively steep demand curve but also\nbecause the suppliers are assumed to believe that the unchanging structure of the market\nhas been changing every period.! Otherwise, suppliers will not ignore observations prior\nto the previous period. If they realize that the structure is unchanging, even if they do\nnot understand it, there is no reason to give greater weight to recent observations than\nto more remote observations. When all observations from some initial date are given\nequal weight and if, in equilibrium, expected price is to equal the equilibrium price, then\nexpected price must equal the mean observed price in all periods since the initial date.\nIn that case the price sequence must converge to equilibrium. \"We shall prove this for a\nclass of linear supply and demand functions.\n\nLet the model consist of the following four equations:\n\nD,\u2014-a-\u2014bP,, ...(1)\n\nS, c dP,, (2)\n\nD,- S, (3)\nn-i\n\nPo- \u00bb Pn, ...(4)\nt-\n\nwhere subscripts ? \u2014 0, 1, 2, ... and n \u2014 1, 2, 3, ... denote period numbers, and where\nD, \u2014 quantity demanded, S, \u2014 quantity supplied, P, \u2014 market price, and P, \u2014 expected\nprice.

In subsequent experiments of this sort, it\nhas been possible to obtain non-convergent sequences for a number of periods only when the subjects\nwere misled and believed that the structure was changing when in fact it was stationary.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:23:26 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In situations where the future extends indefinitely, this is not always the case\n[9]. In particular it is important to distinguish between two views of competitive equili-\nbrium: there is the situation where producers are in equilibrium from moment to moment\u2014\nthis is the case of the present paper. However if we trace the economy forward far enough\nthis equilibrium may cease to be possible or efficient, although there may be no way of\ndiscovering this in finite time. On the other hand we could think of producers as being\nin equilibrium also in the sense that at each : the present value of their assets is maximized\n(if such a maximum exists). The economy then behaves as one which had infinitely many\nfuture markets. In such a world the actual path chosen by the economy will be Pareto-\nefficient, and it will be quite different from the economy investitated here.\n\nNow it is certainly possible for the paths generated by the present construction to be\nPareto-inefficient for a long enough horizon [8]. I conclude from this that if the world\nbehaves in this manner, the way for the economy to be made to behave efficiently is for\nsomeone to * aim \" it at a target. Thus there may be, given K(0), a unique choice of\nY(0), which if now made, will lead the economy along its expectation fulfilling path to the\nsteady state. [If indeed the motion were always ** catenary \" we could assert that there\nwill be one such choice of Y(0)\u2014as it is, there may be several.] In that case, if a planning\nboard announced the appropriate rate of change in relative capital goods prices, producers\nought to expect at ? \u2014 0, the economy thereafter will seek the steady state. In any case what\nour idealization shows is, that even if we assume all the frictions, which stop say, the\nequalization of own rates, at all ? away, the invisible hand will generally need a visible one\nto guide it. To say that this is due to the absence of an infinity of futures markets, is\ncorrect but not consoling.\n\nThe paradoxical fact is that if we do not make such very strong demands on the invisible\nhand at all moments of time it may perform in some sense * better \" in the long run.\nThus for instance if we suppose producers to expect current prices to persist forever even\nwhen the steady state has been perturbed, but retain all our other assumptions, then Mori-\nshima has shown [5] that the economy will seek the steady state. Thus while at all moments\nthe economy is making mistakes they are never the big ones it is capable of in the ** correct\nexpectation \" case. This suggests that it may well be that by idealizing as much as we have\ndone, we have not only created some artificial problems, but we are prevented from analyz-\ning the r\u00f3le of one of the most important features of a decentralized and unguided economy\nnamely that at most times economic agents find that their decisions with consequences for\nthe future, were not the appropriate ones. There is also the plain fact that not all agents\nhave the same expectations as to the future values of the same variable, and of course that\nthese expectations are uncertain. It may well be that it is precisely such ** frictional aspects \"\nof the world we live in which prevent it going disastrously ** off the rails \", but no one\nreally knows.\n\nLondon School of Economics.

In a different model with over-lapping generations, the antici-\npated survival of people for two or more generations ('* periods \") may lend stability to a constitution\nrequiring national saving in excess of the game-equilibrium amount implied by that model.

POLLAK.\n\n1 Jf the instantaneous utility function is logarithmic, (4.5) becomes (3.9) since b (0)/5(0) is a constant.\nWe showed in Section 3 that (3.9) is not a correct characterization of the continuous decision sophisticated\noptimum path in the logarithmic case.\n\n2 Think of the sequence of N decision point sophisticated optimum paths as a sequence of functions\napproximating (ox. Strotz's condition (4.5) is essentially a restriction on the slopes of these approxi-\nmating functions. But these slopes imply nothing about the slope of (x27.\n\nSuppose, for example, that we required the individual to allocate C; over the ith subinterval so that the\nrate of consumption was constant, instead of allowing him to allocate C; optimally over the subinterval.\nThis certainly does not imply that the corresponding continuous decision sophisticated optimum path would\nexhibit a constant rate of consumption (i.e. zero slope) on [0, 77.\n\n3 The logarithmic case is, of course, an exception.\n\n4 This also suggests a further difficulty. It would seem that Strotz's derivation applies as well to the\ncontinuous decision naive optimum path as to the continuous decision sophisticated optimum path. Thus,\nif one accepts Strotz's derivation of the sophisticated optimum path, one must argue that (a) the derivation\nis not valid for the continuous decision naive optimum path or (b) the continuous decision naive optimum\npath coincides with the continuous decision sophisticated optimum path regardless of the form of the\ninstantaneous utility function.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:29:21 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

His higher\nincome opens up new possibilities. Whether at the time of his lower income he was aware\nof the satisfaction he derives from added commodities cannot be inferred from his previous\nmarket behaviour. For there is no information contained in the demand relations (3.1)\nabout the commodities which are not consumed, except that they were not desirable\ngiven their cost. Whereas this may be a serious drawback for prediction purposes, in the\nsense that critical values of income which accompany additions of new commodities to his\nconsumption basket, cannot be predicted from observable market relations, on the other\nhand if we observe an individual's behaviour over a wide range of income changes, there\nis no need to respecify the demand curves every time the composition of his market\npurchases changes. The information obtained on the interrelationship between com-\nmodities at lower levels of income remains valid for higher levels of income, and inter-\npolation between the highest and lowest observed range of income and price levels should\ngive us valid predictions about the individual's behaviour.\n\nFinally, because of the fact that inferior and superior commodities, substitutes and\ncomplements, and zero-consumption can be allowed for, a quadratic utility indicator seems\nto be one of the simplest examples which can be used to demonstrate numerically the\nflexibility of market behaviour permissible under the assumption of rational behaviour.\n\nUniversity of California, L. L. WEGGE.\n\nDavis\nAPPENDIX 1\n\nIn this Appendix we make a few observations on the pivotal method (4) as described\nin the paper. Gomory and Baumol [3] called this method the condensed pivotal simplex\nmethod, and they attributed it to Tucker. The method is used widely in many fields, such\nas least squares regressions, and in other classical optimization problems involving linear\ncomputations. The mnemonic property of (4) as stated in (6) is basic to an understanding\nof multivariate statistics, regression analysis, and the analysis of properties of optimal\nsystems [6]. The method is called condensed, because, as compared to Dantzig's simplex\nmethod, no unit matrix (slack variables) is required in the tableaux. Otherwise, the trans-\nformation of the other elements is precisely the same, with a slightly different system of\nidentification of the entries in the tables. In the method followed here, the elements are\nidentified by a row index and a column index, each one preceded by a plus sign or a minus\nsign. A plus sign preceding an integer in the row index column means that the corre-\nsponding column is included in the stepwise inverse, and the positive integers in the column\nindex row on top of the table list all the rows included in the inverse. Negative integers\nlabel rows and columns not in the inverse, as stated in (6). The mnemonic property (6)\ncan be proved by induction through repeated application of Jacobi's theorem on deter-\nminants and the Laplacian and Cauchy expansions of a determinant. It can also be\nproved in the same way as the proof of the corresponding mnemonic property of the\nsimplex pivotal method. One advantage of the condensed pivotal method is that its\nmnemonic property (6) is useful for both constrained and unconstrained problems. Thus,\non basis of (6) it is readily seen that in the framework of the linear programming problem\nma (x'a; x \u00a3 0, b z Ax), A being an mxn matrix, we would generate from the initial\ntableau\n\n0 \u2014J5 0\n\u2014\u2014\u00c9 \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u00c0, 15 51, ..., m, 45 \u2014 1, ..., n, a sequence of tableaux\n\u2014l1,; |A b\n\n0 \u2014a' 0\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:29:51 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The question of choosing the appro-\npriate form for estimation has to do with a correct description, or specification, of the\nstructure that generated the observations. For an exogenous output industry one would use\na demand curve with output as an independent variable, whereas for profit maximizing\nfirms one would use ratios of factors to product prices only. Similarly, if for some reason\nthe cost or profit of the firms are predetermined then one should estimate demand functions\nwith cost or profit respectively as independent variables.\n\nThe foregoing considerations apply also to the choice between short and long run\nmeasures. Since all observations can be considered, apart from random variations, as\nobservations of short run equilibrium, one should be estimating short run demand functions\nwhere the fixed factors and not their prices enter [10, 11]. This is simply a question of\ncorrrect specification and has nothing to do with the desired measure of substitution or\nwith the form of the production function.\n\nThere is another aspect to the choice of ES, that of generating production functions.\nAs has been pointed out above, there is no direct relationship between the concept one\nwants to use and the algebraic form for the production function. Nevertheless there are\nno clear guide lines for selecting functions and if one has to depend on empirical analysis\nthere is no harm in generating functions under the assumptions that some ES are constant\nand to let the data determine their relevance. Even under this principle, we still face some\ndifficulties which are mainly related to the two factor two price ES. As has been shown\nabove, in general these measures are not independent of the directions in which the relevant\nprices change. Fixing the ES for one directional change in prices has no economic\njustification. Furthermore, concentrating on one ES of a pair with respect to own prices\nstill leaves the others unspecified. These two remarks are not independent and not trivial\nin nature. They are related to the fact that the general theory of the economic unit, be it\nconsumer or a firm, cannot be reformulated in terms of two variable two price ES. So\nat best, one takes a partial view, but imposes a great deal, when requiring the production\nfunction to satisfy some conditions on one differential equation.\n\nIt is a different matter with the one price one factor measures. As we have seen,\nthese are not necessarily pure measures of substitution. However, they are directly related\nto the Hessian matrix, which is the canonical form of the underlying structure. The other\nmeasures impose constraints on various combinations of the elements of such a Hessian\nmatrix. But there are many more combinations of such elements than elements them-\nselves, hence it should be more efficient to try to deal with these elements directly rather\nthan through ES.\n\nHebrew University, Jerusalem Y.

Thus,\nthe results of the constant-price case extend in a natural way to time-dependent prices.\n\nI(t)\n\n,C 120\n\nE\n\nFicunE 2\n\nVI. SUMMARY\n\nIt appears from these results that the justification provided by the Strotz-Eisner and\nLucas papers for the geometrically declining distributed lag form of the investment function\ndepends critically on the assumption of fixed prices. In a dynamic world, however, it\nseems more realistic to assume time dependence in economic variables. \"When time\ndependent prices are introduced, the investment path is no longer a geometrically declining\ndistributed lag and there is little evidence to indicate that an auxiliary adjustment mechanism\nof any fixed form will work for all firms and at all times. Of course, it is possible to\nintroduce a changing K* into a distributed lag investment mechanism which is defined\nso as to make the resulting path optimal. However, it would be surprising to find that\npast or present levels of sales, profits, market value, or any of the other variables frequently\nused as estimators of desired capital in econometric work would work very well in this\nregard. The determination of the seriousness and extent of such mis-specification falls\nin the realm of empirical rather than theoretical analysis, however. It is entirely possible\nthat auxiliary adjustment mechanisms, while possibly embodying the above sources of\nerror, give a sufficiently good approximation to such a broad range of underlying cost of\nadjustment situations that their use is justified on the principle of Occam's Razor.\n\nAlthough no simple, unique form of the investment path can be derived from the\nmodel discussed in this paper, it is possible to establish some qualitative relationships\nbetween investment and other economic variables which are useful in theoretical work.\nAmong the most important of these relationships is the finding that investment will be\nincreased if the path of output prices is anywhere increased and decreased if the path of\ninterest rates is anywhere increased.\n\nUniversity of Chicago J. P. GourD\n\n1 As in the case of constant prices these results must be interpreted with some caution. lf wages\ndid increase over some interval, presumably all firms would reduce output thus resulting in an increase in\nthe price of output which would have an offsetting effect on investment.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:33:22 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

INTERPRETING THE RESULTS\n\n'The extent to which one finds the results reasonable must depend upon one's views of\nhow movements in the bond market are generated and also upon the method of con-\nstruction of the data. In this study, Grant's data have been accepted as being well con-\nstructed without any comment but, of course, it is possible that if data had been constructed\nin some different way, slightly different conclusions would have been reached.\n\nIn this section, the more important results will be discussed in turn and possible inter-\npretations of them given.\n\nThe fact that a random walk model with no seasonal component appeared to fit the\nshorter-run fluctuations of the series rather well, is to be expected from previous experience\nwith data from markets having an important speculative element. What is more surprising\nis the clear indications that over the period analyzed, cycles with periods of two and four\nyears were found fairly consistently in all the series. An explanation in terms of the\nstructure of the market is not easily found but a possible explanation is that, possibly\ncoincidentally, there has been a tendency for balance of payments crises to occur in the\nautumns of odd-numbered years, such as 1939, 1947, 1949, 1951, 1955, 1957 and 1961, the\nonly two recent exceptions being in 1956 and 1964, the latter lying outside the period\nanalyzed. As Government action at the times of these crises included the manipulation of\ninterest rates, the observed cycles could have arisen due to this periodic Government\nintervention.\n\nThe close relationships found between bonds of nearly the same term is not unexpected\nas it has always been considered that arbitrage by holders is usually closest between adjacent\nmaturities. However, the extent to which this relationship falls off with frequency has\nbeen less clearly noted in the past. The explanation could either be phrased in terms of\ninvestors! horizons or as being due to all the series being equally affected by Government\nactions which, as they occur only fairly infrequently, can be thought of as affecting long-run\nfrequencies to the greatest extent. This latter explanation appears in general to be plausible,\nand also fits in with the observed lead by the one-year rate over the other rates for the long-\nrun components as any Government action will generally affect short-term rates first and\nwill only slowly percolate through to the longer term rates.!\n\nThis observed lead does lend support to Meiselman's hypothesis that expectations for\nbonds with longer maturities should be based on the current value of the one-year rate as\nthis does appear to provide a useful predictor. However, the fact that no lead was found\nexcept for the long-run components means that his hypothesis needs to be rephrased in\nterms of such components.\n\n6. CONCLUSIONS\n\nA number of features of the movements over time of single series and pairs of series\nhave been found and, in general, plausible explanations have been proposed. The results\nwere found to be consistent with those from other speculative markets and also with\nMeiselman's form of the expectations hypothesis, when suitably amended.\n\nIt is felt that the advantage of the decomposition of the variables into several com-\nponents, which is inherent to the spectral approach, has been well brought out, as several\nof the results are unlikely to have been found using other statistical methods.\n\nUniversity of Nottingham C.

This concept implies that along a ray from the origin\ncrossing the isoquant map all the isoquants' slopes would be equal. Any homogeneous\nproduction function is homothetic but the reverse does not necessarily hold true.\n\nThe mathematical formulation of this function is simple and the function can be\nestimated empirically on the basis of either polynomial curve fitting or numerical integra-\ntion, a speedy task thanks to electronic computers. The parameters which can be estimated\nare technological change, returns to scale, the elasticity of factor substitution and the\nfactors! shares in the product distribution.\n\nIf the data should so indicate the empirical fit of the HIPF would estimate adequately\na straight line, Cobb-Douglas, constant elasticity of substitution production function or\nwhatever form is relevant.\n\nThe HIPF is applicable under market conditions of differentiated competition as\nwell as perfect competition. Tests of the HIPF for the U.S. private non-farm economy\nover the period 1929-53 give interesting results within the framework of data limitations.\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley S.

            "found": "THE EFFECT OF DEMAND ON PRICES 371\n\nfor labour. (A change of one unit in the index of excess demand for labour corresponds\napproximately to a 1 per cent change in the unemployment rate.) The use of d,^, as opposed\nto any other single indicator of demand pressure, did not improve the overall fits of the\nregressions; we have, therefore, rejected our form of a non-linearity hypothesis about\nthe influence of demand. The regressions which contained d, d,..,, d, .; and d,.3, may\nprovide some information about the time distribution of the effect of demand pressure.\nAlthough the individual coefficients were not significant, there was a marked tendency for\nthe coefficient of d,.., to be positive, that of d, to be negative, and those of d, and d,..,\nto be close to zero. This would suggest that the pressure of demand has little effect on\nthe current price level, a larger effect on that of the following quarter, and then a lesser\neffect on those of succeeding quarters; this suggestion is, however, put forward very\ntentatively.\n\nOur main conclusion is that the level of demand cannot be dismissed as being an\ninsignificant factor in the explanation of the price changes of manufactured goods, even\nafter its effects on costs (wages and materials) have been accounted for. Indeed, our\nregressions may have underestimated the effect of demand forces for two main reasons.\nFirstly, the demand variable used in our regressions was the index of demand for labour\nand not an index of demand for the products of manufacturing industry. There are, of\ncourse, great difficulties (both conceptual and statistical) in the construction of such an\nindex for the products market, though perhaps one could experiment with data on new\norders or orders on hand. Secondly, our regressions imply that a given level of excess\ndemand causes an equal points rise in the price index throughout the whole time period\nunder consideration: this is likely to be a form of misspecification. If we assume that\nprices are fixed in relation to unit costs (fixed, wage and material) plus some percentage\nprofit mark-up, i.e. price \u2014 (unit fixed -- wage --material costs)x profit rate, then the\neffect of a unit change in wage costs is seen to depend on the profit rate at the time of the\nchange, whilst the effect of a unit change in mark-up depends on the level of cost factors\nat the time. If, as seems quite likely, percentage mark-ups remain fairly constant in the\nlong run but there is a marked trend in unit costs, then a given change in unit costs is\nlikely to produce a more or less equal change in price at all times, whereas the effect of a\ngiven change in profit rates will vary over time and will be related to the level of total unit\ncosts. As the total level of unit costs will in turn be related to the existing price level, it\nis seen that a given change in profit rate will produce not a given absolute, but a given\npercentage change in price. Now if we assume that the level of demand is related to the\nprofit rate (per cent mark-up) rather than the level of profits, it follows that a given level\nof excess demand is more likely to be associated with a certain percentage increase than\nwith a certain points increase in the price index.\n\nUniversity of Manchester F.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nThe correct specification of the labour input in the aggregate production function is\nimportant in the study of past economic growth, in measuring the marginal product of\ncapital, in predicting future growth and in assessing the opportunity cost of changes in\nworking hours. A production model embodying separate output elasticities with respect\nto men and hours has significant implications for the theory of labour supply, employment\nand distribution.\n\nTheoretical considerations suggest that the elasticity of output with respect to hours\nexceeds that with respect to men. The evidence, based on Cobb-Douglas production\nfunctions estimated for cross-sections of 24 British industries for three different years, is\ncompatible with this proposition. Attempts to correct for a variety of possible sources\nof bias does not alter this conclusion.\n\nAlthough the evidence supports the hypothesis, there is need for caution. The most\nserious reservation, but one that cannot be avoided with the current data, is that a pro-\nduction function estimated for a cross-industry sample may be misleading. A further\nstudy will therefore be carried out using the United States Census of Manufactures data,\npermitting intra-industry production functions to be estimated using individual states as\nthe units of observation. In addition, an aggregate time series study is in progress.\n\nAt this stage in the research it would seem best to assume that the elasticity of output\nwith respect to hours exceeds that with respect to men and is likely to exceed unity. The\ntraditional assumption that 5j is small or at most equal to y, may lead to substantially\nincorrect predictions and policies.\n\nNuffield College, Oxford and Harvard University M. S.

Mr Cliff Lloyd's paper [4] initiated this uncertainty by questioning\nthe validity of the Hicksian proof in a stock-flow economy and Baumol [1], Johnson [3]\nand Shackle [7] perpetuated it by recognizing the possibility that Lloyd might be right.\nThis note shows that the Hicksian proof can be extended to a stock-flow economy and that\nMr Lloyd's argument failed to utilize Walras' Law for a stock-flow economy.\n\nA stock-flow good is one which is produced, consumed, and held for future disposal\n[2, 4]. The excess market demand for such a good consists of the excess flow demand\n(consumption over production) plus the ''investment\" demand (excess stock demand\ntimes some adjustment coefficient). The market can be in market equilibrium or full stock\nequilibrium. In market equilibrium the excess market demand is zero and stocks are rising\nor falling; in full stock equilibrium the excess market demand is zero with stocks constant.\nFrom the latter condition, Lloyd argues liquidity preference and loanable funds need not be\nequivalent:\n\nIn a consistent n-good system, two of the goods being bonds and money, if any\nn\u2014 \u00cd excess demand equations are satisfied, the nth must also be satisfied, thus the nth\nmay be dropped . . . The loanable funds theory drops the money equation, the liquidity\npreference theory drops the bond equation, but the two are equivalent . . . This is\nquite a simple and clear-cut proof, provided each of the goods in the system is re-\npresented by only one excess demand equation, but . . . in an explicit stock-flow theory\nany stock-flow good will be represented by two excess demand equations [4].\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:39:38 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

If a non-negative characteristic vector is associated with\nthe dominant characteristic value and another characteristic vector is associated with another\nreal characteristic value, then these vectors are linearly independent, the second character-\nistic value is less than the first, and the second characteristic vector is not positive. An\nirreducible non-negative square matrix M has a unique (up to a scalar multiple) positive\ncharacteristic vector associated with its dominant characteristic value, and if another\ncharacteristic vector is associated with another real characteristic value of M then that\ncharacteristic value is less than the dominant one and that characteristic vector has a\nnegative component. If linearly independent non-negative characteristic vectors of an\napic matrix M share the dominant characteristic value 7 then no characteristic vector of\nM is positive; if M has positive characteristic vectors they all have the same direction and\nthey all have the same characteristic value, v. If the algebraic multiplicity ([14], p. 39) of\nthe dominant characteristic value t of a reducible non-negative x by x matrix M is e the\nrank of M \u2014\u00abI is at least x \u2014& and there may be as many as e linearly independent positive\ncharacteristic vectors associated with v. If a decomposable matrix M admits a standard\ndirect sum (1, 4) decomposition with A 1 there are linearly independent positive character-\nistic vectors associated with v. If it lacks a standard direct sum decomposition it still\npossesses linearly independent non-negative characteristic vectors. This bears on Sraffa's\ntreatment of decomposability ([17], pp. 7, 8, 25) and luxury commodities.\n\n3. REMARKS\n\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of both positive\nprices for a Sraffa system and positive multipliers for forming a standard system is that M\nbe irreducible. Some sufficient conditions for uniqueness, but not existence, of positive\nprice solutions are that M be basic or weak basic, of positive multiplier solutions that M\nbe apic or weak apic, of positive solutions of either sort that M have a simple ([2], p. 34)\ndominant characteristic value.\n\nA word of caution. Two non-negative square matrices can be as close together as\ndesired in each entry and yet each have just one positive characteristic vector direction,\nthose directions making an angle of over 89? with each other. Their characteristic vector\ndirections are not continuous functions ([22], p. 9) of their entries. However, the dominant\ncharacteristic value of a non-negative square matrix is a continuous function of its entries\n([9], p. 80). If the non-negative square matrices M and M* are close to each other their\ndominant characteristic values \u00ab and \u00ab* are close to each other. If other complex ([19],\npp. 1-7) characteristic values of the non-negative square matrix M are not close to its\ndominant characteristic value then a small change in M produces a small change in the\ndirection of the characteristic vector with dominant characteristic value. But if the dominant\ncharacteristic value is a multiple root of, or is near other roots of, the characteristic poly-\nnomial of M then small changes in M can produce swingeing changes in the non-negative\ncharacteristic vectors of M ([1], [7], [18], [19], [20]).\n\nState University of New York at Buffalo G.

In both of these calculations\nit would be important not to rely on erroneously measured residual growth in total output\nfor measurement of the social return to investment.\n\nIt is obvious that further disaggregation of our measurements would be valuable in\norder to provide a more stringent test of the basic hypothesis that growth in output may\nbe explained by growth in input. The most important disaggregation of this type is to\nestimate levels of output and input by individual industries. The statistical raw material\nfor disaggregation by industry is already available for stocks of labour and capital and\nlevels of output. However, data for relative utilization of labour and capital and for\ndisaggregation of different types of labour and capital within industry groups would have\nto be developed. Once these data are available, it will be possible to estimate rates of\nreturn to capital for individual industries and to study the effects of the distribution of\nproductive factors among industries along the lines suggested by Massell [43]. The\nfact that past observations do not reveal significant changes in productivity does not imply\nthat the existing allocation of productive resources is efficient relative to allocations that\ncould be brought about by policy changes. In such a study it might be useful to extend\nthe scope of productivity measurements to include the government sector. This would\nbe particularly desirable if educational investment, which is largely produced in that\nsector, is to be incorporated into total output.\n\nFinally, our results suggest a new point of departure for econometric studies of\nproduction function at every level of aggregation. While some existing studies [29, 30]\nemploy data on output, labour, and capital corrected for errors of measurement along the\nlines we have suggested, most estimates of production functions are based on substantial\nerrors of measurement. Econometric production functions are not an alternative to our\nmethods for measuring total factor productivity, but rather supplement these methods in a\nnumber of important respects. Such production functions provide one means of testing\nthe assumptions of constant returns to scale and equality between price ratios and marginal\nrates of transformation that underlie our measurement. A complete test of the hypothesis\nthat growth in total output may be explained by growth in total input requires the measure-\nment of input within a unified social accounting framework, the measurement of rates of\nreturn to both human and physical capital, further disaggregation, and new econometric\nstudies of production functions.

            "found": "MONETARY ADJUSTMENTS IN CHILE 293\n\nC. Notes on the variance of the lag structures\n\nReasons for the variance are not difficult to find. The weaknesses of simple adaptive\nexpectations models have been discussed at length elsewhere and need not be restated here.\nHowever, several problems associated with the stock adjustment model deserve a short\ndiscussion.\n\nIndividual economic units may plan portfolio adjustments at unchanged money prices,\nbut for the community as a whole equilibrium real balances and actual real balances must\nbe reconciled through changes in the level of money prices. If prices adjust instantaneously\n(in the unit period) when excess demands appear, equation (7) must describe lags arising\nfrom the delayed adjustment of individuals. Persons may be regarded as choosing a path\nthat maximizes wealth (or utility) over the adjustment period, subject to the cost of adjust-\nment. When the cost of adjustment increases with the speed of adjustment, the optimum\npath will be of the general form described by (7). The coefficient \u00f3, is then a function of\nthe rate of discount, which for this problem is the money rate of interest; ? variance of\nthe lag structures may simply reflect failure to specify this dependence in a period when\nthere has been large variance in the money rate of interest. At the other extreme, if the\ncosts of adjustments are independent of the speed, persons will attempt to adjust im-\nmediately. The lags implied by (7) therefore arise from lags of money prices in response\nto excess demands. Unfortunately, economic theory has little to say about the form\nthat such adjustments should take, and the variance of the imposed lag structure may\nresult because (7) is not the correct form of this adjustment. A more complete analysis\nwould separately specify these two sources of disequilibrium.\n\nIV. SUMMARY\n\nThe main findings of the study may be outlined topically: (1) the introduction of\nsecond-order Pascal distributions leads to the conclusion that geometrically decaying\nweight structures do not work as well as ones that peak in the second or third period;\n(2) the evidence is consistent with long and variable lags,? but the demand elasticities are\nnot very sensitive to alternative lag patterns; (3) the demand functions are interest inelastic,\nand the narrow definition of money is the luxury asset with an income elasticity of 2,\nwhile the broad definition has an income elasticity of 1; (4) events associated with World\nWar II induced an increase of 20-25 per cent in the desired level of real money holdings;\nand (5) the estimated equation for the broad definition of money has the smallest un-\nexplained variance and yields the best explanation of the rate of change of prices.\n\nUniversity of Washington. ALLAN HYNES.\n\n1 See Nerlove and Wage, loc. cit.\n2 The general structure of these problems is to find a path that maximizes the integral\n\nI 7 e-\"GLf(mG)) \u2014c(ri())]dv\n\nwhere f( ) describes the returns from holding real balances and c( ) describes the costs of altering port-\nfolios. When the integrand is concave with respect to m and ri (a case represented by strictly decreasing\nreturns and increasing costs), the solution is a path of the form given by (7); this follows from the catenary\nproperty of the solution to the Euler equation. For a more complete description of these problems, see\nP. A. Samuelson, * A Catenary Turnpike Theorem \"*, American Economic Review, 55 (June 1965), 486-495;\na special case is considered by R. Strotz and R. Eisner, * Determinants of Investment \", in Impacts of\nMonetary Policy, C.M.C. (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1963) ch. i.\n\n3 Finally, it should be noted that these results are not directly comparable to those of Harberger, /oc.\ncit. In his annual regressions, Professor Harberger regresses the rate of change of prices on the contem-\nporaneous rate of change in the nominal quantity of money, on the rate of change of the nominal quantity\nof money lagged one period, on the rate of change of real income and on the first difference of the rate of\nchange of prices; all rates are percentages. These regressions are best regarded as the reduced form of a\nlarger, though unspecified, structural system rather than as a transformation of a particular specification of\nthe liquidity preference function.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:43:17 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In the inverse demand function (1), then, y; is replaced by a vector of prices\nof other commodites. This is the case of a monopolistically competitive firm, i.e. one of\nmany small firms belonging to the same industry and selling commodities differentiated\nfrom each other, while the case of Davis and Whinston is typically a monopoly (or a\nduopoly of private and public firms).\n\nSuppose, as in Negishi [2], some firms are monopolistically competitive. The perceived\ndemand curve for each differentiated product is assumed to be like (3) but y2; is replaced\nby a vector of other prices. It must be noted, in this case, that the second best condition\nfor the other firms, private or public, is simply the Paretian condition and nothing else.\nThe economic system is perfectly separable in terms of decision units and there is no place\nfor second best policies.\n\nUniversity of Tokyo TAKASHI NEGISHI.\n\nREFERENCES\n[I] Davis, Otto A. and Whinston, Andrew B.

It\nmay not suffice to choose i'(X) so as to make XH,\u00ab(1\u2014 HrE)(XF,-- ZF;.) at the point of\nequilibrium. This is necessary and sufficient for /ocal stability of equilibrium; but if\nelsewhere in R the opposite inequality continues to hold, global stability is not necessarily\nattained.

To obviate this possibility i'(x) should be chosen\nso that xH,\u00ab(1 \u2014 Hg)(xF,4-zF,) throughout R. This is sufficient for global stability of\nthe equilibrium. The proof is as follows:\n\n(i) If xH, \u00ab(1 \u2014 Hg)(xF,-- zF,) for all (x, v) in R, there is no limit cycle.

Given that L(C*) does not contain a\nperiodic orbit, it must consist either of the unique equilibrium point alone, or of that point\ntogether with a set of limiting trajectories each of which tends to the equilibrium point both\nas t -- oo and as t \u2014 oo ([2], Theorem 3.1). But the second possibility is ruled out by\nthe fact that the equilibrium is a node or a focus. Hence L(C ^) consists of the unique\nequilibrium point.\n\nTo explain the continuing presence of the employment cycle we do not need to believe\nthat no stabilizing interest-policy exists. Even if such policies can be found in theory, it\nmust be a matter of great practical difficulty to discover the minimum financial stringency\ncalled for, and also to exert the requisite control over the supply of money. And, of course,\nthere are the often competing objectives of interest-rate policy: the control of international\ncapital movements and the management of the National Debt.\n\nUniversity of Rochester.

When K(t\u20142) and AK(t \u2014 1) appear unrestricted, under hypothesis\n(13), the coefficient of K(t\u20142) varies depending on whether time is included or excluded.\nWhen these variables are combined into a single variable, under (14), the time variable\n* picks up \" more of the downward trend and becomes significantly negative. In these\nlatter regressions, the composite capital variable is consistently positive. In addition to the\n** trendlike \" movements in capital stock, which make it difficult to isolate its effects, we\nnote that, as mentioned in the discussion of the hypotheses of Solow and Arrow, changes in\ncapital stock may influence technology in ways other than those predicted by the theory of\nsections 2 and 3. This raises the broader question of whether one might reasonably expect\nthat the view of technological change taken in this paper should preclude or replace alterna-\ntive theories, or whether it should be regarded as complementary to them. Certainly the\nlatter view is the more promising one, which suggests that using the erratic behaviour of b,\nas a clue to revision and extension of the hypothesis may be more profitable than attempting\nto explain it away.\n\nStatistically, then, our results reject quite strongly the view that the rate of technological\nadvance in manufacturing is unaffected by market forces. When the coefficients in our\nbasic regression equation are constrained as suggested by the theory (Table III), the interest\nrate or cost-of-capital coefficient is highly significant and has the predicted sign. Thus, even\nif, as many economists believe, decisions of households as between present and future\nincome are relatively insensitive to interest rate changes, it may well be that the analogous\nchoice on the part of firms is significantly affected by interest rates.\n\nBefore the statistical significance of the interest rate coefficient has economic meaning,\nhowever, it is necessary to get some '' feel \" for its magnitude, or in other words, to ask\nwhether \u2014 0-124 (regression 7), represents a **large \" or a \"*' small\" interest rate effect.\nGiven the units in which v(r) and r(r) are measured, the coefficient 55, divided by mean\nquarterly output (71:25) and multiplied by 400, is a measure of the percentage point increase\nin the technological component of the annual rate of growth of manufacturing output\nwhich will be induced by a one percentage point fall in the cost of capital. Using\nb, \u2014 \u20140:124, this calculation gives a figure of 0-7. Thus, to take an example, if manu-\nfacturing output is growing at 3 per cent per year at a cost-of-capital of 10 per cent per year,\na reduction in the cost-of-capital to 9 per cent should induce an increase in the growth rate\nto 3-7 per cent. From the work of Denison [6] we know that a one percentage point\nincrease in the growth rate represents a large effect indeed of a growth acceleration policy.\nOur figures suggest that such an effect can be achieved in the manufacturing sector by a\nreduction in the cost of capital of less than two percentage points. It should be emphasized\nthat this is over and above any effect which a reduction in interest rates would have on\ninvestment in physical capital: it measures the interest rate effect on the *' residual \" or\n* technological \" component of the growth rate only. One must be careful not to overstate\nthe precision of this estimate, but it is surely large enough to give some interest to the further\ndevelopment and testing of hypotheses of the sort advanced in this paper.\n\nCarnegie Institute of Technology.

CONCLUSIONS GENERALES\n\nComme dans bien des probl\u00e9mes d'agr\u00e9gation les r\u00e9sultats obtenus sont d\u00e9cevants\nencore qu'instructifs. Pour qu'il y ait agr\u00e9gation il faut qu'il y ait quasi-identit\u00e9 entre\nles types de fonctions de production consid\u00e9r\u00e9es. A part des diff\u00e9rences irr\u00e9ductibles entre\nles surfaces de base, les variations \u00e0 partir de ces surfaces de base sont les m\u00e9mes dans\nleur ensemble pour toutes les techniques consid\u00e9r\u00e9es, le rep\u00e9rage de ces variations pouvant\ncependant \u00e9tre diff\u00e9rent et correspondre peut-\u00e9tre physiquement \u00e0 des gains (ou pertes)\nrelatifs dou\u00e9s d'un sens \u00e9conomique. Ces \u00e9tudes sugg\u00e9reraient donc de classer les diff\u00e9r-\nences entre fonctions de production en diff\u00e9rences irr\u00e9ductibles et au contraire en points\ncommuns, ces derniers \u00e9tant seuls susceptibles d'agr\u00e9gation.\n\nOn rejoint ainsi des id\u00e9es intuitives en m\u00e9me temps que l'on pr\u00e9cise les raisons\nd'examiner avec beaucoup d'esprit critique les ajustements tent\u00e9s de facon empirique.\n\nIl est aussi extr\u00e9mement important de noter que les hypoth\u00e9ses faites sont essentielle-\nment des hypoth\u00e9ses de convexit\u00e9 (ou ce qui revient au m\u00e9me de concavit\u00e9). Or il est\nbien certain que la recherche de progr\u00e9s dans les techniques conduit, heureusement\nd'ailleurs, \u00e0 des rendements croissants dans une certaine z\u00f3ne d'utilisation optimum,\navant que les rendements baissent au-del\u00e0 de cette z\u00f3ne. Dans ces conditions en admettant\nune r\u00e9partition physiquement optimum des ressources ce sont d'abord les techniques les\nplus productives qui sont employ\u00e9es au moins dans certaines z\u00f3nes avant que d'autres\ntechniques moins productives le soient. Ceci est particuli\u00e9rement net avec l'emploi de\nmod\u00e9les de programmation lin\u00e9aire.\n\nS'il est certain que les hypoth\u00e9ses de cette programmation ne peuvent \u00e9tre valables\ndans la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 pour des valeurs infinies des variables concern\u00e9es il n'en demeure pas moins\nque si les \u00e9tudes a priori d'agr\u00e9gation sont utiles pour reconnaitre le bien fond\u00e9 de pro-\nc\u00e9dures d'ajustement ou d'analyse des donn\u00e9es statistiques, il est aussi indispensable,\nsurtout apr\u00e9s de tels r\u00e9sultats, d'\u00e9tudier directement la composition (ce terme \u00e9tant pris\ndans un sens distinct d'agr\u00e9gation qui, dans la litt\u00e9rature \u00e9conomique a fini par prendre\nsurtout le sens de simplification par r\u00e9duction drastique des param\u00e9tres a priori consid\u00e9r\u00e9s)\nde fonctions de production (ou d'autre nature selon le cas). Le probl\u00e9me le plus important\nest sans doute la recherche de z\u00f3nes ou bien de paliers o\u00fc\u00e0 cette composition garde la\nm\u00e9me forme et des seuils o\u00e0 des changements se produisent. La programmation lin\u00e9aire\navec sa prise de conscience de fonctions lin\u00e9aires par morceaux, de faces variables, etc.\n\n. est encore un bon exemple des directions de recherche les plus utiles.\n\nEnfin l'aspect alg\u00e9brique des op\u00e9rations introduites, l'importance des r\u00e9sultats obtenus\n\u00e0 moindre peine et dans des conditions tr\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sans utilisation du calcul diff\u00e9rentiel,\nmais par traduction globale des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s physiques ou \u00e9conomiques, donnent du point\nde vue technique de recherche et nature du probl\u00e9me de l'agr\u00e9gation des indications encore\nvagues, mais de toutes facons pr\u00e9cieuses, sur l'int\u00e9r\u00e9t d'essayer d'unifier la structure de\nnombreux probl\u00e9mes d'agr\u00e9gation non seulement pour mieux les r\u00e9soudre mais aussi\npour mieux appr\u00e9cier leur consistance et juger s'ils ont un v\u00e9ritable int\u00e9r\u00e9t.\n\nFacult\u00e9 des Sciences de Caen A.

In this case there is a Kuhn-Tucker price vector \u20ac\nwhose magnitude is equal to s.\n\nThus by introducing this somewhat artificial notion of the amount of capital, we\nrestore the classical equality of its value and its marginal productivity. In the special\ncase of a single good we get exactly the classical relation. Further, since there doesn't\nseem to be any unique right way to aggregate heterogeneous capital, it may be useful\nin other applications to introduce some convenient norm for the purpose, as we have\ndone here.\n\nFor completeness we conclude by proving the inequality relations connecting prices\nand partial derivatives.

Therefore, as long as\nthere is the slightest chance that u(c) is unbounded, an additional initial sacrifice in con-\nsumption pays, if the average investment activity was planned to be essentially below rm.\n\nOf course, this is not a theory which tells us anything about the size and the time\nstructure of the initial sacrifice. It really is an intuitive argument in favour of an average\nsavings ratio m in case anyone wants to approach the problem of optimal economic growth\nby specifying first an optimal average savings ratio. Since we know so little about the future\nthe determination of an optimal average savings ratio may be the best we can do. These\nremarks should not be interpreted as a substitute of a theory of approximate optimal\ngrowth, which is a question for further research.\n\nUniversity of Heidelberg. C.

One\nsuch model, involving fixed coefficients, was just exhibited by way of illustration. On the\nother hand, macroeconomic distribution theories of the Kaldor type which provided the\nspringboard for Pasinetti's general analysis, must now be given brief notice here.\n\nSuch models fare best under the assumption of fixed coefficients, for if smooth marginal\nproductivities were well defined one would have no need for a genuinely alternative theory\nof distribution.! So recognizing the empirical oddity of the postulate, we posit last\n\n1 This sentence is worded cryptically and could be misunderstood. Marginal productivity, properly\nunderstood, provides some of the equations needed in a smooth neoclassical model for a complete theory\nof (factor and goods) pricing. Depending upon the time run, parameters of population growth (like z)\nand saving propensities (like s; or s,,) also contribute blades of the scissors needed to determine equilibrium.\nThe model defined by our equations (1)-(4), precisely because it possesses some simplifications of a neo-\nclassical model (effectively one-sector, effectively one capital good, etc.), is useful to contrast with what\nappear to be some Cambridge attributions of causation. To test the cogency of a line of logic and the\nuniversality of an hypothesized direction of causation, it is valuable to apply them to bor our neoclassical\nmodel azd the fixed coefficient model of this section\u2014and to certain intermediate cases involving a finite\nnumber of alternative activities or blueprints.\n\nSpecifically, assume s,/s. small, and consider f'/(k*) \u2014 r* \u2014 n/s.. Then, in our model, marginal\nproductivity does ** determine \"* the profit or interest rate at every instant of time, but that doesn't deny\nthat n/s. also does ** determine \"* the interest rate in the long run. Both blades of the long-run scissors\ncount. When we have two long-run unknowns\u2014kK* and r*\u2014the presence of two independent equations\nis not an inconsistency; it is a necessity. Because the long-run *' supply curve \"' is given by the horizontal\nlevel n/s,, while the long-run demand curve is the varying function f '(k*), there is a genuine sense of long-\nrun causation, which we share and also neoclassical writers share with Cambridge writers (like Kahn\nquoted below), that says: n[s.\u2014long-run r*.\n\nBut all of the above is quite consistent with short-run causation that runs in quite the opposite direction.\nIn each short run, let k(f) \u2014 K/L be given by past history. This provides us with a vertical short-run supply\nschedule, which intersects the f'/(K) schedule of demand. In the short run, for the model of (1)-(4), the\n** true * causation seen, in every instant of time, K(\u00a3)\u2014f '[k(t)] \u2014 r(fr). For this model, capital scarcity\nrelative to labour is the key to the level of the rate of interest.

(If\none wants to trace short-run effective demand sequences, the Central Bank ensures that the market interest\nrate, R, is put above and below the f''(k) \u2014 r level, just enough to induce full-employment investment\nwithout inflationary or deflationary gaps.) The full-employment growth path of the system as determined\nby its differential equations is causal, in the same sense that the trajectories of the planets around the sun,\nfollowing their Newtonian differential equations, are termed causal. This is a third meaning of causality\nin the present context, alongside the long term causal chain n/s,\u2014r* and the short-run chain kf '(k) \u2014 r.\n\nWarning: in a two-sector neoclassical model, where the sectors have different intensities and with\nproduction-possibility frontier K \u2014 T(K, L; C), k(t)f '[k(t)] \u2014 r(\u00a3), would be replaced by\n\n[Kst), KE); se, s] Le, Ko, ky, r \u2014 9TJ0K \u2014 eKJOK]\nand where we would have to take into account the possibility of multiplicity of short-run equilibria (as\ne.g. in the anti-Pasinetti case where s, \u2014 s, and capital goods production is sufficiently more relatively\ncapital-intensive than consumption goods production) and of long run equilibria (as in the case just\nmentioned, where the ratio of the value of capital to output might fa// while r falls).\n\nIn a general, neo-neoclassical model involving a great number of heterogeneous capital goods and\nprocesses, let [k1, Ko, ...] stand for a vector of per capita capital goods. Then in every short run, the\n** scarcity \"* of this ** supply \"' of physical capital goods, taken together with the saving-investment demand-\ncomposition condition of the model, is an important determinant of the quasi-rents of all capital goods\nand of the spread of (own) rates of profit and interest [r;, r2, ...].

Since these assumptions are\nnot needed, it is not surprising that all these theories should appear so naive. They clearly\nought to be stripped of the unnecessary assumptions which have been superimposed on\nthem (for example that the capital-output ratio is a declining function of the rate of profit,\nthat the wage rate should be zero if just one worker is unemployed, etc.). Then, I should\nguess, they would appear far less naive than they have been made out to be.\n\nAs a general remark, Professors Samuelson and Modigliani correctly point out that\nrelation (1) is one of great generality, and is valid independently of any particular theory\nof income distribution. It may be useful to add that one should not infer from this that\nrelation (1) is irrelevant for such theories. It is, in fact, a necessary ingredient of all of\nthem (except of those that assume income distribution to be given). In particular, it is\nrelevant to Professor Kaldor's theory of income distribution more than to any other.\n\n7. Finally, I should like to add a few words on the warning that the reader is given\nat the end of the introductory section and\u2014more emphatically\u2014at the end of the paper.\nProfessors Samuelson and Modigliani emphasize that there is an assumption on which\nrelation (1) depends crucially, namely the assumption of *' permanent classes of income\nreceivers ?'.1\n\nThis insistence on pointing out the assumptions underlying new results is indeed\ncommendable, although it ought to be completed, it seems to me, with mentioning also\nthe assumptions on which the new results no longer depend, and on which the previous\ntheories which they replace did depend.\n\nIt may be worth pointing out, nevertheless, that there is at least one important case\nin which the assumption that Professors Samuelson and Modigliani stress so much is\nno longer an assumption and becomes a fact. This is the case of an economic system\nin which the means of production are owned by the State. I called such a situation, for\nthe sake of brevity, the case of a socialist system. Professors Samuelson and Modigliani\nhave dismissed it too quickly. They have simply concentrated on objecting that, in this\ncase, 5, is not necessarily unity\u2014which is a point of secondary importance, since efficient\npositions are always possible, never necessary, in a socialist system. What is more\nimportant, in such a case, is that the relevant propensity to save, namely s,, becomes the\nsaving propensity of the State. Therefore, whether it is equal to, or different from, unity,\nit becomes the saving propensity of a permanent saver.\n\nLuici L.

In order to show\nthat a Harrod equilibrium is possible for all values of s and n, the professors postulate a\n* well behaved \" pseudo-production function, with K/Y a smooth, continuous decreasing\nfunction of the rate of profit. They now admit (in footnote 1, pp. 290-1) that there is no\nlogical reason why the pseudo-production function should be of this form. They just assume\nthat it is so. After putting the rabbit into the hat in full view of the audience it does not\nseem necessary to make so much fuss about drawing it out again.\n\nBut it is not sufficient to postulate that K/Y can assume any required value. Is there\nsome mechanism to cause it to be equal to s/n? For the professors this is no problem.\nSaving consists in accumulating putty. When s/n is greater than K/Y, putty per man\nemployed is rising as time goes by, the rate of profit falling and K/Y rising. Contrawise\nwhen K/Y is greater than s/n. Thus K/Y is always being pushed towards equality with\ns[n. Most oftheir paper seems to be concerned with an analysis of the process of accumulat-\ning putty under conditions of Say's Law.\n\nIt is a pity that Pasinetti seemed to encourage the tiresome neoclassical habit of\nconfusing comparisons of equilibria with historical processes by talking about an ultimate\nequilibrium which the economy is approaching. It would be better to say that a golden\nage is a logical construction without history, in which there is no distinction between the\nfuture and the past. In a Pasinetti golden age the two classes always have been saving in\nthe postulated proportions and already own the corresponding shares in the stock of\ncapital.\n\nIn a Harrod golden age, putty or not, P, annual net profit, is equal to -- (1 \u20145)P \u20145W,\nbut to know the rate of profit, P/K, we have to look at the pseudo-production function\nto find K. We know that K/Y is equal to s/n, simply because if it were not this would not\nbe a Harrod golden age. \"Thus, given s, 7 and a *'* well behaved \" pseudo-production\nfunction there is one rate of profit at which a Harrod golden age is not impossible; if the\npseudo-production function is badly behaved there may be several or none; with Pasinetti\nassumptions there can be a golden age at any rate of profit with any pseudo-production\nfunction provided s, Y \u00abs,rK; when s, \u2014 0 a golden age is possible at any rate of profit;\nin the von Neumann or neo-neoclassical optimum golden age s, \u2014 0, s, \u2014 1 and the rate\nof profit is equal to the rate of growth.\n\nWhen the shape of the pseudo-production function and the behaviour of savings\nor the initial conditions are such that no golden age is possible, it does not mean that the\neconomy will not support life. It only means that steady growth would not be associated\nwith a constant rate of profit. For instance, when, at a particular moment, the share of\ncapital owned by workers is less than proportionate to their share in savings, the rate of\nprofit corresponding to a given rate of growth is less than that shown by Pasinetti's formula.\nAs the share of capital owned by workers grows relatively to total capital, as time goes\nby, so that the share of profit accruing to workers rises, expenditure out of profits increases\n(since 5, \u00ab5,) while the saving out of wages remains constant, so that the rate of profit\ncorresponding to any given rate of accumulation is rising through time.\n\nThis must be supposed to have repercussions upon the rate of accumulation and the\nchoice of technique, which we must then bring into the story.\n\nThe assumptions about savings that have been offered so far\u2014s, \u2014 0, 0 \u00abs, \u00abs,\nand s, \u2014 s,\u2014provide models that are extremely simple. Before appealing to reality,\nand claiming support from statistics about the U.S.A., we need to allow for some further\ncomplications, including the fact that no period of actual history is a golden age.\n\nCambridge JOAN ROBINSON.\nThis content downloaded from\n\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:58:52 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Unless they make a more imaginative effort to reconcile their\ntheoretical framework with the known facts of experience, their economic theory is\nbound to remain a barren exercise.

The difficulty with this proposition (apart from the\nfact that it is * very long run \") is that it assumes that workers spend the same fraction of\ntheir income, irrespective of whether it accrues to them as property income or wages. In a\nworld where enterprises are organised as corporations, and property-income takes the\nform of dividends, this would imply (as Professors Samuelson and Modigliani point out)\noverspending their dividend income by the exact fraction required to make their con-\nsumption equal to (1\u20145,)P,, irrespective of the division of profits between corporate\nretentions and dividends.\n\nMoreover once we allow spending in excess of divided income, there is no reason\nto confine such spending to workers. '' Capitalists * also spend some part of their capital\ngains (or even their capital, in the absence of such gains), and as Professor Modigliani\nhas reminded us, the limited length of human life must add to such temptations.\n\nHence at any time there must be capitalists (or shareholders) who over-spend their\ncurrent (dividend) income, (and the same must be true of course of retired workers who\nconsume over the years of retirement their accumulated savings) just as there are active\nworkers who save a certain fraction of their income for retirement. Just as net saving\nout of income sets up a demand for securities, net dis-saving out of income (\u2014 net con-\nsumption out of capital or capital gains) sets up a supply of securities. There is also a\nnet supply of new securities issued by the corporate sector. Since, in the securities! market\nprices will tend to a level at which the total (non-speculative) supply and demand for\nsecurities are equal, there must be some mechanism to ensure that the spending out of\ncapital (or capital gains) just balances the savings out of income /ess any new securities\nissued by corporations.\n\nLet us divide the community into wage and salary earners (W) who save (through\nthe intermediaries of pension funds and insurance companies) some fraction of their\nincome during their working life and consume it in retirement; so long as the population\nis rising and income per head is rising, the savings of the working population must exceed\nthe dis-savings of the retired population by an amount which can be expressed as some\nfraction (s,) of current wage-and-salary income.

The wide\ndivergence of estimates has been attested to by the comparison in the previous pages.\nHowever, by discussing and re-estimating parameters of various econometric models,\nwe may hope to obtain estimates which, while not completely accurate, will cast valuable\ninformation on the present and future state of the economy.\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania MICHAEL K.

It appeared\nthat this result held even when direct labour alone was considered. It also held when\nthe production funcions for direct labour were estimated directly using data on measured\nman hours. However such data are in principle subject to a measurement error due to the\ndifference between nominal and measured man hours. An attempt to take this measure-\nment error into account in estimating the production functions, resulted in sharp reductions\nin a number of the labour input elasticities, which made it doubtful whether the labour\ninput elasticities obtained from the employment functions could be identified with the\n** true \" short-term production function elasticities.\n\nThe estimated elasticities from the employment functions for total labour and the\nspeeds of adjustment were found to be correlated with the average rates of unemployment\nover the sample period. We were not able to establish the extent to which the former\ncorrelation was due to increasing returns at high rates of unemployment, or to shifts in\nthe equilibrium level of productive man hours. The latter correlation is plausibly explained\nin terms of greater flexibility of hiring and firing in relatively depressed industries.\n\nLondon Graduate School of R. J.

By and\nlarge, they show the same pattern as that of the ** total \" inaccuracy. Each cell of the\ntable contains four numbers. \"The first corresponds to the independence prediction (2.2),\nthe second to $7 as defined in (2.5). This second value is in almost all cases considerably\nless than the first. The third value of each cell corresponds to fj, the fourth to RAS.\n\"They are both better than $\u00e0 in a majority of all cases, but the majority is not overwhelming\n(less than 60 per cent). When comparing the various cells, we find that the largest figures\nare those of the Communist countries. This is the effect of a particular trade policy as\nwill be explained in some detail in the next section.\n\nVI. TRACING THE E.E.C. AND THE\nCOMMUNIST POLICY EFFECTS\n\nIn concluding we want to pay some attention to the possibility of using information\nanalysis to the problem of tracing certain special developments. For this purpose we\nreturn to the mutual information concept (2.3),\n\nlog \u2014U., (6.1)\n\nAs stated above, this logarithm is positive when the flow from ito j is above the independence\nlevel, negative when it is below that level, and it takes algebraically larger values when the\nflow from i to j increases relative to the total exports of i and the total imports of j. It\nseems clear that the development of this logarithmic ratio should enable us, at least in\nprinciple, to draw interesting conclusions about the changes in the trade pattern. In the\npresent case we have only four observations on each mutual information, but it is never-\ntheless instructive to consider a few cases.\n\nOne such case is that of the Communist countries (region 7). For the trade between\nthese countries we consider (6.1) with ij \u2014 j \u2014 7, which takes the following values:\n\n1938 0-619\n1948 2-663\n1951-52 2-973\n1959-60 2-408\n\nThese figures clearly indicate that the countries involved concentrated their trade among\neach other after the War. Of course, this feature is well known, but it is interesting to see\nthat it can be measured quantitatively. There are no other diagonal values (6.1) which\nare larger than 2. This explains the fact that the Communist figures of Table III are mostly\nso much larger than the figures of the other regions.\n\nAnother interesting case is that of Germany (region 3) and other E.E.C. countries\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 21:03:03 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The leading non-zero term is quadratic\nand is proportional to a chi-square:\n\nV V ($ \" umi $ ay 3 6\nM ...(3.6)\nizij-1 f\u00fc\n\nSo we minimize the quadratic form (3.6) subject to the linear constraints (3.5), which is a\nstraightforward procedure.!

Waelbroeck himself is the RAS method, which was\noriginally designed by Stone and Brown [3] for the adjustment of input coefficient matrices.\nIt amounts to the computation of n values r; and n values s; such that\n\njer; hjeol n (4.1)\n\nsatisfies the constraints\n\nn n\n\nY fj-rn Y oxus;y i-i..n\nj*1 j*1\nn n ...(4.2)\n\u00bb $5 \u2014-8j \u00bb\u00bb Xygri-yg joel s.n.\ni-1 i-1\nThe inaccuracy values are shown on the third line of each cell of Table I. They turn out\nto be of the same order of magnitude as those of the first line, which is not really surprising.\nIf we would identify r; with y; [x;, and s; with y.;/x,;, the forecast (4.1) would be the same\nas y; defined in (2.4).? This identification is not really correct, of course, since f;; does\nand yj; does not satisfy the marginal constraints. But if we adjust y;; such that these\nconstraints are satisfied, it stands to reason that the result 5 will not differ very much from\n$i. Therefore, the RAS method can be regarded as being approximately equivalent to\nthe information criterion when the y;; do not violate the marginal constraints too seriously.\n\nV. THE INFORMATION INACCURACY OF FORECASTS OF IMPORT AND\nEXPORT DISTRIBUTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL REGIONS\n\nUntil now we considered the problem of the prediction of all n? shares y;; in world\ntrade. We may also be interested in the prediction of the destination distribution of all\nexports from a given region i to all regions, y;j[y;., j \u2014 1, ..., n, or in the origin distribution\nof all imports to a given region J, y;j|y.j, i \u2014 l, ..., nr.

Note that it is immaterial for\n\nfi; whether we use f, in (3.6) or y;j. Hence the proportional adjustment of the preliminary forecasts is\n\nnot really necessary. . .\n2 Actually, the iterative procedure which leads to the RAS forecasts starts in the first round with\nprecisely these r, and s, values.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 21:03:03 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

It is important\nto realize, however, that the single sum of these $2 over j is not equal to the y; which\nis taken as given, and that the sum of $2 over i is not equal to y. ;j This is pursued in\nTable IL, which contains y;, \u2014 Zy;; (sum over j) and y'; \u2014 Zyij; (sum over i) as well as\nthe observed y;, y,;.

Although there is undoubtedly some truth in this assumption, it is clearly of a very\napproximate nature. Some region i may export little to some other region j, in spite of\nsubstantial values of y; and y.;, simply because their distance is sizeable or because their\ngovernments have troubles with each other. Now some of these causes have a quasi-\npermanent character, such as distance and possibly political problems. It is therefore\nconceivable that we can improve on the prediction method (2.2) by taking account of the\nflow distribution in an earlier year. So we return to the year of our x;;.\n\nFor that year it will, generally, not be true that x;; \u2014 x; x; holds for all pairs (i, 7).\nThe left-hand side (x;;) will exceed the right-hand side for some pairs\u2014those whose trade\n'with each other is above the independence level\u2014and it will be below the right-hand side\nfor other pairs\u2014those whose mutual trade is at below-independence level. We shall now\nask the question to what extent it is reasonable to assume that the ratios\n\nOu 2 XulX.. Q3)\nXx, XQ Xj\nX.X.\n\nare constant over time, for which purpose we consider the following possibilities:\n\n(1) Suppose that there is an increase in world trade which is uniform in the sense\nthat all interregional flows increase proportionally. Obviously, the ratios (2.3) then\nremain constant.\n\n(2) Suppose that the exports of region i increase relative to world trade, so that\nx, \u2014 X;|X,. takes a larger value. Since X, is the sum over j of X;;, at least some of\nthe flows X;,, X;,, ... must increase too. If we assume that i's export expansion is uniform\nin the sense that X;, increases proportionally with X; for each j, the ratio (2.3) remains\nconstant as far as the concepts involving i subscripts are concerned. Of course, if X;,\nincreases this has its implications for X ;, the total imports of region 7, which also occurs\nin (2.3); and the relative increase of i's exports implies necessarily that some other region's\nexports show a relative decline, which has its impact on X; as well. If we assume that\nthe ratio (2.3) remains constant in the present situation, we cannot guarantee that the\nmarginal constraints EX;  \u2014 X; (sum over i) are satisfied. [We shall shortly see that\nthere is a good reason for not giving such a guarantee.] Nevertheless, predicting on the\nbasis of constant ratios (2.3) may lead to satisfactory results even though they are not\nperfect as in the previous case.\n\n(3) The third case is that of a region j whose imports X ; increase relative to world\ntrade, and it is supposed that the individual imports X,;, X,;, ... increase proportionally\nwith X ,. This case is completely symmetric with the second.\n\n(4) Suppose finally that i's total exports and j's total imports increase, both relative\nto world trade. Then i's exports to j, X;;, should increase even faster in order that the\nratio (2.3) remain unchanged, and X;, k 7 j and X,j, ^ x i not as fast as X;;. This is\nnot implausible either.\n\nIn summary, we shall attempt to predict the trade flows in the future year, given total\nexports and imports of each region, under the condition that the n? ratios (2.3) remain\nconstant. The logarithm of such a ratio is known in information theory (see e.g. [2],\npp. 30-31) as the mutual information between i and j, in this case: between the exporting\nregion i and the importing region j. The mutual information is evidently positive when\nthe trade from i to j is above the independence level, zero when it is at the independence\nlevel, and negative when it is below that level.

                    "The Information Approach to the\nPrediction of Interregional\nTrade Flows '\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nIn a recent article [5] published in the Cahiers \u00e9conomiques de Bruxelles Professor J.\nWaelbroeck analyzed world trade flows in a very interesting way. He took total exports\nto and total imports from each region as given and applied the RAS method\u2014-originally\nconstructed for input-output analysis\u2014to analyze the extent to which flows known\nfrom an earlier table can account for flows in a later year. The approach has some\nresemblance to certain aspects of bivariate information theory. The present paper takes\nthis theory as a starting point to provide an alternative method of analysis. The empirical\npart of the paper is based on the same data as those which are used by Waelbroeck. It\nturns out that the two methods yield virtually equivalent results, which is not really\nsurprising, but which sheds an interesting light on the nature of the RAS method.\n\nSection II considers international transaction shares from the standpoint of information\ntheory; section III considers some empirical results, and a third prediction method;\nsection IV the RAS method; section V, the information inaccuracy of forecasts of import\nand export distributions for individual regions; and section VI traces the E.E.C. and\nCommunist policy effects.\n\nIL. INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION SHARES FROM THE\nSTANDPOINT OF INFORMATION THEORY\n\nWe divide the world into \u00bb regions and indicate by X;; the flow of exports from\nregion i to region j, by X;, \u2014 \u00a3X; (sum over j) total exports from region i, by X, 2 XX;\n(sum over 7) total imports by region j, and by X, \u2014 X\u00a3ZX;; world trade. \"We divide all\nthese flows by world trade, so that we obtain\n\n-Xg Q 2X6 Q 2X3\n\nXy x. x \"cy ...(2.1)\n\nwhich are, respectively, the share of the flow from i to j in world trade, the share of i in\n\nworld exports, and the share of j in world imports. Since the x;; are non-negative and add\n\nup to 1, they can be regarded as probabilities of a bivariate distribution, and the x;, and\nx; as the corresponding marginal probabilities.\n\nWe assume that the flows X; refer to some previous year. Let it be our task to\npredict the flows for some later year, to be denoted by Y;; under the condition that the\nmarginal totals Y; , Y , are given. Hence it is sufficient to predict the shares y;; \u2014 Y,j/Y.,\ngiven all y; \u2014 Y;/[Y., and y; \u2014 Y j/Y., where Y, is the same function of Y;; as X.. is\nof X;;.\n\nOne prediction method is\n\np \u2014yiy; hLjol..n ...(2.2)\nwhich amounts to the assumption of import-export independence.

Output\ngrows more rapidly than investment. When there is some capital-augmentation, our\none-sector model begins to strain at the seams. The same gross output and the same\nconsumption at two different times mean two different things, because the ' same\"\nremaining gross investment generates more capacity at the later time. The classical\nproblem of the definition of * income\" arises. As Arrow has pointed out, for some\npossible definitions, the ratio of * saving \" to ** income \" is at least asymptotically constant.\n\nEven if m(t) is permitted to vary in time, a constant ratio of gross investment to gross\noutput is incompatible with exponentially-growing gross investment and exponentially\ngrowing employment.

Second, it may be that the broad outlines of economic\nhistory\u2014in. particular, the apparent long-run trendlessness of the marginal efficiency of\ncapital\u2014suggest Harrod-neutrality more than they suggest any other simple hypothesis\nabout technical progress.

On the other hand,\n\n1\u2014 00\nif m(t) is constant, then output will grow at the usual natural rate while the gross saving\nratio will fall exponentially and the rate of interest will rise.

(Of course the equality of private and social rates\nof return is broken.) It should be realized that in short-run equilibrium the real wage may\nbe at its competitive level for the current level of employment. Real-wage rigidity means\nonly that unemployment does not make the real wage fall.\n\nVII EXTENSIONS AND OPEN QUESTIONS\n\n1. Depreciation and loss of productivity\n\nIt is quite straightforward to make allowance for age-dependent physical depreciation\nwithin our simple technology. Let 3(x) be the proportion of an instant's gross investment\nthat survives to age x. Then the fundamental employment and output equations become\n\nSEP\nN(t),\u2014 uM 1) \u00e0(t \u2014 v)i(v)dv,\n\nY(t) \u2014 li p(v)\u00e0(t \u2014 v)i(v)dv.\nt\u2014m(t)\n\nThe easy special case is, of course, depreciation-by-evaporation: 9(x) \u2014 e-9*, The results\nare generally predictable. The case of *' one-hoss-shay \" depreciation is mixed. If 0 is\nthe physical lifetime of capital, 9(x) \u2014 | , o - x - 9 Whenever the economic facts\nrequire (f) X 0, the physical lifetime is irrelevant, and the analysis is exactly as in the\nbody ofthe paper. But when the economic facts would make m(t) \u2014 0, the physical lifetime\nhas primacy and shortage of capital supervenes. It is laborious to piece the two regimes\ntogether but it can be done.\n\nRelated to, but not identical with, the idea of physical depreciation is the notion that\ncapital goods lose productivity (or require increasing maintenance) over their lifetime.\nSuppose, for concreteness, that plant constructed at time v has a capacity at time t Z: v\nof u(t, v) units of output. It is now complicated to say what *' technological progress \"\nmeans, since it may well be desirable to have capital goods which are less productive when\nnew but lose productivity more slowly with age. It is unambiguously progress if v' \u2014 v\nimplies u(v' -- x, v) 7 p(v 4- x, v) for all x Z0 (and labor requirements are not higher\non vintage v' capital). But this is unnecessarily strong. The simple special case is u(7, v) \u2014\nw(t \u2014 v)u(v). Then one has\n\n2| MD,\nN() -\u2014 I.

(There is a symmetric\nhypothesis; output capacity remains but labor requirement increases with age.) It is not\nhard to see that\u2014ignoring depreciation again\u2014the real wage must be w(m)X(t \u2014 m)\nwhere, as usual, 7 is the economic lifetime of capital.

That is: the margin separating active from idle capital is fixed by the requirement\nthat the entire labor force find employment; and output is whatever they are capable of\nproducing.

XPre-Keynesian neo-classical\neconomics relied on a market mechanism: so long as there was unemployment the real\nwage would fall; older and older vintages of capital would be able to earn positive quasi-\nrents; as they entered production, employment would rise. Modern short-run income\nanalysis rests on the presumption that this cannot or does not happen, or does not happen\nquickly enough to matter. The causal structure in (7) and (8) is reversed. If we take\naggregate demand Y(ft) as given (in the simplest case, from exogenous investment via the\nmultiplier), (8) determines m(r) and (7) determines N(t). That is: the margin separating\nactive from idle capital is fixed by the requirement that output just match real effective\ndemand; and employment is whatever is necessary to man that capital. If the division of\noutput between consumption and investment is determined, a model like this is clearly\nable to generate its own future time-path.\n\n2. Aggregate Supply and Demand\n\nThere must, of course, be a market mechanism underlying a Keynesian economy,\nthough it cannot be the same as the neo-classical mechanism. For one thing, a Keynesian\neconomy must have at least one more asset, money, and therefore one more price, the\nmoney wage, than the neo-classical aggregative model we have been discussing. Otherwise\nthere is no explanation for over-saving. Without the attraction of some other store of\nvalue, investors would simply increase consumption whenever capital accumulation became\nunattractive. Nor is there, without money, any opening for the trouble that may arise\nfrom stickiness of money wages and prices. A mechanism close to that described in 77e\nGeneral Theory itself is the following. Suppose W(t), the money wage, is given in the short-\nrun; W(t)or its rate of change may depend on past unemployment, but for the current\ninstant it is given. Now equation (9) can be rewritten\n\nWn)\nXt \u2014 mt)\n\nwhere P(t) is the money price level. Together (8) and (9\") define an aggregate supply curve,\ngiving Y(t) as a function of P(r). Any P(t) determines, via (9), an m(t). That m(t), inserted\nin (8), yields the corresponding Y(ft). More descriptively, with a sticky money wage, any\narbitrary price level fixes the margin between those vintages of capital which can operate\nat a profit and those which cannot; the corresponding supply of output is the capacity\nof the profitable vintages. Obviously Y(f) is an increasing function of P(t).\n\nA detailed treatment of aggregate demand would be out of place in this essay. One\nlimiting possibility is that real aggregate demand is independent of the price level for a\ngiven money wage. More generally, real demand might depend on the price level through\nthe distribution of income, through the real volume of cash balances, or in other ways. In\nany case, the intersection of the aggregate demand and supply curves determines the price\nlevel and real output.\n\nThis is a perfectly-competitive Keynesian model, with (9^) doing the work of a marginal-\nproduct-of labor equation. Here\u2014as in the full employment model\u2014it is possible to\nallow for imperfectly-competitive pricing. Then (9^) can be altered to\n\nWe) .\nXt \u2014 m(t)) '\n\n(9) P(t) \u2014\n\n(9\") P(t) \u2014 (1 4- 0)\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 21:07:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The social rate of return on saving\n\nUnder competitive conditions, the private rate of return on savings is independent of\nthe individual's decisions. Like any price, however, the social rate of return depends on\nthe aggregate of investment decisions. It can only be determined after the whole invest-\nment path (for the past as well as for the future) has been decided. Let us call this pre-\ndetermined path /*(7).

Without\na change in the investment path /*(7), no higher gross output than Y*(rt) is possible for any\nt. In other words, in order to achieve a higher volume of gross output in the future the\neconomy has to increase the current rate of accumulation, which means that it has to\nreduce current consumption.\n\nThe concept of a social rate of return on savings makes sense only in the case of\nefficient paths. For if Y(ft) were limited not by the capacity to produce but by effective\ndemand, then a rise in consumption today could be effected without changing the future\ncapacity to produce consumption goods. But for efficient paths Y*(f) the social rate of\nreturn on investment links small changes in /(7) to small changes in C(f) for given L(t),\njust as the marginal productivity of labor relates small changes in L(t) to the resulting\nsmall changes in C(t) for given /(t).\n\nThere are of course infinitely many ways in which marginal changes of the function\nI*(t) can be introduced.

The object of this part is to relate the competitive equilibrium interest\nrate defined in (27) to what we shall call the social rate of return on saving or investment.\nThe point of the analogy is suggested by the fact that in a perfect capital market the ruling\nrate of interest functions as the private rate of return on savings.\n\nConsider a person who disposes of a certain amount of wealth, W(0), at time zero\nand who is obliged for some reason to pursue a saving program such that his wealth at\nsome given later time T'is equal to a given amount W(T). His wealth at time zero may con-\nsist of a current stock plus the sum of his discounted wage income in the time interval\n[0, T].

One is to adopt\n(33) as a market equilibrium condition: the rate of interest must equalize the present\nvalue of future quasi-rents from a new capital good to its cost of production.

Proofs of these theorems would be essentially a\nrepetition of proofs given earlier.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe postulated a certain technology function which is conducive to golden ages. We\nthen showed that when golden-age consumption is maximal with respect to research effort,\nthe rate of return to '* investment in technology \" equals the rate of growth. We referred\nto this equalization as the Golden Rule of Research. It was also shown that when golden-\nage consumption is maximized with respect to tangible investment in the commodity sector,\nthe rate of return from tangible investment equals the rate of growth. This is the familiar\nGolden Rule of Accumulation. When golden-age consumption is maximal with respect\nto both kinds of investment, the two rates of return are therefore both equal to each other\nand to the rate of growth. This suggests the General Golden Rule of Investment: to\nmaximize golden-age consumption, assuming an interior maximum to exist, equate the rate\nof return from each kind of investment to the rate of growth.\n\nWe also characterized the Golden Rule state in terms of labor allocation. It was shown\nthat if the labor force is homogeneous and capital is unproductive in the research sector\nthen exactly one half the labor force is assigned to research on the Golden Rule path. But\nif capital is productive in research or if the skill at research of the marginal researcher falls\nwith increasing numbers of researchers, due to a nonhomogeneous skill mix, then, on\ncertain assumptions, less than one half of the labor force does research on the Golden\nRule path.\n\nYale University.

One thus finds washing machines\nin many homes, where they are only infrequently (if at all) rented out to neighbors, being\nutilized for only a very minor fraction of their potential. Such imperfections of the market\nalso may account for the coexistence of assets designed for the same type of service, but\nof different durabilities.\n\nWhen use and ownership of assets are interdependent, subjective time preferences!\nbecome relevant for determining the discount rate to be used in evaluating W. This is\nan additional factor of making different buyers prefer (and obtain) assets of differing\ndurabilities.\n\nThe market for second-hand goods does, to a certain extent, mitigate the effects of\nthe above-mentioned imperfections.\n\n3. The Concept of Durability\n\nIn our above discussion of the W function, some qualifications of the durability concept\nwere noted. We shall now examine some further questions relating to this concept.\n\n(i) One simplification of the durability concept lies in the certainty with which the\nlife span of the asset was assumed to be predictable in advance. It is more realistic to\nattribute to the asset, at its birth, some probability distribution of life spans.?. 3 In such\na stochastic model of durability, the value of the asset will equal the average of the values\ncorresponding to different life spans, weighted by their probability of occurrence. We may\ndefine the ** certainty equivalent \" of durability as the life span which, if certain, would\nresult in the same value for the asset. This certainty equivalent has the interesting property\nthat it is decreased when the interest rate rises\u2014as at the higher interest rate, the values of\nthe longer lives become relatively less important in the average. Thus the value of the\nasset is more strongly affected by the interest rate in the stochastic model than in the\ndeterministic one. It seems to us that this will result in amplifying the effect of changes in\nthe interest rate on optimum durability.\n\n(ii) Another conceptual difficulty with durability lies in the possibility of prolonging\nthe life span of an asset already in use. Such a possibility of rejuvenating the asset (by re-\nbuilding it, replacing parts, etc.) allows a partial postponement of the decision on durability.\nIn a deterministic system, of course, this question does not exist. Only when uncertainty is\npresent is it advantageous to postpone decisions until more information becomes available.\nIt seems to us that secondary (and tertiary, etc.) durability has to be introduced into\nthe model as an additional variable in the supply function. The solution should, therefore,\nbe similar, at least conceptually, to that presented here.\n\n(iii) One should perhaps also mention two more general problems which may be of\nparticular importance for the durability concept. As is customarily done with economic\nvariables, durability was treated as continuous. It might be, however, that only a limited\nnumber of alternative life-spans for the durable is technically possible.4 Secondly, we\nhave endeavored to formulate a pure theory of durability. Such an approach necessarily\ndisregards the possibility that in some cases extensions of durability may be technologically\ninseparable from other changes in quality.\n\n4. The Short Run, and Market Imperfections\n\nThe model presented in this paper was developed within the framework of long-run,\nperfectly competitive equilibrium. Two extensions naturally suggest themselves.\n\n1 Together with imperfections in the capital market.\n\n2 That is, when an asset is produced, it has a certain probability P; that it will turn out to belong to the\ncategory having a life span T;, with the whole time shape of the service stream associated with this life span.\n\n3 Solow, loc. cit., deals with the case of ** radioactive \"\" decline in the productive capacity of the capital\nstock, which may be interpreted as a case of mortality being exponentially distributed.\n\n* While such an approach would require a major reformulation, there is no reason to expect different\nresults. Nevertheless, it might be worthwhile to work out the problem in terms of activity analysis.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 21:09:52 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

This cost is to be interpreted as the cost of exact physical repli-\ncation as it would have been had the blueprint been available at 5.!\n\nSince investment designs of different vintage were rarely in production at the same\ntime, and since designs invented after b could not have been produced then, historical\nevidence on relative costs will be sparse if not non-existent. Thus the application of the\nmethod is difficult and conjectural: chaining procedures seem to be required [14]: and,\nas usual, the choice of a particular b intrudes more arbitrariness.\n\nThere is an additional complication of principle even if such replication-cost deflators\ncan be constructed. Investors at \u00ab were interested in the actual relative costs of the available\ndesigns: not their hypothetical relative costs at b. If (due say to changing factor costs in\nthe investment-good industry) these differ, then systematic investment behaviour at the\ncosts of * may appear distorted when viewed at the costs of b. It may even appear, quite\nspuriously, that investors installed at \u00ab designs that were technically inferior to others\navailable at the same cost (see [15]).\n\nBefore amalgamating different vintages of investment into a factor-of-production\nmeasure of capital, it is necessary to weight them for physical deterioration and quality\nchange (or embodied progress)\u2014matters on which it is notoriously difficult to obtain\ndirect evidence. The earlier aggregation condition for technical frontiers serves as the\nconceptual idealisation, articulating in principle our empirical procedures. The basic\nrule it suggests is that weightings given to assets of different age and design should be\nbased on relative outputs (or labour inputs) only after standardisation to a common average\nproduct of labour and a standard lifetime.? There are two alternatives which give equiva-\nlent results only if the aggregation conditions hold exactly. Either consider the effects of\nhaving spent M(\u00ab) at \u00ab on assets with the same physical life as those actually chosen, but\nwith labour productivity at age \u00a3 \u2014 \u00ab equal to that on new vintage-/ assets. Or consider\nthe effects of spending M(f) at t on assets with the same physical life as those actually\nchosen, but with labour productivity equal to that on actual vintage-\u00ab assets of age 1 \u2014 ^.\n\nThese are counsels of perfection.  Failing them, as Solow has demonstrated [18],\nthere remains some hope that vintage-weighting functions may be chosen by the coherence\nwith which they graduate the data ([7] reports somewhat analogous experiments in a\ndifferent context).4\n\nIt is tempting to hope (as does [4]) that forward-looking market valuations of old\nassets can provide weights that convert obsolete and deteriorated assets into equivalent\nfractions of new ones of latest design. But the conditions under which this is true are very\nrestrictive [23]. Pragmatically, correlations between balance sheet and similar capital-value\nmeasures and conceptually-preferable ones may be high: but see [7].\n\nUniversity of Bristol. J. K.

In certain circum-\nstances, the s;(7) will be relevant in obtaining efficiency-unit weights.\n\n?

On the other hand,\np reflects all the exogenous elements in the outlay on the group of factors.\n\nThis raises some basic difficulties in dealing with composite inputs in empirical research.\nFirst there is the problem of applying our criterion of perfect aggregation. \"What we\nwould like ideally to examine are data on changes in the parameters o; ! in order to see\nwhether these parameters did in fact change in the same proportion (the case of eqvi-\nproportional changes in \u00ab; includes of course the very important case of ro change).\nHowever instead of a; we usually have data on prices, i.e. on the product o;s! where the\nlatter includes the endogenous factor s'(x,, . . . , xx) which will vary even when all o; are\nfixed.\n\nIt should be noted that the criterion for perfect aggregation in the competitive model\n(i.e. constancy of relative prices) will usually mislead us in the imperfectly competitive\ncase. Thus e.g. we may observe that p,, . . . , ps vary in different proportions and conclude\n(having the Hicksian criterion in mind) that we are rot allowed to aggregate over x,, . . . , Xm.\nIt may however well be that the firm is a monopsonist in these inputs and the observed\nchanges in p,, . . . , py reflect purely endogenous changes along given supply functions. In\nthe latter case the criterion for perfect aggregation over x, .. ., xa is satisfied. All we have\nto do is take simply the actual (non deflated) outlay on xi, . . . , xw as the composite good.\nOn the other hand one may work out examples where p,, .. . , ps do change proportionately\nwhile &4, .. . , \u00ab4 do not.\n\nEven if we are told that the condition for perfect aggregation is met, i.e. o; \u2014 p\n(i \u2014 1,...,m), we must still know the value of the parameter p at each point, since otherwise\nwe cannot measure the composite good. In other words while our data are on the bracketed\n\nm m\ncomponents in 2X (x) (ps?) we wish to make the division differently, i.e. (p) (i xis) \u2014 px.\n1 1\n\nThe problem can also be regarded as a special kind of an index number problem. In the\ncase of a; \u2014 p (i \u2014 1,...,m) we may obtain the quantity measure of the composite good\nm\n\nz pixi\n\n2 sixi\n\n1\ncal difficulty with this index is that the *' base point weights \" s'(x,, . . . , xs) are not\nobservable constants (as in the Hicksian case) but rather not directly observable functional\nvalues.\n\nAII the difficulties raised in this section do not mean that the application of our theorem\nto empirical studies (such as econometric analysis of production functions) is impossible\nunder conditions of imperfect competition. They imply however that the empirical analysis\nof production functions using composite inputs has to be supplemented by some appro-\npriate tests of variations in supply conditions.\n\nm m\nx \u2014 X xis! by deflating the money outlay X pix; by a price index p \u2014 .

In presenting\nthis measure, we do not claim to have a theory in the sense of a unique prediction of the\namount of interrelatedness (or diversification) to be associated with a particular level of\ndevelopment.

Rosenberg has urged that in the nineteenth century, the U.S. machine tool\nindustry was particularly important instrument in the diffusion of technological change\nthroughout the entire economy; metal-working plants underwent a clearly marked sequence\nof changes in product, and the new processes required at each step in the sequence turned\nout to have wide applications in the manufacture of other products.

In 1919 iron mining had sold to *' blast furnaces \" and to ** steel works and rolling\nmills \", in 1929 it sold only to the former. In half the industries (20) changes in both\ndiversification and indirect relatedness were small (less than .05 in either direction). But\nin one-fifth of the industries (eight in number) increases in diversification were greater\nthan .10 and were accompanied by declines in indirect relatedness. Thus the changes\nobserved in Table 1 appear mainly to be associated with increased diversification in a\nrelatively small number of industries.\n\nAn increase in diversification in any one industry necessarily increases interrelatedness\nin other industries as well. To illustrate the consequences of such an increase, we present\nthe rnatrix A5 with order matrix B;:\n\n0 a4,0 0 0 31323\n0 0 O0 a0 22212\nA; [O0 0 O0 O0 ag B,\u2014|[23 54\nQ4;  Q49  Cag C44 as 11 11 I\n41 0 0 0 O0 12.434\n\nSuppose, however, that a single element (say a4;) is set equal to zero in 45.

The interrelatedness functions of industries 1, 2, and 4 is thus\nless for these industries if 4; holds than if 4; holds. Finally, the average interrelated-\nness of the economy is .57 if 4; holds and .61 if 4; holds.\n\nIt is natural, therefore, to look at those industries which exhibit the greatest inter-\nrelatedness, for these are the industries which produce indirect relatedness in other industries.\nTables 3 and 4 classify industries on the basis of their interrelatedness in 1919 and 1929.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 08:24:10 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Our data, of course, use a fixed set of industrial\nclassifications, so that they would necessarily be incapable of showing this differentiation\nprocess. The disintegration process would have the effect of increasing the importance,\nover time, of the diagonal elements of the input-output matrix\u2014the sales by each industry\nto itself. The fact that there is little evidence of vertical chains of the type exemplified\nby the matrix 44, however, does show that vertical disintegration, if it occurs, leads to the\nformation of sub-industries which are sufficiently similar to be aggregated together, when\nthe economy is presented as an input-output model of moderate order (Leontief's data\nrefer to 41 industries other than final output and consumption). It is not clear, of course,\nwhat would be true if the number of industries considered separately was substantially\nincreased.!\n\n5. We may now consider the empirical connections between diversification and inter-\nrelatedness. This connection may be viewed either in terms of the economy as a whole\nor of particular industries. Table 1 gives a frequency distribution of the elements of the\n1919 and 1929 technological order matrices, and the values of the interrelatedness function\nfor these matrices. Interrelatedness increased from .444 to .536 in the decade. The increase\nin diversification was equal to .097. That is, it exceeded the increase in interrelatedness,\nbecause there was a small decrease (.005) in indirect relatedness in the economy.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTechnological Interrelatedness in the U.S. Economy, 1919 and 1929\n\nOrder of Number of Elements of Technological Order Matrix\nInterrelatedness 1919 1929\n\nIf individual industries are grouped according to their interrelatedness characteristics\n(Table 2), it may be observed that on balance, indirect relatedness appears to have been\ndistributed among industries in 1929 in much the same way as it had been in 1919, although\ndiversification had clearly increased. This circumstance is partly the result of the nature\nof indirect relatedness: an industry may have very little indirect relatedness either because\nit has no relatedness of any kind with other industries; or because it has direct relatedness\nwith almost all industries (is almost completely diversified). On the average, the index of\nindirect relatedness is small in industries where diversification is either very small (under .1)\nor very large (above .7).\n\n! Our findings are not independent of the amount and kind of aggregation used by Leontief. When\nindustries are combined (as they must always be in empirical work) to form an input-output matrix of\nmanageable size, a matrix 4 of order n is replaced by a matrix 4 of smaller order s. Each element of 4\ncorresponds to a block of 4, and it will be non-zero if any element of the block differs from zero. A power\n\nof \u00c1, say 4, has elements a(Q. These will be non-zero if it is possible to find any product aix ax; (a4\u2014 1) not equal\n\nto zero (k \u2014 1,...,5). Thecorresponding portion of the matrix 4t is a sum of products of blocks AG DA kj.\n\nEven if both blocks contain a non-zero element, however, it is possible for the product to be equal to zero.\nHence the qth power of 4 may have fewer zero elements than the qth power of A4 has zero blocks; in any\nevent it cannot have more. Consequently, the more aggregation is carried out upon 4 (the smaller s is,\nrelative to 7), the lower one should expect the calculated order of interrelatedness of the matrix to be;\nthat is, the more closely interrelated the economy will appear to be. For lack of information about the\nactual importance of this fact, we cannot discuss it further.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 08:24:10 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

It may easily be verified that\nevery finite power of a matrix of the form of 4; is a matrix of the same form (as regards\nzero and non-zero blocks) as 43. Moreover, 4; itself is clearly reducible. Technological\ninterrelatedness does not exist between certain pairs of industries, and hence certain in-\ndustries show zero interrelatedness. However, the industries in the third block exhibited\nnon-zero technological interrelatedness. ^ The corresponding part of the order matrix\ncontained no term of order exceeding three. Thus either a pair of industries turned out to\nbe technologically unrelated or they turned out to have interrelatedness of 1/3, 1/2 or 1.\nInterrelatedness of order three between industries ; and j corresponds to the following\nsituation: industry i has a customer, industry r, whose customer industry s sells directly\nto industry j, so that aira;5as; is positive. None of the industries i, r, s, j, of course is a\nfinal output or final demand industry.\n\nThese results rule out certain hypotheses about vertical integration in the economy.\nA. common form of these hypotheses is that industries may be grouped into '' stages \"\nrepresenting well-defined production and distribution processes. For instance, (1) extractive\nindustries sell to (2) basic processing industries, which sell to (3) fabricating industries,\nwhich sell to (4) distributors, which sell to (5) ultimate consumers. If this hypothesis were\nvalid, it would be possible to arrange the closed input-output matrix in the form:\n\n0 4,0 0 0\n0 0 44,0 0\nA,\u2014|0 0 O0 A40\n0.0 0 O0 A,\n\u00c1g s s A Ass\n\nThe order matrix corresponding to this closed system is given by B,:\n\nB,\u2014]|33312\n\nThe technological matrix corresponding to 4, is obtained by deleting the last row and the\nlast column.

But B,, the corresponding closed\norder matrix, contains terms of order 3, 4, and 5, whereas empirical order matrices contain\nonly terms of order 1 and 2. This circumstance is enough to permit rejection of the hypo-\nthesis.\n\nThis result permits a comment on the *' vertical disintegration hypothesis \".

In contrast to the matrix of the closed system, the tech-\nnological matrix need not be irreducible in theory; in fact the matrices under study are\nreducible.?

                    "Economic Interrelatedness\n\nThis paper associates with every input-output matrix an order matrix, and defines for\nevery submatrix of the order-matrix it defines an interrelatedness function. For certain\nclasses of submatrices, the interrelatedness function has an economic interpretation. On\nclosed input-output matrices, where irreducibility is of theoretical importance, irreduci-\nbility is associated with a condition on the interrelatedness function. On open input-\noutput matrices, the function is a way of interpreting certain propositions found in econo-\nmic history. Interrelatedness is also associated with diversification (and hence speciali-\nzation) in a simple way. It is empirically possible (using Leontief's data for the U.S.\neconomy in 1919 and 1929) to examine the way in which interrelatedness has changed over\ntime, and to make predictions about hypotheses such as technological convergence, which\nhave so far been difficult to subject to empirical analysis. Thus the interrelatedness function\nis a useful measure in a number of economic contexts.\n\nIt is assumed that readers are familiar with Leontief's closed system, which consists\nof two matrix equations (actually identities) :\n\n0 \u2014 (4 \u2014 E)Q,\n\n0 \u2014 (Ar \u2014 E)P. .\nHere 0 is a vector of zeros, E is the identity matrix, Q and P are (equilibrium) vectors of\nquantities, and prices, respectively. The matrix A has elements a;;, referring to the quantity\nof commodity ; that is used to produce one unit of commodity j. A7 is the transpose of\nA. These equations are said to be identities, in that all output is allocated to some industry\n(including producers! savings). Leontief's hypothesis is that the matrix A is independent\nof P and Q, and (for short periods of time) it is constant. The elements of A are, in the\nnature of things, non-negative.\n\n1l. . If A has non-negative elements, then A4?, 43, . . . also have non-negative elements.\nIn particular, if we consider an arbitrary power AX of A, then the elements a? of A*\nwill be sums of products of elements of 4.

In such mixed qualitative-quantitative models, a basic\nquestion that may be raised is that of the extent to which, within the framework of such\nmodels (including the quantitative restrictions), qualitative analysis can provide answers\nto questions concerning stability and comparative statics theorems for the models. By\nproviding tools for handling the purely qualitative case, Lancaster and Gorman have\ntaken the essential first step in the analysis of comparative statics theorems for such mixed\nmodels. Since sign patterns satisfying the Lancaster-Gorman theorems lead to complete\ncomparative statics information in the purely qualitative case, their conditions are sufficient\n(but not, of course, necessary) for complete comparative statics information when quanti-\ntative restrictions are imposed. Similarly, the conditions given in this paper, since they\nhold for arbitrary values of the elements of the matrices under consideration, provide\nsufficient conditions for stability for a wide range of restrictions on the values of the\nelements of the matrix. Thus, for example, any matrix of partial derivatives of excess\ndemand functions with sign pattern satisfying Theorem 3 is stable when Walras' Law and\nhomogeneity of excess demand functions are imposed, given a proper choice of signs for\nrows and columns associated with the numeraire commodity.!\n\nWhile there are some immediate applications of the Lancaster-Gorman theorems and\nthe theorems of this paper (particularly to macroeconomic models), the basic justification\nfor work in purely qualitative systems, we feel, is in providing a beginning in the analysis\nof qualitative methods in the more complex mixed qualitative-quantitative models. In the\nfurther work that needs to be done, stability analysis and comparative statics analysis\nmight well be even more closely related than the results of this paper indicate. For example,\nan interesting open question at the present time is that of necessary and sufficient con-\nditions on the sign patterns of a matrix for complete or partial comparative statics infor-\nmation when the only quantitative information is that provided by the assumption (not\nproof, as in this paper) that equilibrium is stable, i.e., what is the scope of Samuelson's\ncorrespondence principle in such a mixed qualitative-quantitative model?

The main\nconclusions may be summarized as follows:\n\n(1) The total effect of a reduction of interest on prices can be split up into two com-\nponents, one of which arises from the fall in interest rates in the course of time whereas\nthe other is related to the lower level of interest.\n\n(2) The first component, connected with the name of Cassel, can practically be relied\nupon to work in the classical direction, but\u2014except for possible lag phenomena\u2014it is\nlimited to the time when interest rates are actually going down. It is thus essentially of a\nshort-term nature and gives no support to Wicksell's propositions.\n\n(3) What Wicksell and other proponents of the classical doctrine seem to have had\nin mind is rather the effect of lower levels of interest. It is not certain, however, that this\neffect will work in the classical sense. As a consequence, it is quite conceivable that at\nlower levels of interest prices will finally be lower than if rates had been maintained at a\nhigher level. This can be attributed to the fact that in the long run lower interest rates\nmay stimulate the expansion of capacity more than they stimulate demand.\n\n(4) While from a theoretical point of view, these unclassical possibilities may be\nsomewhat disturbing and perhaps intriguing, their significance for monetary policy is\nlimited in several ways. First, aside from quite unlikely cases, they only apply to situations\nwhere prices are falling to begin with; for situations of rising prices the rule of the classical\ndoctrine is hardly weakened. Second, even if prices are falling, unclassical reactions only\nappear in the case of capital-poor economies with relatively high interest and low growth\nrates. Third, if interest rates are used as a short- or medium-term instrument, the direction\nof their change being reversed every few years, any unclassical reactions would tend to be\nwashed out in the long run and the picture would be dominated by the Cassel-effects which\nare sure to work in the classical direction.\n\nUniversity of Z\u00fcrich J\u00dcRG NIEHANS.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCES\n\n[1] Beckmann, Martin.

            "found": "ON TWO SECTOR GROWTH MODELS 345\n\nIf we subtract n, the rate of increase in the labour supply from both sides of this expression\nwe obtain a differential equation in K, the capital-labour ratio. \"This equation is well\ndefined for any initial conditions. For evidently the ratio of expenditure on consumption\nto the desired value of capital is a constant and hence the arguments of (i) with minor\nmodifications apply. Existence of a steady state is proved as before.\n\nWe may now also note that the production assumptions can be made less restrictive\nfor this model. What is required is a convex production set, which is additive, contains\nthe origin and does not permit the output of anything in positive amount without input.\nWe may write the members of this set as the vectors x, the positive components of which\nmeasure outputs of the two goods the n:gative components of which measure inputs.\nWith any momentary equilibrium there will be associated some efficiency price vector v\nsuch that if x is a momentary equilibrium vector vx 7 vx' all feasible x'. Of course there\nmay be a whole cone of these v's satisfying this inequality, but the strict convexity of the\ncommunity indifference curves ensures that only one of these will be compatible with\nmomentary equilibrium. None of these postulates exclude the possibility of joint produc-\ntion. The Inada condition may now be stated in terms of the efficiency prices of the capital\ninput. Keeping labour constant one requires that this price should go to zero as k goes to\ninfinity and that it should go to infinity as k goes to zero.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nIt is evident that in all these constructions the condition that the equilibrium at a\nmoment of time be unique is crucial. The rest of the story is really concerned with ensuring\nthat there is a steady state with positive factor prices. But the assumptions required to\nestablish uniqueness of momentary equilibrium are all terrible assumptions. People differ\nin the assets they hold in their age and, alas, in their tastes. Simple proportional savings\nassumptions no doubt have their place in political arithmetic but. seem rather desperate\nat this level. Moreover assuming all these uniqueness problems away prevents us from\nfacing the interesting, although admittedly philosophical, question, of what is supposed to\nhappen when the assumptions do not hold. After all some decisions are taken at any\nmoment of time.\n\nIt seems likely that the way out of many of these problems is to examine paths which\nare not equilibrium paths. Of course this will be a good deal more difficult. It will also\nmean that we shall want to abandon the malleability assumption. There is a great deal to\nlearn.\n\nChurchill College, F. H.

The complements of these proportions measure the cases which\nare probably inconsistent with Lancaster's hypothesis of upwards bias. There may be\nsome small upwards bias for half of the cases, but it seems very difficult to claim that 5,\nis necessarily always biased upwards.\n\nMoreover, even in those years when 5, may be biased upwards the differences between\nthe estimates may be too small to be statistically significant. Durbin [2] suggests a measure\nof the sampling variation of (b, \u2014 5\"), which is used to compute the standard error\nS(b, \u2014 b') in Tables I, II and III. In the present context, however, 5, can exceed 5' so\nS(b, \u2014 b') is calculated for both positive and negative differences. Consequently, two-\ntailed / tests are used to test the significance of the observed differences at the five per\ncent level. In only five out of the forty-four cases are there significant differences between\nb, and 5' and in four of them ^, \u2014 b'. These results are inconsistent with Lancaster's hypo-\nthesis. In only one case (Table III, 1958) is b, biased upwards to any significant extent.\nThe overwhelming majority of cases is consistent with the implicit assumption in [6) that\nb, is not significantly biased.\n\n6. The stability of 5, over time observed in [6] is confirmed when the analysis is\nextended to two more samples and up to 1963. Presumably transitory components of\nX, Y and Z are caused by changes in costs, prices, demands, taxes, import controls and\na host of other economic and political ** shocks \". There have been very many *' shocks \"\nover the period 1949-63 and yet they do not appear to have changed the business savings\nincome-elasticity. If transitory influences on business savings policies are unimportant\nthere is no need to introduce a normal income hypothesis. This conclusion reached in [6]\nis subject to two more qualifications.\n\nIn [6] the view was taken that dividend-restraint ended in 1951 when wage-restraint\nended, though it is recognized that lip-service was paid to both policies after 1951. Prais\n[14] has claimed that dividend-restraint continued throughout the period 1949-53 which,\nif correct, could explain the stability of 5b, observed in [6]. Most economists would not\naccept the view that the observed stability of 5, 1949-63 was due to dividend-restraint, but\nit must be admitted that anyone who thinks that dividend-restraint continued up to 1963\ncan still use this argument to explain the stability of 5. A further check on the importance\nof transitory components is being made using pre-war data.\n\nThe second qualification is that the stability claim is based on a preliminary inspection\nof Tables I, II and III and this conclusion may not be able to withstand statistical tests\nof time-stability. Menges and Diehl [13] have described a series of such tests and they are\nbeing applied to the pre-war and post-war data.\n\n7. Subject to these and other qualifications mentioned in [6], the conclusion to draw\nfrom the evidence above is that the least squares estimates of the business savings income-\nelasticity are quite satisfactory. Normal income models of business saving [3], [15] are\nadmittedly attractive, but until further evidence is presented there seems no reason for not\nusing a least squares model. If this argument is correct, it will be permissible to develop\na more sophisticated least squares model of business saving than the one used here, but\nthere will still be no need to bother about errors in variables.\n\nUniversity of Bristol.

Q.E.D.\n\nCorollary f there is no technological progress in the consumption good industry and\nthe technological innovation in the capital good industry is either nil or Hicks' neutral,\nthen the overall capital-labor employment ratio remains constant.\n\nIt may be important to notice that, under this circumstance, capital is growing at an\naccelerated rate (K/K \u2014 0) due to (32), but labor employment is growing even faster than\ncapital. Thus the existence of an unlimited supply of labor appears to be an advantage\nin a sense for a developing country.? If technological progress is of Hicks' labor-saving\ntype, then the conclusion should be modified. As this process of declining capital-labor\nemployment ratio continues, the economy will sooner or later exhaust its surplus labor\nand reach a turning point to a full employment economy.\n\nThe above theorem 7 may correspond to Fei & Ranis' recent interesting study [16],\nin which they observed, for example, that the industrial capital-labor ratio was declining ?\nin the course of Japanese economic development, especially during the phase of unlimited\nsupply of labor in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century.*\n\nUniversity of Manchester.

This is, of course, true provided that the assumptions are not too seriously violated. For example,\nthe quality of labor, which is recruited from an *' unlimited supply \" source, must be homogeneous. This\ncan be attained by the adoption of a proper education system, etc. (The proper education system also has\na shifting effect on the production functions.) The existence of active entrepreneurs is also important, for they\nsearch all investment opportunities by a shrewd economic calculation, which will make our saving \u2014\ninvestment equation (15) meaningful. It is generally observed that both of the above were true in the case\nof the Japanese economic development.\n\n3 See Fei and Ranis [16], especially table 3, p. 290.\n\n* Capital-saving (or *'labor-using \") nature of the innovation (see theorem 7) in the course of the\nJapanese economic development was also emphasized by Fei and Ranis.

Small firms relied much\nless on this source for their growth.\n\nTo conclude, therefore, one of the reasons why Large firms have been growing at a\nfaster proportional rate than Small firms during the later part of the 1950's is due to the\ninfluence of amalgamations. This, however, is not the complete explanation as the net\nassets of Large and Medium size firms gain equally from acquisitions but the former still\ngrow at a faster overall rate.\n\nOne possibility is that Large firms tend to be less conservative than Small firms and\nrevalue their assets more frequently, and so give the impression, misleading as it may be,\nof faster growth. Another possible explanation is that large companies are finding it easier\nto obtain money on the Stock Exchange (the Board of Trade having shown they are heavy\nusers), and so obtain economies of scale in finance and advantages in growth. A further\nexplanation could be that economies of scale in marketing and production (especially now\nthat technology is advancing at such a pace), are outweighing disadvantages of size.

Keynesian business cycle\nanalysis is within the ** real capital \" camp. So are most of the recent growth models, for\nexample, the whole class of models based on the Cobb-Douglass production function.\n\nThe observed, historical primacy of the real capital notion in business cycle theory and\ngrowth is not without exception.

We have not considered questions concerning the existence of second\nbest solutions, whether a market mechanism can achieve such solutions, or whether solutions\nvia markets are stable.! These topics are themselves large enough to be subjects of papers.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nIn the discussion of this paper the following type of maximization problem was\nencountered.\n\nmax F(x)\ns. t.

Let x* be a solution to the maximization problem for given values\nof the parameters \u00c0*. Also associated with x* is a vector of multipliers * \u2014 (M5, ..., M).\nIf a maximizing solution exists for a specified value of \u00c0, then we obtain a vector of values\n(x*, A*). Thus the maximization problem determines a mapping from a subset of E* to\na subset of E^ x E\". We are interested in solutions which have the property that \u00c0* \u2014 Af\nwhere i \u20ac I, and I is an index set.\nIn order to clarify the above discussion we present the following example:\n\nminimize x?-4y-[z\nsubject to: (D x-yc4z-1\n(2) 3x 4-3y \u2014 \u00c0 \u2014 0.\nLetting 4 be the Langrangean multiplier for (1) and yu for (2), we obtain:\n2x \u20143\u2014 3. \u2014 0\n2y\u20144\u2014 3, \u20140\n227\u2014320 \u2014\nxctyctz-l\n3x 4 3y \u2014 \u00c0 \u2014 0.\nAdding the constraint \u00c0 \u2014 2 and solving the entire system we obtain:\n(x*, y*, z*, p*, \u00bb*, M) \u2014 (5, $5, $, \u2014 ie $9)\nand a minimum of i4.

It is illustrated\nin Figure 14 for the case in which none of the two countries is specialized at the balanced\n\nFiGURE 14\n\nstate. The time path of capital accumulation, starting with position 4, is described by a\ndotted curve. At the initial position 4, country \u00ab is less abundant in capital endowment\nthan country f, so that country \u00ab is specialized to investment goods and imports consump-\ntions goods from country B. As the process of capital accumulation starts, the aggregate\ncapital labor-ratio in country \u00ab is increased while it is decreased in country 8 until position\nBis reached. The price of the investment good is declining during this period and exports\nof investment goods from country \u00ab to country B continue to increase. At position B,\nthe capital-labor ratio in country 8 turns to increase. Country \u00ab is specialized to investment\ngoods until point C is reached where it starts to produce both goods. The path eventually\ngets to point D where the capital-labor ratio in country 8 again begins to decline.

It seems\nunlikely that this matter will be cleared up in models in which A X; and U; are assumed to\nbe independent of each other and of AW.\n\n(iv) The residuals from the fitted equation were correlated with the level of unemploy-\nment as a rough test of whether demand impinges directly on prices as well as indirectly\nvia costs. There is no evidence of a direct relationship of this kind, the 7? between the\nresiduals and U is 0.0027.\n\nThe Unionisation Equation\n\n(i) A given change in the level of unionisation lagged one year reduces the current rate\nof change of unionisation by 11 7; of the change in the level of unionisation.\n\n(ii) The rate of change of prices has an immediate effect on AT which is approximately\n50 9, of the change in AP. The coefficient on AP,-, has the wrong sign.\n\n(ii) The level of profit lagged six-months is a significant explanatory variable. How-\never, its effect seems to be very small. A given change in the level of profits results in a\nchange in the index of pushfulness which is 107; of the change in profits.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIt has been shown that an index of trade union pushfulness namely the rate of change\nof unionisation is closely associated with the rate of change of money wage rates and that this\nindex cannot be explained by the level and/or the rate of change of the demand for labour.\nThis result is not upset in the jointly estimated model of Part 3. Our hypothesis that the\nrate of change of unionisation is the index of the causal variable in the observed relationship\nis therefore consistent with the data at this level of aggregation. Moreover, excess demand\nas measured by the level of unemployment does not appear to have made a significant\ncontribution to the explanation of the variance in wage rates over the period 1921-1961.\n\nWhat is now required is an analysis of the data at a lower level of aggregation. For\none thing, some of the implications of our hypothesis about the role of the union variable\ncan only be tested in disaggregated studies. For another, it is important to know how the\nrate of change of unionisation, the level of unemployment and the rate of change of money\nwage rates are related to each other in a particular sector and in all other sectors. For\nexample, the aggregate relationship between AW and AT' and the lack of correlation between\nU and AT are consistent with either of two conflicting hypotheses. Suppose wage rates\nwere to rise in some sector. Let it be each union's policy to prevent any widening of inter-\nindustry wage differentials. Then this wage change would make unions in other sectors\nmore militant and, if they successfully negotiate wage adjustments, a rise in aggregate\nAW and AT would be observed. Now, all this would be compatible with either an increase\nin demand for labour in the sector where the wage rise originated or with an increase in\nunion militancy which was independent of demand conditions.\n\nWe hope to report on investigations into these matters at a later date.\n\nLondon.

A major shortcoming, for example, is that the study is confined to\naggregate manufacturing.

A sectoral study is planned for the\nfuture.\n\nThe major finding of this study to date, in my judgment, is that a model that purports\nto discuss the wage-determination process must have some mechanism for differentiating\nbetween the influence that experienced and qualified workers have on the wage decisions\nof employers and that which inexperienced or lesser-skilled labor has on these decisions.\nThis study indicates that the quit rate, a worker behavioral variable that is also a proxy\nfor labor demand, does make the distinction between those workers that can affect wage\nchanges and those who cannot.\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley.

Several observers have shown the difficulty of distinguishing\nbetween these two types of inflation [21], [28], [33]. The key distinction between the two\nmechanisms is not whether prices will respond to demand changes. Clearly, they respond\nunder either process. But under the demand mechanism, prices should be stable as long as\ndemand and supply remain in balance and basic costs do not change. Under the oligopoly\nmechanism, prices can rise without excess demand, and the major driving force of the\ninflationary process is the interaction of target-return pricing and profit-based wage\ndemands. While the oligopoly mechanism is likely to lead to inflationary troubles at a lower\nlevel of demand, it may also have a stabilizing effect in periods of excess demand, when the\ninsensitivity of prices to excess demand will lead to a less than full exploitation of the market\nposition. Empirical investigation of the relative significance of the two mechanisms should\nlook for the response of price changes to objective measures of excess demand to sub-\nstantiate the demand mechanism, and to changes in standard unit costs to substantiate the\noligopoly mechanism.\n\n(6) The oligopoly mechanism advanced here also refutes the widely held view [33],\n[28], that on the cost-push side, only wage-push can lead to a sustained inflationary process,\nsince only a repeated increase in business profit targets could lead to continued inflation.\nIt has been shown here that even a constant target rate of profit can produce a rate of\nwage increase in excess of the productivity trend, and with target-return pricing, this wage\nincrease is passed on in higher prices, maintaining the profit rate, and also maintaining the\nrate of wage increases. The oligopoly mechanism is neither a wage-push nor a profit-push\ntheory. It is the interaction of prices, profits and wages which maintains the inflationary\nprocess, and it is the existence of monopoly elements in both factor and product markets\nwhich leads to this result.\n\nHarvard University.

Not only does he have what freedom the\npresent multivariate form of the relation offers, but also the possibility of shifting the whole\nrelation in a desirable direction.\n\nThe Kennedy-Johnson Administration has in effect tried to cause such a shift through\nits wage-price guidelines, first advocated in 1962. These comprise a set of suggestions for\nwage behavior which on balance would keep wage increases in line with aggregate product-\nivity gains, coupled with corresponding suggestions for price behavior in individual in-\ndustries based on industry productivity gains. The guidelines are enforced only to the\nextent that pressure from the Administration, when applied, has any impact on individual\nbargaining negotiations and price decisions. At various times, both business and labor have\ndenounced the guidelines\u2014at first because they were not understood, but more generally\non the grounds that only the wage or price portion was being stressed. And many economists\nhave considered them a useless attempt to tamper with inexorable market forces. It is\ndoubtless premature to point to the overpredictions starting in 1962 as evidence that the\nguidelines policy has had an impact. Again, the test will come when substantially higher\noperating rates are reached.\n\nFinally, the present way of looking at the determinants of wage changes suggests the\nstandard classifications of wage push and demand pull inflations can be refined and\nexpanded. Armed with a regression, such as equation (9), one can look to residuals for\nevidence of the source of inflationary pressures. Significant underestimates of wage changes\noffer an accurate definition of wage push conditions. Rapid wage changes that are in line\nwith the predicting equation but associated with extraordinary profit rates suggest a fairly\nprecise meaning for a profit push inflation. While demand pull could properly describe a\nsituation in which wage changes are in line with the predicting equation and other ex-\nplanatory variables are in some normal relation to the unemployment rate.\n\nUniversity of Minesota.

However, it is obvious\nthat there is substantial overlap between occupational levels and other aspects of social\nstatus. Thus unskilled workers include disproportionately large numbers of negroes,\nimmigrants, rural-urban migrants, youths and persons with little schooling. Therefore,\nvariations in the skill margin reflect corresponding variations in the relative earning\nposition of these groups vis-a-vis those more favored, and the paradigm of the ladder has\nimplications for social mobility.\n\nIdentifying skill levels with social classes pre-supposes a broad consensus among\nemployers, paralleling the status hierarchy, as to the order of preference in selecting job\napplicants. It also implies substantial correlation between educational attainment and this\norder of preference. These two conditions are and long have been met in the United States\nand in most other places as well. It is only in rare cases, such as Jews and Huguenots, that\none finds an inverse relation between educational attainment and position in the consensual\norder of hiring preference.\n\nThe relation of age to the hiring preference hierarchy calls for a brief comment. So\nfar as manual workers are concerned, the young are likely to be only partially trained\nand/or not yet fully committed to full-time year-round wage earning and hence more\nlikely to find unskilled than skilled jobs. The managerial and/or the professional ladders\nare largely non-competing with the manual; but in all of them, the young largely overlap\nwith new entrants and as such play the role of inferior applicants relative to those previously\nhired.!

Trade can only be diverted to union members. The net tax\nflow would be maximised for the union as a whole (unless union governments had to agree\nto pay over tax proceeds to external governments). And the resulting system, that a\nproduct was taxed at the same rate in the union whether it originated anywhere inside or\noutside the union, would accord with one philosophy of the role of taxation in a tax\nunion.!\n\nIn such a case, what becomes of the relation between a tax union and a customs union?\nThe customs union essentially discriminates on a product from different sources whilst the\naimed-for tax union as above does not. Clearly, the effects of setting up a tax union can\nbe analysed in similar terms to the formation of a customs union, but have we not arrived\nat something essentially different?\n\nWe have, but it is not some *' free-trade-equivalent\" system.

Nevertheless, the regression\nand correlation coefficients that are obtained are usually significant at high levels of sig-\nnificance. ?\n\nA common procedure of the cross section studies is to fit gross fixed capital expenditure\nas a proportion of gross fixed assets against percentage change in sales with a distributed\nlag. Those that do not use this form still work in terms of some ratio form. The use of\nthe percentage change or other ratio form does have the advantage in cross section analysis\nof removing heteroscedasticity as automatic adjustment is made for firm size.\n\nThe cross section studies find long distributed lags suggesting slow adjustment. lt is\ninteresting that accelerator effects seem to be concentrated in just those firms we should\nexpect\u2014those with rising sales and more rapid growth.3\n\nIII\n\nThe conclusion that can be reached from an examination of statistical work on the\nacceleration principle is that crude formulations and inappropriate methods of analysis\nhave often yielded bad results but more sophisticated models and methods have almost\ninvariably produced results favourable to the acceleration principle.\n\nThe view is widely held that the statistical evidence is unfavourable to the acceleration\nprinciple. This popular view should be rejected.\n\nUniversity of Birmingham. Davip SMyrH.\n\n!

The only\nassumption I have made about workers' saving behaviour is that they save a constant\nproportion of their income (whether from wages or from profits), and not of total savings.\nOf course, in the long run, the ratio of S; to S; will tend to become a constant. But this\nis no assumption: it is a long-run equilibrium result.

According to our analysis, the bias against the develop-\nment of industries with mutual external economies implicit in laissez-faire is itself a powerful\ncause of underdevelopment. Hence estimates of the strength of structural inter-dependence\nin an underdeveloped economy on the basis of data relating to existing industries tends\nto be misleading. Contrafactual conditionals cannot be reflected in observational data!\n\n(ii) A more genuine analytic limitation is that our analysis requires the strict assump-\ntion of mutual interdependence. Thus, it would not help in explaining the absence of key\nindustries in underdeveloped countries.\n\n(ii) Lastly, the analysis abstracts from difficulties in the use of the game-theoretic\napproach itself and in particular from those concerning the interpretation of the numbers\nforming the pay-off matrix.\n\nV. \"This paper has been concerned with decision-criteria only in so far as these bear on\nthe balanced growth controversy. However, the approach discussed above has certain\nmethodological implications for decision theory. It will suffice to point out here that the\n** reasonableness \" of ' reasonable \" axioms which determine the choice of a decision\ncriterion may often be illusory.

More recently,\nin a discussion of ** the many features of corporate aims \"', Professor Shubik has suggested\nthat ** we can select one feature and assume that the firm wishes to maximize it, subject to\nboundary conditions which require that the other corporate aims meet certain specifications \"\n[10, p. 368]. Shubik's procedure is validated by a utility function for the firm which can\nonly be of the L*-ordering form.\n\nSome interesting lines of research, both theoretical and empirical, are easily suggested\nby such a utility function. In the theory of oligopoly, for instance, one could represent\nthe effects of rival actions by the parameter ^ of our example. The firm's choice is fully\ndeterminate in every case, and along the stretch where the profit objective is ** inferior \",\na reduction in the number of firms\u2014which shifts the transformation surface or attainable\nset outwards\u2014leads to the (unusual) result that profits are decreased. Quite a number of\nsolutions to the oligopoly problem are indicated, depending on the conditions of each\nsituation, since one no longer assumes a single common objective which firms are supposed\nto have. Looking at the internal organization of the firm, it would be interesting if we could\nidentify particular individuals with specific objectives and see the relative influence of each\nin decision making at different times. It may happen that the financial officer has a domin-\nating influence when some conventional ratio is below its acceptable level. He might,\nfor instance, exert a restraining influence on the sales manager when the current ratio is\nbelow par. Such a situation would be explained by L*-ordering.\n\nEmpirical research on the firm's behaviour, oriented along the lines of this hypothesis,\ncould determine its usefulness and validity. From the standpoint of theory, the maximi-\nsation of some final objective in a long run model of the firm could rationalize the particular\nconstraint or satisfactory levels of prior objectives. This idea is immediately suggested by\nBaumofl's growth-maximising model which requires some specific profit rate and pay-out\nfor optimality. Maximising the nth objective then determines the optimum levels of the\nfirst n \u2014 1 objectives, which automatically makes them mutually consistent even when\nsome are instrumental in the promotion of others.\n\nJos\u00c9 ENCARNACI\u00d3N, JR.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Baumol, W.

To the extent that money wages resist downward pressure\nfrom excess labour supply, involuntary unemployment will be more severe and marginal\ncosts to the firm will initially remain constant. The commodity market adjustment process\nwill be even more long and drawn-out as this added impetus to lower prices is withheld.\n\nIn the commodity market, approach toward the new equilibrium will reduce the dis-\nparity between actual commodity supply and that which would prevail, at any given price,\nin a perfectly competitive equilibrium. The new equilibrium level of price is that at which\ncommodity supply will equal demand under conditions of perfect competition to all firms.\nThe transitory monopoly powers of the firms will have passed when prices have converged\nto this new level. At the same time, elimination of downward sloping product demand\ncurves will have also eliminated the difference between the value of labour's marginal\nproduct to the firm and its marginal revenue product, hence the demand curve for labour\nwill have returned to its original position\u2014to Patinkin's labour demand curve. Finally,\nwith an unchanged labour supply curve, the real wage rate must, unless money wages are\nentirely rigid, return to the original equilibrium level (w/p)o, with lower commodity prices\nand a lower money wage rate, but with the same quantity of commodities and labour\ndemanded as in the previous equilibrium. Regardless of the initial rigidities in the money\nwage rate, the force of reduced nominal marginal costs must be added sooner or later to\nthat of product market imperfections as a mechanism which forces commodity prices\ndown to the new equilibrium level.\n\nAt the end of the adjustment, then, the comparative statics result of Patinkin's analysis\nhas been achieved. But the use of temporary competitive imperfection as the adjustment\nmechanism following a reduction in commodity demand has allowed the development of\nan internally consistent system, eliminating the need both for Patinkin's distinction between\nactual and desired supply and for Cross and Williamson's accumulation of unintended\ninventories in perfect competition. We cannot agree with Patinkin who summarized his\nunemployment model saying, ** we can see that involuntary unemployment can exist even\nin a system of perfect competition and wage and price flexibility \" [5, p. 220]. Neither\ncan wage rigidities be avoided as the basic cause of involuntary unemployment nor can\ncommodity market disequilibria and perfect competition coexist in a fully consistent\nPatinkin model.\n\nD.

This calls for some comment. In both\nyears 1951 and 1952 real disposable income fell by 3.4 9, and 1.7 9;, so this had caused a\ndecrease in the share of saving. Next income distribution could not have had any effect\nfor the rise in the share of saving, because the proportion of capital income,of all consumers'\nincomes increased 1952 by only 0.5 7; and was even 0.8 7 lower than 1950. So our explan-\nation for the sharp rise in the share of saving 1952 is that the big inflation during 1951\nwhich continued in 1952 had lowered the real value of consumers! bonds so much that\nthey had to compensate part of the loss by saving more. If monthly or quarterly statistics\nwere available years 1950-1953 would shed very interesting light on our problem.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn an analysis based on the maximisation of utility we have found that the amount\nof bonds compared to savings is a decisive factor in the response of saving to price level\nchanges. This is because the rise in prices decreases the real value of bonds and consumers\ntry to compensate for the loss by saving more. If the amount of bonds is many times the\namount of saving, as in the case of the United Kingdom, the increase in saving needed to\ncompensate for the loss in the real value of bonds is very great.\n\nThere is also an effect due to the decrease in the real value of income, but the mag-\nnitude of this effect\u2014the income elasticity of saving\u2014probably does not vary so much\nfrom time to time and from country to country as the ratio between bonds and savings.\nIn the United Kingdom the size of the income elasticity to save is small compared to the\nratio between bond and saving. Consequently the estimation of the theoretical result\nshowed that in the United Kingdom the effect of inflation on real consumer saving is\npositive.\n\nStatistical investigation showed that our theoretical result is not contradicted by the\nfacts. The regression coefficient between the change in the share of saving from disposable\nincome and the change in the price level was of the magnitude which was expected from\nthe theory and there is a probability of 0.813 that the sign of the regression coefficient is as\nexpected from the theory.\n\nILARI TYRNI.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 09:19:55 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

But for the same reason, Arrow's majority\ndecision may not be discoverable from voting data. If in a referendum, there are m votes\nfor A, n for B, and p abstentions, what do we decide? At least, m people of course satisfy\nAR;B. But the p abstentions may be consistent with AR;B, or may not; they may for\nexample represent BP;A, i.e., not AR;B, subject to case (IIT). Similarly, the n votes for B\nmay represent not AR;B, or it may not; they may, for example, represent AR;B, and\nBRiA, subject to cases (TI) or (II). Thus, even if we arbitrarily assume the existence of only\ncase (T), or only case (II), or only case (IIT), an element of undecidability will still be there.\n\nFinally, it may also be pointed out that once the relevance of the utility or disutility\nof voting is recognized, it is no longer strictly decidable whether the underlying preference\npattern is single-peaked or not. The difficulty arises as before from the lack of a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between preferences and votes, given that the voters maximize utility, as\ndescribed above, rather than follow rules of thumb. Thus single-peakedness of preferences\nis not generally decidable with voting data.!

The reason\nwhy such a strong result holds for their cases may be explained by the fact that the con-\ndition of uniform convergence of the value preserving paths is satisfied in trivial ways,\nrespectively.\n\n5. In this section we are concerned with McKenzie's theorem. The set of the input\nconfigurations of the normalized value-preserving technologies is an 7 \u20141-dimensional\nsimplex R involved in S. McKenzie assumes that each industry has a strictly convex\ntechnology set. From this, the normalized maximal balanced growth technology is a\nunique combination of n normalized technologies selected, one for each industry, and each\nindustry has only one normalized value-preserving technology.\n\nIf there is a value-preserving path of any order, the path is expressed by the solution\nx! of the difference equation:\n\nyt AB! \u2014 yt[I \u2014 A 4- By,\nxt \u2014 yt] \u2014 A 4- Bl and y! z 0.\n\nHere, each column of matrix B is the normalized input configuration of the value-preserving\ntechnology selected one from each industry, and each column of matrix [/ \u2014 A -- B] is\nits normalized output configuration. McKenzie assumes that (7 4- 4^!) is non-singular,\nand if ^ is a characteristic root of (/ -- 4-3) and | 4| \u2014 1, then A \u2014 1.

But this is somewhat technical and seems to be difficult to be given\na clear economic meaning.\n\nThe value preserving path in McKenzie's case, therefore, satisfies the equation and\nthe assumptions in Example 2, and thus, the condition of uniform convergence of the\nvalue preserving paths is satisfied. From this, we can see that the turnpike property holds\nfor his case, too.\n\nTokyo. KEN-1CHI INADA.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Debreu, G. and I. N. Herstein.

            "found": "168 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nTo see the relations between the pace of technical progress and the length of life of\nplant, we must keep a clear view of what question is being put to the model. Some com-\nplications (which the ingenious reader can supply) are avoided, in the comparison between\neconomies, by postulating that the capital/labour ratio is the same, in each economy, in\nproducing consumer goods as in producing capital goods, and that the degree of mech-\nanisation is everywhere the same.\n\nTo exhibit the neo-neoclassical theorem, I compared two economies with the same rate\nof growth and different propensities to save out of profits. In the economy where the\ncapitalists are more thrifty, the share of profits is less and the life of plant shorter. If we\nintroduce into this picture Arrow's principle of learning by doing (which means, as I inter-\npret it, that a higher ratio of gross investment to stock of capital induces a faster pace of\ntechnical progress) then the more thrifty economy also has a higher rate of growth.\n\nFor Arrow, the ratio of gross investment to income is an independent datum. A higher\nratio (due to greater thriftiness of the economy as a whole) tends to shorten the life of\nplant (by increasing the proportion replaced every year) and consequently to increase the\nrate of growth.\n\nThus, in both models, given the propensity to learn by doing, faster growth is associated\nwith shorter life, but the causation runs the other way.\n\nNow compare economies with the same thriftiness conditions, of which one has a\nhigher propensity than the other to learn by doing. A faster rate of growth entails a higher\nratio of investment to capital (both valued in terms of consumer goods). A given ratio of\ninvestment to income cannot sustain a higher rate of growth unless the capital/income\nratio is lower. Thus, for Arrow, the life of plant must be longer in the faster growing\neconomy.! This entails that the share of gross profits on the latest plant is higher to an\nextent that more than offsets the faster pace of the rise of wages. The rate of profit on\ncapital is thus determined.\n\nIn the Keynesian model, given the thriftiness conditions, the rate of profit is determined\ndirectly by the rate of growth. In the extreme case where savings are equal to profits,\nthe rate of profit on capital is equal to the rate of growth. Now, if the capital/output\nratio is the same in the two economies, the share of net profits in proceeds is proportional\nto the rate of profit on capital, which is identical with the rate of growth. On our assump-\ntions, the share of gross profit is proportional to the share of net profit. Thus the two\nopposing influences balance; the length of life of plant is independent of the rate of growth.\n\nIn the general case, with some consumption out of profits, the rate of profit exceeds\nthe rate of growth (the more so, the smaller the proportion of saving in profits). A higher\nrate of growth is associated with a more than proportionately higher share of profits and\ntherefore a longer life of plant.\n\nThus in no case (on our assumptions) does a faster pace of technical progress lead\nto a shorter life of plant.\n\nFurther complications can be introduced into the analysis if we allow for a choice\nof technique at each stage of the learning process. A faster rate of growth tends to lead\nto a lower degree of mechanisation, as well as longer life; but the degree of mechanisstion\nitself reacts upon length of life, through its effect upon the share of profits in proceeds.\nThis was thc point that Mr Pai Panandikar was struggling to express, but at that time no\none understood the argument sufficiently to see what he was driving at.\n\nCambridge. JOAN ROBINSON.\n\n! Arrow takes the ratio of gross saving to gross income to be given by the propensity to save, instead\nof the proportion of net income saved, as in the formula g \u2014 s/v. This reduces the force of the relation\nbetween saving and the capital/output ratio. His assumption, however, seems rather unnatural.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 10:10:16 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Since zeDp.(y), we have X \u2014 Dp.(y) \u20ac X \u2014 D (z). by A,.\n\nHence\n\nX \u2014 Dp4(y) \u2014 Da(y) \u2014 Dp(y) U D(y) \u20ac De(z) U Dp\u00ab(s)\n\u2014X-D(z)\n\nSince D (y) is connected, it must be contained in either Dp(z) or Dp.(z) for these are\ndisconnected open sets (by 44 and 4,) and their respective intersections with D&(y) would\ngive a decomposition of D&(y) into two non-empty, disconnected sets, contrary to A;.\nSince yeD&(y), and yeDp(z), D&(y) \u20ac Dp(z). In particular, xeD,(y) and hence xeD\u00bb(z),\ni.e. xPz.\n\nSuppose xRy, yIz. Then the lemma is proved if we can show xRz. Suppose not;\nthen zPx, xRy. We restate this as yR-!x, xP-!z. Proceeding as above, but substituting\nR^! for R, we have that yP-!z, i.e. zPy, contrary to hypothesis. q.e.d.\n\nWe can now put the lemma and theorem 2 together to get:\n\nTheorem 3. Suppose Djg(x) closed and connected (4, A4; Dg.(x) closed (4), X a\ntopological space with a countable base, which can be decomposed into non-overlapping\nindifference classes (45): Then a continuous utility representing choice exists.\n\nTheorem 3 gives continuous utility from regularity assumptions alone and with only\nweak reference (4,) to rationality.\n\nNew Haven, Connecticut, and Columbia, Missouri.

            "found": "A STOCHASTIC INCOME MODEL USING OPTIMAL INVENTORY RULES 91\n\nKnowledge of the first two moments of our initial variables is sufficient to characterize\nthe time series in which these variables will be observed. Throughout, discussion has been\nconfined to systems that produce stable means. Thus, monotonically divergent time\nseries will not occur. In neither case is there a possibility of variances which converge\nto zero; consequently, both models produce irregular oscillations around fixed levels.\n\nStandard non-stochastic dynamic models generate various classes of time series: if\nthe roots of a second order system are complex with modulus greater than 1, for example,\nthe time path will diverge and oscillate. The variance of the time series composed of regu-\nlar observations on this time path, will increase without bound through time. A logical\nconcomitant of this implication is that an unbounded variance (such as would be observed\nwith y \u2014 1 in equation (10) ) is a sufficient condition for an explosive oscillatory time path.\nSimilarly, a stable variance is sufficient for regular oscillation with constant amplitude\n(the unit modulus time path). There is, however, a much richer array of time path possi-\nbilities in the stochastic models: there is no limitation to cycles with regular period and\nconstant (or steadily expanding) amplitude, and no dependence upon fortuitous properties\nof characteristic roots to obtain realistic fluctuations. In a paper which also rejects the\nstandard deterministic difference equation approach in favor of a random shock mechanism\n[11], Muth has shown that ** cobweb \"' behaviour can be obtained without the assumption\nof irrational price expectations on the part of farmers, a necessary ingredient in cobwebs\nspun in the absence of random shocks.\n\nVII CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe principal results of this study are (a) ** multiplier-accelerator '\" mechanisms can be\nmodified to accommodate random shocks; the modified mechanism generates series which\nafford a better representation of observable series than do the more familiar non-stochastic\ndifference equation models. (b) The rules for inventory investment prescribed for retailers\nin the new normative literature of managerial economics contain characteristics which\nmay lead to substantial amplification in the inherent variability of the system; so long as\nthe smoothing motive remains attractive to the manufacturer, however, this amplification\nmay in part be offset before it is transmitted to the employment and output decision level.\n(c) Under all conditions that can be foreseen in models which relate consumption to\ncurrent income, systems are stable, i.e., the variance of the income variable converges to\nsome finite level.\n\nChicago.

Write p for\nthe ratio of gross induced dissaving over the whole value of the contracts (that is, the\ndeposits, the new credits, and the finance charges) to new outstandings; p is not neces-\nsarily less than unity. This gross induced dissaving happens when the contracts are made,\nand is a result of people being induced to contract hire-purchase debt on goods which they\nwould not otherwise have bought\u2014a point fully explained in [4] and [5]. Put p' equal to\nthe proportion of instalments that are gross induced savings; these arise because people,\nhad they not bought on hire-purchase, would not have saved all the money they actually\ndid save by repaying their debt. It is assumed that p and p' are constant. Then DX(t),\nthe rate of net dissaving at time ? produced by hire-purchase, is given by\n\nQ4) D(t) \u2014 pZ(t) \u2014 p'R(0).\n\nSuppose the government wants to act so as to have an immediate positive effect on savings:\nThus, while increasing the severity of its controls, it should seek to keep repayments as\nhigh as possible. A glance at Figures 2 and 3 shows that Figure 2 is the more favourable,\nsince here there is an actual increase in repayments during a period equal to the new con-\ntract length. Figure 2 is more probable, as has been shown, if deposit controls are not\nstrengthened but the whole weight is borne by maximum contract lengths, so from this\npoint of view the government would be well advised to act more strongly against them.\nThe same is true of a proposed relaxation in controls for reflationary reasons; a lengthening\nof contracts will be associated with larger immediate net dissaving if there is a drop in\nrepayments, which again suggest that a greater lengthening with a smaller reduction in\ndeposits would be desirable.\n\nThere is no need here to prolong the discussion by analysing all the possible circum-\nstances in which the government might want to change its hire-purchase controls. The\nconsequences of such changes are more complicated than might appear at first sight, so\nthe most suitable technique of control under the circumstances of the moment should be\nselected with some care, and the somewhat lengthy transitions should not be overlooked\nin doing this.!\n\nExeter.

This suggests that the division of the expected expansion of\noutput between the spinning firms may have been the result of a cartel decision. The\ninterpretation of cross section investment relations in a cartelised industry is not at all\nclear. Whatever the limitations of Ueno's cross section estimates, they do still constitute\na contradiction of one of our hypotheses.\n\nVI\n\nWe can now review the evidence presented in this paper. First we have showed that\nthere is a downward bias in accelerator coefficients due to the correlation between technical\nprogress and changes in output. For all the data surveyed the correlation coefficient\nwas positive and always exceeded 0.6; the typical value was about 0.9. \"These data sug-\ngested that there was, therefore, a downward bias of between 307; and 607/.

Secondly, we put forward a much more\ntentative hypothesis\u2014that, due to the different degrees of bias, the cross section accelerator\ncoefficients would be lower than those from time series data. This hypothesis\u2014derived\nfrom an analysis of aggregate data\u2014was tested against various studies which use the firm\nas the unit of observation.

Thus, if we were to select a starting program at random, the probability of\nfinding the optimal program would be 29. This suggests that it is quite likely that the\noptimal program would be observed in several trials with randomly selected starting\nprograms.

Stopping\nrules are discussed in (2). In essence, these stopping rules involve comparison of the value\nof an increase in the total pay-off (together with the probability of such an increase) with\nthe cost of another iteration of the algorithm which finds locally maximal programs.\n\nExperimental computations on problems whose structure is similar to, but more\ncomplicated than that one, using the stochastic algorithm outlined here, and other similar\nones as well, indicate strongly that it is quite likely that an optimal program will be found\nin very few iterations. Not only is an optimal program usually more probable than any\nother, but the probability of observing an optimal program is likely to be large as compared\nwith the probability of all other programs taken together. Some of these experimental\ncomputations are reported in [1]. Their import for the stochastic procedure outlined\nhere is, in summary:\n\n(1) It converges to an optimal program in a finite number of steps with probability\nequal to 1.\n\n(2) The probability that an optimal program will be found in a relatively small number\nof steps is large.\n\n(3) The probability of finding a '' nearly optimal\" partition in a small number (two\nor three) of steps is substantial.\n\nThis stochastic algorithm provides a computationally practical way of finding optimal\nor good programs.

The effect on prices is therefore the\nsame as that of an equi-proportional change in factor endowments of this amount.\n\nGreater neutral improvements in Y's production technology than in X's cause all\nfactor indifference curves to become more intensive in factor A4, since Y is intensive in\nfactor B. The income-price lines of Section III shift towards their respective A4-axes\u2014\nie. the opposite sides of the box\u2014and their stable intersections move so as to cheapen\nfactor B.

This does not strike me as an absurd proposition, mostly because\nall economists accept it daily when they use their theories, few of which are perfect.

It is therefore incompetent to contribute to the analysis of a\nhost of important problems: the one extreme is too narrow to be of great interest;\nthe other, too broad to permit meaningful generalizations.\"'\n\nIf this passage does not say that the theory has no rigorous implications for *' groups,\"\nand hence no *' testable \" implications, I am at a loss to know what it does say. And if\nArchibald can read this passage as implying that the concept of the group is to be rejected\nbecause its assumptions are unrealistic, then there is real doubt that any communication\nbetween Archibald and me is possible.\n\nStigler is unduly generous in his evaluation of Archibald's attack on Chamberlin.\nThis attack is seriously marred by Archibald's failure to distinguish between the meaning\nof the condition ** marginal cost equals marginal revenue \"' and the condition '* average\ncost equals average revenue.\" The first is a maxim of rational conduct by the firm; it\nis something the firm seeks to achieve. The second is not. In a world of specialized\nresources, and certainly in one of monopolies whatever their source, it is either a convention\nof accounting (total costs equal total receipts) or, if defined to be an equilibrium condition,\nis imposed on the firm by the capital market via the revaluation of specialized resources.\nThis is what renders the tangency condition irrelevant to productive adjustments and\nmakes the alleged implications about ''excess capacity and unexploited economies of\nscale \"-\u2014with or without advertising\u2014highly misleading if not downright wrong.\n\nA useful concept of ** capacity \"' should be a technical, production concept, dependent\nof course on factor prices but not on the state of demand. The definition of capacity as\nthe minimum point of the kind of average cost curve for which tangency is relevant is not\nsuch a concept. Let demand rise, but the physical production function and factor prices\nremain unchanged except that the rents earned by the firm's specialized resources increase,\nand the minimum point will shift to the right. Does this shift in the minimum point\nimply a meaningful increase in capacity? \"Of course not. A useful concept of the capacity\nof a particular plant is the output at which short-run marginal costs equal long-run marginal\ncosts: if this is the expected output, the plant will be of the right size in the sense that the\nfirm has no incentive to seek either to enlarge it or make it smaller; it is operating at\n* capacity.\" On this concept of capacity, there is no more reason to expect short-run\nexcess capacity under monopoly than under competition. And this conclusion is of course\nsensible. Why should a firm's position on product markets have any connection with its\nincentive to produce whatever output it does produce as cheaply as possible? Similar\ncaveats are in order for alleged unexploited economies of scale.\n\nBecause average cost concepts offer such pitfalls to the unsophisticated, I have long\nfelt that it might promote a fuller understanding of economic theory to expunge '* average\ncost \" from the textbooks. Stigler took a large step in that direction in his 1952 revision\nof his Theory of Price, and by doing so, added noticeably to the quality of an already\noutstanding work. It is too bad that Archibald apparently learned his economic theory\nfrom the earlier edition.\n\nChicago. MiLTON FRIEDMAN.\n\n!

            "found": "RATE OF PROFIT AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION 279\n\nMr. Kadlor presented his theory of income distribution, he pointed out that the interpre-\ntative value of the theory depends on the Keynesian hypotheses on which it is built. In\nparticular it depends on the crucial hypothesis (post-Keynesian rather than Keynesian)\nthat investment can be treated as an independent variable governed by technical progress\nand population growth.\n\nBut this is not the approach that I should like to take here. Whether we are or whether\nwe are not prepared to accept the model in this behavioural sense, there are important\npractical implications which are valid in any case. I should look, therefore, at the previous\nanalysis simply and more generally as a logical framework to answer interesting questions\nabout what ought to happen if full employment is to be kept over time, more than as a\nbehavioural theory expressing what actually happens.\n\nThe case of a socialist systera, which came last in our analysis, is the most straight-\nforward on this respect. The amount of investments that must be undertaken in order to\nmaintain full employment\u2014once this has been reached\u2014is indeed that which is required\nby technical progress and population growth. And if these investments are carried out,\nthe rate of profit (when uniformly applied) must be equal to the natural rate of growth,\nif total demand is to be such as to allow the full utilization of the productive capacity and\nof the labour force. These results do not depend on any behavioural assumption what-\nsoever. They are true whatever individual behaviour may be; as a simple matter of\nlogical necessity.\n\nIn the case of a capitalist system, the additional problem arises of whether the capital-\nists will or will not spontaneously undertake the amount of investments necessary to cope\nwith the natural possibilities of growth. We may of course discuss at length in this case\nthe circumstances under which equilibrium will or will not be automatically reached.\nBut again we should not let these discussions obscure the conclusions, which are valid in\nany case, about the relations that must be satisfied if full employment is to be kept. 1f\nfull employment is to be maintained, /hat amount of investment must be undertaken.\nAnd if it is undertaken; there is\u2014for any given proportion of capitalists' income which\ntends to be saved!\u2014only one rate of profit, i.e. one distribution of income between profits\nand wages, that keeps the system on the dynamic path of full employment.\n\nThis, it seems to me, is the relevant way to look at the model which has been elaborated\nabove. The whole analysis has been carried out with constant reference to a situation of\nfull employment because full employment is the situation that matters, and that indeed,\nnow-a-days, forms one of the agreed goals of any economic system. The conclusions,\ntherefore, acquire an important practical relevance whether the system is automatically\nable to reach full employment or whether it is not. In the latter case, I should say that\nthey become even more important, because it is then that practical measures have to be\ntaken and it becomes essential to have clear ideas about the direction in which to move.\n\nCambridge. LuiGi L. PASINETTI\n\n! Let me point out that, in this context, the objection so commonly advanced against the theory formu-\nlated in section 1 \u2014namely, that to classify the members of a modern society in only two groups is an arbi-\ntrary and crude simplification\u2014entirely loses its ground. The central outcome of the previous analysis\nhas just been to show that, as far as the determination of the rate of profit is concerned, the distinction\nbetween individuals who save exclusively out of profits and individuals who save out of wages is the only\none that matters.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 10:50:39 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In the absence of this type of instability the degree to which the labor supply\ncurve could be backward bending is rather limited.\n\nThe more interesting case (given that we do not observe instability in the labor market)\nis when 1 \u2014 fr. g\u00bb. When capital stock increases (decreases), the quantity of labor hired\nwill diminish (increase). Hence, the total change in output resulting from a change in\ncapital stock will always be absolutely smaller than the marginal productivity of capital.\nThus, whereas it is usually supposed that the observed inverse incremental capital-output\nratio is higher than the marginal product of capital, if the supply of labor were backward\nbending within the relevant range, the incremental output-capital ratio would be lower\nthan the marginal product of capital!\n\nMoreover, as gy fi, \u2014\u2014 1, the reduction in output attributable to a reduced labor\nforce as capital stock increases will eventually become larger than the marginal product of\ncapital, and total output will move inversely with the supply of capital stock available\n(on the assumption that the services of capital stock are monotonically related to the supply\nof capital) ! When\n\nf LL \u00a3w fuk\n\nfJk\u2014\u2014i- TiL Es\noutput will be invariant with a change in capital stock.\n\nFor any given production function, with stability conditions met, the larger the absol-\nute value of g,, the smaller will be the change in output as capital stock changes.\n\nThree conclusions may be drawn from the foregoing. If it is believed that the supply\nof labor is backward bending, some investment in consumer goods of a kind to increase\nthe preference for income may have a very high yield if a government wishes to raise\nnational income (abstracting from the welfare question involved in consumers' preference\nfor leisure). Secondly, if the supply of labor is significantly negatively sloped, this in\nitself could account for the observed stagnation at low levels of output in some circum-\nstances. \"Thirdly, in all circumstances where the supply of labor is backward bending,\ncomputations of an inverse incremental capital-output ratio will always yield a number\nsmaller than the marginal product of capital.\n\nMinneapolis. ANNE O. KRUEGER.\n\n! This is clearly a comparative statics system only. However, without this condition, the labor market\nitself will be unstable.

RoBERT L. BisHoP.\n\n1 Professor Fisher has asked me to add the following footnote, which corrects a minor error in his\npaper. He states (p. 127, n.1) that Theocharis gives the solutin to his original system of difference\nequations incorrectly, since the multiple root (1/2) must involve a polynomial in terms such as /i-!(1/2)t\n(i \u2014 1,..., n\u2014l). (McManus and Quandt, '* Comments on the Stability of the Cournot Oligopoly\nModel,\" this Review, Vol. XXVIII (2), 1960-61, 136, make a similar statement.) This is incorrect, and\nTheocharis's solution is right, as the latent vectors of the relevant matrix span the n-dimensional vector\nspace in which they lie, thus affording the requisite 1 independent solutions to the system, despite the multiple\nroot.\n\nA similar remark applies to Fisher's discussion (p. 130, n. 1) of the case where b -- d \u2014 0. Here,\nagain, the multiplicity of the root\u2014in this case, zero\u2014does not involve a polynomial time trend. However,\nthe fact that zero is \u00e0 root does mean that the particular solution involved is explosive, save in the special\ncase where all the c; are the same. In the latter case, the particular solution is still a constant vector, and\nstability of the second kind can still be obtained. The case of b 4- d \u2014 O corresponds to the cases (discussed\nabove) in which all reaction functions have the same slope. In these cases, if all reaction functions do not\ncoincide, stability (and, indeed, equilibrium itself with the stipulated number of producers all active) is\nnot present; if they all do coincide, the system can be stable (if the other conditions in Fisher's paper are\nsatisfied), but any point on the common reaction function can be approached as an equilibrium, depending\non the initial conditions.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 10:59:25 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

When there is con-\nsumption out of profits, so that the real wage is lower than that which corresponds to the\noptimum length of life of plant, replacements are not being made that the benevolent\nauthority would undertake.\n\nThe behaviour of the firms and of the benevolent authority coincide only when the\nrate of profit on capital is equal to the rate of growth of the economy.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt is not legitimate to draw practical conclusions, without further consideration, from\nan argument, such as the above, which is concerned only with the logical implications of a\npostulated state of equilibrium. n particular, it must be remarked that under private\nenterprise a rise in thriftiness is more likely to produce a slump than an improvement in the\nselection of technique and that it is more onerous to provide for an increase in the degree\nof mechanisation or a speeding up of obsolescence than to maintain a higher level that has\nalready been attained. Nevertheless, if there is any rough correspondence between\nreality and the type of analysis here set out, the fact that the rate of profit on capital may be\nof the order of 15 or 20 per cent in an economy that is growing at the rate of two or three\nper cent per annum, does suggest some interesting lines of thought.\n\nCambridge. JOAN ROBINSON.\n\nAPPENDIX I\n\nThere has been a recent revival of interest in Wicksell's problem of a process of deepen-\ning investment (with a constant labour force and a set of blueprints of known techniques\ngiven once and for all) carried out in neoclassical equilibrium so that the profit-maximising\nmarginal productivity conditions are continuously fulfilled.! There are two major\ndifficulties in this analysis. The first concerns the question of foresight. As the process\ngoes on the rate of profit falls. Are the entrepreneurs aware that this will happen, and if\nso, how are they to make the correct selection of types of long-lived plant to ensure that\nprofit maximising techniques are always in use?\n\nOne way to evade the difficulty is to postulate that the process goes on very slowly\nand plant is relatively short-lived, so that even though firms act on the assumption that the\npresent rate of profit will continue to obtain in the future, the errors in investment planning\nare not serious. (This is rather in the nature of the housemaid's excuse.) Another is to\npostulate that all capital goods are made from a homogeneous, indestructible material\ncalled s7ee/ or meccano, which might better be named ectoplasm. t can be shifted from\none use to another and moulded into different forms without cost, so that there can never\nbe any mistaken investments. In this case no foresight is needed.?\n\n! See Joan Robinson '* Accumulation and the Production Function,\" Economic Journal, September\n1959; and Collected Economic Papers, Vol. II, for a number of recent discussions of this problem. Since\nthen an elaborate treatment has been offered by Professor Meade in A Neo-Classical Theory of Economic\nGrowth. Meade allows for steady growth with an increasing labour force and technical progress, as well as\npure deepening.\n\n? |n the case where ectoplasm per man employed is always larger in the ectoplasm-producing sector of\nthe economy than in the consumption-good sector, ectoplasm will become redundant and its price sink to\nzero at some point in the process of decelerating accumulation. If ectoplasm is not indestructible, a process\nof decumulation (not accumulation) can take place under equilibrium conditions. The story starts with an\nindefinitely large stock of ectoplasm and runs down to the stationary state from above. This was pointed\nout to me by Dr. H. Uzawa.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 11:03:44 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Any increase in the proportional\nrate on corporate income would increase the marginal rate and hence built-in flexibility of corporate tax\nyields\u2014or if corporate rates were made progressive the stabilizing effect would be strengthened even more.\nA reduction in exemption limits on personal incomes would broaden the tax coverage and a steepening\nof the rate schedules (without necessarily increasing the average liability) would also increase the flexibility\nof the tax yield. A similar result would be achieved by relating compulsory contributions and welfare\nbenefits more closely to the level of income. In short, any measure that would either broaden the tax base\nor make the rate schedules more progressive would increase built-in flexibility and hence also the automatic\nstabilizing effect.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 11:13:02 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The meaning of a is seen\nmore easily in column e? which measures the average ratio of saving to profits, since b \u2014 1.\nThis ratio fluctuates over time but the standard errors of a are large and we cannot formally\nrule out the possibility that it is constant. But there are good economic reasons for expec-\nting a to vary over this period: the end of dividend limitation in 1951 and the subsequent\nchanges in the profits tax differential between distributed and undistributed profits would\ntend to change this ratio from year to year. For the same reasons it would be unwise to\nconduct time series regression analyses of saving on profit for these years (cf. Prais [13]\n\np. 39).\nBristol. P. E.

The outstanding implication of the last two sections is that we require more facts,\nnot for their own sake, but in order to put into the theory sufficient content for it to yield\nsignificant predictions. Perhaps the most serious criticism of Chamberlin's critics is that\nthey have concentrated upon a priori discussion of his assumptions, instead of on discovering\nwhat facts were needed to give the theory content, and endeavouring to obtain them so that\nthey might test it. Discussion of the empirical material required is beyond the scope of\nthis paper, but the results of Section III are a little discouraging: we need facts about the\ndemand functions of individual firms (with respect to quality and advertising as well as\nprice) which are likely to be very difficult to get. Hence it may be that, with the obser-\nvational techniques at our disposal, the theory is not likely, at present, to be very fruitful.\nAs for the theory of the group, it appears that, to proceed further, we require some know-\nledge of demand relationships within groups. This suggests both theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nLondon. G. C. ARCHIBALD.\n\nMATHEMATICAL APPENDIX TO SECTION IIl:\n\nThis appendix is a somewhat overdue application of the methods of the early chapters\nof the Foundations to some cases that Samuelson did not have occasion to consider there.\nWe have a maximising model in several variables; our problem is to discover if our infor-\nmation is sufficient to determine the direction of change in the variables when a parameter\nis changed. It is in general obvious that we cannot expect much: the solutions will neces-\nsarily involve the second order partial derivatives, both direct and cross, and, if we have\nlittle information about the former, we have less about the latter. \"We shall, however,\nat least discover what is the minimum information necessary to determine the direction of\nchange. The main results are:\n\n(1) In the case of a specific tax, the direction of change of quantity is unambiguously\ndetermined without the need for any additional information.\n\n(2) This is not true in any other instance. To determine the direction of change of\nquality and advertising when tax changes, it is necessary to assume that second-order\ncross partial derivatives can be neglected; and this assumption is necessary in the case of\nan ad valorem tax to determine the sign of the quantity change.\n\n(3) In no case is the direction of change of price determined, even when cross-effects\nare ignored. This is because it is determined as a linear combination of the changes in\nquantity, advertising, and quality, which, in general, have opposite effects upon price.\n\nIn what follows, advertising and quality variation are first treated together and then\nseparately. It will be noticed that the only difference between the two follows from the\nform of the cost functions assumed: in the case of advertising, the costs of production\nand of advertising are assumed to be independent. It would be possible to treat quality\nvariation in this way, in which case there would be no analytical difference between it and\n\n1 [ am greatly indebted to Kelvin Lancaster, George Morton, and John Wise for generous help with\nthis appendix.

Further\npointers for the improved specification of econometric models may be expected\nfrom an intensive examination of the forecasting properties of the Oxford model\nover several recent years.?\n\n(iii) Conventional econometric models seem to underexploit the basic autoregressive-\nness of the economic system. The specification of linear structural equations\nwith some lags does imply that each endogenous variable has an autoregressive\nequation of the same order and with the same coefficients as all other endogenous\nvariables, but only three equations in the Oxford model have prior values of the\ndependent variable among the explanatory variables. It would be interesting\nto study the empirical properties of a system in which lagged values of the depend-\nent variable were incorporated with other explanatory variables in each relation-\nShip. This would imply a greater degree of agnosticism about economic relation-\nships than is customary, but it might be rationalised by saying that each variable\nis influenced by its previous values and by other variables which may push it off\nits autoregressive path. It would be interesting also to see the results of empirical\nresearch with reduced form systems, in which one estimated a separate equation\nfor each endogenous variable as a function of the whole set, or a sub-set, of the\npredetermined variables. For forecasting and policy purposes such a system\nwould be more directly useable than a set of nearly forty structural relations.

In particular, straight forecasting may be more efficiently\nachieved by the development of survey and anticipations data or by extensive\nautoregressive analysis of economic time series. Econometric forecasts take the\nform of numerical estimates, but if half or more of the implied directions of change\nturn out to be wrong we only have a spurious and misleading precision. As the\neconomic system moves through time, the odds on various further developments\nare continually changing; the likelihood of a balance of payments deficit increases,\nsay ; a renewed burst of inflationary pressure seems more probable. lt would\nbe interesting and important if an empirical model could be constructed in\nwhich the output was the estimated probability of change rather than the estimated\nabsolute changes.

Itis obvious from this mode of argument that the model works the way it does\nonly because wages are spent entirely on consumption and profits on machines. This is\nan extraordinarily powerful assumption, more powerful than many of its users realize.\nHere is a cute example of just how powerful it is: Constant returns to scale, competition,\nmachines produced by labor alone, consumables produced by machines alone, wages\nconsumed, profits saved. Exercise: prove that the relative share of wages in national\nincome is exactly 1/2!\n\n8. In my 1956 paper (and in Swan's) this assumption is not made. \"We took saving\nas a fraction of aggregate income (at one point I permitted the savings ratio to depend on\nthe rate of return on capital).

We have seen that quite strong assumptions are needed to justify his intuition,\nbut that these are certainly no less realistic than those of the current approach to long-run\nequilibrium.\n\nBut although we would be quite content to have achieved only this piece of retro-\nspective justification, we believe that something more has been accomplished. By freeing\nlong-run analysis from its dependence on equilibrium for all firms and consumers, the\nmodel has thrown open the way to a closer analysis of the competitive process, and of the\nways in which the structure of an industry changes through time. On the other hand,\nthere are a large number of mopping-up operations to be done, as well as further advances\nto be made; and perhaps some of our more exposed thrusts should be withdrawn a little.\nTime alone will tell whether this particular way of approaching the problem is useful,\nbut we are in no doubt that economic analysis will in some way eventually have to deal\nwith this class of problems.\n\nIn the meantime, let us mention some important areas (other than those already\ndiscussed) where consolidation is needed, and where further progress could be made.\nFirst, we have been rather vague about the actual numbers in the transition matrices, and\nabout the ways in which they are derived from the basic production (and, for demand,\npreference) data; the general approach is fairly clear, but the details need a good deal\nof work. In particular, the role of internal economies and diseconomies needs to be\nelucidated. Secondly, the rather ** unnatural \" monotonicity assumption, indicates that\nit might be more appropriate to investigate the stability of the size distributions themselves,\nrather than of total output and price. This, however, would leave price determination out\nin the cold, and the model would have to be extended by the inclusion of relations dealing\nwith it, possibly of Walrasian '* market-clearing \" type. Thirdly, we have dealt here only\nwith partial equilibrium. In an earlier unpublished paper, we dealt also with the general\nequilibrium analysis of this system, but only at the cost of a very restrictive assumption\non the demand functions, i.e., that they could be inverted to give prices as well-defined\nfunctions of quantities demanded. Clearly there is a rich field for future work.\n\nFourthly, in many respects the model has a definite recursive structure (especially\nin the ** birth-and-death \"* special case), and this makes it suitable for econometric investi-\ngation. Finally, and probably most important, exclusion of imperfect competition is\nregrettable, particularly since the analysis should help to throw light on the ways in which,\nas the size distribution of the industry changes under the impact of economic forces,\nperfect competition gives way to monopolistic conditions (and\u2014possibly\u2014on the reverse\nprocess). Indeed since, as Harvey Brazer has pointed out to us, the size distribution of\nfirms in perfect competition is not particularly interesting, the problem of extending the\nmodel to imperfect competition will be a crucial test of its usefulness, as well as of its\nrobustness.\n\nIn spite of all these problems, however (and there are others), we believe that some such\nstochastic approach as this is required if the unfortunate and ever-widening gap between\nthe approaches of micro-economics and macro-economics is\u2014someday\u2014to be closed.!\n\nAnn Arbor PETER NEWMAN.\nBerkeley J.

SuMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThis paper has been concerned with the ratios of price to marginal cost for produced\ncommodities, and with the ratio of labour income after tax to labour income before tax.\nIts principal substantive conclusions are as follows:\n\n(a) 1f some of these ratios are given and others are free to vary, the first-order con-\nditions for an optimum prescribe that, if commodities are substitutes in the Hicksian sense,\nthe variable ratios should lie within the range bounded by the largest and smallest of the\ngiven ratios. If complementarity is present, no such bounds can in general be set for the\noptimal ratios.\n\n(b) Consider a set of such ratios, some given and some variable, the latter set at values\nprescribed by the first-order conditions. Let us now change one of thevari able ratios\n(say that of x;). If the initial ratios are uncorrelated (or negatively correlated) with the\nchanges that now occur in the values of the Slutzky substitution terms relating to x, the\nfirst-order conditions define an optimum with respect to the xq-ratio. The optimum is\nlocal if (but not only if) this requirement is met in the vicinity of the value of the x;-ratio\nprescribed by the first-order conditions; it is global if (but not only if) it is met for all\nchanges in the x;-ratio.\n\nThree final points will be made. First, as Samuelson points out ([l11], p. 20),\nit may be that the optimal allocation of given totals of commodities according to the social\nwelfare function is a position of unstable market equilibrium. He suggests that it is\npossible for a government to circumvent this difficulty; it is a debatable point whether\nthis requires more or less skill than to decide whether a particular set of ratios of price to\nmarginal cost defines a local optimum, a global optimum, or a pessimum! Secondly,\nit may be that a programming approach to the problem discussed in this paper would\nbe more fruitful; it has been pointed out to me? that this would be particularly the case\nif we were to introduce more than one primary resource. Thirdly, it would be interesting\nto examine the implications of the techniques and results of this paper for problems of\ninternational trade.\n\nToronto. H. A.

In addition, it should be remembered that idle capacity may take the form of\nidle machines or idle men or both.

The criticisms of competitive economies\nthat there is too much idle capacity, and of planned economies that there is too little,\nseem especially interesting in light of these observations. One of the problems involved\nin planning an economy under centralized control would seem to be the provision of\nenough idle capacity, rather than the '* least possible \" which planners often aim for.\n\nPerhaps one of the most useful tasks which queueing theory could be put to work\non is the determination of the optimum number of competing servicing units (petrol\nstations is a good example) and the most efficient average level of idle capacity in an industry\nor market.

If this assumption did not\nhold, the commodities in the system could be divided into (say) k mutually disjoint groups,\nsuch that the commodities of the first group produced only those of the second, those\nof the second only those of the third (and so on), until the commodities of the kth group\nproduce only those of the first group; so that after k periods the inputs of commodities\nof any group would be converted, independently of other groups, into outputs of com-\nmodities of the same group. Accordingly, though the system is indecomposable, so that\nin any single period it does not fall apart into sub-systems, we could make it decomposable,\nif we were prepared to construct new periods that consisted of k of our previous periods,\nand look only at the initial inputs and final outputs of these compound periods. Thus\nwe may say that while Assumption I rules out simple independence, Assumption III rules\nout compound independence also. Compound independence is not inconsistent with the\nexistence of a von Neumann path; it does however mean that the optimum path (from\nan arbitrarily given starting path) may not approximate to the von Neumann path, but\nmay oscillate about it (within the ** compound \" period).\n\nThe further stages of Morishima's work then proceed as follows. The general\n** Turnpike \" problem\u2014of the optimum path with (arbitrarily) given initial supplies and\n(arbitrarily) given terminal product-mix\u2014is set up as a Linear Programming problem,\nprimal and dual; the primal determining the course of outputs and the dual the course of\n(imputed) prices. Lemma II establishes that if there are no zero outputs in the final\nperiod, there can be no zero outputs in any period; equality of costs and prices must\ntherefore hold throughout. (This, it should be noticed, does not exclude the possibility\nof excess supplies, with zero prices.) Lemma III then shows that, in infinite time, there\nis a convergence of prices; looking at the sequence of relative prices only, and starting\nfrom arbitrary initial prices, there is convergence to the von Neumann price-ray, in infinite\ntime. Lemma IV sharpens this convergence. Given a *' neighbourhood \" of the von\nNeumann price-ray (taken to be so small that the same activities as are chosen at the von\nNeumann prices are chosen at all prices that remain within the neighbourhood), any\nprice-sequence that starts close to arbitrary initial prices will remain within this neighbour-\nhood after a finite time. \"This uniform convergence, together with the fact that the initial\nimputed prices stay in a bounded region however long the programming period is taken\n(Lemma V), enables us to determine a finite time, that is independent of the length of the\nprogramming period, such that after that time the sequence of relative prices will be\nwithin the prescribed neighbourhood of the von Neumann price-ray. It follows that\nthe same activities as on the von Neumann ray will always be chosen except during a finite\ntime (which, as we have seen, may be zero) at the beginning.!\n\nAll the argument so far, since Lemma II, has run in terms of the price-sequence;\nthe principal properties of that sequence, which have emerged in simple terms in the course\nof my own argument, have been established by Morishima with great generality. (Lemma\nIV effectively establishes the convergence to constant costs.) All that remains for\nMorishima to do is to climb back from the price-sequence to the quantity-sequence;\nthis is what he does in the last stages of his proof.\n\n! Morishima's assumption that choice is made from a finite number of activities should here be noted.\n\nOxford. J. R.

Changes in prices\nand outputs are affected by the level of profits and excess stocks; but changes in excess\nstocks and profits are not determined by price and output levels but comprise a self-\ngenerating cumulative process of the type familiar from the classical theory of the business\ncycle. The casual interpretation of the complete system reduces the problem of stability\nto that of the relative stability of equilibrium and disequilibrium parts.\n\nThere are many directions in which this theory could be generalized. First, stocks\ndesired for precautionary motives were omitted from the analysis. In order to combine\nspeculation with trading in futures contracts, it would be necessary to analyze precautionary\nholdings as well as transactions and speculative holdings of stocks. Secondly, alternative\nassumptions about the formation of expectations of future prices could be adopted rather\nthan the hypothesis examined here, that expected price is equal to the long-run normal\nprice, which is equal to the cost of production. Finally, it would be of interest to deal\nexplicitly with the problem of the irreversibility of accumulation of fixed capital equip-\nment.\n\nThe main conclusions of this study are as follows. First, the investment is determined\nby capital requirements, steady growth output proportions and equilibrium relative prices\nare stable within the complete system, provided that the money rate of interest is at least\nequal to the equilibrium rate of growth. \"This conclusion may be verified when capital\nrequirements are determined by transactions motives alone and remains true when capital\nrequirements are determined by both transactions and speculative motives. The chief\nconsequence of speculative activity is to generate damped oscillations in speculative stocks\nand profits or to slow the approach to equilibrium which would take place if no specu-\nlative investment were undertaken.\n\nBerkeley, California.

As is seen most easily in (19),\nincreasing the number of firms only makes the damping rather quicker. This is in striking\ncontrast to Theocharis' model, in which outputs fluctuate indefinitely and get more and\nmore violently unstable as the number of firms increases.\n\nOn the other hand, instability is still possible if the adjustment model is put into\ndiscrete form. Indeed, for the appropriate choice of lags, Theocharis' system is the special\ncase in which the adjustments to the target outputs in each period are complete.! Insofar\nas adjustments are less than complete, there is a tendency towards stability\u2014think of the\nextreme case of no adjustments\u2014and so the lower the speeds of reaction the larger must\nbe the number of firms to cause instability.

I had worked out what still appear\nto me (subject to the amendments of the ** Supplementary Note \"' in the June 1960 issue\nof this journal) the simplest conditions under which the revealed preference relation may\nbe extended to generate a complete ordering for the consumer. But I was careless in\nadapting Georgescu-Roegen's axiom to the revealed preference relation, in seeking con-\nditions under which this derived ordering may be represented by a continuous function\n(paragraph 33 on pp. 74-5 of my paper).\n\nGeorgescu-Roegen (Q. J. E., 1954, p. 508) defines a ** preferential set \"' as '* a continuous\nsequence of alternatives arranged in their order of preference \", and his Axiom II.7 may\nbe paraphrased as follows: Given a particular commodity bundle x and any preferential\nset Y not containing x, but containing y, and y, such that y,Px and x0Py,, then Y also\ncontains a bundle y, such that x is indifferent to y, (by definition of the preferential set, ys\nis unique). He claims that no ordinal measure of utility can be obtained without such an\nassumption and\u2014by inference\u2014that this condition allows a complete ordering to be\nrepresentable by the usual continuous utility function, unique up to a monotonic or\norder-preserving transformation.*\n\nMy error arose from failing to observe that Georgescu-Roegen's axiom, although its\nwording is ambiguous on this point, must apply to every preferential set satisfying the\nconditions of the axiom. The Engel curves in the revealed preference problem are certainly\npreferential sets (in the sense of rp) that satisfy the axiom, but there may well be other\npreferential sets around that do not, as the reader may verify by studying Dr. Uzawa's\ncounter-example. It is also fairly easy to see intuitively that if there are no kinks in the\nbehaviour curves (his suggested condition), then the axiom will be satisfied for al/ prefer-\nential sets.\n\nMona, Jamaica. PETER NEWMAN.\n\n* The relations between orderings and representational functions, and the necessary proofs, have not\nyet been completely worked out in the literature, and will form the subject of a later paper by R.

That there does exist some confusion may be seen in Maurice McManus's otherwise excellent\npaper in this journal (Volume 25, no. 2), where he states (p. 98, footnote 3) that '* Continuity and density,\nhowever, are true properties of ordinal quantities \". Clearly any continuous representation function\ncan be submitted to a discontinuous order-preserving transformation so that this statement is false; the\nonly invariant property of an ordering is the order itself.\n\n142\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 11:30:41 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The foreign currency value of exports will fall in proportion to the devaluation.\nWhether a devaluation improves or worsens the balance of payments then depends only\non the elasticity of demand for imports. 1f this is unity the value of imports in domestic\ncurrency does not change (and in foreign currency falls in proportion to the devaluation),\nand the balance of payments will not alter. Only if the elasticity of demand for imports\nis greater than unity will the balance of payments improve. This type of case is not generally\nprovided for in formal international trade theory, which commonly assumes market-\nbased pricing. It might be useful here (as also when there is excess demand for imports\nor for home-produced goods) to introduce a ** price flexibility factor \"*.\n\nCost-based export pricing can be represented in Figure III. The initial position is at\nL and the increased price of imports shifts consumers! equilibrium to A. This time the\ndomestic value of exports does not rise, so there is no increase in expenditure in terms of\nheme-produced goods. Instead of the equilibrium shifting up to B or C (as in our earlier\nanalysis), it stays at A.\n\nThe value of exports in terms of foreign currency falls in proportion to the devaluation.\nIf A is due west of L, this means that the degree of external deficit originally represented\nby L is now represented by 4. And in this case there has been no change in the balance of\npayments situation. But of course A may be north-west or south-west of L, depending\non the elasticity of demand for imports, and then the foreign value of imports will have\nfallen more (north-west) or less (south-west) than exports.\n\nMelbourne.

As for the first and third quotations\u2014in\nthose relatively rare cases where they discussed disequilibrium, the classics seem quite\nclearly to have recognized that a change in the money supply can affect supplies and\ndemands for goods (thereby rejecting the homogeneity postulate),? just as they were well\naware of the possibility that an increase in the money supply may tend to reduce the\ninterest rate.

For in this case it can be shown that the ratio between the aggregate stock of\nbonds and the aggregate stock of money, i.e., SB/Sy, appears as an explicit parameter in\nthe reduced form equations corresponding to ($3). Even in this instance, however, all\n\" real\" quantities are invariant with respect to equiproportionate changes in the aggre-\ngate stock of money and bonds. This emphasizes what is perhaps the most interesting\nfeature of the system (S2), namely, that the stock of bonds is '* geared \"\" to the stock of\nmoney via a market adjustment mechanism in such a fashion that changes in the aggre-\ngate stock of bonds are, ceteris paribus, directly proportional to changes in the stock of\nmoney.\n\nResults precisely analogous to the above can be obtained for an economy containing\nfixed supplies of physical assets (which yield an income in ** kind \"). Provided no trader\nsuffers from '* money illusion\", and provided individual traders are permitted to issue\nnew securities and to retire outstanding debts in the light of changing market conditions,\nthe effects of a change in the aggregate stock of money can and will be entirely offset by\nan equiproportionate rise in money prices and in nominal asset balances.\n\nMore generally, if we consider an economy in which all commodities except money\nare produced, consumed, and held in the form of assets, and if the relevant supply and\ndemand functions of the system depend only on relative prices and other real variables,\nthen it can be shown that the equilibrium demand for commodities, for real bond income,\nfor physical assets, and for real money balances are all invariant against a change in the\nnominal stock of money.

As Patinkin\npoints out,! equilibrating additions to, or subtractions from, the stock of real balances on\nthe part of either households or firms may intervene between the two.\n\nIH\n\nIn conclusion, two implications of the foregoing discussion may be stated explicitly.\n\nFirst, the stock of real balances is, or can be made, an integral part of value theory\nas well as of monetary theory. Starting with certain specified assumptions, we can derive\ndemand functions in which the initial stock of real balances plays a definite role. It\nshould be emphasized that the importance of this real balance effect is an empirical, not\nan a priori, matter. Patinkin, for example, suggests that **. . . there is fairly persuasive\nevidence from the postwar experience of inflationary pressures generated by accumulated\nliquid assets that this behaviour (that of consumers in commodity markets) has been so\n(i.e. by the real value of their money balances) affected.\"? The usefulness of demand\ntheory is to suggest the specification of, and place restrictions on, the demand relationships\nrequired in practice. For example, the econometrician is interested in the problem as\nto whether or not he should include the stock of real balances in (say) his consumption\nfunction. Orthodox demand theory tells him to do this; the only question remaining is\ntherefore how important it is, and this is an empirical matter.\n\nSecondly, on a theoretical level, the stock of real balances is a matter of some impor-\ntance in any economy where positive saving exists. In certain special cases (i.e., where\ndepreciating assets are not involved), the stock of real balances becomes irrelevant in full\n(i.e., stationary) equilibrium. But this is not surprising. 1t will be recalled that the\ninfluence of the real value of the monetary stock was first called into account? as a device\nfor explaining how saving and investment could be automatically equated, in a schedule\nsense, at a positive rate of interest and a full-employment level of income. Thus positive\nsaving was presumed to be desired at high levels of income, and so it is quite reasonable\nthat the stock of real balances should figure on a theoretical level, in one set of circum-\nstances (an economy with positive savings at high levels of income) but not in another\n(namely, in a special type of stationary state).*\n\nPennsylvania R.

Here all that we can do is to observe that the authors demonstrate that the\nequations of the neo-classical model of the kind they consider are consistent in a formal sense. This is\nirrelevant to the central issues of whether such a model is particularly meaningful from an economic point\nof view, or whether it provides an adequate background for a discussion of the response of price changes\nto autonomous shifts in the money supply. In their discussion the authors fail to come to grips with\nPatinkin's argument, for the most part because their use of the word '' consistent \" cannot beiden tified\nwith Patinkin's use of the term.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 05:24:45 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In the light of this brief\ndiscussion, it can be seen that these arguments are not always well founded. By the\nsame token, many of the arguments employed by opponents of the device cannot be said\nto have any general validity. The effects of index-linking depend in general upon the\nbehaviour patterns of the individuals in the community in which it is introduced; on com-\nplex considerations concerning expectations, and on the interpersonal and intersectoral\ndistribution in the economy of obligations fixed in money terms. These must be evaluated\nfor any economy in which its introduction is contemplated.\n\nThere is also to be considered an important argument of principle, namely, that\nindex-linking enables those members of the community who so choose, to eliminate some\nof the risk arising from monetary instability. Other things equal this must be accounted\na positive gain. \"This consideration suggests that an index clause may be of value even\nwhen, on balance, the community expects no significant movement in the price level in either\ndirection.\n\nThe main arguments against the introduction of index-linking derive from expedience.\nThe device may well make it difficult for the authorities to attain their policy objectives\nin other directions. It is for instance, perfectly possible for index-linking to add to the\nlevel of effective demand even if expectations turn out to be correct. In addition, if\nexpectations turn out to be wrong, the device may add to the pressure on prices arising\nfrom costs. To some extent also, the use of particular weapons of economic policy such\nas increases in indirect taxation, may be rendered less effective. An increase in effective\ndemand is not of course a decisive ground for opposing a particular policy even in time of\ninflation, but it is evidently a factor to which much weight is likely to be given in practice.\n\nIn addition to these considerations there are numerous practical matters to weigh\nin the scale against the device. Difficult problems of accounting would arise for businesses.\nThe problem of defining an appropriate index would become of major importance. Almost\ncertainly, the authorities would be tempted to tailor their tax and subsidy measures so that\nthe index is stabilised.! Nonetheless, post-war experience suggests that these practical\ndifficulties need not be regarded as decisive.\n\nTo decide where, among these conflicting considerations, the balance of advantage\nlies for any particular economy is clearly not an easy matter. The difficulty of this task,\ncombined with the fact that the advance of inflation has currently been checked may suggest\nthat the issue would be best shelved. The argument from the current stability of prices,\nhowever, does not dispose of the issue. For one thing, it has yet to be shown that, over the\nlonger run, monetary stability is compatible with a satisfactory rate of economic growth.\nFor another, much of the real case for index-linking rests on its ability to ameliorate the\nproblems associated with unexpected price changes, whether inflationary or otherwise. If\nit were felt that the merits of index-linking were sufficiently persuasive to warrant its intro-\nduction even within a limited field, there would be much to be said for taking steps to do\nso at a time when this could only be construed as a demonstration of strength on the\npart of the authorities rather than the reverse.\n\nCambridge.

In other words, the curve in the second quadrant of his Figs. 2 and 3 would have\nsloped upwards from left to right, (and not from right to left) and his particular method of\nshowing that a higher //Y involves a lower W/P would have broken down.!\n\nBut in order to demonstrate this result we need not assume differences in the two\nproduction functions, or even the existence of a convex transformation curve\u2014it is indeed\nvery doubtful that any such result could be reached by making special assumptions about\nthe character or the constellation of the curves in box diagrams. The result follows only\nfrom a Keynesian macro-economic model in which a higher level of capital expenditure\nnecessarily increases the aggregate demand function relative to the aggregate supply\nfunction, and thereby (under conditions of full employment) raises prices relatively to\ncosts independently of any shift along the isoquants of the production functions, or the\ntransformation curve. ]t is the fall in W/P caused by an increase in aggregate demand\nwhich may in turn react on the level of capital expenditure through a consequential change\nin the techniques of production employed.\n\nThus even within the rigid framework of neo-classical assumptions the change-over\nfrom a static equilibrium model to a balanced growth model involves a far more radical\nchange in the determinants of distributive shares than Mr. Findlay realizes. The\n** elasticity of substitution\" between Capital and Labour which loomed so large in the\nformer, becomes, at best, only one of a number of factors which enter into the picture :\nand its role can be quite a subordinate one.\n\n3. But even that modest role disappears into thin air once we remove the unreal\nassumptions from which we started. As soon as we allow for a continuous change in\ntechnical knowledge, it becomes illegitimate to assume a linear-and-homogeneous pro-\nduction function. \"Technical progress is in fact, the same kind of thing (though more\ncomplex) as increasing return to scale, since (depending on the speed of capital accumu-\nlation) an increase in capital per unit of labour may yield a proportionate, or even a more-\nthan proportionate, increase in the product ; and it is not possible to say that that part\nof this increase which is due to the change in ** knowledge \" can somehow be separated\noff and isolated from that part which would have taken place if knowledge, in some sense,\nhad been ** held constant \".? The trouble with the neo-classical approach is not that it\nstarts with a lot of unreal abstractions\u2014this is true of any theory, in science just as much\nas in economics\u2014but that it operates with the kind of abstraction which leads nowhere:\nwhich cannot be removed or relaxed without destroying the foundations that were\nconstructed with its aid.\n\nCambridge.

As a recent publication of the U.S. Department\nof Commerce put it, * detailed studies have shown the swing in the profit ratio to be characteristic of a\nbroad range of industries, so that a structural shift toward typically lower-profit industries apparently was\nnot a major factor in it \" (U.S. Income and Output, Supplement to the Survey of Current Business, 1959,\np.15).

Provided that\nboth money and bonds are either pure stock or pure flow goods and therefore represented\nby only one excess demand equation, the two theories must be equivalent by the Hicksian\nproof. In a pure flow economy, i.e., one in which goods are produced and consumed\nbut never held, or in a pure stock economy, i.e., one in which goods are held but never\nproduced or consumed,! the Hicksian proof is quite valid. Even in a stock-flow economy,\nwhere production, consumption, and holding go on simultaneously, Hicks! proof holds\nif neither bonds nor money are stock-flow goods, though one may be a stock good and the\nother a flow good.\n\nThe problem arises in the seemingly more realistic case when bonds or money or\nboth are stock-flow goods and therefore represented by two equations. In this case\ncertain limiting conditions must be met before Hicks' proof is valid. By Walras' Law\nwe are able to eliminate one of our excess demand equations, but only one. In order to\neliminate a stock-flow good from our equation system we must eliminate not one but two\nequations. One way we might do this is to make certain assumptions concerning the\ninstitutional make-up of the model we are working with, thus causing some of the equation\nin our system to be redundant by connecting them to other equations. In particular, it\nis possible to link the excess flow demand function for money to the excess flow demand\nfunction for bonds in such a way as to make them equivalent.\n\nLet us suppose that in our particular economy the only way to create bonds is to go\nto a bank, state one's intentions to the banker, and, should he see fit, promise to pay him\na certain sum per year in perpetuity. The banker, in return for this, creates demand de-\nposit in the name of the individual and the deal is completed. In order to buy back the\nbond one must return to the banker and by the same process eliminate the agreement,\nin which case the banker destroys the previously created demand deposits of the individual.\nLet us further suppose that in this economy of ours the only way in which the banker can\ncreate money is by buying individuals\" bonds, and the on]y way in which he can destroy\nmoney is by selling them back to the individual from whom he originally bought them.\nNo one but the banker is permitted to hold bonds and no one but the banker is permitted\ntocreate money. In this economy, therefore, it will be impossible to destroy bonds without\ndestroying money, and it will be impossible to create bonds without creating money.\nIt will be equally impossible to create or destroy money without creating or destroying\nbonds. The excess flow demand function for money gives us the rate of destruction or\ncreation of money at each set of values assumed by the model. In our model economy\nit must also tell us the rate of destruction or creation of bonds, because the two are identical.\n\nThis is not to say that bonds and money are in any sense identical; the stock of money\nmay be much greater or smaller than the stock of bonds for historical reasons, but the\nrate of change of the two stocks will be identical.\n\nUnder these conditions the excess flow demand for bonds is always identical to the\nexcess flow demand for money; if one is equal to zero, the other is equal to zero. Now by\nWalras' Law we may eliminate either the market excess demand for money or the market\nexcess demand for bonds. Since, when the excess flow demand for bonds is in equilibrium\nthe excess flow demand for money must also be, which of them we choose to deal with is\nof no importance. Like Hicks we may call a theory which chooses to eliminate the market\n\n1 This of course, is precisely the situation envisaged in the pure exchange economy of the earlier stock\nand flow analysis.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 05:35:39 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

One not only must concern oneself with the allocation\nof existing stocks but also with the net change in these stocks which arises when the rate of\nproduction is not equal to the rate of consumption. At any given price there will be a\ncertain demand to hold any stock-flow good, there will also be a certain net rate of\nproduction of that good (possibly negative or zero). If there is a non-zero net rate of\nproduction the size of the stock of the good in existence will change. If this change is\nnot compensated for by a change in demand, excess market demand (excess demand to\nhold plus excess demand to consume) will be non-zero, and price must change. If stocks\nare changing the system must be out of equilibrium. However, if the rate of current\nproduction (flow supply) is not equal to the rate of current consumption (flow demand)\nStocks must be changing. In equilibrium, flow supply (the rate of production of goods)\nmust be equal to flow demand (the rate of consumption of goods). \u2014 That is to say that\nexcess flow demand (flow demand less flow supply) must be zero.\n\nUnfortunately the fact that the current rate of production is equal to the current\nrate of consumption does not mean that the market is in equilibrium. There still exists\nthe possibility that the current existent stock of the good is not equal to the current demand\nto hold the good. \u2014 This being the case, price will change because total demand (consump-\ntion plus the demand to hold) will not be equal to total supply (production plus existent\nstocks). In equilibrium, not only must the rate of production equal the rate of consump-\ntion, but total supply must be equal to total demand. Thus according to the ** new\"\nstock-flow economics a stock-flow good, that is one which is produced, consumed and held\nmust be represented in a general equilibrium system not with one but with two excess\ndemand equations. One is the excess flow demand equation which tells for each possible\nset of values of the system what the rate of additions to or subtractions from stocks will be.!\nThe other is the market excess demand equation which shows the total market demand,\nboth stock and flow, for the good at these values. In equilibrium both these equations\nmust be equal to zero. If excess flow demand is not zero, then flow supply, the rate of\ncreation of new stocks, must not be equal to flow demand, the rate of destruction of old\nStocks, and over time there will be net additions to or subtractions from stock, which will\ncause the market excess demand curve to shift and thus change equilibrium price. If\nmarket excess demand is not zero then there will be forces at work causing prices to change.\nThus for each stock-flow good in an economy there will be two equations which must be\nsatisfied. Fora pure stock good or a pure flow good, on the other hand, the usual analysis\ncan be conducted with one excess demand equation for each good.\n\nThe Hicksian proof of the equivalence of the two theories is based upon what Patinkin\ncalls ** Walras Law \"', according to which, in a consistent n good system, two of the goods\nbeing bonds and money, if any n\u20141 excess demand equations are satisfied; the nth must\nalso be satisfied, thus the nth may be dropped. Of course, it makes no difference what the\nnth equation is, no matter which of the equations is dropped the solution of the system\nremains unaltered. In particular one could drop either the equation for bonds or the\nequation for money, it would make no difference. The loanable funds theory drops the\nmoney equation, the liquidity preference theory drops the bond equation, but the two are\nequivalent.\n\nThis is quite a simple and clear-cut proof, provided that each of the goods in the system\nis represented by only one excess demand equation, but as we have just seen, in an explicit\n\n1! Such changes in the size of existent stocks constitute the flow side of the picture. A flow is defined\nas the rate of change of the size of stocks. Parenthetically this definition has one peculiar ramification.\nIf stocks are zero and remaining zero as in the case of service industries, flows must also be zero. Thus\nin the case of a pure flow good, where stocks are by definition zero, ner flows must be zero.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 05:35:39 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The mathematical formulation of the present paper helps to clarify the issue.\nIt shows that the entire Ricardian model stands on the assumption of a uniform composition\nof capital all over the economy. The problem of introduction of machinery exactly\nhypothesizes a violation of this assumption. \"Therefore, the general conclusions cannot\nbe extended to this case. Looked at in these terms, the chapter ** on machinery \"* appears,\nrather than a contradiction, an honest acknowledgement by Ricardo of the limitations\nof his theory.\n\n10. CONCLUDING REMARKS\nA few remarks may be drawn as a way of conclusion.\n\nRicardo's model is built on very crude assumptions. The most crucial of them is\nthat all sectors of the economy use\u2014we might say in more modern terms\u2014the same period\nof production. This was just the point against which his contemporary critics (especially\nMalthus) threw their most violent attacks. In their function as critics, they were right.\nThe limits entailed by the assumption are relevant not only for the Ricardian theory of\nvalue\u2014as has always been thought\u2014but also for the determinateness itself of the whole\nsystem, as soon as the simple case of two-commodity production is depaited from.\n\nOn the other hand, once the assumptions underlying the whole analysis have been\nexplicitly defined, the system appears to be logically consistent and determinate in all its\nmacro-economic features and even in its sectoral details, except for some particular\nsectoral variables in which Ricardo was not interested. A mathematical formulation of\nthe model is possible, claiifies many issues\u2014among others, those connected with the\ncontroversial chapter ** on machinery \"\u2014and permits a representation of the Ricardian\ndynamic processes\u2014in particular the process of economic growth\u2014in a few rigorous and\nconcise notations. The solutions of the natural system Ricardo was dealing with are shown\nto exist and to be unique but not stable. They reach a perfect stability only in the equili-\nbrium of the stationary state.\n\nThe whole model, in its crudeness and simplicity, appears remarkably complete and\nsynthetic. Ricardo is always looking for fundamentals. Detailed relations are dealt\nwith only in the light of basic tendencies\u2014when they become too complicated and lead to\ndifficulties, those relations which are thought to be less important are frozen by crude\nassumptions. Whether this is a fruitful methodological line to pursue is open to contro-\nversy. Later, neo-classical economists preferred a radically different line of approach.\nThey abandoned too ambitious dynamic outlooks and instead started to analyse, in a\ncomplete way and in all its functional interrelationships, at least a more simplified (static)\nversion of economic reality. The step which was supposed to follow, however,\u2014that of\npassing to a dynamic analysis\u2014has not come out as easy and spontaneous as was expected,\nand, in recent years, it has not been infrequent for economists, faced with urgent problems\nof economic development, to have second thoughts on the subject. In this light, the\nRicardian analysis, with all the naivet\u00e9 and the limits of its particular theories, appears\nless primitive now-a-days than it appeared some decades ago.\n\nHarvard University and Cambridge University.

Professor Tobin is free to reject this ** independence-assumption \"\" either in the\nunder-employment case or in the full-employment case, though if he wished to differentiate\nbetween them and reject it in the one whilst accepting it in the other, his readers, I am sure,\nwould be grateful if he would show his hand and reveal his true reasons. But he is not\nfree simply to ridicule the whole macro-proceeding by saying, in effect, why bunch every-\nthing into two categories, instead of 50 or 500? | Macro-economic models, for all their\nshortcomings, attempt to do something rather more subtle than just aggregating production\ninto two arbitrary categories, 4 and B, and incomes into two equally arbitrary categories\nX and Y\u2014the division in each case is justified by fundamental behavioural properties of\nthe capitalist system. Investment is picked out, because expenditures debited to a capital\naccount are independent of the current income flow in a way in which expenditures on\nincome account are not ; Profits are picked out, because any change in aggregate demand\nrelatively to aggregate supply affects residual incomes in a contrary direction to contractual\nincomes and also because in any reasonably stable system the proportion of profit saved is\nvery much greater than savings out of contractual incomes of a// kinds. Of course it\nwould be nonsense to suggest that it is the decision to produce Goose Livers on a certain\nscale which determines the incomes of Gourmets, instead of the other way round. But\nit is just as nonsensical to imply that the assumption that the division of output between\nInvestment and Consumption is independent of Profits and Wages is equally far-fetched.!\n\n8. Professor Tobin's second point is that the theory only works so long as there is\nno collusion between members of each of the two groups, in raising or lowering their\npropensities to consume so as to influence their share of the product ; and if there is\ncollusion on both sides, there will be all the horrors of bilateral monopoly. \"With all\nthis I heartily agree. But may I remind him that the same can be equally said of the\nneo-classical theory or indeed any other theory such as the Ricardian or the Marxian ?\nAs Wicksell, in particular, never tired of emphasising, once capitalists acted in collusion\nthe marginal productivity theory of interest and wages goes out of the window.\n\nCambridge.

For reasons given in my paper (Cf. this Review, Vol.\nXXIII (2), p. 89) any narrow definition of factors of production makes nonsense of the whole marginal\nproductivity approach, since the essential properties of divisibility and variability of co-efficients can only\nbe assumed to exist as between broad categories, such as Capital and Labour, and not, \u00e0 la Wicksteed, as\nbetween ** horses and ploughs and footpounds of power \".

What we would like to know is how far he would\npursue the Induced-Investment criterion if it is not for the time being economically feasible\nand conflicts with existing comparative costs.\n\n(c) The third conflict arises from the fact that while Hirschman treats the growth\nof imports of new commodities as the prime mover of the industrialisation process of the\nunderdeveloped countries creating a ready-made demand for their new domestic industiies,\nhe skates very lightly over the snag that at present these imports will have to be financed\nmainly by the expansion of primary exports. Here again we would like to have a clearer\nstatement of how far Hirschman is willing either to expand or contract the production of\nthese primary exports to promote industrialisation, failing luck in having surplus capacity\nto produce an export commodity which happens to have a very elastic demand at the time\n(p. 172).\n\nIn fact Hirschman's whole treatment of the balance-of-payments problem of the\nunderdeveloped countries is unsatisfactory and eccentric. Other economists may worry\nabout the fluctuation in the prices of primary products, but to Hirschman the balance-\nof-payments problem of the underdeveloped countries is yet merely another of the excess\ndemand pressures which would stimulate their economic development provided they do\nnot aggravate their inflation by investing too much in social overhead capital. For instance,\nwhat is one to make out of his argument that the balance-of-payment difficulties of these\ncountries are not due to an excess of total demand over available resources but merely\ndue to a certain growth sequence which leads to expansion of those sectors whose output\nhas low *' exportability ''? (p. 169). On the subject of outside aid to ease the balance-of-\npayments difficulties of the underdeveloped countries, Hirschman again tries to sustain\nhis view that what they really need is not a ** supplement of real resources \" or general\ninvestible funds but merely specific additional imports and speaks favourably of the barter\nagreement negotiated by Russia with a number of underdeveloped countries (p. 172).\nThus he ends up by advocating tied aid or investment in its narrowest form ! He obviously\nhas no experience of the practical difficulties which the '' specificness\"\" of the imports\ncreates for the underdeveloped countries which have entered into such barter agreements.\n\nTo sum up : (i) Hirschman has successfully established the case for unbalanced growth :\nbut his argument has been vitiated because he has unnecessarily and excessively tied it\nup with a pure Demand Approach to economic development. (ii) He has also done real\nservice by stressing the psychological factors of economic backwardness in opposition to\nthe usual concern only with the physical supply of resources. But by his somewhat\noptimistic belief in the pressure of excess demand to overcome all physical shortages of\nresources, by his over-tender attitude towards inflation and balance-of-payments deficits\nand by his outright rationalisation of the underdeveloped countries\" fondness for prestige-\ncreating large scale industries and modern technology, Hirschman reminds us of the psy-\nchiatrist who claims to cure his patients by humouring them in their wilder fancies instead\nof telling them a few hard facts of life. In the end we are left with the doubt whether even\nsuch a persuasive exponent of this technique as Professor Hirschman can really talk himself\nout of the frequently dismal and negative task of the economist in the underdeveloped\ncountries of pointing out the need to husband scarce resources and to make painful choices.\n\nOxford and Rangoon.

CONCLUDING COMMENTS\n\nThe principal purpose of this paper has been to identify the primary determinants of\nmoney wage changes in Canadian manufacturing industries at the two-digit level of dis-\naggregation. Although the evidence is subject to several limitations, it is generally consistent\nwith the view that in the majority of industries wage changes are associated with changes\nin the relative wage (i.e., the industry's wage relative to the general wage level in Canada),\nand in the general level of unemployment. The influence of the demand for labour, as\nmeasured in our tests, is also discernible in a majority of industries. The factors that show\nthrough least clearly are the level of wages in the same industry in the United States and\nindustry profits.\n\nThis evidence is broadly consistent with the aggregative wage-change relationships\nthat have been estimated for various countries including Canada. Moreover, the estimates\nemphasize that general economic conditions have an important influence on wage changes\nin particular industries in comparison with influences that are peculiar to particular indus-\ntries. Although all the variables entering these relationships reflect the general economic\nconditions prevailing in the country, these environmental factors are directly reflected in\nthe level of unemployment in the community and the overall level of wages. In quite a\nnumber of industries the influence of these environmental factors seems to be conditioned\nby variations in the demand for labour in particular industries.\n\nThe limited information that is available provides little evidence of a significant\nassociation between strikes and the rate of change in wages negotiated under collective\nagreements. In addition, the degree of unionization across industries is not significantly\ncorrelated with the rate of change in wages across industries from 1961 to 1966, nor does\nit seemed to be related in a systematic way to the role of profits and United States wages\nin influencing wage changes in Canadian manufacturing industries.\n\nLittle or no evidence has been found to support the key industry hypothesis for Canada.\nThe identity of the key group of Canadian industries is in doubt; the existence of the as-\nsumed bargaining cycle is in doubt; and when wage changes in an assumed key group of\nCanadian industries are related to wage changes in particular industries, it is doubtful\nwhether these key industry wage changes are any more closely associated with wage changes\nin non-key industries than are wage changes in manufacturing generally.\n\nSomething can be made of the key group hypothesis if instead of defining the key group\nin terms of industries it is defined in terms of employees covered by collective bargaining\nunits. The evidence is consistent with the view that the wage settlements arrived at\nby collective bargaining units for the economy generally are positively related to wage\nchanges in many individual Canadian industries. However, because of the close relation-\nship between wage changes arrived at in collective bargaining settlements for the economy\nas a whole and general labour-market conditions, it has not been possible to identify\nsatisfactorily the separate influence of the spill-over effects per se of collective bargaining\non wage changes in particular industries and the influence of general labour market\nconditions.\n\nUniversity of Western Ontario G.

When the covariance matrix is measured, it is\npossible to compute directly the matrices G, H and Z in the main hypotheses R(1) and R(2)\nand leave f, the utility function parameter, as the only coefficient to be estimated. This\nwas done and fi was estimated separately for each equation and by pooling the data for all\nthe variables. The results were that the single equation estimates of f varied wildly between\nequations and the unique estimate from the pooled data was very badly defined. The\nimplication of this would seem to be that the errors in proxying rate expectations are trans-\nmitted in an accentuated form to proxying of the covariance matrix.\n\nSome attempts were also made on the basis of variations in rates of return about their\nhistorical means to compute covariance matrices for sub-periods. The difficulty with this\nis deciding upon the length of period to take. If the period is too short, the elements of\nthe matrix are minute. If the period is too long, there is very little variation in the elements\nof the matrix. No progress was made with this problem.\n\nThe main outcome of a considerable amount of largely unsuccessful work reported in\nthis section is that it is difficult to improve on the results reported in the previous section,\nbut that if goodness of fit is our only aim, then introducing an autoregressive element into\nthe model via adjustment costs is one way of achieving that aim.\n\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe aim of this study was to explain Discount House portfolio and debt behaviour in\nterms of a simple but strongly specified model of rational choice in conditions of uncertainty.\nThe model advanced made strong assumptions about\n\n(a) the Discount House utility function;\n\n(b) the competitiveness of the bill, Short Bond and money markets;\n\n(c) the constancy of subjective variances and covariances of asset yields and borrowing\nrates.\n\nSome data mining took place in order to establish the ** best \"\" proxies for expected rates of\nreturn but measurement error in these expected rates inevitably remains.\n\nThe main empirical findings are that the model postulated explains a good proportion\nof the portfolio and debt changes of the Discount Houses. Almost all the coefficients\nrelating asset and liability levels to interest rates are well determined despite high inter-\ncorrelation between the independent variables, and have signs which confirm a priori\nexpectations. The majority of the a priori specifying restrictions were tolerably well satisfied\nwhen the equations were freely estimated. The variant of the model which assumes that\nuncertainty surrounds both borrowing and lending behaviour is marginally superior to\nthe variant which assumes that the planning period is short enough for borrowing rates to\nbe known with certainty.\n\nThe popular view that the working of the institutions central to the U.K. monetary\nsystem cannot be explained in terms of simple models and that their behaviour is so unstable\nthat it is virtually impossible to make predictions, seems to be wrong. This simple model\nexplains a large part of the movements in the Discount Houses' Balance Sheets over the past\n15 years. It does not explain it all, however, and there is plenty of scope for improvement.\nSome of the more immediately obvious avenues of further enquiry have been explored but\nthere must be many others which would repay further work.\n\nUniversity of Essex M.

This may be too long relative to the\ndecision period. A\u00c0 better approach might be to set up the basic model in continuous time\nand estimate a discrete approximation to such a model! Secondly our initial results\nsuggest that a more thorough analysis of the stockbuilding behaviour of industries producing\nmainly to order would be worthwhile. Thirdly as our results do not provide much evidence\nshowing the production smoothing considerations to be very important in all industries,\nmodels of short-run output behaviour could throw more light on the behaviour of finished\ngoods stocks. Finally there is a good case for a more thorough attempt at investigating\nthe role of liquidity factors and supply constraints.\n\nUniversity College, London P. K.

            "found": "ON THE EFFICIENCY OF COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMES 581\n\nsatisfy the conditions of section 2, then all competitive programmes are efficient, but it\nseems unlikely that the technology is that special.\n\nThis brings us to a second direction research could take: modification (or extension)\nof our institutional framework. We dealt above with a model in which independent firms\nmaximize present value over finite horizons. If, for example, we assumed instead that\nfirms maximize over infinite horizons, our conclusions would undoubtedly be modified.\nIndeed, it is hard to see how such a firm would rationally hold ** too much capital\nforever! ; the economy still might (if the number of firms is growing), but should be less\nlikely to.\n\nNote also that our analysis has had the character of partial equilibrium; we have\nignored the problems of consumer choice and the associated distributional aspects of\ncompetition. Introducing consumers who maximize over preference orderings subject to a\nbudget constraint could also alter the conclusions of this paper. Again the results will\ndepend on what planning period is chosen for consumer optimization. One view regards\nthe family as the unit of decision making, and thus insists on having an infinite horizon for\nthe optimization of the family. An alternative view suggests a finite life for every consumer\nand a planning horizon identical with his life. It is then suggested that the consumer end\nhis life either with no capital or with the amount dictated by a bequest motive.\n\nIf we regard consumers or families as optimizing over infinite horizons, then in defining\ntheir budget constraint over this planning period we are assuming something about the\nbehaviour of the capital market. That is, the capital market has some operating rules that\ndetermine the limitations on the borrowing and lending capabilities of individuals. Such\nrules can be analogous, for example, to the rule of * dying without debts \" in the finite life\ncase. Consequently, such rules have implications for the aggregate rate of capital accumu-\nlation (see Arrow and Kurz [1, Ch. 7] for extensive discussion of the implications of alter-\nnative budget constraints). Therefore, it is conceivable that there may exist appropriate rules\nthat will ensure the efficiency of a competitive programme along which consumers obey\nthese borrowing rules.\n\nIt is easy to show, however, that for an economy with growing population the condition\nof * zero capital at the end of the consumer's finite life \" is perfectly consistent with a\ndivergent aggregate capital stock and economic inefficiency (see Starrett [15, Ch. 6]). From\nthis it follows that a competitive equilibrium that would be defined relative to such con-\nsumer optimization and individual budget constraint can be inefficient. Thus, it appears\nimportant to investigate budget constraints and corresponding definitions of competitive\nequilibria that might ensure competitive efficiency. We believe this to be a problem for\nfurther research.\n\nStanford University M. Kunz\nD. A. STARRETT\n\nFirst version received August, 1968; final version received December, 1969\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nIn section 2 we claimed that efficient, locally reachable programmes have Malinvaud\nprice systems; here we will sketch a proof of this result.

While maintaining roughly the\nsame level of abstraction, there are certain obvious ways in which the restrictive assumptions\ncan profitably be relaxed. \"The most obvious of all is by the introduction of a price-\nmechanism\u2014which, however, makes the models much less tractable. Also interesting, and\npossibly less difficult, is to allow the variance of the probability distribution of the outcome\nof a gamble to vary independently of expected return and so permit a comparison of the\neffects of selection on risk-seekers and risk-averters.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThis paper derives and tests directly the influence on investment behaviour of relative\nprice and productive input variables and interprets the empirical results in terms of assumed\nproduction and adjustment cost conditions and expected price formation behaviour.\nResults from testing a range of different investment equations within the same general\ntheoretical framework provide evidence of statistically significant depreciable capital user\ncost and wage rate relative prices and corresponding productive factor variables, depreciable\ncapital and labour. The results provide no evidence of an important role for liquid capital\nvariables in influencing investment, except for a possible substitution effect resulting from\nchanges in liquid capital user costs.\n\nIn contrast to most investment studies this paper places much more importance on\ndifferent relative prices as influences on investment behaviour and specifically excludes an\noutput measure in investment equations. While it may be argued that the output or acceler-\nator influence is operative through (say) depreciable capital and labour levels which imply\nan associated potential output level, capital and labour variables were included because\nof their ** capacity \"' influence stemming from their costs of adjustment and not to represent\nan accelerator influence. This approach is consistent with the structure of capacity acceler-\nator models [8, 9, 13, 17, 28] but here relative prices replace output variables as the exo-\ngenous determinants of desired capital stock and depreciable capital and labour variables\nrepresent an expanded interpretation of current capacity.\n\nIt may also be argued that the importance of the time trend variable is due not only\nto systematic shifts over time in production and adjustment cost functions or price expecta-\ntion behaviour, but also to changes in demand conditions not fully captured by the inclusion\nof an output price index. If this is the case, however, it would seem more appropriate to\nmodify output demand conditions to include a shift variable such as national income, rather\nthan introduce an output measure or output changes. Since this shift variable finds its way\ninto the derived demand equation for investment goods, the combination of shift variable\nand factor prices determines desired capitalstocks.! For that matter a demand shift variable\nmay well represent the economic force in neo-classical models that output or sales variables\nrepresent in accelerator models which treat output as exogenous.\n\nThe empirical results presented here suggest that the extension of investment models\nto include labour price and input variables represents a more logical step than that followed\nin past studies where liquid capital variables have been included in the absence of labour\nmeasures [31, 32]. However, while certain types of ** liquidity \" variables did not perform\nwell empirically, the underlying model does not incorporate the internal-external investment\nfunds cost difference which liquidity theorists believe to lie at the heart of the internal\nfunds flow influence on investment behaviour. Modification of the model to incorporate\nthese cost differences in the cost of capital or liquid capital user cost variable would be\nnecessary to test this hypothesis directly.\n\nCornell University R.

This follows because the independent variable\n\n(R,, 7 0-1)\n\nis effectively the same in both sets of regressions since the Lutzian and Hicksian forward\nrates differ only minutely for the first forward rate (j \u2014 2, Table 1), but the dependent\nvariable will have greater variance in the Lutzian case due to the greater elasticity of these\nrates. The variances of the dependent variable in these regressions confirm this in that for\nthe British data all variances of the dependent variable are greater for the Lutzian case and\nin the Durand data this is true for ten of the thirteen regressions. The Meiselman model\nwas not initially very strong in explaining the change in forward rates for longer time spans\n(n7 4) and the results presented here show that any explanatory power that it did have\nwas overstated. It must be emphasized that these results were obtained by using data which\nhas been smoothed and the rationale for such pre-test adjustments to the data has as yet not\nbeen adequately formulated. Telser's [14, p. 560] recent proposal to concentrate research\neffort on finding additional explanatory variables for adaptive models such as Meiselman's\nis therefore somewhat premature.

This claim appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the argu-\nment in my paper. According to Dr Bliss, ** the equilibrium under discussion . . . is a mo-\nmentary equilibrium \" and the ** major fault \" in the argument is *' the illicit importation\nof long-period equilibrium theory into the analysis of a short-run situation \". Thus, he\nassumes I was concerned with the short-period situation *' in which the price system was\nadjusted to the new pattern of demand and the old capital stock \". (Debreu's results do\nrefer to such short-run equilibria). But my paper, in fact, deals exclusively with long-run\nequilibria. In the pages Dr Bliss refers to, the problem is whether the process of net saving\ncan lead to a new /ong-run equilibrium, and whether this can happen without changes in r\nand w so drastic as to make implausible the traditional explanation of distribution.\n\nThe process of transition to such a long-run equilibrium does, indeed, by itself raise a\nnumber of difficulties for the demand and supply theory of distribution. As I noted, the\nconclusions of the theory would after Keynes be qualified as applying either ** in the absence\nof risk and uncertainty \" or under the hypothesis of an appropriate monetary policy.! It\nwas also noted how the changes in the physical form of the capital stock as it adapts to the\nnew methods and outputs, may undermine the very notion of saving used in the theory.?\nAII these additional difficulties were, however, ruled out from the main line of the argument\n(see assumptions (c) and (d), p. 425). This was done in order to focus the analysis on one\ncentral deficiency, and show that, even if the process of transition could be assumed to work\nsmoothly in those respects, it might still lead to no new long-run equilibrium, or to no\nplausible one, because the fall of r might be accompanied by a decrease, and not an increase\nin the proportion of *' capital \" to labour in the economy.\n\nDr Bliss however seems to imply that an analysis conducted by means of a sequence\nof ** momentary \" equilibria, far from bringing out additional weaknesses of the theory,\ncould show that a new long-run equilibrium might be reached, even where the proportion\nof ** capital\" to labour falls together with r. But, as far as I am aware, no such argument\nhas been advanced before.\n\nIn fact, the demand and supply explanation of distribution seems faced, at the present\nmoment, by two alternatives. On the one hand, there is a long-run analysis undermined by\nthe inconsistencies of the notion of capital it must use. On the other hand, there are short-\nperiod analyses where the attempt to avoid these inconsistencies (by referring to heterogen-\neous capital goods) leaves room for the doubts, which Dr Bliss himself expresses, about\nthe '** appropriate assumptions \" or even the fruitfulness of the whole approach.) In this\nsituation, the temptation might be strong to use the short-period approach to provide\n** some rationalization \" of results which derived their plausibility only from a long-run\nanalysis.\n\nUniversity of Florence P.

Insofar as fiscal policy is used,\nthe proportion of output devoted to investment could be constant only if the composition\nof public spending were deliberately manipulated with this end in view. The postulate of a\nfull-employment fiscal policy therefore implies that one would still have to use the Keynesian\nanalysis, with the difference that it would be used to determine the overall savings ratio\nrather than the level of output. Matters are different if one postulates with Meade ([9],\np. 3) that full employment is preserved solely by an active monetary policy. With a pro-\nportional consumption function that is unaffected by interest-rate changes, monetary policy\nwould operate solely on the level of investment. One could therefore reconcile full employ-\nment, a constant savings ratio, and a Keynesian process of income determination.\n\nBoth of the two assumptions that would vindicate use of the neo-classical model are\nrestrictive. Unless one believes that one or other of them provide a useful approximation\nto reality, the neo-classical model must be interpreted as an asymptotic model only. Unless\nthe initial conditions are such as to locate one in the unstable zone of Fig. 1, the Keynesian\nmodel will lead to an asymptotic solution that is consistent with the neo-classical model,\nbecause the equilibrium point lies on the W \u2014 0 curve. A rise in the savings ratio will\nultimately lead to a higher level of income, as the neo-classical model predicts. But it will\nnot necessarily lead to an immediate increase in the rate of growth; the Paradox of Thrift\nonly disappears after one has allowed a sufficient lapse of time for the depression in the\nprice level to stimulate monetary ease and thereby investment. The neo-classical growth\nmodel is an excellent asymptotic model, just as the classical model of income determination\nis an excellent guide to the level of income 20 years hence provided there are no exogenous\nshocks in the interim. But neither the neo-classical growth model nor the classical income\nmodel tell one anything about the actual rate of growth (of output or capacity) or the actual\nlevel of income next year. For such purposes it is necessary to study the actual forces that\ndetermine investment, and the most important of these forces is the desire of businessmen\nto invest rather than the full-employment level of savings. Those concerned with the practi-\ncal problems of stimulating growth may not have doubted this; but, if so, it is in spite of\nrather than because of the formal growth models that have been constructed.\n\nLondon JoHN WILLIAMSON\n\nFirst version received August 1968; final version received May 1969\n\nREFERENCES\n[I] Bergstrom, A.

Equilibrium inventory\nwill definitely fall with increases in holding cost. However, we have not been able to show\nthat equilibrium price and output only change slightly in these circumstances. In fact, it\nseems possible that equilibrium price and output may change significantly. Nevertheless,\nit is clear that changes in equilibrium price and output are conditioned by the change in\nequilibrium inventory. Moreover, a previous finding (footnote, p. 217) that a uniform\ndensity and constant marginal production cost imply Op*/Oh- 0 (which inequality need\nnot hold if marginal production cost is increasing) would seem to suggest that strongly\nincreasing marginal production cost would be one factor leading to the outcomes observed\nby Nevins.\n\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\n\nTo provide a more complete test of Nevins' results it would be useful to extend our\noutcomes to a dynamic, multi-period model. In principle, we could use a mathematical\ninduction in extending the single period results to an arbitrary horizon. However, the\nuniqueness problem we have already encountered seems to make the multi-period problem\nespecially difficult.

Information on this\nelasticity and on the utility interactions cannot be derived from the present results. As\n\n-\u00e0i M. 1 M\nit would appear that little more of a quantitative or qualitative nature can be said about the\nrestrictiveness of the separability hypothesis for the utility function or the apparent inevit-\nability of the dominance of the income effects under these conditions.\n\nIt is worth noting that the results under additivity do not support Green's! result. The\nhypothesis of direct additivity implies that either (a) all goods are normal and substitutes for\neach other; or (b) one good is normal and a substitute for every other good, the remaining\ngoods are either all inferior and complementary with each other or all neutral and unrelated\nto each other. One good (bread) was inferior and was a net complement for all other goods.\nThis divergence might be taken as evidence that consumer's do not engage in maximising be-\nhaviour. An alternative conclusion would be that the consumer's utility function is not,\nin fact, additive and in view of the likelihood ratio tests it is this which the author would\nfavour.\n\nHowever, it is still possible that the basic hypothesis is incorrect\u2014that consumers do\nnot maximize utility. This conclusion would be supported by the application of a likelihood\nratio test to the results under the Slutsky restrictions alone (Table 9). The Slutsky restric-\ntions were rejected and it therefore became impossible for the various separability hypo-\nthesis to be accepted as they impose more severe restrictions on the income compensated\nsubstitution terms than mere symmetry. If this were not so it would be possible that the\nconsumers do maximise utility but not according to the budgeting pattern implied by the\nseparability hypotheses considered here.\n\nIt is quite likely that the method adopted to test the hypotheses was unduly severe. The\nrestrictions are imposed at the mean proportion of expenditure devoted to each good and\ndo not hold exactly at any point in time. Anyhow, with changing tastes and a general shift\nup the utility function it is likely that such local conditions are not hypotheses worth testing.\nIt is also possible that the choice of a log linear demand function affected the results as no\nglobal utility function can correspond to such a representation of the demand equations.\nFinally, it is possible that the grouping chosen was simply incorrect\u2014a change of grouping\nmay lead to more favourable results. The evidence presented here weighs pretty heavily\nagainst the Slutsky and separability hypotheses but the conclusion may well be that it is\nmeaningless to test such hypotheses in a static framework given the data the econometrician\nis forced to work with.\n\nAustralian National University R.

The question I wish to investigate\nis whether, when uncertainty can be measured by variance, an increase in the uncertainty\nin the yield of the asset will cause the proportion of wealth invested in it to decline (if\nthat is possible). I only look at the case of an *' interior \" solution since the other cases\nfollow quite trivially.\n\nLet h(ri) \u2014 U'(c(k(1)))r;. Then taking U to be homogeneous, and using the notation\nof I, we find:\n\n, , A*w\nh' \u2014 U'(c(k(1)) | 1\u2014a \u2014\u2014 r, (a)\nk(1) ...(5)\nU'Aw A*w\np - 1-9) [ 5 r,-1 b\nKQ) [ ?

But then from our\ndiscussion in I we know that an increase in the variance of r,, leaving E(r;) unchanged,\nmust cause E[U'r,] to fall, and this means that in the new situation, a marginal transfer\nto asset of type 1 reduces expected utility in period (1) (whereas previously it left it un-\nchanged). Hence for given c(0) the proportion of wealth invested in asset 1 will decline.\nHowever (4) is clearly independent of w and so of c(0), when U is homogeneous and\nHQ da 0. Hence whatever the effect of the changed variance on c(0), the conclusion\nstands: the proportion of wealth invested in the asset will decline.\n\nIt is clear that this (quite expected), result must be kept distinct from an answer to the\nquestion of how an increase in the variance will effect the total amount of the asset bought.\nIf \u00ab \u00ab1, there is no problem, since we already know that less will be saved. When a\u00bb 1,\nthe matter is more problematical. Indeed the reader can construct examples, for which\nthe amount of the now riskier asset bought is increased. This kind of ** Hicksian \"' result\nis again quite in accordance with common sense.\n\nIV. SOME CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nNo one will deny that the economic assumptions of the Mirrlees model are pretty\ndrastic. Yet it is fairly hard work to get any results. (Mirrlees, who found approximate\nexplicit solutions for c(a, k), had a much harder time still). I conclude that the exercise\nis not to be taken in a practical spirit but rather as a demonstration that a rational planner\nmay make more provision for the future when the future becomes more uncertain.

The elasticity with respect to tax-induced changes in the opportunity cost of\nretained earnings appears to be substantially highei than the elasticity with respect to\nthe ratio of maximum possible net profits to gross profits.\n\nAlthough these results support the original suggestion that tax policies designed to\ninfluence the level and timing of corporate saving may have important effects on economic\nstability and growth, the link between corporate saving and these policy aims must still\nbe investigated. Changes in corporate saving may be stabilizing in two ways. First,\ntax-induced changes in saving could (in principle) lead to higher investment during periods\nof low aggregate demand and lower investment during periods of high aggregate demand.\nBut the well-established evidence that investment occurs only after a substantial lag\n(Eisner and Strotz [7]; Almon [1]; Eisner [6]), reduces the potential importance of such\ncountercyclical policy, even if it is accepted that investment would be cyclically sensitive\nto tax-induced changes in retained earnings. Second, if corporate saving does not affect\nshort-run corporate investment but dividends do influence consumption, tax policies to\ndecrease dividends during periods of high aggregate demand would be stabilizing. Although\nthis may be a potentially useful way of reducing aggregate demand by *' forced saving \"'\nin high income groups instead of by lower investment or decreased general consumption,\nthe estimated lag structure indicates that such a policy could only be effective if the govern-\nment's recognition and implementation lags were sufficiently short.\n\nWhen we turn to the influence of tax policies on growth, the effectiveness of the\ndifferential profits tax in influencing corporate saving raises two further questions. First,\ndoes an increase in the internal availability of corporate funds lead to increased corporate\ninvestment? Second, does an increase in corporate saving induce a corresponding decrease\nin personal saving? If the answer to the first question is yes and the answer to the second\nis no, tax policies to encourage corporate saving will increase aggregate investment. If the\nanswer to both questions is yes, such tax policies will only shift investment from the non-\ncorporate to the corporate sector. Finally, there is no effect on investment if the answer\nto the first question is no and the answer to the second question is yes.\n\nPrevious attempts to estimate the effect of retained earnings on corporate investment\nhave been handicapped by the high degree of multicollinearity between retained earnings,\nprofits and sales. The tax-induced changes in the \"equilibrium \" ratios of retained\nearnings to profits and sales that have occurred in Britain since 1950 may provide a useful\nset of data with which to estimate the effects of retained earnings. This is currently being\nexplored.\n\nAlthough the relation between corporate and personal saving has been the subject\nof theoretical speculation, it has never been empirically estimated. Because both forms\nof saving are cyclically volatile, multicollinearity problems again arise. The rise in dividends\nafter 1958 and the relative fall that can be expected to follow the 1965 corporation tax\nmay provide a sufficient departure from the secular and cyclical patterns to permit studying\nthe effect of corporate retentions on personal saving.\n\nA preliminary examination of the data for the period after 1958 shows a sharp rise\nin personal saving and a change in corporate financing from internal to external sources.\nBut only a careful study will reveal whether the tax change had any qualitative effect on\nthe total supply of saving and the level and pattern of investment.\n\nHarvard University M.

Together\nwith these, a long planning period is one additional joint sufficient condition which will\ngive the desired result. Another condition which would also give constant coefficients\nhinges on the assumption that the firm uses the * correct\" long-run cost minimizing\nmatrix S* to value terminal stocks. In this case, constant horizon * rollover \" planning\n(with the plan reformulted each period) would do, as inspection of equation (6.7) indicates.\nPossibly other sufficient conditions can be imagined; their relative credibility would vary\nfrom situation to situation.\n\n(iii) Within the above rather stringent limitations, the results of this paper indicate\nthat a fairly complete theoretical justification can be provided for the use of distributed\nlag functions, thus filling a gap pointed out by Griliches [9] and other authors. Moreover,\nthe model presented here integrates and generalizes the partial adjustment and adaptive\nexpectations justifications for distributed lags. The use of the Kalman filter generalizes\nthe original one-period adaptive expectations model of Cagan [4] to the multi-period\nadaptive predictor (3.1) (paralleling results of Nerlove [14] and collaborators), while at\nthe same time the use of cost functions including the control variables is very much in\nthe spirit of the partial adjustment investment models of Eisner and Strotz [7], Lucas [13]\nand Gould [8]. As in these models, current policy must be determined in light of all future\nchanges in the parameters of the problem. \"With the present specification, this dependence\nis given by the linear feedback rule (5.9) for determining present control variables as a\nfunction of the variable g, which * summarizes \" the expected future according to the\nlinear difference equation (5.11). Since all the relevant equations are linear and stable,\nthe future expected values in (5.11) can be reduced to a distributed lag function of past\nobservations via the Kalman filter. In the general case of non-linear constraints and\nnon-quadratic costs, this reduction will not be possible, although linearizations about a\nnon-linear feedback rule might sometimes be feasible.\n\n(iv) In summary, the ** good \" and ** bad \" results of this paper are somewhat mixed.\nOn the one hand (abstracting from aggregation problems), sufficient conditions for nice\ndistributed lag equations are shown here to exist; on the other hand, the conditions are\nfairly tight and the equations they imply are unidentifiable in terms of the firm's cost\nand demand parameters. Further, not much relaxation of these conditions in the quadatic-\nlinear model is likely, nor can nice equations be deduced in other types of optimizing models.\nOn balance, the results seem somewhat negative, although the idea that firms somehow\nmanage to find the cost-minimizing S* matrix to value their terminal stocks is perhaps\nacceptable as a working hypothesis.\n\nHarvard University and LANCE TAYLOR\nODEPLAN, Santiago, Chile\n\nFirst version received January, 1969; final version received March, 1969\n\nAPPENDIX ON STABILITY\n\nHere I amplify the discussion of observability and controllability given in the text,\nand also give a sketch of the proofs of theorems 1 and 2 when all costs are time invariant.\nFor more details, see [3], [11], [12] and additional citations there.\n\nA-1.

            "found": "Optimal Population and Capital\nover Time: The Maximin\nPerspective\n\nGUILLERMO A. CALVO\nColumbia University\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA well-known implication of the Solow-Swan growth model with non-overlapping gener-\nations is that if individuals do not care about the number or well-being of their descendants,\nthe present generation will gain nothing from having children (see Phelps (1966)). The\nnon-overlapping assumption is quite crucial for such a result. Consider instead the case\nwhere generations overlap in Samuelson-Diamond fashion (Diamond (1965)), i.e. indi-\nviduals live for two periods\u2014they work in the first and retire in the second. At present,\nperiod zero, there are, therefore, two generations alive, one of which is old and the other\nwhich is young and will survive until the end of the next period. Again, the old at time\nzero do not, in principle, benefit from future generations but that is no longer true for the\nyoung at time zero because their capital will be operated by the young in period one. In\na competitive environment, for instance, with no childbearing costs and positive cross-\npartial derivatives between capital and labour, the utility of the young at time zero never\ndecreases by adding one more member to generation 1, i.e. the set of individuals born in\nperiod one, because ceteris paribus the rate of return on capital in period one also goes up.\n\nIt is clear that we must adopt some allocation rule in order to be able to be more\nspecific about the number of children that present generations must have if they want to\nmaximize their utility. In this paper I will examine the case where present and future\ngenerations are constrained to be *' fair \", in the sense of the Rawlsian maximin, to every\nindividual who lives or is going to live during any subinterval of the planning period (stretch-\ning from zero to the indefinite future) under the assumption that it is possible to allocate\nconsumpd\u00fcon freely among individuals subject only to the technological constraints.\nConsequently, we are going to be looking at a typical problem of a central planning agency\nwhen its objective is to maximize the welfare of present generations but it is constrained to\nabide by the dictates of the maximin principle.\n\nThe present approach, with its emphasis on the welfare of the living generations, is\nby no means typical of the optimal population literature, most of which is instead con-\ncerned with the maximization of a sum of utilities (see, e.g. Meade (1955), Dasgupta (1969,\n1974), Pitchford (1972)). This objective may very well imply sacrificing present generations'\nutilities in favour of the future ones. Consider, for instance, the Meade-Dasgupta maxi-\nmand (see Meade (1955), Dasgupta (1969)), consisting of a discounted or undiscounted\nsum of utilities weighted by the number of individuals in each generation. As shown by\nDasgupta (1969), it is possible to find conditions under which, in the Solow-Swan model\nwith non-overlapping generations, it would be optimal (according to his criterion) to have\npositive population at every point in time, implying that present generations would have to\nrefrain from consuming all the available capital. Therefore, in a Dasgupta optimal plan\nthe present generation is worse off than it would be if it had no descendants and ate up all\n\n59\n"

This result will be shown to be reversed when\nthe same government is operating within a Phillips curve framework that generates counter-\nclockwise cycles in the inflation/unemployment plane.\n\nWe may recall that the cyclical behaviour of the inflation/unemployment rates observed\nby A. W. Phillips [3] for pre-1957 Great Britain tended to be in a counterclockwise direction\naround the average relationship. The United States, during that same period, bears witness\nto a roughly similar experience, although somewhat less pronounced. In more recent work,\nH. I. Grossman [1] maintains that, in the post-World War II period, the cyclical movement\nof inflation and unemployment seems to have been reversed. A quick glance at the\nAmerican data will support this observation, in particular for the post-1954 period.\n\nIn view of these observations, I would like to develop a general macroeconomic\nframework which can take account of both types of cyclical movements. The structure of\nthis framework consists of the following equations:\n\nu\u2014F[n-Anf]w-ywb \u2014 F'\u00ab0, 0cy,A\u00ab1 (1)\n\u00fcr \u2014 f(u,\u2014ur) Bzo ..(2)\nXP \u2014 a(n,\u2014nP) a z0 ..(3)\n\nwhere 7 denotes ** the expected long-run level of \", and u, and z, are the unemployment and\ninflation rates respectively. Hence, (1 \u2014uP) is the level of employment which firms expect\nto require in the ** long-run \"'.\n\nIn order to obtain an understanding of the workings of this model, let us proceed\ndirectly to the extreme cases; where alternatively f \u2014 O0 and then \u00abo \u2014 0.\n\n(a) When f \u2014 0 and \u00ab4-0, we obtain the basic adaptive inflationary expectations\naugmented Phillips curve model which can be rewritten as:\n\nn, \u2014 F^ ![u,\u2014 yuF] - AE, .. (4)\n\nalong with (3), and where (u5) can then be interpreted as some '* natural \" unemployment\nrate. This was the model employed in Nordhaus [2], within which vote-maximizing policy\n\n369\n",

                    "1l. INTRODUCTION\n\nFeldstein [1] has suggested recently that the growth of social security pension schemes has\na dual impact on personal savings. Firstly, there is a savings replacement effect which\nleads to a reduction in personal savings and, secondly, an induced retirement effect which\nleads to an increase in savings which has to be spread over a longer retirement period.\nIt is argued that as a scheme becomes more established the induced retirement effect\ndiminishes. This implies that when one comes to consider the effect of changes in pension\nbenefits and contributions with a well-developed scheme the savings replacement effect\noperates almost in isolation.\n\nIn this paper a private pension scheme is introduced from which the individual can\nreceive a pension some years before he becomes eligible to receive the state pension. It is\nshown that it is then possible for both the growth of the private scheme and changes in\nstate and private pension contributions and benefits to have an effect on savings determined\nby the savings replacement and induced retirement effects.\n\n2. INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT BEHAVIOUR\n\nIt is assumed that an individual lives for L years and is retired from period 7, a date which\nhe is free to choose. If he is retired on or after period 7, he receives the state pension at a\nflat rate p. The private pension is organized through a terminal salary scheme whereby the\nindividual contributes a constant proportion o, 0\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab 1, of his wage income w(7) into the\nscheme in return for a pension f(T)w(T), 0 \u00abf \u00ab1, in every period of retirement, the earliest\npossible date of receipt being 7; \u00ab T,. The scale of benefits, as given by fi(.), is a function\nof the retirement date. An individual who retires before he is eligible for the state pension\nwill still receive it from 73.\nIn addition the following assumptions are made:\n\n(Al) all income and price variables are known with certainty;\n(A2) there is a perfect capital market ;\n(A3) terminal bequests are fixed and can therefore be ignored;\n\n(A4) the individual's intertemporal utility function depends only on the intertemporal\nconsumption stream: utility is an increasing function of consumption expendi-\nture in any one period and consumption expenditure in each period is a normal\ngood, increasing as total lifetime income increases.\n\nThe individual's problem is to choose an optimal retirement date. 'The above assump-\ntions imply that it will be that value of 7' which maximizes the discounted present value of\nlifetime income.\n",

INTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the central aims in the theory of economic growth is to characterize optimal paths\nby a system of competitive or efficiency prices.\n\nWe work in a multi-sector economy with production and consumption over time.\nOur model is a generalization of Radner's model [16] similar to that presented by Dana [4].\n\nA. central planner has to decide how to divide the available commodities, at each period,\nbetween consumption and production according to some criterion of optimality. The\nplanner may face uncertainty about technological progress in future, natural resources and\ntheir locations, labour, etc. In this work we assume (as in [4], [16], that there is uncertainty\nabout the production possibilities and the (exogenous) supply of resources which are\nessential to production. Uncertainty, at each period, is represented by the occurrence of\nsome *' state of the environment \" which is independent of the planner's decisions; these\nuncertainties arise similarly in successive planning periods. The sequence of ** states \" is\nrepresented by a stochastic process on some probability space, where the probability\ndistribution on the set of sequences of '*'states\" is known completely. \"This is more\ngeneral than considering a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables\n(as in [3], [10]) or a stationary Markov process in which the transition probability is given\n(as in [15], [7]).\n\nThe evaluation of feasible programmes is done by a generalization of Gale's ** catching-\nup \" criterion (see [6]), namely, we maximize the expected sum of non-discounted utilities.\nThis criterion is sensitive to an increment of utility at any period and gives equal treatment\nto all periods.\n\nSuppose that a certain programme is optimal according to the planner's evaluation.\nIs there a price system such that in this programme producers maximize their profits and\nconsumers maximize their utility? We prove that each optimal programme can be sustained\nby prices (which are integrable functions) such that at each date: (a) at almost all ** states \"\",\nthe optimal production maximizes the expected intertemporal profit; (b) the optimal\nconsumption, almost surely, minimizes the ** cost \" among all consumption vectors yielding\nno less utility. Moreover, these prices are also Malinvaud prices for the optimal programme\n(see [9]), i.e. the terminal cost minimization conditions are satisfied. To prove this result\nwe define valuation functions and use dynamical programming methods.\n",

In fact, Samuelson argues that there are as many Bergson functions\nas there are r-tuples of preferences in the domain of Arrow's function, and hence the\nimpossibility theorem has nothing to do with Bergson's welfare function.

FORMALITIES\n\nFollowing Arrow [1], we consider a set of 7 individuals (labelled 1, 2, ..., \u00bb) who each sub-\nscribe to a preference relation over a set S of alternatives. Each individual preference\nrelation R; is supposed to be * rational\" in the sense that it is reflexive, transitive and\ncomplete. (For this and other terminology, see Sen [2].) The set of all rational preference\nrelations will be denoted by \u00a3P.\n\nWe consider functions f which are defined on a subset of A\" and whose values\n\nR \u2014 f(R,, R5, ..., R))\nare relations on the set S. Such a function will be called a constitutional function. lt is\nnatural to consider first the case when\ndom f \u2014 I\".\nThis will be referred to as condition (U). Also natural is the condition\nrange f \u20ac IR.\nThis is the condition of ** Collective Rationality \" (CR).\nThe condition of the ** Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives \"' (T) asserts that the\n\ncollective preference over a pair (x, y] of alternatives is independent of the individual\npreferences over pairs other than (x, y). (For a full account, see Sen [2].)\n\nTheorem 1 (Wilson [3]). Except for authoritarian constitutional functions\n(CR) ^ (D -(U).\n\nThe word ** authoritarian \" appearing in the theorem needs to be defined. The use\nof this word is perhaps not entirely justifiable but it is used in the absence of anything more\nappropriate. Its precise definition is given below.\n\nConsider a constitutional function f which partitions the set S' of alternatives into\ndisjoint subsets, the collective preference between elements of distinct subsets being imposed\nregardless of the nature of the individual preferences. If, on each of the subsets which have\nmore than two members, at least one individual is a dictator or an anti-dictator, then we\nshall say that f is authoritarian.

                    "Nordhaus' recent paper in this Review [1] is of particular interest as it offers an explicit\nanalysis of the interaction between the economy and the polity, albeit for a partial section\nof the economy only. It analyses both the steady-state equilibrium and the disequilibrium\npaths within electoral periods. This comment is directed to the first part only, where the\nlong-run choice in democratic systems over the course of many electoral periods is studied.\nNordhaus reaches the ** fundamental long-run result \" that:\n\n** 'The democratic outcome corresponds to the policy which was found . . . to be purely\nmyopic. That is, it comes at the point where the implicit rate of time preference is\ninfinite \" [1, p. 179].\n\nThis implies that a democratic government chooses a point on the long-run Phillips-curve\nthat has lower unemployment and higher inflation than optimal.\n\nThis comment is intended to show that Nordhaus' result is not an attribute of a\ndemocratic government as such, but rather depends on the specific assumptions made\nabout the government's utility function. If another\u2014equally plausible\u2014utility function\nis used, quite different results follow. Using the same assumptions about voters evaluations\nof unemployment and inflation and about the trade-off between the two, it turns out that\nunemployment is always higher, and inflation correspondingly lower, than Nordhaus\nsuggests to be typical for a democracy.\n\nThe economic model is unchanged, but instead of the goal of vote-maximization\n[1, p. 174] it is assumed that a government wants to maximize the length of time which it\ncan expect to remain uninterruptedly in power. It seems plausible that government poli-\nticians are not only interested in winning the next election but do in fact look beyond it,\nespecially if they are confident of winning the forthcoming election. The younger party\nmembers will exert particular pressure in this direction as they are interested in ensuring\nthat their party is still popular with the voters in the future, when they have a chance to\ntake over governmental jobs.!\n\nTo formalize this idea, the aggregate voting function g,(\u2014u, \u20147) may be interpreted\nas the government's probability of election (or re-election) in period n (0 \u20ac g,\u00ab1). A\ngovernment may stay in power over periods ? \u2014 1, 2, ..., oo. The probability of being in\npower in period 1 and not being elected in period 2 is g,(1 \u201492); the probability of being in\npower both in period 1 and 2, but of being defeated in period 3 is g,:g;,(1\u201493), etc. In\ngeneral, the probability of being in power uninterruptedly over n periods and of being\ndefeated in period n--1 is II1g,(1\u20149,,,). The expected length of time in power is the\nsum of the various periods of being in government, weighted by the above probability\n\no0 t\n$ 11-942 II 2- (1)\nt\u2014-1 T\u2014-1\n\nThis expression may also be derived by assuming a discrete utility function taking the\nvalue one if the party is in power, and zero otherwise. The expected utility of n uninterrupted\nperiods in government is n(1\u20149,,,)II1g,. The sum of expected utilities over all possible\ngovernment periods is equation (1). Using the assumption that a democratic government\n\n553\n",

FINE\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n\nIn Part I of this paper [2] it was shown that certain appealing conditions forced any social\nquasi-ordering rule to include the positional rule, which is itself the intersection of all\nfinite ranking (f.r. rules. These conditions are slightly strengthened in the first three\nsections of this part, but this allows us to characterize in Section 3 the rules that also\nsatisfy the additional properties as the intersection of some set of f.r. rules. In case a con-\ntinuity property, which can be interpreted as a non-veto condition applied to groups, does\nnot hold, the set of f.r. rules must be extended to include transfinite weightings. Section 1\nfinds sufficient conditions for a quasi-ordering rule to be positional. This is used in Section\n2 to prove the results contained in Section 3 for the special case of a social ordering rule,\nwhen a single f.r. rule emerges. This special case is then generalized in Section 3.\n\nIn Section 4, for the first time in the paper, we analyse conditions that recognize\nsocial decision depending upon the number of alternatives. Previously, only the number\nof individuals has been effectively allowed to vary. Again, simple and natural properties\nhave powerful consequences, and it is thereby shown that the Borda rule is a compelling\nchoice for making social decision, given a veil of ignorance, that is no knowledge of the\nspecial features of the individuals and alternatives concerned. Incase only a quasi-ordering\nrule is required, social decision is based on the intersection of a set of f.r. rules symmetrical\nabout the Borda rule.\n\nIn Section 5 we turn to choice structure rules. First a positional choice structure is\ndefined. It is the strongest such rule containing all the f.r. rules, since an alternative in a\nset belongs to the choice from that set iff for some f.r. it is best in the set. This last condi-\ntion is shown to be equivalent to demanding that the HC of that element does not belong\nto the convex hull of the HC of the other alternatives in the set. Then an outline is made\nfor a conditions analysis of the rule: it is found to be the weakest rule satisfying certain\nconditions, in the sense that any other rule satisfying those conditions must be more\ndecisive. In this, the method, results and analysis correspond to Part I's consideration\nof the positional quasi-ordering rule.\n\nSection 6 is devoted to an examination of some questions concerned with the in-\ndependence of conditions and Section 7 contains concluding remarks. The above only\nsketches the major results of this paper. In addition, the analysis of normal social quasi-\nordering rules in Section 2 and Section 3 has obvious relevance to the theory of production\nand utility under risk in the presence of indivisibility.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that throughout this part, individual preferences are assumed\nto be antisymmetrical. Whilst the complications posed by individual indifference were\n\n1 First version received April 1973; final version accepted November 1973 (Eds.).\n\n2 The first part of the paper [2] was written up by K. Fine and the second by B. Fine. Both authors\nhave contributed to all sections of the paper, though the first has contributed more to the material on the\npositional rule and the second to the material on normal social rules. Some of the results for ordering\nrules in this paper have been independently established by Smith [12].\n\n459\n"

            "found": "Inefficiency and the Demand for\n\"* Money\" in a Sequence Economy \"'\n\nDAVID STARRETT\nHarvard University\n\nSeveral authors have recently attempted to incorporate transactions costs and/or incomplete\ninformation into models of general equilibrium (see, for example, Foley [3], Radner [7]\nand Starr [9]). Of particular interest to us here is the model of Professor Hahn [4]. His\nmodel has the following properties (among others).\n\n1. Perfect certainty; in particular, prices on all markets (both spot and future) are\nknown for sure by all agents at the outset.\n\n2. Convexity in the transactions technology; in the presentation transaction opera-\ntions essentially take the place of production operations as there is no independent\nproduction sector.\n\nA. model with these properties seems, at first glance, to be isomorphic to another in\nwhich *'sold \" goods and ** bought\" goods are different commodities, and there is a\nproduction technology for transforming the one into the other. In such a model we would\nsurely expect that if efficiency is defined relative to the transactions technology, then a\ncompetitive equilibrium would be efficient (all the assumptions of the standard theory\nwould seem to be satisfied).\n\nHowever, Professor Hahn argued that competitive efficiency (in the sense defined\nabove) was highly unlikely. The argument was persuasive, but not completely convincing,\nsince no actual examples of inefficiency were given. In this paper we seek first to elucidate\nthe inefficiency by example. Having done so, we discover that the inefficiency can provide\na rational demand for a certain type of money. For ease of exposition, the analysis is\ncarried out entirely by example in Part I. \u00c0 general treatment is deferred until Part II.\n"

                    "I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of competitive equilibrium has always been concerned with the *' stability\nof that price structure which clears the commodity market. The earlier economists defined\nthe concept of stability, and tended to assume it without giving a rigorous analysis of the\nstability hypothesis. Hicks [8] presented well-known conditions for stability, but in so\ndoing failed to consider the dynamic process of price adjustment through time. None-\ntheless, in a classic paper Metzler [12] pointed out that if all commodities are gross\nsubstitutes, the Hicksian conditions for perfect stability are identical to the conditions for\nstability in a dynamic sense. This discovery, brilliant as it was, turned out to be only a\nprelude to a more exciting theme. In later developments, it was established by Negishi\n\n15], Hahn [7], Arrow and Hurwicz [2], and Arrow, Block and Hurwicz [1] that a com-\npetitive equilibrium is indeed dynamically stable for a gross substitute economy.\n\nDespite the central place it occupies, the assumption of gross substitutability represents\na serious drawback to the stability literature. Although we can certainly dispose of com-\nplementarity of a technical nature often observed among several commodities by a simple\nprocess of aggregation, it is impossible to assume away weak gross complements without\nloss of generality. It should be noted, however, that the absence of gross complements\nis by no means a necessary condition for dynamic stability. Thus, the difficulty associated\nwith universal gross substitutability should not totally undermine the stability hypothesis.\nThis point, well recognized in the literature, is of course of little interest unless one is able\nto identify meaningful classes of competitive systems in which both complementarity and\nstability are present. This paper attempts to proceed a few steps forward in this direction\nvia the natural route of extending the Metzlerian gross substitute system.\n\nWe shall first propose three distinct, but closely related generalizations of the\nMetzlerian system. Subsequently, in Section III, these generalized systems will be shown\nto be locally stable even though they may include elements of gross complementarity.\nTo indicate the extent to which the Metzler theorem carries through, we shall also demon-\nstrate that the Hicksian conditions are necessarily satisfied for a particular pair of these\ngeneralized systems. From this, we can directly proceed to comparative statics. In\nSection IV we shall present a result of comparative statics closely analogous to the one\nobtainable for the original Metzlerian system. This result, far stronger than the one\nimplied by the Hicksian conditions, will be seen to hold for a (different) pair of the proposed\ngeneralizations. To illustrate the nature of our concepts, a numerical example will then\nbe considered briefly. Finally, in Section V, we shall discuss some related literature,\nespecially an alternative line of generalization suggested by Morishima [13], [14].\n\n1 First version received November 1970; final version received October 1971 (Eds.).\n\n2 'This paper is taken from my Ph.D. thesis submitted to the University of Rochester in February\n1972.

Real-time decentralized processing\u2014\nwhich models the computation of decision rules in a temporal decision problem by members of\nan organization\u2014captures both the cost of computation in terms of the members' time and the\nconstraints imposed by computational delay on the use of recent information. Unlike a batch\nprocessing model, it has no single measure of delay because decisions are computed from data of\nheterogeneous lags. Furthermore, decentralization does not unambiguously reduce delay, because\nprocessing a message precludes processing current data.\n",

Mod-\nelling the information processing constraints of economic agents, whether these agents are\nindividuals or organizations, is a way of understanding how the decision rules that arise\ngiven these constraints differ from those predicted by models with unboundedly rational\nagents.\n\nFor organizations, such modelling has an additional motivation. Information pro-\ncessing is decentralized in organizations; that is, it is performed jointly by the members of\nthe organizations. Therefore, as has long been emphasized in management science and by\nbusiness historians such as Chandler (1966, 1990), information processing is itself an econ-\nomic activity\u2014one that is an important determinant of the structure of organizations and\nthat uses significant resources. For example, the members of a firm's administrative staff\nare hired precisely because there is no unboundedly rational entrepreneur who could con-\ntrol the firm in the way that is often assumed in economic models.\n\nEconomists have used various approaches to modelling information processing by the\nadministrative staffs of organizations. One is to model constraints on communication\nbetween a fixed number of agents, such as in the literatures on communication mechanisms!\nand team theory.? This approach attempts only to explain the decision procedures of exogen-\nously given agents. In fact, information transmission costs cannot explain why those who\n",

First, what is\nthe impact of being offered JTPA classroom training on the duration of unemployment and\nemployment? Second, what is the effect of actually participating in this training on the length of\nsuch spells? Belonging to the treatment group shortens unemployment spells but has no effect on\nemployment spells. Actually participating in training has a larger positive effect on the exit rate\nfrom unemployment than the effect of simply being a member of the treatment group. Ignoring\nthe endogeneity of actual training in estimation substantially underestimates its effect.\n",

This consensus is reinforced by\na recent experimental study of adult women who were offered access to classroom training\nadministered under the U.S. Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) (Bloom er. al. (1993)).\nStudies suggest that these gains usually result more from increased weeks of employment\nthan from increased hourly wages or increased hours per week for those who are employed.\n\nIn this paper we address two questions about the impact of classroom training (CT)\non the labour market histories of adult women who participated in the National JTPA\nStudy. First, we ask whether being a member of the treatment group increased employment\n\n655\n",

A dynamic utility maximization model\nis presented and estimated using longitudinal data on women from the Panel Study of Income\nDynamics. The MLE method employed, involves solving a dynamic programming problem.\nFurther, a minimum distance estimator is proposed which allows for the incorporation of wage\ndata in a computationally simple way. The estimates are used to predict changes in the life-cycle\npatterns of employment, marriage and divorce due to differences in education, race, the female's\nearnings and her (potential) husband's earnings. The estimation results indicate that the utility\ngains to marriage are decreasing in the female's wage rate and increasing in her (potential) hus-\nband's earnings, while the opposite is found for gains to working. Ignoring the endogeneity of\nmarital status decisions is shown to lead to an underestimation of own and husband's wage effects\non female labour supply.\n",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe American family has undergone a major transformation over the last four decades.\nThis change was characterized by a large increase in the labour force participation rate\nof married women, a sharp increase in the rate of divorce, a drop in the fertility rate and\nan increase in the number of female-headed households and never-married men and\nwomen. These demographic trends have led to an increased recognition among labour\neconomists of the importance of household structure in the study of individual and family\nlabour supply. In the study of female labour supply, for example, there is growing aware-\nness that both marital status and fertility decisions are strongly interrelated with female\nlabour supply decisions and can therefore no longer be considered exogenous from a life-\ncycle perspective. The presence of children (especially when they are young) is known to\nhave a strong negative effect on the mother's labour supply. Consequently, female wages\nand labour force experience could be expected to play an important role in decisions on\nthe timing and number of births.\n\nFemale labour force participation decisions have also been found to depend strongly\non the marital status of women. In addition, economic theories of marriage imply a strong\ncorrelation between a female's return in the labour market and her 'return' in the marriage\nmarket, measured in terms of utility gains from marriage. For example, according to\nBecker's (1973, 1974) theory of marriage, marital gains can be derived from the specializa-\ntion of labour within the household, which is found to depend negatively on the ratio of\nthe wife's to the husband's wage rate. Gains from marriage and therefore marital status\ndecisions will thus in general depend on a female's (potential) wage rate. If gains from\n\n199\n",

                    "The possibility of sunspot equilibria and endogenous cycles are explored in a two-sector\noverlapping-generations model with entry. It is shown that if prospective entrants act oligopolisti-\ncally as producers but competitively as consumers then a strategic complementarity between the\nentry decisions of agents across sectors and across time may arise. If the complementarity is\nsufficiently strong, the economy will have multiple, Pareto-ranked steady states. Stationary sunspot\nequilibria can then be constructed as a randomization between allocations in the neighbourhood\nof the multiple steady states providing a source of aggregate fluctuations.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe extent to which changes in beliefs can be important factors in initiating economic\nfluctuations has been a prominent area of investigation for macroeconomists. The notion\nthat beliefs about the future influence current decisions is a property of almost all dynamic\neconomic systems. The more challenging task is identifying economic environments in\nwhich changes in beliefs alone influence current choices in such a way that the variations\nin beliefs are self-fulfilling. Because the resulting fluctuations arise in the absence of\nvariations in fundamental variables such as preferences and technology, they are often\ntermed *'sunspot equilibria\". Apart from suggesting that instability of expectations may\nbe a distinct source of cyclical volatility, sunspot equilibria may also explain why\napparently small disturbances in fundamentals lead to large change in macroeconomic\naggregates.'\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate the possibility of sunspot equilibria in an overlapping-\ngenerations economy characterized by a plausible form of strategic complementarity: as\nmore agents enter as producers in any particular sector of the economy, they create an\nincentive for agents to enter as producers into other sectors as well? The basis for this\n\n1. Woodford (1987) provides additional arguments for the consideration of sunspot equilibria.\n\n2. Strategic complementarity is a condition on the direction of the strategic interaction between players\nin a game and has been useful in a variety of contexts in industrial organization (Bulow, Geanakopolos and\nKlemperer (1985)) and in macroeconomics (Cooper-John (1988)).\n\n795\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Tue, 08 Feb 2022 16:37:44 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

If an agent\ndefaults on a contract, he can be excluded from future contingent claims markets trading and can\nhave his assets seized. He cannot be excluded from spot markets trading, however, and he has some\nprivate endowments that cannot be seized. All information is publicly held and common knowledge,\nand there is a complete set of contingent claims markets. Since there is complete information, an\nagent cannot enter into a contract in which he would have an incentive to default in some state. In\ngeneral there is only partial insurance: variations in consumption may be imperfectly correlated\nacross agents; interest rates may be lower than they would be without constraints; and equilibria\nmay be Pareto ranked.\n"

The classical objective of value maximization\nis extended, but is indeterminate. Instead, firms are viewed as being subject to shareholder control\nvia some decision mechanism. As long as this decision mechanism is responsive to a unanimous\npreference by shareholders, shareholder control is consistent with but stronger than value maximiz-\nation. Next, the particular institution of majority voting by shareholders is examined. It is shown\nthat for generic economies, a majority rule equilibrium for a firm implies that production is\noptimal for the largest, or dominant, shareholder. Finally, a more realistic control mechanism is\nconsidered in which majority voting by shareholders is constrained by a group of shareholders,\nor Board of Directors, who control the voting agenda. The result is that shareholders not on the\nBoard have no influence on the equilibrium production choice of the firm.\n"

INTRODUCTION\n\nMost of the recently developed models of entry in oligopolistic markets and the theory\nof political competition deal with the case of dominant firms or parties which face a\nthreat of potential entry. These models possess a number of features on which they may\nbe compared and contrasted. The most important of these features are the ways in which\nthe existing parties or firms compete against each other for votes or profits, and types of\nexpectations the incumbents have about the responses of potential entrants to changes\nin their decisions. In most of the cases an electoral or oligopolistic competition is\nrepresented by some type of a non-cooperative game played by parties or firms.\n\nIn this paper we also consider a non-cooperative model of electoral race where the\nestablished parties (incumbents) compete against each other by offering positions\n(*ideologies\") to the population of voters. Given the profile of voters! preferences over\nthe space of *'ideologies\" (or, issue space), each of the established parties attempts to\nmaximize its vote share. In making their choices, the incumbents, however, anticipate\nthat a new party (an entrant) will join the electoral race. Consistent with the other parties'\nobjectives, the entrant is assumed to maximize its share of voters while taking the\nincumbents' choices as given. The resulting non-cooperative game possesses, therefore,\na structural hierarchy: the established parties behave as Nash players with respect to each\nother, whereas acting as Stackelberg leaders with respect to the entrant and correctly\nanticipating its vote-maximizing response to their choices in the issue space.\n\nThe main purpose of this paper is to study the properties of the game we described\nand, in particular, to characterize its equilibrium, which we will call **hierarchical equili-\nbrium\". Naturally, some assumptions are needed in order to guarantee the existence of\nthe equilibrium. We assume that there are two established parties, the issue space I is\nthe uni-dimensional interval, all voters have symmetric single peaked-peaked preferences\nover I and the distribution of the voters' ideal points is represented by a quasi-concave\ncontinuous density function. Under these rather mild assumptions, we are able to prove\nthe existence and uniqueness of the hierarchical equilibrium and to completely\ncharacterize it.\n",

                    "1. MOTIVATION\n\nFor games in which firms producing identical products compete in prices there are several\nwell-known results relating mixed-strategy Nash-equilibria to the Walrasian equilibrium\n(e.g. Allen and Hellwig (1986), Vives (1986)).! The purpose of this paper is to show that\nsome of these results remain true if one replaces the concept of mixed-strategy Nash-\nequilibria by the concept of iterated elimination of dominated strategies.\n\nThe paper has two motivations. One is that in our opinion the use of a more\nelementary solution concept makes the above results more transparent.\n\nThe other is that, as a model of non-cooperative behaviour, the concept of iterated\nelimination of dominated strategies assumes less coordination of the players! choices\nthan the concept of mixed-strategy Nash-equilibrium does. This is important in our\ncontext because the Walrasian equilibrium is intended to describe decentralized\neconomies, and hence a model providing non-cooperative foundations for Walras' concept\nis the more attractive the less coordination is assumed to exist exogeneously.\n\nThe difference between the concept of iterated elimination of dominated strategies\nand the concept of mixed-strategy Nash-equilibrium can be viewed in several ways. One\nis that the iterated elimination of dominated strategies is a procedure which in principle\nevery agent can carry out for himself. The analogue is true for mixed-strategy Nash-\nequilibria only if there is a unique equilibrium. If there are multiple equilibria then some\nkind of explicit pre-play communication is required to ensure that players coordinate to\nplay one particular equilibrium.\n\nAt a deeper level one can compare the formal informational assumptions required\nto justify the iterated elimination of dominated strategies with those required to justify\nmixed-strategy Nash equilibria. A natural framework for such a comparison is a formal\nmodel of common knowledge of the type suggested by Aumann (1976, 1987).\n\n1. An early analysis of mixed-strategy Nash-equilibria in price games is contained in Shubik (1959). An\nalternative approach has been suggested by Dixon (1987) who investigates epsilon-equilibria.\n163\n",

                    "This paper discusses why redundant skilled workers may be reluctant to accept interim\nunskilled jobs. If skilled work is more satisfying or less arduous for highly productive workers,\nthen such workers invest more in moving quickly between skilled jobs. Thus, high productivity\nworkers tend to search on-the-job, and if unemployed will specialise in job search, rather than\ntake an interim position. If individual differences in productivity are known to the worker but\nnot the potential employer, then search strategy may be used as a productivity signal, with more\nthan the efficient proportion of workers searching on-the-job and too few accepting interim\nunskilled jobs. Optimal policy requires a subsidy on interim unskilled jobs.\n",
                    "The primary aim of this paper is to consider why unemployed skilled workers are\napparently reluctant to take temporary unskilled jobs, preferring to \"stick to their trade\",\nand accepting a possibly long unemployment spell, during which little search may occur.\nWhilst commonplace in Britain, this phenomenon is also significant in the U.S.\u2014for\nexample, Clark and Summers (1979). Bulow and Summers (1986) capture this in a dual\neconomy model by assuming that primary sector jobs are offered to the unemployed, but\nnot to secondary sector workers.\n\nFour reasons have been advanced to explain why a competitive unskilled jobs sector\nmight fail to absorb unemployed workers not undertaking significant amounts of search\nwhile waiting for a skilled job. First, the level of unemployment benefit may discourage\nsuch work. Second, the threat of unionization may cause the unskilled wage to be set\nabove the market clearing level. Third, in the segmented labour market literature, taking\nbad jobs has been conjectured to have a long term \"'scarring effect\", reducing skills and\nthereby future earnings. (See Taubman and Wachter (1986).) Fourth, the remote location\nof secondary sector employment may prevent on-the-job search for primary sector jobs\n(Harris and Todaro (1970)). In the model described in the next section workers' reluctance\nto take interim jobs arises because secondary sector employment reduces future earnings,\nbut unlike the segmented labour market models, unskilled work need not reduce future\nproductivity.\n\nThe primary hypothesis advanced here is that under a plausible behavioural assump-\ntion\u2014namely, that within a skill category, more productive workers find skilled work\nmore satisfying or less arduous than less productive workers\u2014job search decisions may\nact as a productivity signal. The starting points for the work here are the important\ncontributions on information creation by Spence (1974), Akerlof (1970, 1976), Salop and\nSalop (1976), Guasch and Weiss (1980, 1981), and Burdett and Mortensen (1981).

INTRODUCTION\n\nIn most economic models of communication, information is collected once and transmitted in a\nsingle piece from a sender to a receiver (Crawford and Sobel, 1982; Aghion and Tirole, 1997;\nMorris, 2001). In many realistic settings, however, a sender receives multiple pieces of informa-\ntion over time and is asked to convey his opinion multiple times as more information comes in.?\nFormal sequential reports are frequently observed in congressional committees, accounting (Dye\nand Verrecchia, 1995), capital budgeting (Arya et al., 1997), and the financial market (Penno,\n1985). Informally, consultants, doctors, and other professionals are often asked to convey their\nearly opinions before giving a final assessment.\n\nIn many of these environments, information received later may contain less noise than that\nreceived earlier and is thus of higher quality. For instance, a December survey of consumer de-\nmand for hybrid cars next year may be more accurate than a similar one taken in July. Moreover,\nthe sender's ability to observe the underlying true state of the world may improve as he becomes\nmore familiar with the task at hand. In either case, the sender typically cares about how all his re-\nports reflect on his ability. This paper investigates how an agent of privately known ability reacts\nstrategically to improvement in the quality of his information under a sequential reports system.\nIt also applies these insights to the optimal choice of reporting protocols. Namely, it identifies\nconditions under which the principal should require a single report after the agent has received\nall the information, and conditions under which she should ask for sequential reports instead.\n\nl1. Inreply to accusation of inconsistency: The Economist, 1999-12-18, p.47.\n\n2. Throughout this paper, the receiver of information who then makes decisions (the principal) is female and the\nsender of information (the agent) is male.\n",

The\nfear of falling under an equally inefficient and venal ruler that favours another group is enough to discipline\nsupporters. The model predicts extensive use of patronage, ethnic bias in taxation, and spending patterns\nand unveils a new mechanism through which economic frictions translate into increased rent extraction by\nthe leader.

                    "1. INTRODUCTION\n\nInstitutions are important determinants of economic development, as different strands of research\nhave emphasized. Political institutions, in particular, influence policy determination by placing\nconstraints on the behaviour of leaders and inducing them to take into account the well-being of\ntheir citizens. When these institutions are weak, examples abound of rulers who have been able to\nextract enormous rents from power in a seemingly unconstrained manner.! However, these rulers\nhave also engaged in extensive redistribution of resources in surprisingly inefficient ways, which\nsuggests the existence of constraints on the exercise of power. Specifically, they often raised\nrevenue through costly market manipulations and then spent on inoperative bureaucracies that\nserved as distribution channels for patronage? Surprisingly, in spite of their conspicuous wealth\naccumulation and their mismanagement of the economy, many of these leaders have enjoyed\nactive support from sizeable shares of their impoverished populations.? This raises the following\nquestions: Why does any part of the population support these leaders? Why do these leaders\nchoose to engage in wasteful patronage transfers? Why are these leaders seemingly unaccountable\nto their own supporters?\n\nTo answer these questions, this paper develops a simple framework to analyse political ac-\ncountability when societies are ethnically divided and institutions are weak. The starting point is\na political agency model in which three assumptions are maintained:\n\nl. Since this is particularly the case in post-colonial sub-Saharan Africa, I will concentrate on illustrative examples\nfrom this continent. Several rulers such as Mobutu, Moi, or Houphouet-Boigny have been estimated to possess personal\nfortunes equivalent to the total foreign debt accumulated by their countries (see Ayittey (1992) or Mbaku (2000) for an\naccount of the extent of rent extraction).\n\n2. See Bates (1981), Collier and Gunning (1999), and Easterly and Levine (1997) for an account of the long list\nof inefficient redistributive interventions and their economic effects in Africa.\n\n3. In many instances, large populations are easily mobilized by the regime: ethnic voting is such an example and\nis pervasive in the African continent. This support can also include decentralized violence against the opposition such as\nin Rwanda in 1994 or in contemporary Zimbabwe. Note also that some of the presumed authoritarian leaders, such as\nBenin's K\u00e9r\u00e9kou, have been re-elected when multiparty elections have been introduced.\n\n1259\n",

We find that such PTAs increase the cost of multilateral\ntariff reductions and thus cause a stumbling block to global free trade. This occurs because multilateral\ntariff reductions decrease the threat that can be used in PTAs and thus the surplus that can be extracted\nfrom them. By explicitly modelling the interaction between preferential and multilateral negotiations, we\nderive a testable prediction and provide novel econometric evidence that supports the model's key pre-\ndiction. The welfare analysis shows that the current World Trade Organization rules allowing this type of\nPTAs may be optimal for economically large countries, thus the model can predict the rules we observe.\nWe also analyse alternative rules that constitute a Pareto improvement.\n",

                    "1. INTRODUCTION\n\nPreferential trade agreements (PTAs) are currently among the most important instruments of in-\nternational economic policy. Since 1995 at least 130 new PTAs were created worldwide, more\nthan doubling the number created in the previous 50 years. More than a third of world trade is\nestimated to be carried out under them. Traditionally, PTAs are studied simply as a reciprocal\nreduction of trade barriers, such as tariffs, among a set of countries. However, such reductions\nare often not the only or even the main motivation for PTAs. Many PTAs require cooperation\non issues that are not related to trade policy. The most obvious such agreement is the European\nUnion (E.U.) and its predecessors, which requires countries that want to accede to change their\nbehaviour on a broad set of issues such as environmental and labour standards, intellectual prop-\nerty, human rights, etc. As we describe below, this is far from an isolated case.\n\nEconomists generally support free trade, that is, non-preferential trade liberalization, but\nthere is no such consensus about the preferential liberalization that characterizes PTAs. The key\nconcern is that PTAs may be \"stumbling blocks\" to multilateral liberalization (Bhagwati, 1991);\nthat is, PTAs may halt or reverse the process that has allowed members of the General Agreement\non Tariffs and Trade (GATT)/World Trade Organization (WTO) to reduce their multilateral tariffs\nby over 9096 in the last 60 years (Staiger, 1995). One important channel through which this can\noccur is when PTA partners try to prevent reductions in their preference margins. This leads\nthem to oppose multilateral liberalization because it entails a reduction of tariffs that apply to all\npartners and thus it erodes preference margins. This problem was foreseen by Johnson (1967)\nand nearly caused the collapse of multilateral negotiations in 2004, prompting the International\n\n821\n",

                    "Contrary to conventional wisdom, a right to silence can reduce wrongful convictions of innocent\nsuspects who tell police the truth, and may reduce the overall conviction rate without affecting the\nconfession rate. We establish these conclusions by modelling interrogation as a game in which suspects are\nprivately informed of their type, but do not know the content of witness reports. Our model has testable\nimplications which distinguish it from competing models. The best data rejects competing models, but\ndoes not reject our model.\n",

INTRODUCTION\n\nSurely fewer persons will confess if police must warn them of their right to silence.\nCan it be supposed that the rule in question has been established with the intention of\nprotecting [the innocent]? They are the only persons to whom it can never be useful.?\n\n1\n",
                    "Common law criminal systems have typically given suspects in criminal trials a \"right to silence\":\nif the suspect does not answer police questions then the jury must condition its verdict on the\nother evidence alone, deciding as if the suspect had not in fact been interrogated. The Supreme\nCourt decided in Miranda v. Arizona (1966) that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination would be violated were the jury to draw an adverse inference from silence after\nthe suspect received a Miranda warning.? The right to silence was first formalized in England in\n1897, and was attenuated by the 1994 Criminal Justice Act, which allowed prosecutors to invite\nadverse inferences from a refusal to answer certain material questions.^\n\nThe Miranda decision is/was regarded as the apotheosis of the Warren Court's\njurisprudence, but the right to silence was controversial before then.? There seem to be two\nreasons why it has attracted such fierce criticism.\n",

                    "(1) It prevents the jury from using potentially informative evidence, as do hearsay and other\nexclusion rules. Furthermore, Bentham (1825) argued that the right seems particularly\negregious as it is only advantageous to suspects who are factually guilty. On closer\ninspection, Bentham's argument has two parts: a factual claim that innocent suspects do\nnot exercise the right, and a theoretical claim that a suspect can only gain from the right if\nshe exercises it.\n\n1l. Cassell (1996, p. 389). J. Harlan (dissenting from the majority opinion in Miranda) claimed that \"The Court's\nnew code would markedly decrease the number of confessions\".\n\n2. Bentham (1825, p. 241).\n\n3. See J. Warren's majority opinion (fn. 37) and the Court's decision in Doyle v. Ohio (1976). The Supreme Court\nreaffirmed the Miranda decision in Dickerson v. U.S. (2000). See Amar (1997, Chapter 2) for a provocative account of\nthe principles underlying the Fifth Amendment.\n\n4. While invocation of Miranda rights ends interrogation, English suspects had to exercise their rights question-\nby-question before 1994. The right to legal advice was included in the 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act. See\nSeidmann and Stein (2000) for more details.\n\n5. Posner (1999, p. 1533) describes the right as the most hallowed, and yet at the same time the most questionable\nof the evidentiary privileges\".\n",

The procedures effectively filter return data for\nunspecified historical biases in the market's priors. They do not involve explicit estimation of the market's\npriors, and hence, economize on parameters. The procedures derive from a new but simple property of\nBayesian learning, namely: if the correct likelihood is used, the inverse posterior at the true parameter\nvalue forms a martingale process relative to the learner's information filtration augmented with the true\nparameter value. Application of this central result to tests of asset pricing models requires a deliberate\nselection bias. Hence, as a by-product, the article establishes that biased samples contain information with\nwhich to falsify an asset pricing model or estimate its parameters. These include samples subject to, e.g.\nsurvivorship bias or Peso problems.\n"

A simple formula for the high income optimal tax\nrate is obtained as a function of these elasticities and the thickness of the top tail of the income\ndistribution. In the general non-linear income tax problem, this method using elasticities shows\nprecisely how the different economic effects come into play and which are the key relevant param-\neters in the optimal income tax formulas of Mirrlees. The optimal non-linear tax rate formulas\nare expressed in terms of elasticities and the shape of the income distribution. These formulas are\nimplemented numerically using empirical earning distributions and a range of realistic elasticity\nparameters.\n"

                    "If an investor wants to form a portfolio of risky assets and can exert effort to collect information\non the future value of these assets before he invests, which assets should he learn about? The best\nassets to acquire information about are ones the investor expects to hold. But the assets the investor\nholds depend on the information he observes. We build a framework to solve jointly for investment\nand information choices, with general preferences and information cost functions. Although the optimal\nresearch strategies depend on preferences and costs, the main result is that the investor who can first\ncollect information systematically deviates from holding a diversified portfolio. Information acquisition\ncan rationalize investing in a diversified fund and a concentrated set of assets, an allocation often\nobserved, but usually deemed anomalous.\n",
                    "The asset management industry is in the business of acquiring information and using that\ninformation to manage a portfolio of assets. While the rationality of asset portfolios and financial\nservices is hotly contested, little is known about what kind of information rational-expectations\ninvestors should learn. Since the information learned determines which assets are invested in,\nunderstanding information acquisition is central to understanding investment behaviour. This\npaper investigates the interplay between information choice and the investment problem.\nInvestment choices with given information and information choices with a single risky asset\nhave each been studied before.! But analysing the two choices jointly delivers new insights.\nSpecifically, the feedback of one decision on the other can generate gains to specialization.\nWhen choosing information, investors can acquire noisy signals about future payoffs of many\n",
                    "1. Recent work on the role of information in portfolio choice includes: Biasis, Bossaerts and Spatt (2009),\nBanerjee (2007), Maenhout (2004), Bernhardt, Seiler and Taub (2008), Albuquerque, Bauer and Schneider (2007),\nKodres and Pritsker (2002), Wang (1993), and Admati (1985) and is reviewed by Brunnermeier (2001). Recent work\non learning with one risky asset includes: Barlevy and Veronesi (2000), Bullard, Evans and Honkapohja (2005),\nPeress (2004), and Cagetti, Hansen, Sargent and Williams (2002). Learning by a representative agent is modelled\nby Sims (2003), Peng (2005) and Timmermann (1993); these models cannot address portfolio allocation because a\nrepresentative agent must hold the market portfolio for the market to clear. The most closely related work is done by\nPeress (2009), who studies how exogenous differences in portfolios affect information acquisition, Vayanos (2003),\nwho studies the optimal organizational structure for transmitting investment information, and Brunnermeier, Gollier\nand Parker (2007) who consider the choice of optimism, which is the mean of a signal, in contrast to information\nallocation which is a choice of signal variance.\n",
