Conclusion\n\nThis concludes our analysis of the connections between the various sets of stability\nconditions. It was stated in the Introduction that the restriction to equal speeds of adjust-\nment k; would be relaxed later. This is easily done. Observe that the matrix M, defined\nby mi \u2014 ki ai, may be written in matrix notation as\n\nM \u2014 KA (18)\nwhere Kisdiag(k k,, . . . .. ; kw), and the Kk; are all positive. Now if any stable matrix\nA, upon multiplication by a diagonal matrix D, in turn gives a stable matrix if and only\nif all the diagonal elements of D are positive, then 4 is said, by Arrow and McManus\n(1958) to be D-stable. In economic terms, if 4 is D-stable, then if it is stable in the ordinary\nsense it will be stable for any (positive) set of speeds of adjustment (and only for a positive\nset). Now if A is Metzlerian (Enthoven and Arrow, 1956), or quasi-negative definite\n(Arrow and McManus, 1958), or has a quasi-dominant main diagonal (Theorem 13 of\nthis paper), it will be D-stable. Since these are the main stability conditions so far\ndiscovered (though C5a is not strictly a' stability condition), the restriction to identical\nspeeds of adjustment is seen to be of no great consequence:\n\nIf we are concerned with invariance of stability under transformation of num\u00e9raire\n(on the subject of general transformations see McManus, 1958), then each one of the\nn(m x m) matrices A that can be formed from the 5 excess demand functions will have\nto be stable if equilibrium is to be stable. This has already been discussed in connection\nwith C5a and C5b.\n\nThere remain a few open questions on the relation of the various stability conditions\nto each other. Two such problems will be discussed here. Does C3 imply C7 for a general\nmatrix 4 ? If A is Metzlerian, then the corollary to Theorem 16 says that the answer is\nyes, while it may be shown that if m is equal to 2, the answer is also yes. A further question,\nrelated to this, is whether, given that 4 is symmetric, C7 E Cl (as C2 E C1). Both prob-\nlems apparently turn upon whether, given that a matrix is symmetric and stable, there\nalways exists a positive vector /i satisfying C7, a proposition which seems extremely unlikely.?\n\nKingston, Jamaica. P. K. NEWMAN.\n\n! One application of this result is to the model of equilibrium in imperfect competition constructed\nby Smithies (1942) in a remarkable and unjustifiably neglected paper. If it is assumed that the cost functions\nare linear (not quadratic, as in the original model) then it may be shown that C7 is a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for stability in his model. This condition would be satisfied if the expected influence of a pro-\nducer's own price on his sales is greater than the sum of the expected influences of his rivals! prices, which\nis a condition mentioned by Smithies (1942, p.259).\n\n? Since this paper was written, Professor Arrow has sent me a numerical example confirming that\nsuch a positive vector does not always exist. Generalising this example a little, consider the matrix\n\n\u20141 a a\nG4 \u20141 \u2014a jr where$ \u00ab a \u2014\u00ab l1. This matrix is symmetrical and Hicksian, and hence stable ; but\na \u2014a \u20141\n\nit is easy to check that one cannot find a positive vector (/,, /, 43) such that C7 is satisfied.\n\nHahn's Theorem (14) has recently been independently proved by Takashi Negishi (Economerrica,\nJuly 1958), while yet another proof is due to Arrow and Hurwicz, in the October issue 1958 of the same\njournal, Essentially this theorem states that, if 4 is Mezlerian, then Hicksian imperfect stability (see foot-\nnote 1, page 4) is a sufficient condition for dynamic stability. \u2014 Metzler's original theorem (7) proved that\nHicksian perfect stability is necessary and sufficient for dynamic stability if 4 is Metzlerian. These results\ngive an easy alternative proof of Theorem 16, since if 4 obeys C5a, then stability implies '* perfect \" stability,\nwhich in turn implies imperfect stability. It follows that the equilibrium price vector satisfies the require-\nments of the vector / in C7, so C7 is necessary as well as sufficient, which is Theorem 16.\n\nAnother development since this paper was written is an article by M. E. Fisher and A. T. Fuller (Proc.\nCamb. Phil. Soc., 54, Part 4, October 1958) on the mathematics of such linear systems. Using their remark-\nable Theorem 1, it is easy to show that if 4 is Hicksian, then we can always find a positive diagonal matrix\nD such that the product matrix DA has all its roots real, distinct and negative, and so is stable.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.:ffff:ffff:ffff on Thu, 01 Jan 1976 12:34:56 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

            "found": "CAPITAL LEVIES IN WESTERN EUROPE 41\n\nThis leaves the alternative of levy by some non-fiscal device, which means in practice\na blocage. No doubt a permanent blocage is less clumsy than a fiscal levy. But unless\nthe inclusion of non-monetary assets would not materially affect the distribution of the\nburden a fiscal levy would appear to be advantageous on equity grounds, except where the\nmethods of valuation of non-monetary assets are very unsatisfactory. A temporary\nblocage is another matter, but this is not generally an appropriate alternative.\n\nOf course, a satisfactory answer to this question can only be given for each individual\ncase after a detailed examination of its administration, methods of valuation and guesses\nabout the likely affects of the alternatives. All that is suggested here is that a general case\nagainst the levy on equity grounds, is, in the circumstance of the post-war levies in Western\nEurope, difficult to substantiate. Certainly there do not appear to be any a priori grounds\nfor preferring the alternative to the levies.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nPost war capital levies have been operated in many countries without giving rise to\nmajor difficulties, and in a number of instances they have been productive of substantial\nrevenues. Their success from these standpoints was greater than anyone would reason-\nably have expected on the basis of earlier experience with this form of taxation.  Amongst\nthe factors which go to explain this success, the monetary reforms and the existence of\neffective systems of exchange control must be assigned a high place.\n\nTo evaluate the economic usefulness of these levies is another matter and it is not an\neasy task. Each of the anti-inflationary levies made a substantial contribution to the\nreduction in liquidity desired by the authorities, but their effects from this standpoint were\nrapidly offset by the monetary or budgetary policies which were simultaneously being\npursued. This result emphasises the need to accompany an anti-inflationary levy with a\nrestrictive credit policy if the levy is to be effective. A capital levy is unlikely to be an\nadequate substitute for a restrictive credit policy where excess liquidity exists, although\nit is sometimes regarded in this light. It is perhaps best to look at it, at least initially, as a\nmeans of reducing the burden of such a policy. The main merit of the other levies rests\non their ability to combine the fixed assessment basis of the levy with a capacity to restrict\neffective demand. In the case of Finland's Second Capital Levy the value of the tax\nas an instrument for facilitating a substantial redistribution of real capital was also\nimportant.\n\nEvidently a full evaluation of these levies requires that they should be compared with\nthe alternative instruments available for achieving the same ends from the threefold\nstandpoints of administration, economic effects and equity. This article does not pretend\nto provide the material for making such a general judgement. It does seem justifiable\nto conclude however that if these devices are evaluated not against any ideal alternative,\nbut rather against the alternatives practically available, then a number of the levies must\nbe conceded to have considerable merit. In a sense though, any general justification for\nthese levies has to rest on distributional grounds, although in some instances questions of\nincentive may also be relevant. This is because in most cases the alternative devices\navailable do not appear to be demonstrably inferior to the levy whether they are con-\nsidered from the standpoint of administration or from the standpoint of their effects on\nthe level of effective demand.\n\nBelfast.

            "found": "INVESTMENT ALLOWANCES, INITIAL ALLOWANCES 47\n\n10. It remains to enquire whether there are any grounds of public advantage for pre-\nferring any one of the three methods of encouraging investment to any other. It is some-\ntimes suggested that investment allowances are wrong in principle because they involve a\nsubsidy on investment ; but they do this no more and no less than equivalent initial allow-\nances of cheap credit facilities. Investment allowances have the advantage of arith-\nmetic simplicity, and that their value is independent of subjective interest rates ; these\nshould not be valued too highly, however, since any comparison of investment allowances\nwith either of the other two methods involves doing the sums for both. It has sometimes\nbeen suggested that investment allowances are the best method of the three because they\ndiscriminate in favour of firms which are growing fast ; but there is no reason to believe\nthis. If a rapid rate of expansion leaves a firm short of ready money, and this is reflected\nin a high value of r relative to the average firm, then if the rates of initial and investment\nallowances are fixed so as to make them equivalent for the average firm, it is initial allow-\nances which discriminate in favour of the rapidly growing firm. Investment allowances,\nas seen above, discriminate not in favour of the firm which is growing fastest, but in favour\nof the firm which turns its capital over fastest ; and there is no reason why the public\ninterest should require the encouragement of relatively short-lived investments.\n\n11. It is also possible that reasons for preferring one type of inducement to invest\nto another should arise from differences in their impact on government finance. The\nimmediate direct reduction in the receipts of the Treasury in the year an investment is\nmade due to the granting of investment or initial allowances is v? or at ; to make these\nequivalent from the point of view of the firm a must be larger than v (to an extent shown\nin appendix 2), so that initial allowances involve a larger direct and immediate loss of\nrevenue. Whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer prefers a method of encouraging\ninvestment which implies a larger or a smaller immediate impact on government finance\ndepends on a variety of considerations of debt-management, monetary policy and sheer\npolitical expediency which will vary from time to time. The immediate effects of cheap\nloans on government finance are harder to generalise ; if the government actually provides\nthe loans, the immediate impact on the overall government financial position is large, but\ndoes not fall ** above the line \"', i.e., on current account ; if the government merely sub-\nsidises loans actually provided by some other body, the direct impact on government\nfinance, like the benefits to the firm, all lie in the future, and the immediate cost is zero.\n\n12. In conclusion it must be emphasised that the analysis above has taken a partial\nequilibrium viewpoint in comparing investment allowances, initial allowances and the\ngranting of cheap credit facilities as inducements to investment. If any of these, or any\ncombination, is successful in increasing investment the effects on employment and financial\nconditions will be felt throughout the economy, and the resulting changes in the financial\nposition of both the government and private firms may permit or require widespread changes\nin t or r. As these more general effects of a rise in investment will be fairly similar what-\never type of inducement was used to bring it about, it has been thought worth while to\npursue the partial equilibrium approach involved in analysing the effects of a, v and c\nwith r, ? and n either held constant or varying independently. This approach has shown\nthe differences between investment allowances, initial allowances and cheap loans to be\nboth smaller than, and different from, what is sometimes believed.\n\nOxford. J.

TRANSACTIONS AMONG PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS\n\nSo far the only aspect of transactions between private individuals which has been\nconsidered is the expenditure of a part of urban incomes on the free markets for farm pro-\nducts. This process, as we have seen, retards the return of cash to the issuing bank,\nhence it increases the cash circulation. Apart from this, transactions among private indi-\nviduals only amount to a few per cent of the transactions between private individuals\nand the socialist sector. For this reas\u00f3n it is possible in an analysis of short period\nfluctuations to assume that the volume of transactions among private individuals is constant\nand hence can be left out of the discussion. Over longer periods the volume of transactions\namong private individuals can undergo variations sufficiently great to need attention, at\nleast as minor influences on the currency circulation. Growth in the volume of such\ntransactions of course increases, while a decline diminishes the circulation of cash.\n\n* * *\n\nAmong the factors described above, a disproportion between purchasing power and\nthe stock of goods available has a special character ; when such a disproportion obtains\nthe ratio which the cash circulation bears to income is determined not by the spontaneous\nspending habits of the population, but by compulsion resulting from rigidities in the plan-\nned economic system. In planned economies the most general form of inflation is thus\ninvoluntary retardation of the rate at which incomes are spent. \"This arises because the\nstate provides for consumption a supply of goods which is too small or of inadequate\nquality to mop up the purchasing power outstanding.\n\nA potential reduction in the rate at which incomes are spent is an important element\nof elasticity in the general rigidity of a planned economy, since for some time and to some\ndegree it bridges the gap between purchasing power and the supply of goods ; it thus\nfulfils a function similar to that of rising prices in a free market economy.\n\nLondon J.

                    "62 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nConcerning the view that macrotheory has been built up as a parallel or analogy\nto microtheory, and that we cannot construct macrotheory without making use of micro-\ntheory, it may, first of all, be said that this is hardly justified by the history of economic\nthought. A great deal of classical theory is macrotheory, and does not depend for its\njustification or empirical relevance on micro analogies.! Secondly, although it may well\nbe admitted that it is possible to construct macrotheory as an analogy to micro theory,\nand economists sometimes do so, this is not an argument relevant to the logical structure\nof economic theory. After all, to refer to an old problem, while hypotheses may sometimes\nin practice be obtained inductively, this in no way validates induction as a form of inference.\nIn addition, some disaggregated models such as the matrix multiplier have been derived\nby way of analogies to aggregated models, but it would scarcely be suggested that the\nlatter are logically prior or more fundamental than the former. Thirdly, the approach\nbased on analogies with microtheory seems to mistake the whole purpose of macrotheory\nwhich is to analyse specific problems based on aggregates. Thus the behaviour of con.\nsumption relative to national income can be formulated and tested without the apparatu:\nof maximizing and allocative theory. Moreover, one may go further and suggest that\nmicrotheory may even be an impediment to the formulation of good hypotheses at the\nmacro-level. In the case of the acceleration principle, for example, it has been shown\nthat this may or may not lead to the magnification of fluctuations in net investment relative\nto net national income (or net investment of the firm relative to its sales). The ability\nto progress beyond pure taxonomy, however, depends on the construction of a complete\nmodel into which are introduced empirical assumptions. In this way, the introduction\nof the macro-consumption function (with the usual conditions of diminishing marginal\nand average propensities to consume) does, in fact, lead to magnification in a macro-\nmodel.?\n\nAn important consequence of this point of view is that a less aggregated analysis\nof any problem cannot by itself stand as a criticism or refutation of a more aggregated\nanalysis. For example, models have been constructed in which investment minus saving\nex ante is equal to the sum of excess demands ex ante in \u00e0 number of factor and goods\nmarkets. Equilibrium is defined as a situation in which excess demand in every market\nis zero, so that equality of investment and saving ex ante is not a sufficient condition for\nequilibrium. It is then suggested that this throws doubt on the value of models based of\na straightforward investment-saving approach.5 But this would be so only if, on the one\nhand, the investment-saving approach were intended to solve problems related to the\ninterdependence of markets, and, on the other, the market approach is shown to provide\nbetter answers to the problems for which the theory in terms of investment and saving\nwas propounded.\n\n4. CONCLUSION\n\nThe argument presented here is not to be interpreted as saying that disaggregation is\nuninteresting or unimportant, or that cross section studies may not throw considerable\nlight on the behaviour of the economy. It also does not say that there is no value in con-\n\n! Consider, for example, Smith and Ricardo on accumulation and the stock of capital.\n? Vid. Baumol [2], and Winding [13].\n\n* Vid.

This means, however, that if the macro\ntheory were valid, any micro theory invented to explain the same universe would be either\notiose or wrong. In other words, aggregation which depends on postulating functional\nrelationships of the sort discussed between micro variables and macro variables is feasible\nonly if microtheory is irrelevant or impossible.\n\nThis conclusion, of course, is not at all surprising. If macrotheory is first of all\ntreated as subsidiary to microtheory, and is then expected to produce conclusions which\ndepend on the structural interrelations of micro variables, either contradictions will result\nbecause the demand is impossible, or the macrotheory will be successful and leave no\nplace for microtheory.\n\nThe difficulty may be removed, however, by generalising one stage further. The equa-\ntions to be added to the system may be written as :\n\n9. AQ. Ys Yo Xo. .s Xu Xue, X) 20. imd...\n\nIf (n \u2014 1) of these are independent we can solve for Y; in terms of the other variables,\nand write\n\n10.

Then in the con-\nstruction of a macrotheory, and the derivation of a macro equation from 12. the micro\nvariables can be assumed to be constant, of negligible importance, or at least suitable for\ntreatment as the stochastic part of the model. Conversely for the purposes of micro\ntheory the macro variables in 9. can be treated in the same way.\n\n3. FURTHER ELABORATION\n\nThe major implication of what has been said so far is that it is not worthwhile to\njudge any workable theory in terms of its being absolutely complete in the sense of being\nrelevant to every problem which might arise. Moreover, economic variables are not to\nbe judged in terms of which are of logically primary importance and which are secondary.\nIn the set of equations 9., for example, which variables are dependent and which are\nindependent, which are endogenous and which are exogenous will be determined by the\nparticular problem in hand.! \"Within this logical framework, therefore, macrotheory and\nmicrotheory are seen to be complements not substitutes. Indeed, since in 9. it is not\nnecessarily possible to make a logically rigid distinction between macro and micro variables,\na distinction between the two sorts of theory may not always be easy to make, or even be\nworth making.\n\nl'This in turn will allow the regression problem mentioned supra to be dealt with.\nThis content downloaded from\n\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 05:55:09 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Moreover, for the aggregation to be significant it is necessary that X,,..., X,\nbe macro variables and r be considerably smaller than 5 otherwise one will merely have\nsubstituted one micro system for another.! In other words in the macro model in which\nequation 8. is included X,, ..., X, must appear in their own right either endogenously or\nexogenously in the same way as Y. They are variables the meaning of which is a function\nof the theoretical system in which they are employed.\n\nConsider now the set of equations 6. which is necessary to perform the required aggre-\ngation. The question arises, What meaning is to be attached to them ? Theil [10, p. 13]\nsays that they are entirely formal. It is not at all clear what significance '* formality \"\nhas in this context. For example, Theil considers the possibility [10, p. 36] that individual\nincome is a quadratic function of total income, which to the ordinary everyday economist\nis a postulate so full of empirical content as to be as far from formality as possible.\n\nThe view might be held that it just so happens that micro and macro variables change\ntogether over time and that it is then possible to estimate a statistical coefficient relating\ntheir movements, but implying no causal hypothesis. Apart from the difficulty which\nmight arise in the use of regression analysis in estimating this coefficient, it would require\na curious act of self-abnegation on the part of scientific investigators to place the problem\nof why such a relationship exists in perpetual abeyance. While for the very good practical\nreason of the need to go ahead with some empirical work it would be foolish for econo-\nmetrists to hold their hands and wait for an explanation of such a relationship if it exists,\nit would be equally foolish for them to deny the value of an explanation if the explanation\ncan befound. Itis our view, therefore, that there is some point in endeavouring to provide\na theoretical foundation for the aggregating equations.?\n\nUnfortunately, there is a logical difficulty connected with the discovery of such a\ncausal hypothesis within the framework of the model as set out so far, and as employed\nby econometrists. The difficulty arises from the acceptance of the doctrine that micro-\ntheory is fundamental theory and all other theory must be built up from it.\n\n1 Tt is after all, always possible to work with the equation C \u2014 X e Y).\n\n? [n support of this view it is worth noting, for example, that the analysis of aggregation in a Leontief\nmodel is frequently based on various ideas of complementarity, substitutability, and similarity between\nindustries and is not treated solely as a problem of measurement without theory.

For example, Klein [4, p. 93]\nrefers to ** the behaviour of individual households or firms which must form the basis of\nall theory of economic behaviour \". From this trivial proposition it is not a valid infer-\nence that a theory of individual behaviour must form the basis of all other theory. Indeed,\nit cannot be assumed (but must be demonstrated) that because all decision making is in\nsome sense done by individuals that a theory of individual decision making is even possible.\nIt is, perhaps, also of interest to note that Klein, anyway, is already dealing with aggre-\ngates when he mentions households and firms.\n\nIt will also be argued here that the aggregation problem is not primarily one of\nmeasurement, nor is it useful to follow Tinbergen [11] and look on macro relationships as\naverages of micro relationships ; rather economic theory at any level of aggregation\nexists on a par with economic theory at any other level, and if an aggregation problem\nexists, it is because economic theory at some level is unsatisfactory.\n\nThe argument which follows is based on the simplest possible problem.

                    "A. View of the Aggregation\nProblem\n\n1l. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe aggregation problem is concerned with the relationship between macrotheory\nand microtheory. Its usual formulation (as set out, for example, by Klein [4, 5], Balderston\nand Whitin [1], or Theil [10]) involves a comparison between the predictions obtained\nfrom a large economic model with many equations and variables and a smaller model in\nwhich the variables and parameters are aggregates of those in the larger model. In\nparticular, it is desirable that the aggregated predictions of the micro model should not\nconflict with those of the macro model. A simple example is provided by de Wolff [14].\nAssuming that an unambiguous meaning can be attached to the income elasticity of\ndemand of an individual consumer, he investigates those circumstances in which similar\nprecision can be attached to the concept when applied to a group of consumers.\n\nIn a recent book by Theil [10] it is shown that where a set of linear micro equations\nis to be aggregated into a single macro equation, aggregates can always be defined so that\npredictions from the micro equations do not contradict those from the macro equation.\nSimilarly, such *' perfect\" aggregation is frequently possible when the micro equations\nare non-linear?\n\nWhere there are several macro equations to be derived, a less satisfactory state of\naffairs prevails. While it is always possible to obtain macro reduced form equations from\nlinear micro reduced form equations, this situation corresponding to the single macro\nequation case, it is rarely possible to obtain macro structural equations in the same way.\nThe reason for this is that the same micro variables will usually be aggregated differently\nin different macro reduced form equations, but to obtain the macro structural equations\nit is required that these aggregates be identical?.\n\nThe position adopted in this paper is that the attempt to solve the aggregation problem\nby means of the definition of indices of micro variables is bound to be unsatisfactory,\nand leads to a mistaken view of the relationship between micro and macro theory. Apart\nfrom the possibility of the non-identity of indices*, the present view is unacceptable because\n\n''The author has benefited considerably from discussion of this topic with Professor Baumol of\nPrinceton University. He is also indebted to Messrs. Archibald, Lipsey and O'Leary of the London\nSchool of Economics for valuable discussion of an earlier draft.\n\n* An example is provided by Klein [4]. If each firm's production function may be represented by an\nextended version of the Cobb-Douglas production function, he shows how a production function of the\nsame type may be derived for the economy as a whole.\n\n* Theil [10, p. 152] discusses a situation in which two macro reduced form equations each contain an\nincome index, but these two indices are as a rule not identical.\n\n* [t is worth noting that in his reply to Klein Shou Shan Pu [9] pointed out that these indices may have\nonly the most tenuous connection with variables appearing in macro theory.\n\n58\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 05:55:09 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In Value and\nCapital terms, there is a ** dominance of complementarity \" between labour and capital.\n\nI am myself not much in love with *' golden ages\"' of this character ; to deprive\nan analysis, that is concerned with motion in time, of an anchor in time has always seemed\nto me to be a dubious proceeding. Nevertheless I would agree that the nature of the\nrestraint which is set by initial equipment is not usually such as to prevent a ** dominance\nof complementarity \". The more optimistic view (which shows the demand for lbaour\ngrowing\u2014and so, with an inelastic supply of labour, wages rising\u2014in the process of\nexpansion) is on the whole, without doubt, correct.\n\nConclusion\n\nI am well aware that I have been talking, in this last section, in a looser and vaguer\nway than in those which preceded ; the ground which I have just been covering, in this\nrather casual fashion, is ground which ought to be worked over more carefully. \"What\nI hope I have done is to provide an interesting technique by which some of these important\nmatters can be more fully explored. 1 think that the application of this technique would\nthrow some light upon them ; but I should like to make clear, before concluding, that I\nam under no illusions about the total that could thereby be achieved.\n\nThe questions which the present model is concerned to answer are by no means the\nsame as those which other model-builders (such as Harrod, Domar or Kaldor) have sought\nto answer by their models ; it is perfectly possible that what I have been saying may be\ntrue, and that what they (or some of them) have been saying may be true also. And even\nwithin the field of the questions which I have been trying to ask, the validity of my model,\nI would freely admit, is quite questionable. As has just been shown, it may be too much of\na \"\" diminishing returns\" model\u2014though it can be pushed, if we like, in a '' constant\nreturns \" direction. But it can hardly pass over (so far as I can see) into a world of In-\ncreased Returns ; yet the association of Increasing Returns with economic growth is a\nkey which may well unlock more doors than those which have here been causing us so\nmuch trouble.\n\nOxford.

The gain would be\npossible only if large numbers of workers were affected (which means in effect that the wage\nrate is raised by market forces over a wide area rather than the deliberate action of some\nemployers who have got together) ; while the fact that a concerted wage policy cannot be\nfollowed increases both the difficulty of anticipation of the workers' reponse and the risk\nattached to the anticipation.\n\nThus under the casual system of employment, the wage-efficiency relationship does\nnot operate, and consequently there is no floor. If everybody gets equal employment\n(which will happen in the long run with chance selection), then the wage will be driven\nto the point 4, where the work units supplied per worker is so low that the total demand\nfor work units is just met when everybody is employed.\n\nI\n\nIt may not be out of place here to indicate that the analysis presented above throws\nlight on one of the causes of the disparity in wages between agriculture and industry,\nand the maintenance of wage-rates in industry, in spite of widespread un-, or under-\nemployment of labour in agriculture. Industry is in quite a different position from\nagriculture as regards the system of employment. It has a limited number of employers\nand every individual mill has a core of workers who are attached to it and in continuous\nemployment throughout the year. Industry's wage policy will be concerned with its own\nspecial body of workers without any reference to the volume of surplus labour in the\neconomy asa whole. \"Thus either by individual or concerted action the industrial employer\ncan realise the most profitable situation by keeping the wage rate at the floor level (Z.).\n\nAnother possible reason for the agricultural-industrial wage differential has to do\nwith the productivity of casuallabour. Industry needs its labour force to be in continuous\nemployment throughout the year ; productivity of labour is affected seriously if casual\nunstable labour is used. But in agriculture the system of employment is the casual system,\nand, unless there is marked scarcity of labour in this sector, total employment usually will\nbe shared out among the job-seekers, with each putting in less number of days of work than\nare available in the year. This means that industry must pay a minimum wage which will\nenable the worker to attain physical efficiency sufficient to supply as many work-days of\neffort as are available in the year ; whereas agriculture, except under conditions of scarcity\nof labour, has no necessity to have this minimum. \u2014 On our supply curve of work units\nwith respect to wage, this minimum (which might be called the point of no idleness such\nas K) is likely to be above the floor wage (L) we have discussed before at which the\naverage cost per work unit is at its minimum.\n\nFor minimising labour cost the industrial wage will need to be not merely at the floor\nlevel, (L) but also at the minimum wage point of no idleness (K), and a positive wage\ndifferential with respect to agriculture will exist.\n\nLondon.

Thus, if the non-monopoly sector\nprice increases to k time marginal cost to match the monopolist's original price policy, the\nmonopolist will always react by further raising his price to something greater than K times\nmarginal cost.\n\nWe cannot, therefore, simply define a monopolistic policy by the relationship between\naccounting prices and costs, but must always consider the relationship between these\nrelative to their relationship elsewhere.\n\nThe difficulty is, which relationship to use ? Our original choice was the relationship\nbetween price and marginal cost in some industry chosen at random, but, as McManus\ncorrectly points out, the status of this industry is higher than that of a mere numeraire.\nIn effect, the * hidden assumption ' for which McManus searches but does not correctly\nlocate is that we have assumed it is to the price of the n'th commodity that the monopolist's\nreactions are geared. This is a useful enough assumption in many models\u2014the z'th\ncommodity might, for example, be a competitively produced good which is the chief\nsubstitute for the monopolist's output\u2014but it is not general. Perhaps the answer in the\ngeneral case is to assume the monopolist's relationship between price and marginal cost to\nall other industries, the functional relationship being ultimately determined by demand\nconditions. This will certainly confront us with some complex analysis.\n\nOur intent in writing the original article was to indicate that piecemeal application\nof single Paretian welfare conditions in a situation in which not al] such conditions could\nbe satisfied might well decrease, rather than increase, welfare. McManus's comments\ncertainly add strength to our original contention.\n\nLondon. KELvIN LANCASTER.\nR. G.

                    "102 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nCURRENCY AREAS\n\nThe sterling and dollar areas have remained relatively homogeneous and stable but\nthe composition of even these was not entirely constant.\n\nThe sterling area included throughout the period all colonial possessions and dependen-\ncies of the United Kingdom except the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and Palestine ; in addition,\nAustralia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, South Africa, Ireland, Iceland, Iraq and\nBurma. Egypt and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan left the Sterling Area in July 1947, Palestine\nand Jordan in February 1948, Jordan (though not Israel) rejoining the area in July 1950.\nThe Faroe Islands were part of the sterling area until November 1948 and Libya has been\na member since January 1952.\n\nThe dollar area, in addition to Canada! the United States and her dependencies,\nincluded throughout Liberia,! the Philippines and the following thirteen Central and South\nAmerican countries : Columbia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador,\nGuatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, El Salvador, Venezuela.\nBolivia became a member of the dollar area in July 1947, Chile was a member from July\n1947 to July 1948 and Peru from July 1947 to August 1948. For purposes of the statistical\nanalysis imports from the last two countries were included in the dollar totals for 1948\nonly. Uruguay was in the dollar area only from July 1947 to March 1948 ; since this\nperiod did not include June 30th in either year, Uruguay is not treated as in the dollar area\nin 1947 or 1948.\n\nWhat has been termed the rest of the world is a heterogeneous collection of countries,\ntowards which import policy was generally far from uniform. From 1949/50 onwards,\nhowever, it contained one major component, the relaxation area, which enjoyed more or\nless uniform treatment, but as even this area was growing in size, figures for different\nyears would not be strictly comparable.?\n\nAs it stands, the *' rest of the world \" group is relatively constant in size, being affected\nonly by the minor changes in composition of the sterling and dollar areas already mentioned.\nIts composition by main import licensing groups since 1950 is indicated below :\n\nComposition of imports from the ** rest of the world\"\n(i.e., non-sterling non-dollar area)\n\n1950-58\n\nPercentages\n\nSoviet bloc 55, 55 64| 61| 59; 71. 65, T0| 68\nJapan 07| 09, 21/|07| 12; 1:6| L6 | 15, 105\nRelaxation Area 70-0 | 86:2 | 86:0 | 847 | 86:2 | 85-4 1 91:9 | 91:55 | 9177\nRest 2228 | T4 55 85/67, 59 | \u2014 \u2014 -\u2014\n\n1!

                    "IMPORT CONTROL IN THE UNITED KINGDOM SINCE THE WAR 101\n\n(a) On supply grounds : Licences to import essentials from areas (e.g., the dollar\narea) from which they are not on Open Licence are considered ad hoc in the light of advice\nfrom a responsible government department.\n\n(b) In relation to end use : Applications for licences to import machinery (and certain\ndollar materials) are considered individually in relation to end-use and alternative sources\nofsupply. The issue of licences to import goods either for re-export in the form imported\n(REX licence) or for ultimate export after processing (UX licences), depends largely on the\nnet foreign exchange earnings.\n\n(c) By quotas : In some cases quotas are established fixing a limit (by quantity or\nvalue) to total imports of a particular commodity for a particular period : sometimes\nthese apply to one source only (bilateral quotas), sometimes to a large number of sources\ntogether (global quotas). Within these totals, licences may be allocated to individual\nimporters in various ways. \"The most usual method is to share them out among established\nimporters in proportion to their share of trade in some specified past period when the\nimports concerned were not subject to restriction ; (in some cases, this had to be pre-war).\n\n(i) Bilateral quotas have generally been established under bilateral trade negoti-\nations largely as a concession to the exporting country, which has furthermore some-\ntimes been granted the right to administer the allocation of the quota. This applied\nin particular to the ** special hardship quotas \" granted to those O.E.E.C. countries\nwhich had suffered exceptionally from the British deliberalisation of 1951/2, and\nalso to licences under the Token Import Scheme. In such cases an import licence is\nissued automatically to the British importer who can produce the appropriate certifi-\ncate from his foreign supplier. Licences issued in respect of trade agreement quotas\nnormally have the validity of the period covered by the agreement.\n\n(ii).Global quotas were introduced on a large scale in respect of those commodities\noriginally liberalised in 1949 and 1950 which were deliberalised during the 1951/2\nbalance of payments crisis. Quotas mostly related to the whole *' relaxation area \"'\nand were announced for six months at a time ; applications for licences had to be\nmade within specified time limits and the licences were normally valid for the period\nof the quota (with possible extensions of three months). Only a few of these global\nquotas remain at the present time, most of the goods to which they were applied having\nbeen subsequently ** reliberalised ''.\n\nAI items subject to specific licences, however allocated, must be regarded as subject\nto quantitative control from the sources for which such individual licences are required.\n\n(4) BLock LicENCES\n\nThese were a way of regulating imports, now largely superseded, which bore a super-\nficial resemblance to open individual licences, but were in fact rather a form of restriction\nby quota.

After the introduction of the O.E.E.C. liberalisation policy in 1949/50 the\nOpen General Licence contained two major Schedules : (1) a list of goods which could\nbe imported freely from all countries (World Open General Licence) ; (2) a much longer\nlist of goods (classified into 17 groups) which could be imported from all ** relaxation area \"'\ncountries ' (Relaxation Open General Licence).\n\n\"There were still, as before, a few shorter lists of commodities which could be imported\nfree of restriction only from British Commonwealth countries or other individual countries\n(e.g., lace from Malta, bulbs from the Netherlands, etc.). During the temporary deliveralis-\nation period in 1952/3 the Open General Licence included a third major Schedule con-\ntaining a substantial list of items which had been deliberalised from the *' relaxation\narea \" but could still be imported without restriction from the ** Scheduled Territories \"\n(Sterling Area Open General Licence). With further reliberalisation measures the latter\nlist became shorter as goods were restored to Relaxation Open General Licence. More-\nover, with the general unification in 1954 of sterling payments arrangements in the non-\ndollar world (extension of transferable account facilities to all non-dollar countries), a\nfourth schedule was introduced of commodities (mainly raw materials) which might be\nimported freely from all non-dollar countries (non-dollar Open General Licence).\n\nCommodities on Open General Licence from any source are in effect not subject to\ncontrol from that source.\n\n(2) OPEN IuDivipuaL LicENCE (O.LL.)\n\nThis is a licence issued to an individual trader permitting him to import specified goods\nwithout limit of quantity or value either from any country (World Open Individual Licence)\nor from specified countries or groups of countries (e.g., Dollar Open Individual Licence,\nNon-Dollar Open Individual Licence, Relaxation Open Individual Licence, etc.) The\nlicence may be valid for a finite period or until revoked. \"This particular type of open\nlicensing has generally been used in connection with the imposition of certain administrative\nobligations on importers (e.g., to make periodic returns of imports, contracts, or com-\nmitments) or for the purpose of limiting the freedom to import to certain categories of\ntraders (e.g., members of the commodity markets on which the goods in question are\ntraded). In many cases, however, such licences have been granted freely to any one apply-\ning for them. Such licences have never effectively restricted the quantity of the particular\ngoods imported and have often served as an interim stage on the way to an Open General\nLicence.*\n\n(3) SPECIFIC IMPORT LICENCE\n\nThis is a licence issued to an individual importer, permitting the import of a specific\nquantity of a particular commodity from a specified source or sources. Specific import\nlicences are valid for finite periods, generally six months, (twelve months for machinery) ;\nan extension of three months (six for machinery) may usually be obtained. The quantity\nadmitted may be determined in various ways :\n\n1 See p. 78 for definition of ** relaxation area \".\n? Cf.

If it were explicitly recognised\nthat the index is to refer to a household with a '* median standard of living \", the sample\nof household budgets that are to provide the Weights could be confined to a fairly narrow\nrange of incomes and household sizes.

One cannot of course say in the abstract\nwhat constitutes a proper scale of tax progression, but it may not be unreasonable to suppose\nthat these figures indicate rough justice as between Buganda and Kigezi but not as between\nTeso and Acholi. The poorer Acholi received half its income net of export duty whilst\nin the case of the more prosperous Teso the proportion was two thirds : this cannot be\nregarded as equitable on any principle.\n\nIV\n\nThere has been a good deal of discussion about the ways in which countries with high\nincomes can help in the development of those with lower per capita incomes. But a low\naverage income is not the only distinguishing feature of underdeveloped countries and to\nconcentrate on this one feature may deflect attention from the problems associated with\nregional income disparities such as exist in most parts of tropical Africa and in other\nunderdeveloped areas. Regional disparities in income were as conspicuous in England\nbefore the 19th century as they are in Africa to-day and since they are now much smaller in\nEngland it may be that they automatically disappear with economic growth. But this\nshould not be taken for granted : the experience of the past decade in Uganda, a period\nof very rapid advance albeit a short one from which to generalize, gives no ground for\noptimism. Regional disparities are obviated where there is mobility, but there are political\nand economic factors in most parts of Africa which inhibit the permanent movement of\npeople from the poorer to the richer regions of a country. There would be fewer poor in\nSouthern Italy if there were more employment opportunities in the North, but it cannot be\ntaken for granted that an acceleration of economic development in Buganda would auto-\nmatically enhance incomes in the other regions or bring about a permanent resettlement\nin Buganda. An increase in average income in Uganda brought about by an acceleration\nof economic development in Buganda might create as many internal problems and strains\nas it would solve.

In this he is clearly correct : so long as consumer's surplus as measured by the\nquantity-compensating variation exists, it necessarily follows from the foregoing analysis\nthat it can be completely appropriated by the monopolist. It also follows that che extent\nto which discrimination can raise revenue is inversely related to the size of the income\neffect. It is largest in the case of constant marginal utility of money when the income\neffectis zero. The larger the income effect the nearer the area under the MR curve approach-\nes the area under the MY curve and the smaller the possible gain. his is only another\nway of saying that the size of the quantity-compensating variation varies inversely with\nthat of the income elasticity of demand. Professor Lewis's second point is therefore\nsubstantially correct. It is obvious however that given the usual indifference pattern, the\nquantity-compensating variation must be greater than zero, for equality of the areas under\nthe MR and MY curves implies either kinked or intersecting indifference curves. In general,\nas compared with single pricing, discrimination makes possible a larger total revenue\nfor any given volume of sales.\n\nFinally, even if, under single pricing, the consumer is spending the maximum he is\nprepared to devote to the commodity, so that the quantity compensating variation is\nzero, it may still be possible to increase monopoly profits by discrimination with a smaller\noutput.\n\nSheffield.

Besides,\ninvestment of type (2b) has neither empirical significance, nor is it logically thinkable :\nWhy should investment which does not create new capacity be induced after all ? If we\ntake account of autonomous investment of the capacity creating type (1a), however, then\ninduced investment (/7^4) in the acceleration equation is less than investment in the equation\nfor the capacity effect (I^ -- I\"7).

The capital coefficient applies to autonomous and to induced\ninvestment. The acceleration coefficient, however, is applicable only to induced invest-\nment.

The fact which they announce is well known, but their proof for a simple case\nis a nice pedagogical contribution. I would only make two further observations. First, the\nassumption of closure is inessential to my argument and to demand theory, one merely\nredefines the notion of compensation, so that the consumer is compensated if he receives\nthe greatest lower bound of incomes which permit him to reach a position at least as good\nas he could achieve under the initial conditions. The new function Mz (p) has the same\n\n; 2\nproperties as the old one. If ix exists, it is equal to d m , Where x is chosen at\n2\nP. Moreover, the second differential does exist for almost every P, and thus a unique\nbest combination of goods exists for almost every P and income Mz (p). (My discussant,\nFrank Hahn, and I independently noted this point when my paper was first presented\nto the Econometric Society.)

In fact, the possibility of immiserizing growth arises only when, with these con-\nditions favourably fulfilled, either or both of the following crucial conditions are fulfilled :\n\n(a) the offer of the rest-of-the-world is inelastic, (i.e., 7, is negative, which may be\nfor the extreme, and by no means necessary, reason that the growing country's exports\nare Giffen goods abroad) ; and\n\n(b) growth actually reduces the domestic production of importables at constant\nrelative commodity prices (i.e., y is negative).\n\nStringent as the latter condition may appear at first sight, recent analyses have shown\nthat it is feasible under relatively simple assumptions. Thus the Rybczynski proposition\nstates that under a two-commodity, two-factor model where, say, labour and land being\nthe factors, one good is labour-intensive and the other land-intensive, if labour (land)\nincreases in supply, then the output of the land-intensive (labour-intensive) industry must\nactually contract if the relative commodity prices are maintained constant.? Professor\nJohnson has recently advanced the proposition thta under neutral technical progress in\none industry, the technology of the other and the total factor endowment remaining\nunchanged, the output of the other industry must actually fall under constant relative\ncommodity prices.?

For even when allowance is made for the\nadjustment in the rate of taxation in consequence upon the enlargement of the tax base\n(due to the inclusion of capital gains) it is possible that the taxation of capital gains dis-\ncourages risk-bearing by more than the allowance made for capital losses encourages it.\nThis is likely to be the case if the relatively ** risky \"' securities are those which offer a definite\nprospect of capital appreciation, and where therefore the previously tax-exempt proportion\nof the expected yield (the portion represented by expected appreciation, and not by the\nprospective dividend) is relatively large. In other words, to the extent that prospective\ncapital appreciation is possitively correlated with uncertainty (so that the more risky the\nsecurity, and the higher the '* expected yield \"', the greater the element of capital appreci-\nation in that yield) an income tax which exempts capital gain undertaxes risky investments\nrelatively to safe investments (per unit of yield) and thereby counteracts the tendency of\nincome tax to discourage risk-bearing.\n\nThis was the basis for the conclusion in my book that *' the effect of the non-taxation\nof capital gains is to reduce the discrimination against risk bearing inherent in income\ntax \".! I still believe that there is a presumption to this effect, and that a British type\nincome tax, whatever its defects from the point of view of equity, is less discouraging to\nrisk bearing than a more comprehensive tax which includes realized capital gains in taxable\nincome, and allows realized capital losses as an offset against present and future capital\ngains. But in view of Messrs. Musgrave and Domar's findings with regard to the effect\nof a tax on Accrued Income with full loss offsets I no longer believe that this conclusion\nnecessarily follows. Since a tax on Accrued Income lacks the discriminating features of\na British type tax, a tax on Realized Income\u2014which could, after all, be regarded as an\nintermediate case between the two\u2014might, on balance, be more favourable to risk-taking\nthan the British type tax (due to the fact that it offers a certain relief for capital losses)\neven though it involves a shift in the tax burden towards more risky investments.\n\nThe above does not affect the conclusions stated at the beginning of this paper as\nregards the relative merits of a British type income tax, an annual capital tax and an\nexpenditure tax. But it does mean that the extension of the same reasoning to the case of\na tax on Accrued Income was erroneous. Given full loss offsets, and ignoring the indirect\neffects through savings, a tax on Accrued Income appears to be no less favourable in its\neffects on risk-taking than an expenditure tax. This latter conclusion also casts some doubt\non the proposition that the taxation of realized capital gains has adverse effects on the\nincentive to take risks as compared with the present British-type income tax.\n\nCambridge.

However, the force of this reversal of\ndirection is diluted by recognition, as in section 2.5, that the size of investment balances is\nnot independent of the current rate of interest r. In section 3.4 we have considered the\nproportionate allocation between cash and '* consols \"* on the assumption that it is inde-\npendent of the size of the balance. An increase in the rate of interest may lead an investor\nto desire to shift towards cash. But to the extent that the increase in interest also reduces\nthe value of the investor's consol holdings, it automatically gratifies this desire, at least in\npart.\n\nThe assumption that investors expect on balance no change in the rate of interest\nhas been adopted for the theoretical reasons explained in section 2.6 rather than for reasons\nof realism. Clearly investors do form expectations of changes in interest rates and differ\nfrom each other in their expectations. For the purposes of dynamic theory and of analysis\nof specific market situations, the theories of sections 2 and 3 are complementary rather\nthan competitive. The formal apparatus of section 3 will serve just as well for a non-zero\nexpected capital gain or loss as for a zero expected value of g. Stickiness of interest rate\nexpectations would mean that the expected value of g is a function of the rate of interest r,\ngoing down when r goes down and rising when r goes up. In addition to the rotation of\nthe opportunity locus due to a change in r itself, there would be a further rotation in the\nsame direction due to the accompanying change in the expected capital gain or loss. At\nlow interest rates expectation of capital loss may push the opportunity locus into the\nnegative quadrant, so that the optimal position is clearly no consols, all cash. At the\nother extreme, expectation of capital gain at high interest rates would increase sharply\nthe slope of the opportunity locus and the frequency of no cash, all consols positions,\nlike that of Figure 3.3. The stickier the investor's expectations, the more sensitive his\ndemand for cash will be to changes in the rate of interest.\n\nNew Haven, Conn. U.S.A. J.

A detailed examination of durable\ncommodities for the United Kingdom budget survey of 1937/38 is given by Prais and\nHouthakker [5], while estimates for the Dutch 1935/36 survey can be derived from a recent\narticle by Wit [6]. Various other sources were used, and in several cases adjustments\nwere necessary ; a detailed description is given in the appendix. The resulting figures\ngiven in table 5 all refer to the period before the war, and where budget surveys are used\nthe elasticities are evaluated at or near the mean working-class income.\n\nAs both methods and data differ, any agreement between the two sets of estimates is\ncause for surprise ; in fact there is rather more than one would expect. For three budget\nsurveys where sufficient data were available the weighted income elasticity for all durable\ngoods is close to unity, which corresponds to the assumptions about the relation of owner-\nship to long-term income elasticity made above. For clothing there is a fair degree of\nagreement generally, even including an estimate from time-series. For household effects\nand its constituent parts (the next four items) ownership elasticities do correspond roughly\nto the Dutch income elasticities, but they are consistently lower than the estimates for other\ncountries. National characteristics in the classification of necessities and luxuries might\naccount for this difference ; this is generally a poor explanation, but in the present case\nrather plausible. Among the other commodities major indivisible items are notable in\nthat the estimates from American time-series seem much more plausible than our estimates ;\nthe value of -75 is almost certainly too low, even for a long-term elastici.y.\n\nIf we concentrate on the Dutch cross-section estimates of demand elasticities, a com-\nparison with ownership elasticities shows no general or consistent divergence between the\ntwo. This suggests that estimates from cross-section data are closer to *' true\" long-\nterm income elasticities of demand than recent controversies may have led us to believe.\n\nCambridge. J. S.

For \u00a3 X t,, the stationary level of w,\nis W, \u2014 W, and if the stagnation has lasted for a while, the convergence property of the\ndifferential equation (8) has secured that the factual w, is nearer to W. As soon as the\n\npoint of time t, is passed, the stationary level for w, shifts to 9\u00bb, \u2014 y\u20145h. For the de-\nY\n\nvelopment of wi it is now reasonable to assume wi, \u2014 W and wi, \u2014 O as initial conditions\nfor the process following the point of time ty. w, will then either increase monotonically\ntowards the new stationary level, or converge to it through cyclical movements. It is\ntherefore possible that we for an industry such as the one under consideration now, shall\nobserve an increasing wage rate simultaneously with an increase in productivity. It is,\nhowever, obvious that it is impossible to find any definite relationship between changes\nin wage rate and changes in productivity. :\n\nWhen we have a period with rather definite and long lasting trends in productivity\nin different industries, we may expect the forces pointed out by the particular solutions\nsuch as, say, (14) and (16) to be dominating\u2014other components included in the model\nsolution having vanished through dampening. This suggests that we may expect not\nchanges in wage differentials, but the wage differentials themselves to be correlated with the\nchanges in productivity.\n\nAs for the employment, it is implied already by (4) alone that the level of the wage\nrate differential within the model is uniquely correlated with changes in employment.\n\nIn real life even this relationship between levels of wage differentials and rates of\nproductivity and employment changes may, however, be difficult to verify, because it is\nobscured by such things as unionism, local preferences, preferences for different kinds of\nwork, etc. Further the mechanism outlined above is surely less realistic under conditions\nof unemployment than under conditions of full employment.\n\nOslo.

NETTL\n\nIn perfectly competitive conditions the more nearly a firm approaches the profit\nmaximum the greater are its chances of survival. It is thus the pressure of competition\nwhich gives meaning to the concept of profit maximisation ; it is the absence of competition\nwhich is often assumed to lead to its abandonment. The question is how consistently\nand generally the forces of competition are overcome in imperfect markets.\n\nCompetition must be understood not only as existing competition but also as potential\ncompetition. Inter-firm rivalry may be limited by price agreements but these are notorious-\nly short-lived and there is little evidence of collusion on non-pirice competition. Moreover,\na rigid price is quite consistent with profit maximisation in that each seller believes that\nan independent price policy will result in greater losses than gains. There is little evidence,\ntoo, that a low price policy by established firms will be successful in inhibiting potential\ncompetitors. The only certain and positive deterrent to entry is the presence in the\nmarket of energetic and progressive firms which are obviously exploiting all the possi-\nbilities. In the case of large firms external competition is reinforced by internal pressures.\nTop executives can seldom afford to relax for long or new men will take their places.\n\nLimited capital resources and uncertainty may make entrepreneurs cautious. For\nexample, the possession of liquid resources is essential but this consideration assumes far\ngreater importance for small firms than for large firms and is likely to be achieved by a\npolicy of short run profit maximisation. Borrowing on a large scale may involve loss of\ncontrol but profit maximisation must be understood as maximisation of one's own profits\nand not those of anyone else. Uncertainty may lead to conservative policies but risks\nmust be taken from time to time if the firm is to maintain its market position. The\nentrepreneur can never be sure that the risks he forswears will not be undertaken by others.\nInvestment is, after all, not gambling but action taken on the basis of informed knowledge.\n\nIn the absence of any objective test or criterion the answer to the question whether\nentrepreneurs maximise profits must lie in an examination of the market environment in\nwhich they work. To replace profit maximisation by utility maximisation is to render the\nanalysis meaningless and even misleading. \"We are in no position to assess the subjective\nprobability distributions in the minds of entrepreneurs or to know what is the utility of\nmoney to them. \"The one consistent and general influence upon entrepreneurs which the\neconomist is in a position to assess with any accuracy is the influence of competition. It\nis suggested that this influence must always work in the direction of maximum profits.\n\nSheffield. J. H.

Homo Economicus Neumanensis, the actor in the Theory of Games, applies the\nstrategy of minimaxing because he aspires to the maximum sure profit (m.s.p.) In the\nn-person zero-sum-game this endeavour leads to the formation of coalitions. In the\nnon-zero-sum-game it leads to the formation of a multilateral cartel between all real\nplayers.\n\n2. For the theory of peaceful oligopoly (differentiated or undifferentiated oligopoly)\nwhere coalitions are excluded by the prevailing standard of behaviour, the following policies\nwere examined :\n\n(a) '* Quasi-minimaxing \", i.e., the choice of that value of the strategic variable i\n(price or sales volume) that would yield the highest payoff if the other party maximizes\nits payoff for a given i. It was found that this policy does not yield m.s.p.\n\n(b) Ordinary minimaxing with strategies as elements (choosing e.g. the independence\nposition or the dependence position). It was found that the number of possible strategies\nto be considered is infinite\u2014each strategy of one party producing a new strategy of the\nOther party. Ofthe series of strategies thus generated, the series in one of the standard cases\nconsidered in this paper tended to the Cournot point as optimal strategy, the series in a\nsecond standard case tended to the dependence point.\n\nThis solution must be rejected as impractical.\n\n(c) A. Henderson's solution (quasi-minimaxing with strategies as element) does not\nyield m.s.p.\n\n3. If the parties act in a spirit of quasi-co-operation, they will try to increase the profit\nabove what will be actually obtained according to sub-section (25), by moving to a point\non the ** quasi-contract curve \", though only in exceptional cases this will happen to be\nthe point at which the joint profit is maximized. However, no procedure has been described\nby which, in absence of direct communication and agreement, the parties could reach this\ngoal. It proved impossible to extend the results obtained in the theory of bargaining to\noligopoly proper.\n\nNew York. H.

It might be objected that road transport is a small\nproportion of the total transport sector ; in fact, its net output was greater than railways,\nairways and harbours net output taken together.\n\nSeers emphasised the value of foreign trade statistics in the construction of an input-\noutput table. They are not as valuable as he imagined. For any class of imports we\nusually cannot separate into parts that which is merely passed, via a distributor, to final\ndemand, and that which is passing to various sectors in the form of intermediate goods.\nThus one usually has to rely on data from the demand side for imports, and we have seen\nthe difficulties there. Export figures do, of course, enable us to complete on entry in the\ndisposals side of a sector account, but naturally give no information for use in the inter-\nindustry transactions part of the table.\n\nWhen transactions between two sectors can be computed from data on one sector,\nbut not from the other transacting sector, as in the case of imports above, the valuable\nstatistical cross-checking properties of the technique are lost. Seers recognised that\n** one-sided \"' calculation would often be necessary, but did not mention the disadvantage\nof this.\n\nThese then were our experiences in attempting to compute sector accounts in Tangan-\nyika. We draw our conclusions in the final section.\n\nIV\n\nOn constructing both aggregates and sector accounts, we quite clearly found that the\nlatter required very much more work than the former ; in fact, as we have demonstrated,\noften it was statistically impossible to derive reasonable data on sector sales and purchases,\nwhilst fairly easy to estimate net output.\n\nThis meant that input-output analysis must be of a very great potential use to justify the\nexpenditure of large statistical resources on it. But, at least in Tanganyika, uses at present\nseem to be slight. For the lack of interdependence we suspected was amply confirmed.\nMany flows estimated after considerable work were negligible. Others could only be\nvery roughly quantified. And above all, a very high proportion of the elements in the\nmatrix were blank.\n\nIn view of the fact that considerable work is required for little result, we do not think\nunderdeveloped countries, with very limited statistical resources, should undertake input-\noutput work, before estimates are made of the national income, and possibly simple\nsocial accounts. The latter two sets of statistics offers the best return to scarce statistical\n$kill.

It is remarkable that this index, develop-\ned originally without benefit of Slutsky, as it were, should now appear so strongly justifiable\nin the light of post-Slutskian demand theory, suitably aided by concepts taken from ordinary\ntheory as above. Perhaps the answer is that common sense, now supported by theory,\nmust always indicate that some average of **old\" and '*new\" weights is desirable ; any\nreasonable method of averaging will probably give an approximate result ; the proper\nmethod of averaging a pair of ratios is to take their geometric mean.

More\nplausible therefore would be random changes in proportionate expenditures. Now the\neffect of random changes in proportionate expenditures on our system would be much the\nsame as if proportionate expenditures were always constant, i.e., as if expenditure on any\nindividual commodity always changed by no more nor less than total expenditure. If so,\na certain specific result would be observed in equation (4.1). e; ey and e, no longer have\nindependent meaning, but it would seem that their sum would have to be unity. (This of\ncourse is the population value of the sum, the observed results would depend on the appli-\ncation of the law of converging probabilities, as elsewhere). Now this sum, which we might\nterm e, is always measurable by simple computation, since in all cases :\n\n! Professor Pigou also, it will be remembered, has strongly advocated the Fisher Index.

                    "42 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nTwo kinds of risk will dominate the formation of the probability beliefs represented\nby the o's. First, there is uncertainty with respect to the prices at which the securities\ncan be sold before maturity. Secondly, there is the degree of certainty with which the\ninvestor may expect interest payments to be made and principal to be repaid. The first\nmay be designated as market risk, the second as credit risk. Private securities are subject\nto both kinds of risk. Government securities are not subject to credit risk. \"The degree\nof market risk to which they are subject depends upon monetary policy. The fact that\nGovernments are not subject to credit risk implies, however, a greater market risk for private\nthan for Government securities. Because of these uncertainty characteristics, the following\ncondition obtains :\n\n9; \u2014 op \u00ab 0.1\nIt may also be assumed that :\n\n\u00a3g \u2014 \u20acp \u00ab\u2014 0?\nand:\n\n0-\u2014cp-\u00ab13\n\n1 Thus, a fundamental assumption of the model is that, while changes in risk factors may affect the\nexpected values of the distributions of yields, they will always lead to changes in the dispersion of those\ndistributions, and, since risk must always be present to a greater degree in the private securities market,\nthat the dispersion of this distribution will always exceed that of the yield distribution for Governments.\n\nAlthough it is logically possible for changes in risk to affect only the mean value of the yield distribution,\nrealistically the possibility of this seems nil. For example, while the lessening of the credit risk on a given\nSecurity, say by the guarantee of principal and interest of the obligation of a smaller corporation by a\nlarge company, would lead to an upward shift in capital value and consequent downward shift in yield, it\nwould also decrease the anticipated range of fluctuation about that yield. To the extent, therefore, that\ncredit risk affects dispersion in this manner, only in its total absence would its impact on dispersion be\nzero. Hence, it seems reasonable to assume that, because of its presence in the private security market,\nthe above condition will hold.\n\nLastly, to the extent that investors expect central banks to put a floor and/or ceiling to fluctuations of\nGovernment security values, this conclusion is given further support from a direct truncation of the\ndispersion of the Government security distribution.\n\n? These conditions appear to be justified by the historical relationship among the yields of fixed interest\nbearing securities.

                    "The Availability Doctrine:\nTheoretical Underpinnings!\n\nThe availability doctrine has been cited in defense of monetary policy when the latter's\nefficacy has been questioned on the ground that borrowers may be insensitive to the cost\nof borrowing. According to the availability doctrine, a restrictive monetary policy\nmay cause a reduction in the quantity of credit supplied private borrowers by private\nlenders irrespective of the elasticity of demand for borrowed funds. \"This result would\nevidently imply a perfectly inelastic schedule of the supply of loanable funds and a shift\nof that schedule to the left.? The purpose of this paper is to formalize certain institutional\nfactors which may explain the characteristics of supply implied by the availability doctrine.\n\nThe pressures exerted by monetary policy upon lenders according to the availability\ndoctrine may be described in the following way. First, monetary policy may change the\ndegree of uncertainty in the Government securities market and hence affect the liquidity\nof the lender's portfolio. Secondly, there is the competitive effect upon the demand for\nprivate securities of changes in the prices of Government securities. The following model\ndepicts a particular equilibrium theory of assets suggested by these two aspects of the\navailability doctrine.\n\nAssume two kinds of fixed-interest bearing securities of equal maturity and given de-\nnomination to be available for selection, Government and private securities represented\nby g and p, respectively. Let X, stand for the proportion in par value terms of the portfolio\ncomposed of Governments, X, the proportion in private securities.

Jn other words, if the schedule of supply is perfectly inelastic and if it shifts to the left, the elasticity\nof demand will not affect the extent to which the flow of funds is reduced. \u2014 This will be true even if demand\nis perfectly inelastic, for in that case supply takes precedence over demand.

It then becomes impossible to say whether\nsuch a tax would result in more or less risk taking than a comprehensive income or\nexpenditure tax without making assumptions about the relationship between risk taking\nand capital gains and losses. Where net capital gains are expected, such a tax will reduce\nyields less than in proportion to risk. \"Where net capital losses are expected, such a tax\nwill reduce yields more than in proportion to risk.

We conclude, then, that proportional comprehensive income and expenditure\ntaxes are theoretically similar in their effects on risk taking, and that it is very possible for\nthem to discriminate in favour of it rather than act neutrally like a capital tax. \"Whether\nor not comprehensive income and expenditure taxes are practically similar in their effects\ndepends ultimately on the design and feasibility of the two taxes and the actual reaction\nofinvestors.

The\nsupply curve moves up to the left, by just the rate of tax. The demand curve, released\nfrom the immediate burden of this first payment of tax, moves up by just the rate of tax,\ncoming to rest at a position below the original pre-tax position by the discounted value\nof subsequent taxes ; that is to say, the discounting, to a present value, of the indefinite\nnumber of prospective tax payments continues to act as a depressant on the demand curve.\nIn terms of the numerical illustration above, the offer for 1,000 shares is now $80, not $79,\nsince a resale at $80, less $1 sales tax, would produce a loss of $1 that would bring the\nnet yield down to $4, or 5 per cent on the investment.\n\nSince both curves, under the sales tax, move up by just the tax rate, from where they\nwere under the purchase tax, the price rises, through this tax substitution, by just the tax\nrate, and the volume of transactions is the same under both taxes. The change in point\nof impact has not given rise to a change in true incidence.?\n\nIf, to borrow from the investor case, all but one of the speculators are exempt, there\nwill be no discounting of future taxes, even though speculators, by definition, look forward\nto resale. If the tax is on purchases, the prospective purchaser who is not a charitable\ninstitution, although he would like to be able to get his shares for less than $100, will not\nbe able to do so ; he must pay the $100, to compete with the mass of untaxed buyers.\nHe must accept a lowering of his rate of return on share investment, if he is to stay in the\nmarket. Similarly, a tax on sales, despite the prospect of its indefinite repetition whenever\na taxable seller appears, is not discounted ; it does not affect price. Accordingly, under\na purchase tax, the one taxable speculator bears the full burden of a tax that is a function\nof the purchase price paid by the preceding holder plus the gain or loss realized by that\nholder. 4A tax on sales, for that same speculator, imposes on him a burden that varies\nwith his own purchase price plus his own capital gain or loss.\n\nNew York. CanL S. SHoUP.\n\n? The opposite conclusion, reached by Mr. Kennedy, appears to be due to the fact that he seems not\nto take into account both sides of the next transaction. '' The shift of formal incidence from purchaser\nto seller does not release the speculative purchaser from having to pay the duty. For he will have to pay\nit when he sells the share he has bought ; since he is ex hypothesi a speculator, he will take the duty into\naccount when buying.\" Loc. cit., p. 242. But now his prospective purchaser will have no tax to pay,\nhence will be willing to pay correspondingly when the time comes, and will not this fact exactly counter-\nbalance, in our speculator's mind, the fact that he himself will have to pay a tax at that time ?\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 07:07:32 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

            "found": "Stamp Duties as a Capital Gains Tax:\na Reply\n\nI am greatly indebted to Professor Shoup for having so courteously drawn attention\nto the specious argument I used in my earlier note when I was considering the influence\nof speculators on the market. Professor Shoup is primarily concerned with the theory\nof incidence as such, and since I am entirely in agreement with his excellent analysis, I\nshall not comment further on this aspect. Perhaps I may be allowed, however, to add\ntwo points on the practical issue.\n\nProfessor Shoup, with the help of his numerical illustration (p.), argues that, when\nthe point of impact is shifted from buyer to seller, the speculative buyer will raise his offer\nprice by just the amount of the tax, because he will then obtain the same yield as before\non his speculative instrument. I agree in principle, but it seems to me worth pointing out\nthat it is a very nice calculation of yields which leads to this result. In terms of Professor\nShoup's numerical illustration, the speculator who buys at $80 and sells at $80 will get\n5 per cent on his money. If he bought at $79 and sold at $79 he would get 5:06 per cent.\nThe difference in yield must seem very small to someone not primarily interested in yield\nconsiderations. In my earlier note, I was clearly not justified in arguing that the presence\nof speculators would frustrate the rise in share price as a result of the change in point of\nimpact. Nevertheless, it would seem reasonable to hold that the speculator will not be\nvery important in determining the market's reaction to the change\u2014or, perhaps more\ncorrectly, that it will be his guess about the reaction of the rest of the market that will be\nimportant. And if the speculators are ready to acquiesce in the reactions of the rest of\nthe market, then the relative strength in the market of the tax-exempt dealers will be some-\nwhat enhanced, though I certainly would not pretend that this is very great.\n\nThe second point is perhaps more important. In my original note, I argued that\nthe authorities could achieve a rough and ready capital gains tax by raising stamp duties\nin times of high market values, provided the incidence of the tax was squarely on the seller.\nNow it seems to me clear, once again from Professor Shoup's very helpful numerical\nillustration, that the incidence of the tax is indeed on the seller, whatever the point of\nimpact. There seems to be therefore a prima facie case for a policy of this kind. If the\ncase were accepted, would there be any value in shifting the point of impact from buyer\nto seller ? I still think it would be a sensible thing to do : for, if the taxation of capital\ngains is regarded as just, justice must not only be done but also be seen to be done.\n\nOxford.

He never mentioned the possibility\nof the ratio of the marginal costs being undetermined. On the contrary. He insisted on\nits being unequal to the ratio of the marginal revenues if the total spending was not constant,\nalthough in that case the product markets could not be in equilibrium. My conclusion\nthat he had constructed a model with a tendency to produce unstable solutions was thus\nnot unjustified.\n\nBut in his comments on the first draft of this Note Mr. Pearce expressed himself,\nquite definitely, in favour of the second possibility. I have not been able to find any\nstatement either in his original article or in his Reply which would support this inter-\npretation. As, however, Mr. Pearce is the author of the model, his interpretation must\nbe accepted. And this means that all discussion of stability is precluded by the conditions\nof the model. We simply do not know what happens if the economy is not in equilibrium,\nand there is, therefore, no point in asking whether it moves towards or away from it.\n\nIf we neglect all minor misunderstandings due to unavoidable obscurities and in-\nconsistencies in formulation, the following points seem to emerge from our discussion :\n\n(1) In Mr. Pearce's model the monopolistic producers determine their demand and\nmarginal revenue curves by experimenting with different volumes of output in the conditions\nof full employment and of constant total money incomes.\n\n(2) The producers determine their cost curves on the basis of their production\nfunctions and on the basis of the prevailing prices of factors, which the producers expect\nto remain constant.\n\n(3) The consumers save a part of their incomes, but changes in saving and, therefore,\nin total spending have no effect on the amount of the productive resources employed\n(factor prices always change so as to accommodate changes in spending).\n\n(4) If savings increase (f\u00e1ll) with an increase (fall) in real income, no equilibrium\u2014\nin the sense of all producers! marginal costs being equal to their marginal revenues\u2014is\npossible at any point which is not the maximum welfare point.\n\n(5) Whether equality of marginal costs with marginal revenues is possible at the\nmaximum welfare point depends on the producers! manoeuvres by means of which they\nhave determined their demand and marginal revenue curves.\n\n(6) Equilibrium in the sense of all producers! marginal costs being equal to their\nmarginal revenues does not necessarily imply that their profits are at a maximum. It\nis possible that profits of some of them (or even of all of them) are at a minimum.\n\n(7) The conditions of the model do not permit us to say whether the producers tend\nto move towards the maximum welfare point or away from it (if they happen to be not\nin equilibrium).\n\nTo these conclusions I think we must nowallagree. As to'whether they justify the state-\nment *' that the profit maximising rule * marginal cost to equal marginal revenue ' will,\nif universally applied, lead to the same pattern of production as the more familiar planning\nrule * marginal cost to equal price ' ''?\u2014the reader must follow his own judgment.\n\nLondon.

It has been shown that in my model there is a limit to the\nrate of price deflation if a monetary system is to exist, unless money balances can bear a\nnegative rate of interest. Further, there are no difficulties about a monetary equilibrium\nin the case of increasing productivity. There is no '' ever faster rate of price decline \".\nIndeed, there is no change in the relative advantages of holding money and other assets.\n\nIV CONCLUSION\n\nThe examination of the conditions required for the compatibility of any behaviour\nof the price level with equilibrium has been undertaken on the general assumptions of perfect\nflexibility of prices and perfect foresight. It has been shown that what is required is a\nmedium of exchange on which positive or negative rates of interest can be imposed. If\nmoney must bear a zero money rate of interest, it has been shown that there are limits\nto the rates of change in the price level beyond which the monetary system breaks down.\nFurther, in this case the rate of fall of the price level must not exceed some value which will\nbe below the marginal productivity of capital.  '\n\nAn important distinction between a change of prices due to changes in the quantity\nof money and in productivity is made. Its importance lies in the fact that the equilibrium\nmoney rate of interest must be higher than the marginal productivity of capital if an in-\ncreasing quantity of money is causing the price level to rise, as an allowance is required\nfor the depreciation in the value of money.

If the central bank increases the quantity of idle money\n(without decreasing the supply of some other asset) the recipients of this money may be\nin varying degrees bulls or bears. The more bullish they are the more will the bond rate\nbe reduced. '' If, on the other hand, all receivers of the payments of the central bank are\nbears with respect to bond holding, no change in the rate of interest will occur . . .\"! In\nour terminology this means that k \u2014 1.\n\nIn his recent contribution Professor Patinkin also emphasises the wealth effect of\nchanges in the quantity of money on the demand for money and the effective demand for\nbonds. As the quantity of money increases '* there is a positive real-balance effect on the\nspeculative demand. However, since this effect operates in other markets as well this\nincreased speculative demand must be less than the initial increase in the amount of\nmoney.\"?\n\nIII\n\nThe conclusions of this paper can be summarised briefly. Its basic contention is\nthat the amount of money which people desire to hold as a store of wealth depends not\nonly on the rate of interest but also upon the total amount of wealth available. As the\nstock of idle money is part of that wealth changes in this stock may lead to changes in the\ndesire to hold money.\n\nIt is useful to distinguish between demand curves for money (drawn on the assumption\nof constant wealth) and interest-reaction curves (drawn on the assumption of changing\namounts of money, and, hence, wealth). The former shows the reaction of the rate of\ninterest to changes in the quantity of money effected by open-market operations ; the\nlatter shows the reaction of the rate of interest to ceteris paribus changes in the quantity\nof money. The two curves will coincide if the marginal propensity to hold money (X) is\nZero.\n\nSome presentations of the Liquidity Preference Theory seem to have implicitly made\nthe interest-reaction curve coincide with the demand curve. Mr. Turvey, on the other hand,\ndistinguishes between the two and their different applicabilities.\n\nThe general wealth effect of changes in the quantity of money (or bonds) the impli-\ncations of which this paper attempted to clarify has been treated implicitly or explicitly\nin several theories.\n\nLiverpool.

There is a different Leontief demand function for each type of index formula used.\nIn particular, the elasticity of aggregate demand depends upon the choice from\nalternative arithmetic and geometric formulae.

In figure 4 the drawn lines\nrepresent the points which the consumer can attain by disposing of his stocks at the zero\nprice, while the dashes indicate the same at purchase prices. It is seen that the restriction\nto zero disposal prices makes any given composition of the balance-sheet the best one under\nthe given circumstances. From the point of view of instantaneous maximization at a given\ntime, the balance-sheet \u00eds indeterminate and merely a historical accident.\n\nIt can be suggested that in view of these arguments it is perhaps better to abandon\nthe principle of mazimization of utility at any given moment, and to introduce an altogether\ndifferent principle governing the individual's behaviour. Such a principle should presum-\nably control the movement from one stable point to another, or better still it should imply\nstability at * stable positions\" as a special case. 1 have experimented in this manner with\nthe maximisation of the speed with which the new stable position is attained, and with the\nmaximization of the rate of increase of utility at any given time ; but neither of these has\ngiven satisfactory results. \"There must be other assumptions which give a better per-\nformance and are at the same time intuitively acceptable ; but up to now I have not been\nable to find one.\n\nStill, the theory set out above suggests several verifiable relations which only depend\non the concept of stable positions ; and I think these need not be affected by the introduc-\ntion of a new principle. First, it is implied that the stock of a particular commodity held\nis a function of prices and net worth. \u2014Cross-section analyses should reveal some analogue\nto the Engel curve for individual stocks as a function of net worth. Second, if only\nstable positions are considered\u2014i.e., if we restrict ourselves to cases where no accumu-\nlation occurs\u2014there should be a functional relation between net worth and income.\nConversely, savings should depend on the actual ratio of net worth to income. \u2014 All such\nhypotheses hold, of course, strictly only for individuals with identical preferences ; it may\nbe expected that in this respect age-groups will do for a study of balance-sheets what\nfamily size grouping already does for the analysis of family budgets.\n\nAs for the suggested adaptation of demand to a change in income, it rests on one hand\non the assumption of a straight-line approximation for the path followed by the balance-\nsheet ; the introduction of a new principle governing the choice of this path may leave\nsuch an approximation unaffected. On the other hand, however, it must be pointed out\nthat the assumption of linear depreciation formulae enters to a large extent in the form of\nthe final results ; indeed, this strong assumption is the main factor making for the similarity\nof the present approach with the results of the model given by Stone and Rowe [5].\n\nCambridge.

Naturally it is a matter of degree : a\nsixpence-in-the-pound tax will not worry anyone very much. But if the large public com-\npany remains a maximum profit firm irrespective of the level of taxation, the same is less\nlikely to apply to the individual entrepreneur whose firm was a maximised profit firm\nlargely owing to his own personality, his peculiar attitude to money and income. There\nmust be many who previously restricted themselves to the same, rather frugal, standard\nof living irrespective of the prosperity of their firm, but who have reacted to the current\nhigh levels of taxation by sporting Bentleys and other unaccustomed luxuries. It is called\nan Expense and paid for by the firm, but the Inland Revenue know it more accurately as\nIncome, however disguised. It is not hard to show that an entrepreneur can be better off\nby spending more in the form of such expenses even though his residual profits are reduced.\nThus, the entrepreneur's standard of living may vary in inverse proportion to the profits\nof his firm. Theoretically\u2014and pace the Income Tax Inspector\u2014he is best off at zero\nprofit. Doubly so, because such expenses, being allowable for tax, cost just about half what\nthey would cost if paid for by the entrepreneur himself, quite apart from the personal\nIncome Tax he would be paying on his income.\n\nTaxation is the biggest influence counteracting the general modern tendency for firms\nto tend towards maximum profits. It may be a temporary phenomenon ; possibly it is\nnot the actual level of taxation which makes entrepreneurs behave like this, but the rapid\nchange in levels. If tax rates, however high, remain stable the system of bogus expenses\nmay gradually disappear, and the proportion of maximum profit firms will go on increasing.\nFrom the point of view of those who desire economic growth of the American type\u2014or\neven the Soviet type\u2014such a development is highly desirable.

Examination of the equilibrium conditions of the market as a whole reveals certain\nrelationships which must hold between the total quantities of the two types of *' real\"\nassets, the margins of net worth employed by speculative holders of these assets\nand the price of bonds.

The\nquantity of ** real \" money is M, the amount of I.O.U.s outstanding is 7, and the aggregate\nvalue of bear bonds outstanding, valued at X, is B.

For the market as a whole,\ntotal net worth is B, 4- M, being of course equal to the total of those assets which are not\nat the same time liabilities of members of the market. The amounts of bear bonds and\nL.O.U.s outstanding need not be equal. It is quite possible for the market as a whole\nto be short on bonds, or on money. We define the extent to which it is as a whole short on\nbonds as w \u2014 B4 \u2014 I; if w \u00ab 0, the market is short on money.\n\n2. Now let the price of bonds decrease by y' to X'.

The general impression\nto be gained from Table IV is that in the three cases considered, Y ; (7) is a far poorer approxi-\nmation to X;(f) than was Y,(r). At time 10, for example, in cases A4 and C the relative\ndeviations are still around 26 per cent, and it will take more than 50 time units from zero\nto reduce the relative deviation to less than five per cent.

In the pure demand case the\ndistribution of income is independent of income claims and reflects demands for goods\nand for labour.\n\nIH\n\nWe may define demand inflation as the price rise and/or wage rise brought about by\nD,\u2014, being greater than QP,\u2014,, and cost inflation as the price rise brought about by hW,.,\nbeing greater than P,.\u2014, and/or the wage rise resulting from an excess of jP,., over W,..,.\nAs these terms are often used in discussions about inflation it is as well to spell out their\nprecise meaning in the models.  Beacuse the relationships of the model are derived from\naccepted economic hypothesis, conclusions about the nature of these terms should hold\nwidely.\n\nCost inflation and demand inflation in their pure forms exist only in models VI and IX\nrespectively. In the other models the inflation is a complex mixture of the two factors.\nBasically there are two types of plans which may be in excess of real opportunities to meet\nthem ; expenditure plans for real consumption and real investment which if in excess of\nreal output lead to excess demand, and real income claims by wage and salary earners and\nby entrepreneurs which may lead to cost inflation exerting an effect additional to the demand\ninflation if they are in excess of real income, (jh \u2014 1). In an actual process it would be\nextremely difficult to isolate the two elements, but the terms do have use as indicating the\ncauses behind the process.\n\nIt may be noted in passing that pure cost inflation can only take place without the\naccompaniment of excess demand to the extent that entrepreneurs are prepared to\nallow stocks to pile up. \"When stocks are too high further cost inflation will produce un-\nemployment.\n\nExcessive income claims and excess demand imply cost inflation and demand inflation.\nDeficient income claims and excess demand must therefore imply cost deflation and demand\ninflation, for costs are exerting a downward pressure on prices and wages. Admittedly\ndeficiency of income claims is an unlikely case when inflation becomes advanced, but it\ncould well exist for mild doses.\n\nCanberra. J. D.

I did not want to restrict myself to the condition of zero profits\nalthough this had been suggested as the natural consequence of free entry under competition\nand is associated with the efficiency criteria of linear programming theory. This, of course,\nis an old story. The second order conditions of profit maximisation do not hold for the\ncase of perfect competition with production functions homogeneous of the first degree\u2014\nexplicit form. 1t is the \"exhaustion of product\" problem associated with marginal\nproductivity rewards being paid to all factors, and I feel that it is unfortunate that Morishima\ndesires to base his argument on the peculiarities of this much discussed and much analysed\nproblem. \"Whether one gets maximum profits or not, it can be argued that factors are\nindividually paid according to their marginal productivity and that the total value of output\nis so distributed. Then all my equations hold ; the system of production functions are\nhomogenous of degree zero\u2014implicit form ; and Morishima's sought after property\nprevails. This is very nearly a generalisation of Samuelson's theorem to joint production.\n\nIam much interested in the extension of my interpretation of the Leontief input-output\nsystem to the realm of imperfect competition. This is surely the realistic case and is the\ncase in which the technological basis for constancy of input-output coefficients disappears.\nThe coefficients, in this case, are truly a m\u00e9lange of all types of economic parameters and\nsubject to all the variabilities of human tastes, attitudes, and beliefs, as well as to production\ntechniques. Under these conditions, the market structure of imperfect competition, there\nis no longer any necessary incompatibility between true profit maximisation and homo-\ngeneity of degree zero for the production function. 1t is then possible to have fixed pro-\nportions among physical quantities provided prices remain constant. However, with\nmarket imperfections it is even less likely than in a competitive economy that either relative\nor absolute prices will be unaffected by an /-fold increase in final demand ; hence my\nappraisal of Morishima's case as somewhat pathological.\n\nMorishima's paper serves the purpose of exposing the difficulties confronting input-\noutput theorists when they attempt to interpret their system of empirical regularities.\nIt is variously interpreted as a system of technological relations and as a system of general\nequilibrium equations in the Walrasian sense. It is, in fact, neither. The implicit con-\nfounding of prices and physical quantities without an explicit theory of either type of variable\nprevents the interpretation of input-output analysis along these lines. In a general\nequilibrium system there ought to be a genuine set of technological relations defined in\nterms of physical quantities. In addition, there should be price formation or determination\nequations. The lack of price formation theory and a technological foundation are precisely\nthe aspects forcing Morishima to go to the extreme of assuming prices constant in order to\nmake a statement about quantities. By assuming prices to be a set of constants, he, of\ncourse, avoids the complications they introduce in the system of equations.\n\nOxford. L. R.

To the extent that consumer sovereignty is one of our values, ought we to\nallow people to behave imprudently? Should we permit them the strategy of precom-\nmitment ?\u2014e.g., should a man be allowed to sell himself into bondage for the sake of an\nimmediate gratification of desires ?! What ought to be our view of the irrevocable trust,\nespecially if the maker tries to revoke it? At which date should sovereignty inhere in the\nmaker?

If so, should the constant K be selected so that the derivatives of the log-\nlinear function and the true one are equal at / \u2014 \u00ab ? Why should this be the appropriate\nvalue ?\n\nMy view is that these questions are difficult to answer mainly because consumer\nsovereignty has no meaning in the context of the dynamic decision-making problem. The\nindividual over time is an infinity of individuals, and the familiar problems of interpersonal\nutility comparisons are there to plague us. The interpersonal aspect of the intertemporal\nproblem becomes clear if we think of a similar problem involving a family of brothers\nwhere each has a utility functional depending not only on his own utility but upon a weighted\nsum of the utilities of all of them. Suppose the oldest brother always has the power to\nallocate the annual proceeds of an estate, but with it being foreknown that each year one\nbrother will die off, the oldest next. The shifting of the discount function of the family head\ngives rise to the danger of inconsistent planning ; and the family head of the moment may\nconsider the alternative strategies of (a) an irrevocable trust, or (5) playing his favorites\nextra heavily now knowing that they will be out of favor at a later date. What can the\ndetached view of consumer sovereignty be in this context !\n\nPigou? and others have regarded ** myopia \" as an excuse for state intervention in\ndetermining allocations over time (investment). But on what basis ought the state to\nmake these decisions ? Ramsey? contended that all weights should be equal; but at\nleast for those problems involving the allocation of a limited stock of goods over time\n(i.e., the problem of ** conservation \"), this proposal becomes meaningless if one contem-\nplates future generations ad infinitum.\n\nMore questions have been raised here than I am prepared to answer ; but somewhat\nout of practical considerations I would suggest the following : The individual can probably\ndo as good a job as the state or any other agency in determining allocations for himself\nas of future dates, provided the future dates include none which are proximate. That is\nto say that I would have confidence in the judiciousness of a person to-day, if he is not\nignorant of future facts, to decide how much to save and how much to spend for the rest\nof his life, starting a couple of years from now. | Mr. Smith is probably in as good a position\nto evaluate the relative importance of the Mr. Smith of 1960 and the Mr. Smith of 1970\nas anybody else, and I would therefore permit him, in the absence of risk and uncertainty,\nto precommit his future allocations provided the period of precommitment did not begin for\na couple more years. The real decisions to worry about are those where an immediate\nor proximate satisfaction is gained at the expense of still-more-future costs.  Precom-\nmitment may be regarded as either good or evil depending upon whether the period of\nprecommitment begins now or later.\n\n! Typically, our common law has held many contracts that partake of this character to be unenforceablc.\nThe problem here, ethically, is akin to that of whether a body politic should be permittcd to vote itself into\na dictatorship.\n\n?

These lapses are the splurges, binges, and\nextravagances which we all know.!\n\nThis picture is typical, I suppose for most of us, but there are no doubt some who,\neither through lack of training or insight, have never learned to behave consistently and\nfor whom the intertemporal tussle remains unsolved. These people we call '' spend-\nthrifts.\"? By contrast, those who have taken on log-linear discount functions havc\nlearned to be '\" thrifty.\"\n\nSpendthriftiness, in the general sense of inconsistent or imprudent planning,? is by\nno means insignificant. It is especially among the lower-income classes, where education\nand training are commonly blighted, that one would expect to find imprudent behaviour\nof this sort.* In America, lower-income people tend to gorge themselves with food after\npay-day ; overheat their homes when they have money for a bucket of coal ; are extrava-\ngant, going on sprees on pay-day, not budgeting their money, and engaging in heavy\ninstalment buying ; do not keep their children in school ; and are freer in the expression\nof their sexual and aggressive impulses.? \"Their high birth rate is well-known. All thesc\nbehaviour characteristics can be explained as a failure to cope intelligently with the problem\nof the intertemporal tussle. Obviously, this is not the entire story ; but the observations\nare consistent with the hypothesis presented, and it would be upsetting if thc facts werc\notherwise.\n\nThe character of behaviour under precommitment is more difficult to label. Its\nresults are somewhat ambiguous. Sometimes precommitment causes an individual to\nsacrifice future pleasures heavily for the sake of present ones, e.g., to go into debt to make\npossible an expenditure providing mostly present gratification. But at other times precom-\nmitment seems more '* wholesome,\"? as when a person contracts to save a certain amount\neach month or goes into debt to buy a house. The distinction, I feel, is this : in the one\ncase the present is heavily favored at the expense of the future ; in the other an allocation\nis made among various dates of the future in accordance with weights given by the lower,\nbut more level portion of the A(t \u2014 4) function, as depicted in Figure 3. Precommitment\nthen has the effect of precluding grossly unequal allocation within that future period of time\nonce it moves into the present.\n\n! To one who would say that to discount the future for remoteness at all scems to him foolish and\nirrational, I should reply that he is one who received very strong training as a child which went beyond\nsimply teaching him the strategy of consistent planning and effected such a change in his tastes that he\nnow finds it unnatural to discount the future on this account. | Moralizing against discounting the future\nin this way has, of course, found its way into the prominent literature on this subject. See, e.g., B\u00f3hm-\nBawerk, op. cit., pp. 253-255.\n\n? If the X(t\u20145) function rose to the right of \u00ab, inconsistency between plans and behaviour would lead\nto ** miserliness \" with the individual saving for a Tuture planned expenditure which he continuously post-\npones. True miserliness would, however, appear to be better explained in other terms, money or wealth\nbecoming an object of desire per se.\n\n* The '* spendthrift \" might, of course, also be defined as anyone who discounts the future because of\nits remoteness, but I think this catches somewhat less satisfactorily the essence of the term because such a\nperson may behave quite prudently\u2014empty moralizing aside. | Mr. Thore has pointed out, however, that\nmy spendthrift might display more conservative behaviour than another person who has a lower k even\nthough he plans consistently.\n\n* Perhaps in some underdeveloped economies this problem would take on its most serious dimensions.\nThe notion that the incidence of the sharp discounting of the future is greater among \"' primitive races,\nchildren, and other uninstructive groups in'society \" was asserted clearly by Fisher in The Theory of\nInterest, ch. I\" $8 9, and earlier by Jevons in 7T/te Theory of Political Economy, ch. II and B\u00f3hm-Bawerk,\nOp. Cif., p. .\n\n$ See W. Allison Davis, ** Child Rearing in the Class Structure of American Society \" in The Family in\na Democratic Society: Anniversary Papers of the Community Service Society of New York, 1949 and Robert\nF. Winch, 7T/ie Modern Familv, 1952, pp. 93-94. These authors ascribe these behaviour patterns to anxiety\nfeelings stemming from the insecurity that results from low and irregular income. It is not clear to me\nwhy this anxiety should lead to spendthriftiness rather than to miserliness or to painstaking family budgeting.\nIf the facts were the opposite, would one feel any less comfortable with the explanation given?\n\n5$ The word is in quotes because we do not intend to provide moral judgments at this point.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 15:29:20 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

THE DISCOUNT FUNCTION\n\nSpecial attention should be given, I feel, to a discount function, such as that shown\nin Figure 3, which differs from a logarithmically linear one in that it '* over-values \" the\nmore proximate satisfactions relative to the more distant ones.! Such a function suggests\nthat individuals who precommit their future actions or who naively resolve now what\nthey ** will do \" in the future, commonly do not schedule the beginning of austerity until\na later date. How familiar the sentence that begins, * I resolve, starting next . . .\" ! It\nseems very human for a person who decides that he ought to increase his savings to plan\nto start next month, after first satisfying some current desires ; or for one to decide to\nquit smoking or drinking after the week-end, or to say that '* the next one is the last one.\"\n\nIt has been customary for the United States Army to offer voluntary enlistees a\nfurlough starting with the date of enlistment. This practice is not needed to enable a\nman to put his affairs in order\u2014he can do that first and then enlist\u2014but it does serve\nas an enticement to those who want the paternalism ('* security \") of the army, but do not\nwant it right now.? The many schemes for instalment buying (notably of used automo-\nbiles in the U.S.) which require * no down payment and nothing due for two months \"\nare evidence of the effectiveness of enticements of this same kind. Indeed, all purchases\non credit can be viewed as precommitments that often (although not always) exchange\nfuture costs for a present pleasure.?\n\nMy own supposition is that most of us are *' born\" with discount functions of the\nsort considered here, that precommitment is only occasionally a feasible strategy (because\nof risk and uncertainty), and that we are taught to plan consistently by substituting the\nproper log-linear function for the true one. Children are known to discount the future\nmost precipitously and the *' virtue \" of frugality is something to be instilled when building\n* character.\" True discount functions become sublimated by parental teaching and\nsocial pressure, and the inconsistency problem considered in this paper becomes lost from\nsight. \"There is a rationale for discounting at a constant rate of interest. In some cases\ntraming may be so effective that the individual's original discount function can no longer\nbe said to be his \"true\" one. His tastes have changed and his discount function has\nbecome log-linear or perhaps even constant. Hisis the '* harmony \" case. Precommitment,\ntherefore, is never attractive to him\u2014even under certainty. In other cases,* however, we\nmay say instead that a person has been taught to plan and behave consistently and not\nthat his tastes have been molded. His is not the harmony case. Such a person will, from\ntime to time, depart from the consistent pattern of behaviour, sometimes because pre-\ncommitment becomes feasible (and this is always his preferred strategy under conditions\nbecause precommitment becomes feasible (and this is always his preferred strategy under\nconditions of certainty) and sometimes because of lapses that result when the true weight\n\n! As an empirical supposition, there is a precedent for this in B\u00f3hm-Bawerk, op. cit., pp. 257-258,\n. the original subjective undervaluations are, in the highest degree, unequal and irregular. 'In particular,\nso o far as the undervaluation is caused by defects of will, there may be a strong difference between an enjoy-\nment which offers itself at the very moment, and one which does not ; while, on the other hand, there may\nbe a very small difference, or no difference at all, between an enjoyment which is pretty far away, and one\nwhich is farther away.\" Tn context it is clear that he is'r eferring here to changes in the rate of discount.\nThis same possibility was considered by Marshall, op. cit., Mathematical Appendix, Note V.\n\n*Since marriage was mentioned earlier alongside joining the army as a possible precommitment\nstrategy, I cannot avoid remarking facetiously that marriage too is commonly preceded by a period of\nengagement!\n\n3 There are, of course, other important reasons for buying on credit.\n\n* For the distinction made here I am indebted to Mr. W.

It is not enough that these should be monotonically increasing functions\nof one another because of the variational nature of the problem. Each must be a positive\nscalar multiple of the other, so that the scalar can be factored out of the integrand function\nand placed in front of the integral sign. Thus, if (t \u2014 * \u2014 A\u00ab) \u2014 constant x X(t \u2014 4),\nthe solution to which is X(1 \u2014 \u00ab) \u2014 K'\u2014*, with the constant ratio equal to k^ ^7, we have:\n\nT\nOQ.

Should\n1 enter the problem in a more general way than by merely causing a linear shift of the\ndiscount function, the problem of consistent planning becomes more involved.

(2) At alternative periods the individual selects his consumption for that period and the next\nand allocates this amount between the two periods.

TWO STRATEGIES IN THE FACE OF INCONSISTENCY\n\nAn individual who because he does not discount all future pleasures at a constant\nrate of interest finds himself continuously repudiating his past plans may learn to distrust\nhis future behaviour, and may do something about it. Two kinds of action are possible.\n(1) He may try to precommit his future activities either irrevocably or by contriving a\npenalty for his future self if he should misbehave. This we call the strategy of precommit-\nment. (2) He may resign himself to the fact of intertemporal conflict and decide that his\n* optimal\" plan at any date is a will-o'-the-wisp which cannot be attained, and learn to\nselect the present action which will be best in the light of future disobedience. This we\ncall the strategy of consistent planning. \u2014'T'hese possibilities will be discussed in order.\n\nl. The Strategy of Precommitment. 'To-day it will be rational for a man to jettison\nhis * optimal \" plan of yesterday, not because his tastes have changed in any unexpected\nway nor because his knowledge of the future is different, but because to-day he is a different\nperson with a new discount function\u2014the old one shifted forward in time. Yet it is also\nrational for the man to-day to try to ensure that he will do tomorrow that which is best\nfrom the standpoint of to-day's desires. Unpleasant things which to-day we want to do\nsometime in the future are continually put off until tomorrow (the *' mafiana effect ^\")\nunless we can find some way of precommitting ourselves to actually doing the task tomorrow.\nConsequently, we are often willing even to pay a price to precommit future actions (and\nto avoid temptation). Evidence of this in economic and other social behaviour is not\ndifficult to find. It varies from the gratuitous promise, from the familiar phrase *' Give\nme a good kick if I don't do such and such \" to savings plans such as insurance policies\nand Christmas Clubs which may often be hard to justify in view of the low rates of return.\n(I select the option of having my annual salary dispersed to me on a twelve- rather than on a\nnine-month basis, although I could use the interest!) Personal financial management\nfirms, such as are sometimes employed by high-income professional people (e.g., actors),\nwhile having many other and perhaps more important functions, represent the logical\nconclusion of the desire to precommit one's future economic activity. Joining the army\nis perhaps the supreme device open to most people, unless it be marriage for the sake\nof *' settling down.\" And, of course, regretting either course later on (at least for the\nmoment) is to be expected, for otherwise precommitment would have had no purpose.\nThe worker whose income is garnished chronically or who is continually harassed by\ncreditors, and who, when one oppressive debt is paid, immediately incurs another is\ncommonly precommitting. There is nothing irrational about such behaviour (quite the\ncontrary) and attempts to default on debts are simply the later consequences which are to\nbe expected. Inability to default is the force of the precommitment.\n\nWhat needs to be explained is not that people do precommit their future actions, but\nthat the practice is not still more wide-spread. The reason it is not, I believe, is because\nof the presence of risk and uncertainty, both as to future tastes and future opportunities.\nBecause of risk and uncertainty, people are also willing to pay for options permitting them\na greater range of choice at future dates! and this is of overwhelming importance, especially\nas it affects the detailed aspects of future behaviour.\n\n2. The Strategy of Consistent Planning. Since precommitment is not always a feasible\nsolution to the problem of intertemporal conflict, the man with insight into his future\nunreliability may adopt a different strategy and reject any plan which he will not follow\nthrough. His problem is then to find the best plan among those that he will actually\nfollow.\n\n! See Tjalling C.

Indeed, if it is believed that this special case is realistic, a rationale is needed.\nWe provide one in the next section.\n\n! The reader is cautioned that this is not the same as the familiar proposition that the marginal rate\nof substitution between present and future consumption is determined in equilibrium by discounting at\nthe market rate of interest. The marginal rate of substitution between consumption at time 0 and at time\nt is, for the utility functional used here, equal to:\n\nu ! Ou\nX 3c ! X9 3c\nand not to X(?) / (0). If one unit of consumption at time 0 can be exchanged for (1 -- r)! units at time 1,\nwhere r is the rate of interest, utility maximization requires that:\nA() 9u| 9C()\nry X0) Ou] 9C(0) '\nwhich is quite different from the requirement that:\n\nA( \u2014 G-\u2014) X0) \u2014 kt X(0).\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 15:29:20 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

It may however\nbe pointed out that if the changes in the exchange rate were regular but not rapid the incen-\ntive to speculate would not be very great ; and any short period fluctuations in the balances\nresulting from movements of the exchanges in short steps, e.g., once a year, could be\naccommodated by movements in reserves or short-term finance, or prevented by offsetting\nfluctuations in the stringency of controls or tariffs.\n\nIn any case it is not necessary for changes in the relative prices of non-traded goods\nto come about exclusively via alterations in the exchange rate (r). All the results above\nmay be rewritten so as to allow for the effects of variations of home or foreign prices of\nnon-traded goods ; if we define the proportional rates of change of home and foreign\nprices of non-traded goods in own currencies as :\n\n1 dph 1 dpf\neph \u2014 ph d and epf \u2014 \u00bb d\nthen any result for eT or eP which was achieved by eph \u2014 epf \u2014 0 and er \u2014 er, will equally\nbe achieved by any set of these such that :\neph \u2014 er \u2014 epf \u2014 er (18)\n\nThus it is possible to modify the model to allow for the influence of * autonomous \"\ntrends of prices set up under full employment, and also to allow for the influence of the\nprices of exports and imports in each country on the price level of non-traded goods, so\nlong as this influence is not so strong, in either country, as to make any effective devaluation,\nor other change in the relative prices of non-traded goods, impossible.\n\n19. It is hoped that the model set out above will, for all its limitations,! prove helpful\nin analysing some of the problems set by the long run development of relations between\ndifferent sections of the World Economy, by describing these in a form which makes it\npossible to combine a devaluation analysis of the best-known variety, with information\nabout the market prospects of trade in particular commodities and by particular countries,\nwhich forms the real counterpart of the assumptions about the growth of A-parameters\ndescribed above.\n\nOxford.

The provision of ''finance\" for the purpose of economic\ndevelopment of the colonies by Parliament was in itself a meaningless gesture unless the\nGovernment fully intended to take the requisite steps to release the real resources necessary\nto fulfil the task assigned to the C.D.C. in the Overseas Resources Development Act. This\nis a striking example of the consequences of the Government's failure to integrate into a\ncoherent plan the economic development of her colonial territories.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nIn my review of the achievements of the C.D.C. during the period 1948-54, I indicated\nthe sort of answers which British policy makers have given in practice to our initial set\nof questions : To what extent should a development corporation undertake projects in\npartnership with private enterprise and local governments ? Under what conditions\nshould such a corporation undertake the management of development projects directly ?\nWhat test or tests should the development corporation apply in selecting projects? And\nshould a development corporation finance projects solely by means of loans to private\nenterprise and colonial government authorities ?\n\nThe review of the Corporation's operations has revealed how the C.D.C. has attempted\nto answer the questions raised in the preceding paragraph : (1) Since 1952 association\nwith private enterprise and/or local colonial governments has been a normal requirement\nfor capital sanction for all new C.D.C. undertakings. (2) Prior to 1951, the Board of the\nC.D.C. managed directly most of the Corporation's projects. After that date, '* deliberate\npolicy was to look for experienced private enterprise partners to share in investment and\nmanagement.\"! (3) The Corporation was supposed to act for financial purposes as a\ncommercial concern\u2014to become self-supporting '* taking one year with another.\" And (4)\nthe Corporation committed by the end of 1954 approximately 30 per cent of its total capital\nin the form of loans\u2014ostensibly to cover '* some part of overheads and abortive pilot\nschemes and investigations.\"?\n\nOn the basis of the information I have been able to examine, I do not think that it is\npossible to dismiss in one bold stroke the Corporation's \u00a310 million loss as the result of\ninattention or laxity in administering the financial and other provisions of the Overseas\nResources Development Act, especially since, as I have attempted to show, the provisions\nof the Act are subject to more than one interpretation. And during the initial period\n1948-50, no clear and concise criterion for capital sanction was provided either in the\nOverseas Resources Act or by the responsible Ministers in Parliament. The Board's\nfirst Chairman, Lord Trefgarne, can argue with some justification that the Board of the\nC.D.C. was adjusting its interpretation of Section 15 (1) of the Act to an object and purpose\nunfamiliar to the administrators of the nationalized industries ; that is, as a guide to the\nselection of new enterprises rather than as a guide to the operation of existing ones.\n\nBloomington, Indiana.

The avowed purpose for which the C.D.C. was set up was that of\n** improving the standard of living of the colonial peoples by increasing their productivity\nand wealth \".? But it was to do this within the limits imposed by the requirement to\nbreak-even in the longer-run, and it was also to keep the dollar shortage in mind.? This\nmay be a ** vagueness of the mandate \". One may, perhaps, question the compatibility\nof the first two requirements, and the relevance of the third (the colonies being the main\ncontributor to the sterling area dollar pool). But there seems nothing which invites failure\nof the projects undertaken.\n\nThe failures, it seems to me, have resulted from a combination of managerial incom-\npetence and of the high risks inevitably attaching to untried ventures in the colonies, though\nthese two elements are in practice not easy to separate. Incompetent management is of\ntwo kinds : the people responsible for the carrying-out of particular projects doing the\nwrong thing ; the people responsible for selecting the projects making too optimistic an\nassessment of the risks, and doing so on the basis of inadequate investigation. Deficiencies\nof both these kinds existed in full measure, and are well illustrated by the story of the\nGambia poultry-farming scheme. It may be that the atmosphere of 1948 was conducive\nto an urge for speed and a heavy discounting of risks, although the Corporation had ex-\npressed its intention '* to avoid all embracing and grandiose economic development plans \".\nBut it was surely right to accept Bagehot's precept that '* caution is the life of banking,\nbut venture is the life of commerce \". To blame the failures on ** vagueness of the mandate\"\nor on the financial rules puts things the wrong way round. And it is relevant in this con-\nnection to emphasise that the failures were not merely financial (an inability to break-even)\nbut physical (no eggs and dead chickens).\n\nThe real part played by the break-even rule was to compel a sharp contraction in the\ngrowth, and a change in the character of the Corporation's activities once large sums\nof money had been lost early-on through bad. management. The Corporation had itself\nfully appreciated that it would need, on some of its undertakings, to earn more than what\nI have called the modest return to be earned overall : '* it hopes and expects that some of\nits undertakings will make substantial yields in order to counterbalance low yields and\nlosses \". But when large losses were experienced in the early stages, venture had to give\nway to caution. In an effort to fulfil its financial obligations the Corporation had to\neschew risks, to cut its losses, and to concentrate on well-paying projects. Hence the\nchanges which Mr. Wicker describes : increasing participation with private capital ;\nincreasing importance of debenture loans as a form of financial participation by C.D.C.\nThe Corporation became something very different from its original conception.\n\nIt seems probable that if the Corporation had started more cautiously, and had selected\nprojects which, though small, were a financial success, nothing would have been heard\nof the vagueness of the mandate or of the difficulties inherent in the rules under which the\nCorporation operated. The difficulties would have been there, but they would have been\nconcealed. They were brought into prominence only by the early failures, which were\nthemselves the result of quite other causes. However, a less venturesome policy would\nhave brought its own problems, for it would no doubt have been asked whether the oper-\nations of the Corporation were not too limited to do much good for the colonies.\n\nOxford.

We may now say something more on the economic meaning of our results. The\nexpression (b' \u2014 A'A) is a vector of net profitabilities of activities\u2014the difference, in each\ncase, between revenue and cost, where the latter is evaluated at the '' efficiency \" prices\nof the productive factors. Each element in this vector is necessarily zero or negative ;\nand when it is negative, the activity level of the corresponding activity is zero. On the\nface of it, (1*) says that whenever there are changes in the parameters 5 and 4, the resultant\nchanges in 4 and x are such that each activity which has become more profitable (the net\nprofitability has become less negative, or has become zero) as a result of all these changes,\nwill have increased its activity level if this level changes at all, and conversely ; and like-\nwise, if either one has changed in the negative direction, so has the other. This seems reason-\nable enough : the more profitable activities have increased their output, the less profitable\nones have decreased it, insofar as they have changed at all. Similarly, (2*) says that each\nproductive factor whose unemployed residue (always positive or zero) has increased will\nhave suffered a fall in price, and conversely ; and each factor whose residue has decreased\nwill have enjoyed a rise in price, and conversely ; but in each case a definite change in\nthe one variable does not exclude a zero change in the other.\n\nIn evaluating these results, we must note the following points : Whenever an element\nof the vector (b' \u2014 2'4) is changing, the corresponding x is almost always not ; and vice\nversa. If the former is changing, then the activity level in question is zero either before or\nafter the change, and will be zero both before and after the change if net profitability is\nnot zero either before or after. To take an example of a case when both are changing,\nsuppose that net profitability rises from a negative value to zero while the activity level\nrises from zero to a positive value, for a particular activity; the conclusion that both must\nhave changed in the same (algebraic) direction is a perfectly straightforward result of the\nassumption, basic to linear programming, that negatively profitable activities have zero\nactivity levels. The interpretation of (2) and (2*) is exactly analogous.\n\n8. The results just arrived at are very helpfully illustrated by Marshall's train-boat\nexample,! used by Beckmann in the preceding note. First it is necessary to note that the\nrestraints applying to the dual of the form of the problem given by Beckmann are :\n\n\u2014h, \u2014 n Q, \u2014\u2014 \u00c0o\n\u2014b, \u2014 A, ds \u2014 3\nwhenever both kinds of transport are used ; this gives :\n\n!

The expression (6) then tells us that the indi-\ncated sum of this particular set of tendencies must not be less than the sum of the tendencies\nof efficiency prices and utilizations of factors (including those not directly affected by the\ntechnological change) to move together for every factor (if they move at all).\n\n5. This result may be generalised in terms of the matrix equations (1*) and (2*) :\n\n&(b' \u2014 1A) 8x 2 0 2 8X XXe \u2014 Ax).\n\nDistributing the operators and rearranging, we obtain :\n(7) 8b' 8x -- 82 84. x \u2014 A 84 8x 2 9X 8(Ax) 2 9X 8c. (8)\nWe may now consider some interesting special cases. Consider, for example, 85 \u2014 3c \u2014 0,\ni.e., where the only changes are in technology, this gives :\n\n84 84: x \u2014X 84 8x 2 9X 9(Ax) 2 0, (6*)\nwhich is the generalization of (6). Its economic interpretation is the same as that just\ngiven for (6). Another interesting case is $44 \u2014 3c \u2014 0, i.e., when the only changes are in\nthe activity revenues. Here we obtain :\n\n8b 8x 293 A8x 20 (9)\nwhich is a sharpened form of the inequality obtained by Samuelson.\n\nIt should be noted that there are no term by term inequalities behind (7), (8), (6*),\nand (9) in the same sense that there are such inequalities behind (1*) and (2*), namely\nthose given in (1) and (2). By (1) and (2) we know that for every k and every n respectively,\nthe indicated inequality holds for the kth term of the product of the two vectors 3p' and\n8x on the left hand side of (1*) and for the nth term of the product of the two corresponding\nvectors on the left hand side of (2*). No such statement can be made about the inequalities\n(7), (8), (6*), and (9) because the rearrangement of terms necessary to obtain them has\nobliterated the term by term relations.\n\n6. It is of interest to note when it may be expected that the strict inequalities hold, and\nwhen not. We have already seen that if there is no change in the set of free factors we may\nwrite 8A' 8(4x) \u2014 93'8c. (In fact, we may do so also if any factor which ceases to be or\nbecomes free is only just free before or after the parameter change, resp., that is if c \u2014 Axx\neven though X, \u2014 0 or if (1 2- 3)ex \u2014 (1 -- 8) (A4xx) even though (1 4- 355 \u2014 0.) Similarly\nit can be shown that if there is no change in the set of activities, or if any activity which\nceases or begins goes to or from the borderline case of inactivity, then :\n\n8b' 8x \u2014 9(' A) \u00e0x.\n\nHence we conclude that if for any factor ex which ceases to be or becomes free the relation\nck \u2014 X ay; x; holds for all k both before and after the change in parameters, and if for\nJ\n\nany activity x; which ceases or begins the relation b; \u2014 X ax; holds for all j both before\nk\n\nand after the change in parameters, then the relations (7) and (8) may be written :\n\n(7*) 8b' 8x -- 81/84 : x \u2014 X' 84 8x \u2014 9X S(Ax) \u2014 5X 8c.

                    "A Generalized Comparative Statics\nin Linear Programming\n\n1. In the preceding note, Beckmann shows how the conclusion given by Samuelson!\nthat 3b' 8x z\u00bb 0, where the vector of activities x changes as a result of a change of the vector\nof revenues b, can be generalized to include changes in the vector of factor availabilities c\nand in the technology matrix 4. These results are arrived at solely by consideration of\nknown relationships among the vectors in question, not by any explicit consideration of\nthe restraints applying to the individual elements of these vectors. It is the purpose of\nthe present note to show the further considerable sharpening of these results which may be\nobtained by taking into account the specific restraints on the individual variables. We shall\nfind, in fact, (a) that the two quantities in Beckmann's expression (9) are individually\nsubject to a corresponding restraint ; (b) that the restraint applies not merely to the vector\nproducts shown but to each term in the vector products ; and (c) that a simple rule separates\nthose cases in which the equality sign holds in these expressions from those cases in which\nthe inequality sign holds.\n\nIn section 2 the assertions (a) and (5) will be simultaneously demonstrated ; in sections\n3 and 4 the consequent sharpening of Beckmann's result will be applied to the special\ncase he considers in his section 2 of a change in a single technological coefficient ; in\nsection 5 some further consequences of (a) are examined ; in section 6 the rule mentioned\nin (c) is set out and demonstrated in detail ; and in section 7 the rule (c) is illustrated using\nthe example from Marshall given by Beckmann in the preceding note.\n\n2. Consider an activity analysis problem 5b'x \u2014 max subject to Ax \u00ab c, x Z 0, and\nx\n\nconsider some arbitrary changes in the parameters 4 \u2014\u2014- A 4- 84, c \u2014 c 4- 8c, b \u2014 b\n.- 8b, giving rise to the corresponding changes in the solutions for activity levels and\nefficiency prices x \u2014\u2014- x 4- 3x and 4 \u2014\u2014- A 4- 84. To simplify the presentation of this\nsection, we shall define a vector of net revenues p, where the typical term of this vector is :\nPy \u2014 by \u2014 X ay &\u00ab O.\nn\n\nand where the change in net revenue of the kth activity, as a result of the changes in para-\n\nmeters, is :\nSP, \u2014 S(by \u2014 X s ak)\n\n\u2014\u2014 Oby \u2014 X 9Ao * \u00fckn \u2014 X \u00c0n Saks.\nn n\n\nNow the efficiency price theorem states that all activities for which net revenue is\nnegative have zero activity levels ; that is, if, for any k, Pk \u2014 0 then x\u00ab \u2014 O0, and if\nPy 4- SP, \u2014 O then x; 4- 8xy \u2014 0. Hence it is evident that if xi \u2014 0 and xy -- 3x\u00ab \u2014 0,\nthen 3P& \u2014 0, because then Py \u2014 0 \u2014 Py 4- 3P&.. Similarly we know that if P& \u2014 0 and\nPy 4. 8Py \u00ab 0, then 3x, \u2014 0 \u2014 xx.\n\nHence if both 3xy z& 0 and 8Py z^ 0 for any k, it must be true for that Kk either that\nXk \u2014 O0 and 8xy \u2014 O or that xx -- 3xx \u2014 O and 3x, \u2014 0.

His C, and C, are two kinds of\nequipment, but nothing is said about the time which it takes to produce them (gestation\nperiod) or the period over which they are expected to be useful (service life). It is no\nargument to dismiss a problem as antiquated until it has either been satisfactorily solved\nor shown to be uninteresting.\n\nIn my opinion Professor Solew is barking up the wrong tree in seeking either the\nproblem or the solution amongst index numbers. Let us postulate a world in which\nthere is only one kind of machine, and let us abstract from working capital. Then the\nproblem with which Professor Solow is concerned evaporates. Now compare two machines.\nIf one is older than the other and has a shorter prospective remaining service life, its value\nis less, and the difference in value varies with the rate of interest.\n\nNext, compare two machines exactly alike in all respects (including age) except that\none is drawn from an economy with a higher product-wage rate. The value of the two\nmachines is different, and the investment required to create them is different. A difference\nin value remains if we deflate them by the wage rate (obtaining what I have called *' real\ncapital \" or capital in terms of labour time), for in two economies with different product-\nwage rates the rate of profit and therefore the rate of interest are different (under the\nassumptions on which the argument is set out). I am sorry to have given the impression\nthat ** it does not seem to bother \" me that two exactly similar pieces of equipment may\nrepresent different quantities of accumulation. I was trying precisely to show what there\nis to be bothered about.\n\nAgain, if the wage rate has altered during the life time of a machine, its historic cost\nand its reproduction cost differ.\n\nFinally, two machines, though physically alike may require different quantities of\nlabour to produce or to operate them (because of technical progress).\n\nNone of these questions can be dealt with in terms of an index of physical equipment,\nand each of them is important for the analysis of distribution and of capital accumulation.\n\nCambridge.

These empirical studies provide, moreover,\ncertain goals at which the theory ought to aim. For these studies have indicated that\ncertain behaviour patterns are extremely common among the firms of the real world.\nIt would seem then that one important test of any theory of the firm should be its ability\nto show such behaviour as a normal consequence of the assumptions it makes. The\ncomplex of phenomena known as full cost pricing appears to me to be a sensible and even\nlikely outcome of my assumptions. This seems to me to provide an independent check\non the plausibility of the assumptions themselves.\n\nTo turn now to some of the criticisms which are rather more specific to my paper.\n(1) Mr. Davis objects to my use of the concept of an industry on the grounds that such an\nentity is, in practice, indefineable in terms of either technological similarity or substitu-\ntibility.| But, in the simplest form, the concept of an industry is merely a way of stating\nthat any particular firm, is, in most respects, compelled to give the policies of other firms\nvery great weight in forming its own. Whether the firms it must watch are the producers\nof close substitutes, or technologically similar products, is not really very important ;\nnor is it important just where the line is drawn in our theory. As long as the firm does in\npractice act as though a defineable industry existed we are justified in having introduced\nthe concept. The fact that it requires refinement to apply to particular cases does not remove\nits advantages.\n\n(2) Mr. Davies suggests that it is anomalous that consumers who are *' largely price\nconscious \" can be appealed to by means of sales expenditure and product variation.?\nBut it does in fact appear to be common to seek these '* advantages \" as long as no price\nis attached to them.\n\n(3) Mr. Davies finds some difficulty in my assumption that. all firms may maximize\ntheir profits, while only the price leader (i.e., the firm willing to accept the lowest price)\nwill be able to obtain the highest possible profits. \"The difference is that the non-leaders\nmaximize profit subject to the constraint that price is selected for them by another firm.\nThe leader is under no such constraint : he selects the price to suit himself. The situation\ns stable because those who are dissatisfied with it cannot raise their prices without losing\ngoodwill, whereas lowering prices still further will, by hypothesis, make them less com-\nfortable than they already are.\n\nFinally, Mr. Davies is doubtful whether theory has any role at all to play in unravelling\nso complex a picture. Whether or not he is right will, ultimately, only be revealed by\npatient application of both theoretical and empirical approaches. Butit would seem prema-\nture to abandon the attempt to see certain genera] rules underlying business conduct simply\nbecause the categories employed by theorists do not find exact parallels in the real world.\nEconomic theory is, after all, a tool of research and not a body of settled knowledge,\nand in no field is this more true than in the theory of the firm. It is the task of the applied\neconomist to adapt the tools provided by the theorist (often perforce the same man!)\nto his particular problem, and it would be foolhardy for the theorist to usurp that function.\n\nToronto.

In Figure 2 we see that if a combination of hedged and\nunhedged stocks are held we may hold an unlimited total quantity of stocks provided\nthe two are increased proportionately. This proportion is given by the slope of the\nstraight line PQ in Figure 2.\n\n6. We have reached the point where a summary of our assumptions and conclusions\nwould be in order. We asserted that if merchants maximise their expected income,\nsubject to the constraint that the probability that their actual net income falls below\na disaster level should not exceed a certain value, then under certain conditions they\nwill either hold cash, hold a combination of short-hedged and unhedged stocks, or a\ncombination of long-hedged commitments and unhedged stocks. In order to find these\nconditions we showed that the probability constraint could be approximated by means\nof the Tchebycheff inequality without making any assumptions about the form of the\nprobability distribution. We are able to reach our conclusions in terms of the second\norder moments of the probability distribution of prices of spots and futures. In addition,\nwe argued that the forward price will always equal the spot price plus carrying costs,\nand that the futures price will never be greater than the spot price plus carrying costs.\nThis permitted us to conclude that the expected gain from a long hedge is the negative\nof the expected gain from a short hedge.\n\nThe detailed conclusions are as follows :\n\n(a) If we expect the spot price and the basis to move in the same direction, then\nwe will hold short-hedged and unhedged stocks only if we expect both actions to be\nprofitable. The basis and the spot price will move together if the futures price and the\nspot price move in opposite directions.\n\n(b) If we expect the spot price and the basis to move in opposite directions, then\nwe will hold unhedged stocks and long-hedging commitments if we expect both actions\nto be profitable. The spot price and the basis will move in opposite directions when the\nfutures price and the spot price move in the same direction.\n\n(c) We will hold short-hedged and unhedged stocks when one of these actions is\nexpected to be unprofitable if the basis and the spot price are expected to move in\nopposite directions. Hence we would expect short-hedged stocks and unhedged stocks\nto occur simultaneously during the part of the year when no new stocks are expected\nto be forthcoming (when the spot price and the futures price will move together).\n\n(d) Similarly we will hold unhedged stocks and long-hedging commitments when\none of these is expected to be unprofitable when the basis and the spot price move in\nthe same direction. Generally this occurs when the spot and futures prices move in\nopposite directions. This is most common in that part of the crop year when new\nsupplies are expected to be forthcoming.\n\n(e) We will hold only one type of commitment when it is expected to be very\nprofitable with respect to the other.\n\nChicago.

The two index numbers are, therefore, negatively\ncorrelated. It follows that the variance of log Q';(/) will be less than half as great as the\narithmetic mean of the variances of log Q',(r) and log Q',(r.. Hence, in view of (10),\nthe residual variance obtained by using ^ ideal\" index numbers in the demand equation\nfor a group of commodities will be less than half as great as the arithmetic mean of the\nresidual variances obtained by using the two alternative combinations of Laspeyres' and\nPaasche's index numbers.  Symbolically we have:\n\n(15) var. ua(t) \u00ab \u00a3i (var. u,(\u00a3) 4- var. uy(2))\nwhere u4(t), u,(t) and uj(f) are obtained by substituting Q'4(t), Q',(r) and Q';(t) respectively\ninto (10).\n\nThe inequality (15) has been derived from the assumptions 4 B and C and the\nassumption that consumers behave rationally in the sense that they make consistent\nchoices.! \"We can relax assumptions (A4) and (B) provided that the factors which are no\nlonger assumed to be constant can be introduced into the demand equation. In practice\nit will be possible to introduce into the demand equation only a few of the variates which\nhave an influence upon demand, and part of the stochastic element in the equation will\nbe due to the omission of the remaining variates. Hence the variances of the variates\nu'a(t), u',(t) and v',(r), which are obtained by adding to wu;(t), (t) and uj(f) the stochastic\nelement \u00ab(f) resulting from the omission of certain variates from the demand equation,\nwill not necessarily satisfy the inequality (15). Nevertheless, the less restrictive inequality :\n\n(16) var. u'a(t) \u00ab &(var. w's(t) -- var. u's(f))\n\nwill probably be satisfied.?\n\nFrom (16) it follows that, if the residual variances resulting from the use, in the\ndemand equation, of the two alternative combinations of Laspeyres' and Paasche's index\nnumbers are approximately equal, then the residual variance resulting from the use of\n* ideal\" index numbers will be smaller than either of them. It is possible, however,\n(depending upon the shape of the indifference surface) that the residual variance obtained\nby using one of the combinations of Laspeyres' and Paasche's index numbers will be much\nsmaller than the residual variance obtained by using the other combination ; and, in this\ncase, it could be smaller also than the residual variance obtained by using ** ideal index\nnumbers.\n\nIt should be remembered that the conclusions reached so far concern the residual\nvariance in the structural equation and not the estimated residual variance obtained by\nleast squares regression or any other particular method of estimation. . Provided, however,\nthat the statistical methods used lead to unbiased estimates of the parameters of the equation,\nwe should expect the inequality (16) to apply also to the estimated residual variances\nobtained by these methods.\n\nThe practical importance of this conclusion will depend upon the relative magnitudes\nof the variances of the stochastic elements u(z) and e(t). The element (f) will be greater\nthe greater is the change in the relative prices of the different members of the group and,\nas can be seen from (10), the greater is the group parameter [1 -- 5b]. Hence the choice\nof index numbers is likely to be important in cases where the relative prices of the different\nmembers of a group of commodities vary considerably and where the elasticity of demand\nfor the group is either much greater or much less than unity.\n\n! The inequalities (11) and (12) depend upon the last of these assumptions.\n?

                    "The Use of Index Numbers in\nDemand Analysis\n\nI\n\nIn most empirical demand studies it is necessary to deal to some extent with groups\nrather than individual commodities. In fact, in order to avoid grouping, one should have\nnot only to distinguish between all the different brands and grades of a given commodity,\nbut also to use such small units of time that quantities purchased, at different points of\ntime, within a unit period could be regarded as perfect substitutes. It is seldom possible\nto adopt such a procedure, and, consequently, the demand functions whose parameters\nwe attempt to estimate from empirical data are not, usually, identifiable with the demand\nfunctions of economic theory. Indeed, the so-called parameters of such equations are,\nin most cases, not parameters at all ; for, even if the tastes and income of every consumer\nin the market and the prices of all commodities outside the group were to remain constant,\nthere would, generally, be no constant relation between the price and quantity indices for\na given group of commodities.\n\nThis leads to the question of what we are trying to measure when attempting to esti-\nmate the parameters of stochastic demand equations involving groups. Are we trying\nto estimate the values of certain constants which, assuming a complete knowledge of con-\nsumers' preferences, could be deduced from economic theory, or are we performing\nmeaningless arithmetical operations?\n\nConsider the n demand equations :\n\n(1) qi \u2014 f(pi (D, Pa (D, . \u00abPu Psi (0, pao m) i \u2014 1... .n\n\nin which q(f),p.(t) and m(r) are the quantity of the ith commodity, the price of the ith\ncommodity and money income respectively in period z. | Let P(t) be any index of the prices\nof the first \u00bb? commodities which varies in proportion to these prices when they all change\nin the same proportion, and let Q() be the quantity index defined in such a way that P(f) Q(1)\nalways varies in proportion to the expenditure on the group. We then have :\n\nQ) P(f)Q(t) \u2014 constant x b pta)\n\neQ(r) P()\n9P(t) Q(f)\nthe individual commodities. Generally, therefore, it will not be constant, even at a partic-\n\nular level of prices.

The consumption *' steps \" are however not in the same order for all consumers :\none may place lighting, wireless, cooking and iron in that order of preference in the\nelectrical way of life, and another may have a totally different order (or none at all) after\nlighting. The supplier may therefore feel unjustified in attempting more than two or three\nblocks, especially as he will be faced with a situation where the prices of electrical appliances\nwill vary considerably from time to time (and so almost certainly shift B and C if not A).\n\nConcluding Comment\n\nSince tariffs cannot be adjusted to individual surpluses or to changes in the surpluses\nover time, the two-block tariff advocated by Mr Gabor would not appropriate all consumers'\nsurpluses, and it would deny electricity to some who could afford it under another form\nof tariff. These arguments seem to apply equally to the case of gas. Since most consumers'\nindifference curves for electricity apparently are not continuous and do not originate on\nthe income axis, a multi-block or a conventional two-block tariff may collect more of the\nsurpluses in total than can the Gabor type. 1f electrical apparatus were more readily\navailable in homes, these ** curves \" would more closely resemble the normal type of indiffer-\nence curve, and in the case of gas this position may already have been reached with many\nconsumers : the minimum gas service normally contemplated is cooking, for which gas\nis not so indispensable as electricity is for lighting since it may be supplemented or sup-\nplanted by fuels using inexpensive apparatus or apparatus already in the possession of\nthe housewife\u2014 coal fires, electric kettles and toasters, etc. In consequence some consumers,\nespecially those with gas rings, may have indifference curves more resembling the continuous\ndownward sloping curves of Diagram I, and in these circumstances the Gabor type tariff\ncould have advantages. But some consumers might not contemplate using gas for any\nservice other than cooking, whether occasional cooking on a gas ring or full scale cooking\non a cooker. These would more resemble consumer A4 on Diagram II in that a single\npoint fully charted their gas indifference *' curves\" so that a single price could extract\nmost of their consumers' surplus. The difficulty analogous to (i) above however would\nthen arise : a single price aimed at the householder with a gas cooker might leave a large\nunexploited surplus with the gas-ring customer, and a single price aimed at the latter might\nforce the gas cooker customer to use another fuel.\n\nThis comment has followed Mr. Gabor in assuming that the more a supplier can exploit\nthe consumer's surplus the higher his net profit, or the lower his net loss, will be. If,\nhowever, as seems likely, the cost per unit supplied to a consumer varies with his level of\nconsumption, then the supplier would have this additional factor to take into account\nin deciding the form of his tariff. For example a supplier would presumably only want\nto supply consumer 4 in Diagram II if AQ were greater than the specific costs attributable\nto the supply. However, the assumption is probably on the whole a useful first approxi-\nmation when the form of the block tariffs is under consideration ; it would have to be\nabandoned when quantities and prices for the blocks had to be fixed, or if it could be shown\nthat the specific costs of supplying a consumer were not a monotonic decreasing function\nof consumption.\n\nLondon.

When in office,\nfor the first year or so which concern us here, there was no major change of policy in this\nfield, which might have made the plan irrelevant. Moreover, had there been such a change\nof policy, it would not necessarily follow that the plan would forthwith have ceased to be\nsignificant. It is the thesis of this article to suggest that if the plan and its virtual achieve-\nment have significance, it is to show that the economy cannot be directed quickly towards\nany particular end. If it takes a year or two to induce the necessary alterations in policy,\nand make them effective in the behaviour of firms and individuals, it is likely to take at\nleast as long for a political decision to change the policy to become effective. Fortunately\nfor our present purpose, the change of Government came late enough before the plan-year\n1952/53 to make the possibility of a major change of policy of little importance.\n\nTo summarise then, the only conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence is that\nthe success of the Long Term Programme, our only 4-year plan, can at present be neither\nproved nor disproved. To argue either way, it is necessary to make non-verifiable\nassumptions. The assumptions are likely to seem plausible and justified or not according\nto the political opinions, knowledge, experience or prejudice of the holders. At least\nit can be said that the evidence does not show any prima facie case for the anti-planners\nor the cynics.\n\nOne conclusion arising clearly from this study is that if planning of this kind is to be\ntaken seriously it should be more carefully and precisely formulated. If we are interested\nin plans we must be interested in their results. 1t is only possible to discover the results\nat all exactly if somewhere (not necessarily all of it for publication) there is an account of\nexactly what the plan meant.\n\nA more important inference from the somewhat surprising success of the plan, if\nsuccess be conceded, is that the distinction between planning the real, and relatively stable,\ncomponents of the economy needs to be distinguished more clearly and explicitly from the\nmonetary, and unstable, components. At worst, the distinction might help to make the\nmeaning or limits of plans more clearly understood ; at best, it might help towards making\nplans more effective. Having distinguished the more stable and predictable elements,\na plan for them should allow a longer time for its operation than has so far been\ncustomary.\n\nNottingham.

CONCLUSION\n\nThe general conclusion seems to be that, if population is growing, accumulation\nof capital has strictly limited powers of raising real wages, in the absence of technical\nprogress. Under constant returns, with a constant fraction of national income accu-\nmulated, it is possible for labour, capital and national income all to increase at the\nsame rate, maintaining a constant level of real wages. But in order to increase real\nwages, capital must increase faster than labour. This entails a rising accumulation-\nfraction, which cannot, however, increase indefinitely, since there is an upper limit to\nthe proportion of its national income that any community can accumulate. Under\ndiminishing returns, capital must increase faster than labour in order to keep real\nwages from falling (let alone raise them) ; except in the improbable case where an\nincrease in both labour and capital is accompanied by a fall in the amount of rent\n(even so, rent cannot become negative). In order that capital may increase faster than\nlabour, the accumulation-fraction must continually rise, as in the previous case. Under\ncertain circumstances (such as the existence of rather odd kinds of national-income\nfunction) this increase in the accumulation-fraction may be postponed. If population\ngrows at a diminishing rate, it is possible that the accumulation-fraction, even if it\nrises, may approach asymptotically an upper limit that is practically possible. These\ngeneral propositions may be qualified in particular cases ; but it appears probable\nthat these qualifications will cease to apply with very high rates of capital growth.\n\nAll these limitations on the raising of real wages can be removed if we postulate a\nsufficiently high rate of technical progress. Thus, technical progress is a necessary\ncondition for a permanent and continuous increase in real wages. (This conclusion is\nexpressed in terms of real wages. Similar propositions would hold good of real income\nper head. Even if we assume that the State has an unlimited power to redistribute\nreal income, we cannot escape the conclusions reached here.)\n\nBristol, H, D, DickINSON,\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 15:53:53 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Even if a man eventually chooses a distribution which shows that he is averse\nfrom taking large risks, the selected distribution may include one or more component\nrisks which, if faced in isolation, would be regarded as gambles. Thus simultaneous\ninsurance and gambling may not necessarily be inconsistent with the use of the distri-\nbution function of a unimodal income distribution as a utility function.\n\nThe compatibility of the present theory with others is perhaps less important\nthan its possibilities as a. fruitful tool of analysis. A convincing demonstration of its\nemployment must await another occasion, but a brief account of some of its qualities\ncan be given. Firstly, the basis of the theory is essentially competitive ; it can be\nused to show how a man should strive to scale the social ladder or how a firm should\nattempt to maintain its predominance in an industry. The man and the firm do not\nmaximise utility and profits in a vacuum, but condition their actions according to\nboth their present status in their respective societies and their expectations about the\ncollective results of their rivals' activities. Secondly, the theory is flexible because we\nare free to vary the quality or quantity on which an individual's rank in a given society\nis deemed to depend and to re-draw the boundaries of this society according to the\nproblem in hand. The relevant rank may depend on income, wealth, or marks in an\nexamination, while the society may be co-extensive with a nation, a village, an\nindustry, or a profession. Thirdly, the theory explains a great variety of behaviour.\nIt tells us why small firms must take risks if they want to get on and why large firms\nare likely to avoid doing so. Used in conjunction with a simple model applicable to\nagriculture, it indicates the degree of crop diversification desirable with large holdings\nand explains why smallholders may concentrate on a single crop, the nature of the\ncrop varying again with the size of holding. It shows under what circumstances some\nland may be left idle.\n\nLastly, but not least in importance, the theory is based on a principle that is\nsimple and easy to understand. The great advantage of profit maximisation is that its\nimplications are easily intelligible ; perhaps for this reason there is considerable\nreluctance' to abandon the principle even when its limited applicability has been\ndisclosed. The idea of a firm attempting to secure the highest position in the hierarchy\nof an industry can be grasped without the necessity of removing our feet from solid\nground. The principle is not simply a restatement of the nebulous assertion that\nexpected utility is or should be maximised.\n\nVI.\n\nThe earlier disquiet about the relationship between two kinds of utility has led\nus by devious ways to a position where we can prescribe a rule of conduct for those\nwho aspire to social eminence, in so far as this is determined by position in the income\ndistribution. The principle expounded seems to hold some promise of yielding useful\nresults when applied to specific problems. At worst we have shown that a new parlour\ngame can be played with the aid of no more than a Report of the Commissioners of\nInland Revenue and a slide rule.\n\nCambridge. A. D.

National income tables focus on size, sectoral accounts on structure,\nfunctioning or inler-relationship.? ln countries with a highly developed productive\napparatus, diversified output, and large pool of '' know-how \"' and skills, the problems\nof stabilisation and full employment are the major policy considerations, at least in\npeace-time. Such economies usually have highly *' elastic \" capacities at the margins.\nIn these economies so-called '' social overhead capital \"' is not a limiting factor, and an\nexpenditure programme to fill a deflationary gap is likely to elicit a production response\nleading to increased employment. For such economies national income figures are most\nuseful. On the other hand, the underdeveloped countries are precisely those for which\nthe structural insights provided by sectoral accounts are of first priority, and structural\nconsiderations have this top priority, not only because bottlenecks bulk so large, but\nalso because the aggregate consumption and investment functions lack autonomy due\nto shifting boundaries between the monetary-non-monetary sectors (see footnote !\nbelow). This \" principle of choice \" has been roughly stated by Mr. Seers in another\nplace.?\n\nThus, on the operational level we come to the not too surprising eclectic conclusion\nthat both types of accounts have something to contribute to the analysis of under-\ndeveloped countries and the problem of development. To get our initial insights into\nthe size of the economy, how much there is there to work with, and the rate of growth\nof the economy, national income tables are appropriate ; to get a picture of the structure\nand functioning of the economy, particularly with reference to budgetary and monetary\nphenomenon, sectoral accounts seem most useful. \"In principle,\" one would collect\nthe data necessary for the least aggregate form of th\u00e9 accounts possible.

There is, in fact, some evidence to the contrary for\nNigerian farmers.\n\nHe will, no doubt, object that I am missing his main point, namely, whether the\nestimation of national income aggregates should take precedence over an account for\nforeign trade, government, statutory boards and public companies as a guide to policy.\nThe answer is that when trying to piece together information on the output of food-\nStuffs, which /s the single most important sector, it is exceedingly helpful to use the\nnational income approach in order to compare the estimates of various crops with\nestimates of other outputs and to check total output of food by comparison with\nindependent estimates of aggregate food consumption.\n\nIt is \u00e0 commonplace that the aim in underdeveloped countries is to raise real\nincome. Is it not possible that nice considerations of inflationary or deflationary\ntendencies are really less vital to the welfare of these countries than is information\nwhich may enable adequate steps to be taken to improve the productivity of labour\nand the fertility of the soil? If there is not available some indicator, however crude,\nwhereby to assess such progress\u2014and it is comparisons of this kind rather than fore-\ncasts which the administrator requires to make\u2014then statistical policy is being\ngoverned too much by the considerations which are only apposite to advanced or\nindustrial economies.\n\nSimilarly, it is this undue emphasis on national income and sector accounts as a\nstatistical kind of machine tool which leads Mr. Hollinger into a misconception.\nPerhaps Indonesian experience justifies great expectations of national budgeting;\nall I can say is that Nigerian experience does not. Although it is tempting to look for\nconsumption functions, they need not provide the sole or even the principal motive\nfor calculating aggregate consumption figures. Neither do sectoral or inter-industry\naccounts really assist the policy maker to break specific '' bottlenecks \" in an under-\ndeveloped area where \"' bottlenecks \" such as inadequate port facilities or a shortage\nof skilled technicians are either localised and easily pin-pointed for improvement\nwithout statistical.advice, or so general and fundamental a feature of the economy\nthat no division of them into sectors will illumine the problems they present. Mr.\nHollinger puts a much stronger case where capital formation is concerned if, by his\n\"* sectoral accounts,\" he means to indicate the type of investment and whether financed\nprivately, by business or by government. He seems to go further than this, however,\nby suggesting that an accelerator or multiplier can be given some empirically meaningful\ncontent. This is over-optimistic in an economy where the boundary between '' pro-\nductive \" and '* welfare \"\" capital is difficult to define, as in West Africa.\n\nAggregate and sectoral.accounts are of first-rate. importance in the statistical\npolicy of an underdeveloped country because together they form the least unreliable\nmethod of providing the administrator with a sense, by no means commonly found, of\neconomic proportion, and with a logically consistent ' intelligence report\" without\nwhich exaggerated notions of relative sizes tend to linger as an obstacle in the way of\nsound judgment. If it is unwise to claim for the approach, as. Mr. Hollinger tends to\ndo, rather more than can reasonably be expected, it is no service.to underdeveloped\nareas to argue, as Mr. Seers has done repeatedly, that practically all the administrator\nneeds in the way of economic advice can be had by adopting what is too often in effect\na line of least resistance to the shortage of statistical information.\n\nCambridge.

It may be the firm\nwith the longest trading record, the greatest prestige; or the most forceful entrepreneur ;\nor it may be a firm which, although not occupying a dominant position in the '' indus-\ntry \" under consideration, yet is extremely important in other fields.\n\nThe profit margin included in full cost must not be so high as to attract new\nentrants. In Mr. Wolfe's '' industry \" freedom of entry presumably means freedom\nto produce substitutes within a range sufficiently wide to eliminate profits in excess of\nthe necessary minimum. 1f the price leader is earning abnormal profits, then new-\ncomers will appear. Potential entrants will surely look at the profits of the successful\nand efficient firms rather than at those of the unsuccessful or less efficient.\n\nThe problem of entry bristles with difficulties in this connection, and in view of\nthe uncertainties involved it is doubtful if entrepreneurs place.any great reliance on\nthe price weapon as a method of precluding entry.

This is in sharp contrast with the results that follow from the type of\nmodel in which the actual rate of growth is not directly affected by the natural rate of\ngrowth ; in such a model, for example, an autonomous increase in the rate of population\ngrowth tends to increase the amount of unemployment, and the only balancing factor\nis what may be provided by any induced decline that may follow in the rates of growth\nof population or productivity.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe argument has been conducted throughout at a relatively high level of abstrac-\ntion, and many qualifications would have to be made before it could be applied to the\nexplanation of any particular phase of historical experience. Subject to this, the main\nconclusions may be summarised as follows. The hypothesis that the proportion of\nincome saved depends on the amount of unemployment leads to the inclusion in the\nsaving function of a negative term that grows $ari $assu with population and pro-\nductivity. The presence of this term causes growth to take place in the type of system\nthat would in its absence fluctuate about a stationary level. The growth that takes\nplace will be at the natural rate, i.e. the rate at which the maximum physically possible\noutput is growing. The shape of the saving function may, therefore, be regarded\nfrom one point of view as not so much the cause of growth of income as the explana-\ntion of why the increase in saving does not prevent income from growing at the\nnatural rate of growth. The average level of activity over the cycle will be such as to\nlead to an average ratio of saving to income equal to the average ratio of investment\nto income required by the natural rate of growth. Complications arise if the saving-\nincome ratio at full employment is below that required by the natural rate of growth ;\nbut for various reasons this does not normally occur. The natural rate will probably\nin practice depend in part on the average level of activity, so that anything that\nserves to raise the average level of activity will also raise the growth rate.\n\nCambridge.

Those areas of production where such a technology is impossible of\nachievement can be owned by the state which should '' represent \" the people, not in\nsome metaphysical sense, but in the ordinary sense of common political usage.\n\nIt seems, therefore, that neither the so-called difficulties of ' reverting \" nor the\nreal \"' representative \" character of the state do, in the least, mitigate the '' exploita-\ntion \" on which the economic development in a socialist economy is based.

But our analysis suggests that if it were decided that the marketing\nboard profits should be used for long-term economic development, improvements in\nagriculture should not be starved for the sake of would-be infant industries. (b) It\nmay be admitted that, from the peasants' point of view in the short run, it does not\nappear to matter whether the profits go into the hands of the marketing boards, in\nthe form of '' disguised taxation,\" or into the hands of the private companies. It may\nbe admitted even further that sometimes the peasants may tend to suffer from the\n\"' jam yesterday, jam to-morrow \"' type of promise from their government. But even\nso, there is a great difference between the profits of the marketing boards on which\nthey have some claims and the profits of the private companies which used to be\nremitted outright in the form of large export surpluses. (c) As we have noted above!\non the basis of the available evidence, it is debatable whether the peasants get less\nunder the marketing board system than they would have got under /aissez-faire, and\nwhether, therefore, the marketing boards tend to reduce their long-term output.\nThere is also the further and more general criticism that any attempt at internal state\ncontrol in the backward countries in favour of the '' domestic \" factors of production\nwill tend to raise the cost of production of raw materials and reduce their output\nbelow /Ae optimum level. But the optimum output cannot be defined in the abstract,\ndivorced from the pattern of income distribution. As we have seen, the free play of\neconomic forces in the backward countries operated under conditions which diverged\nwidely from the ideal competitive norm and the past pattern of income distribution\nbetween the '' domestic \"\" and '' foreign \"' factors cannot be said to be determined by\npurely rational economic factors only. Thus even if state control, e.g. particularly in\nraising wages and working conditions, leads to a reduction in output, it cannot be\nsaid to be a divergence from the optimum in some unique sense. Further, those who\nfear that state control would lead to dearer raw materials appear to rule out the sub-\nstantial possibilities of increasing productivity through a better labour and agricultural\npolicy which may well result in cheaper raw materials in the long run.\n\nOxford.

Here again he says quite explicitly that ''. . . the excess\ndemand and gaps considered have all been defined for a single unit period. Such a\nunit period is, of course, quite short and indefinite.\"! Dr. Hansen offers some thought\non the problems of calculating the gap, but he has to admit that his model does not\nhelp very much in solving them. This is simply because the model presumes know-\nledge of the development during each of the unit periods. It seems that Dr. Hansen\nreally stands on the same side of the fence as Mr. Zawadzki, not because his theoretical\nmodel assumes something unrealistic, but because, in practice, it may be necessary to\nresort to some other way of calculation. In the case of the inflationary gap summation\nover time seems necessary because of lack of information and thereby the causal rela-\ntionships are concealed.\n\nTo make Dr. Hansen's inflationary gap \" proper '\" equal to the traditional infla-\ntionary gap\u2014disregarding the difference about the period\u2014we have to assume that\nthere is no factor gap, no intermediate goods gap and that the calculators know what\nmagnitudes of final goods the economic subjects are planning to purchase and sell.\nNow Mr. Zawadzki states that in the traditional analysis the neglect of the factor gap\nis perfectly justified because there is no factor gap to be closed. A '' healthy \" price-\nwage relationship must be assumed to exist normally. One would think that, at least\nin principle, attention should be given to all the markets of goods, services and factors,\nand that only the problem in hand and the functional relationships between the markets\ndecide in which markets we should be interested. Of course, Mr. Zawadzki may be\nright about the factor market, although in the final analysis only the empirical facts\ncan decide which is the right approach.? Just like Dr. Hansen, Mr. Zawadzki thinks\nin terms of static expectations. But is it really true that the calculations of the gap\nhave been and are meant to be carried out only in circumstances of static expectations ?\nIf not, then the factor gap may come to the fore again.\n\nFinally, it should be stressed that Dr. Hansen's approach is most useful in explain-\ning the process of inflation, whereas it is quite inadequate for purposes of estimating\nthe inflationary gap in a given situation\u2014or rather, it illustrates the difficulties in\ncarrying out calculations of this sort.\n\nHelsinki.

This case is similar to the last, except that the specific\nration is not fully taken up if an M.P.I.C. touches H/A between / and A.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nOn page 1 it was mentioned that this geometrical analysis can be derived from\nan ordinary three-dimensional model with the three goods measured along three\nrecti-inear axes. The two-dimensional point price lines, the money price lines, the\nguide lines and the M.P.I.C.s are then projections on to the Oxy plane of, respectively,\nthe point budget planes, the money budget plane at various levels of z, the inter-\nsections of pairs of money budget planes, and the curves formed by the intersection of\nthe various indifference surfaces with a money budget plane.\n\nThe technique may prove useful in economic fields other than that of rationing.\nFor instance, in the theory of consumer's choice without rationing it can illustrate two\naspects which cannot be dealt with in the usual two-good model. These are comple-\nmentarity and the theorem that a group of goods behaves as a single good for pro-\nportional price changes.\n\nThe theory of rationing is but a simple extension of the theory of consumer's\nchoice without rationing. It is more difficult to analyse satisfactorily by geometry, but\nthe additional complexity is due more to the need to consider a three-good model\nthan to the introduction of an extra budget constraint. In this paper, the three goods\nare treated asymmetrically as regards the indifference curves, M.P.I.C.s and the\nration group. This makes the model easier to represent in two dimensions and the\nasymmetry is a virtue rather than a necessary evil in so far as rationing never covers\nall goods in practice.\n\nLeeds. M.

Extensive involuntary\nunemployment raises the coefficient of wealth and lowers that of the wage rate, without\nnecessarily producing an appreciable effect upon the level of consumption corresponding\nto given levels of wealth and the wage rate (except through the decline in wealth due\nto the concomitant underemployment of physical assets).\n\nEspecially significant, in view of the indiscriminate lumping of property income\nwith labor income in many consumption functions, is our conclusion that wealth and\nthe interest rate affect consumption in opposite directions, even though they affect\nproperty income in the same direction. Furthermore, property income may vary\n(over moderate time periods) without producing any change in wealth or the interest\nrate or, by our hypothesis, in consumption.\n\nThe adverse effect of an interest rate rise upon consumption may be greatly\naugmented through its effect on wealth. Unless they are offset by equivalent changes\nin the expected earnings of assets, interest rate changes produce opposite changes in\ntheir market values. But induced changes in the earnings of assets depend upon the\nresponsiveness of investment to interest rate changes. Consequently, to the extent\nthat (expected) investment fails to respond to, say, monetary measures, consumption\nresponds that much more strongly. Our analysis therefore tends to reaffirm the effective-\nness of the rate of interest as a means of implementing economic policy.\n\nThe fiscal policy implications of our discussion are far from novel. lt indicates\nthe necessity of distinguishing fiscal measures that affect expectations (e.g., permanent\npayroll taxes) from those which affect consumption only through the transfer of\nwealth. In this connection, the inferior effectiveness of transfers not embodied in\npermanent programs as compared with government purchases of goods and services\nis apparent. Our analysis also serves as a reminder that transfer (tax) measures are\neffective before payment is made or even accrued, the effect upon wealth, human\nwealth, or the rate of interest beginning when adoption of the measure is first recognized\nas likely. In short, the lack of evident response to the culmination of such measures\ncan often be ascribed to leads, rather than lags, and speed in their execution (e.g., in\ntax collection) may not be very vital to their effectiveness.\n\nStanford, California.

(12)\n\nWork on these lines is now being undertaken; though the assumption that \u00ab is\nindependent of prices may be assailed on theoretical grounds and may not be justified\nfor wide price variations. The question can be decided only with empirical tests, of\nwhich the most important will be the study of Engel curves for different periods.\n\nWithout such further experimental work it seems idle to do more than sketch a\npossible theory of the factors influencing the value of saturation expenditures. These\nfactors will include most of those which are usually classed as sociological or taste\nfactors. In particular those taste factors associated with the age-sex composition of\nhouseholds are of great importance. Some preliminary analysis of data on post-war\nfood consumption suggests, as is to be expected, that the value of \u00ab differs according\nto the size and composition of the household. On the basis of a separation between those\neffects of composition which are specific to the commodity and those which affect the\nstandard of living as a whole, the obvious formulation is\n\ngi \u2014 XkgnjA(y[Eajm) ......eeeeseeeee\n\nwhere qi is the household expenditure on, or consuniption of, the /^^ commodity, y is\nthe household income, s; the number of individuals of the j'^ category in the household,\nand xij and oj coefficients corresponding to the specific and income effects respectively.\nThis formulation is particularly attractive in that it allows, in principle, for the separate\nestimation of the coefficients xij and ej, by comparing Engel curves for groups of\nfamilies of constant composition.\n\nRecently, demand analysts have been devoting more attention to those factors\nwhich influence consumption but are not included in the classical categories of\neconomics. In particular, attention has been paid to the possibility of rigidities in\nconsumer behaviour, as evidenced by the irreversibility of demand functions through\ntime [5], the influence of previous peaks in the level of consumption [9], and, recently,\nthe concept of a set of expenditures to which the consumer is committed before he can\nmake any free purchasing decisions [13]. The present paper and the ideas it contains\nare put forward as a contribution to this line of thought.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe following are the main conclusions of the paper.\n\n(/) The idea of a saturation level of expenditure on a commodity leads to\nthe concept of a sigmoid Engel curve; the form of curve adopted implies that a\ntypical commodity behaves as a luxury at low incomes and as a necessity at high\nincomes.\n\n(4) An analogy may usefully be drawn between such Engel curves and the\nsigmoid response curves used by biologists to describe the effects of measurable\nstimuli on the behaviour of living organisms.\n\n(4) A specific mathematical form for the curve, based on the cumulative form\nof the normal curve of error, is suggested in equation (1) and a simplified form in\nequation (8). Efficient procedures are available for estimating the parameters.\n\n(iv) \u00c0 very satisfactory fit was obtained when the simplified curve was used\nto analyse working-class expenditures for 1937-8.\n\n(v) The two parameters \u00ab and \u00ab of the simplified curve are referred to as the\nparameters of saturation and of cheapness; this interpretation arises from the\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:00:29 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

SUGGESTED EXTENSIONS OF THE ANALYSIS\n\nWe turn now to a more general discussion of the implication of our system of\nEngel curves. First, the system of curves described by (8) is not additive: that is,\nthe sum of expenditures predicted by the individual curves is not identically equal to\ntotal expenditure, at least if the curves are fitted with the assumption of independent\nerrors which we have used. The calculation of the differences, however, confirms the\nimpression to be gained from Fig. 3, namely that these are of a very small order, in\nmost cases below 1 per cent of total expenditure. Thus it would be very difficult if\nnot impossible to distinguish between the present system and one which included the\nadditional restraint of additivity, since the discrepancies are within the errors of the\nestimates. Secondly, in our discussion we have not so far taken account of inferior\ngoods; that is, those possessing a negative income elasticity. If the good is inferior\nover the whole range of income, it may be analysed with the use of equation (2), in\nwhich case the numerical value of f will be negative. But it must be admitted that our\nsystem of curves cannot easily be adapted to the case of a commodity which, whilst in\nthe lower ranges of income it behaves like a necessity or even a luxury, is treated by\nthe very rich as an inferior good. This phenomenon is considered by Wold [16, p. 276)\nthough the interpretation of the examples he gives is not unambiguous.\n\nModel (8) may be transformed for the investigation of market data (aggregated\nover consumers) by means of a suitable assumption about the distribution of consumers'\nincomes. Elsewhere [1] the writers have put forward arguments for using the lognormal\ndistribution in such a context, and its application here is particularly simple. For if\nincomes are distributed lognormally with parameters y and c?, the distribution function\nbeing written 4(ylu,c2), the total quantity demanded by the community is given by\n\ng- j[sA (p) 2 (Qrlese?) dy\n\n\u2014 kA(al\u2014u, Ide?) \u2014\u2014....... e \u00dc\u00d3II\n\nBefore investigating market data of this type we must make provision for the\neffect of prices, both of the commodity itself, and of possible substitutes and comple-\nments.

AN APPLICATION TO THE 1938. INQUIRY INTO WORKING-CLASS\nEXPENDITURES\n\nThere exists a maximum likelihood method of estimating the parameters x, \u00ab\nand p in (4) which is moderately easy to apply: it involves essentially an iterative\nprocedure which seems suitable for computation on modern automatic computers.\nThe method of maximum likelihood applied to equation (5) is similar except that new\ntables of working probits and weighting factors are required; these will be published\nelsewhere [2].\n\nIn order to test the validity of model (4) a preliminary graphical analysis using\nlogarithmic-probability paper was carried out on data for a number of individual\ncommodities which included pre-war expenditure and consumption figures for beef\nand veal, bacon and ham, all food, and expenditure on meals outside the home. All\nbut the last mentioned yielded Engel curves which flattened in the higher ranges of\nincome, suggesting that the saturation level was nearly attained, but the last mentioned\nshowed a highly elastic relationship over the whole range of incomes. All were closely\napproximated by model (4) and a striking feature was that for all curves the value of\nthe 8-parameter appeared to be closeto unity. This was confirmed by numerical analysis,\nfor in all cases the divergence between the estimated value of 8 and unity was less\nthan the standard error of the estimate, itself less than o.r.\n\nThe analysis was therefore extended to a classification of commodities which\nincluded those other than food. Graphical analysis again suggested that the value of 8\nwas close to unity, and the final numerical analysis? which we present below was\nbased on the following model, in which the assumption 8 \u2014 1: is made.\n\nq\u2014kA(xy) - \u20ac lee\nLater a full variance analysis confirmed that the assumption of a multiplicative error\nwould have been better founded, but the loss is but a slight one in the efficiency of the\nestimation procedure.\n\nThe data used are those of the 1937-38 budgets collected from industrial working-\nclass households by the Ministry of Labour for the purpose of revising the Cost of\nLiving Index, and we have to thank the Ministry for making them available. The\n\n1! The analyses in this paper were carried out on desk machines; the number of iterations required\nwas very small.\n\n?

The writers are at present investigating the use of such a model in the\nmarket for television sets; a model with similar features has recently been applied\nto the American market for motor cars by Farrell [6].\n\nThe case of a divisible consumers' good is, however, more closely paralleled by a less\nwidely known development in biology of the same type of analysis. Finney [7] has\ndescribed an experiment in which honey bees were allowed to take honey from a number\nof pots to which varying amounts of a repellent had been added. The saturation level\nof consumption was in this case estimated partly from a control pot containing no\nrepellent, and partly from the shape of the normal sigmoid curve which was again\nfound to describe the relation between the mean consumption of honey and the\nconcentration of the repellent. The closest economic parallel to this experiment would\nof course be provided by the replacement of the repellent concentration by a monetary\nprice, in which case the assay would take the form of a controlled economic experiment\nto determine the variation of demand with respect to price. But there is no reason\nwhy the positive stimulus of income should not be investigated in a similar way. The\ntheory is, as its counterpart in biology, rooted ultimately in the Weber-Fechner law\nof logarithmic reaction to stimuli. It may be that consumers' purchasing decisions\nare in fact based on psychological mechanisms of this type, modified by the imposed\neconomic constraint that the budget must ultimately be balanced ; this is not inconsistent\nwith the decision systems usually proposed in the pure theory of consumers' behaviour.\nThe purpose of this paper is in fact to present the results of such an investigation and\nto discuss the economic significance of the estimates obtained.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q is the average quantity consumed, x the saturation level of consumption and\n\nThe mathematical form of the sigmoid relationship used in this investigation may\nz \u2014 log\u00ab-4-plog y, y being the consumer's income; \u00ab and f are parameters to be\ndetermined along with \u00ab.

Indeed, the basic theorem on efficiency in linear models can be demonstrated\nfor his model with elementary techniques.\n\nHowever, we have found that this simplicity is bought at the expense of prohibiting\nall trade in intermediate products (with a slight exception), which is indeed a heavy\nprice.

If the price of X is low (say, it is on the level corresponding\nto the slope of the parallel price-lines AE and GK), then the income needed for reaching\nthe curve 4 \u2014 r is less in the second situation than it was in the first (0'G \u2014 OA).\nBut, if the price of X is high (say, for example it corresponds to the parallel price-lines\nBD and HJ), then the opposite is true (O'H \u2014 OB). (A converse change in the con-\nsumer's indifference map would, of course, again have an opposite economic meaning.)\n\nTo sum up, there are taste changes that are favourable, and there are taste changes\nthat are unfavourable, to any income group and in any price situation whatever. On\nthe other hand, there are taste changes that are convenient to one income group, but\nare inconvenient to another, or that are convenient in one price situation, but are\ninconvenient in another\u2014which all agrees, of course, with common-sense observation.\n\nV\n\nThe modern methods of propaganda and education offer a powerful tool for pro-\nducing substantial changes in people's tastes at relatively low costs. For this reason,\nto-day the Economic Problem of a community\u2014whether of a highly industrialised\ncommunity or of an industrially backward one\u2014does not consist merely in finding the\nbest uses for its scarce resources so as to gratify people's actual wants to the highest\npossible degree. Rather, it includes also the question of how these scarce resources\nshould be divided between productive operations for sa/isfying people's actual wants\nand measures for changing these wants. It must be decided again and again whether\na given amount of resources benefits the consumers more if it is used for gratifying their\npresent tastes in food, in housing, in music etc.\u2014or if it is used for educating these\nconsumer's tastes, for altering their irrational likes and dislikes (whether these result\nfrom primitive superstitions or from \"' civilised \" prejudices), and for habituating them\nto new consumption goods.? The purpose of this paper has been to find a tool of analysis\nfor problems of this kind.\n\nIt should, of course, be clear that the welfare criterion proposed judges consumers'\ntastes only on the basis of which tastes these consumers themselves would prefer to\nhave. The evaluation of these tastes on the basis of a given moral or aesthetic standard\nmay possibly furnish rather different results.\n\nBrisbane, Australia. JouwN C. HansANYi1.\n\n! In effect, it corresponds to an upward shift in the consumer's demand schedule for X which he enjoys\nif the price of X is low enough to make this commodity easily accessible to him, but which he dislikes if\nthe price of X is too high for that.\n\n? There is a particularly strong Prima facie case for an attempt to change people's consumption habits\nand norms if these substantially hinder the utilisation of some of the country's basic economic resources,\nsuch as would be the case, for instance, if a primitive tribe had tabooed the consumption of the most plentiful\nfood-stuff of its territory. (This conclusion, of course, would not apply if there were reasons to believe that\nthis hypothetical tribe preferred the maintenance of its old ways of lite to the economic advantages of such\n\u00e0 change, in awareness of the costs entailed.) .\n\nBut quite apart from such extreme cases, the standard of living in probably every country, including\nthe most civilised, could be considerably raised by making people more familiar with, and less averse to,\na few easily accessible refinements in consumption habits, in preparing food, in building and furnishing\nhouses, etc., devised by other nations.

Only the second\nstep brings an increase in utility inasmuch as it means the satisfaction, to a certain\nextent, of this new want.

If in addition the price of X is prohibitive, both of\nthem are equal to nil.\n\nAn adjustment for a change in the consumer's taste can be made in the price-\nequilibrating variation by a similar method. It can beshown that in the most interesting\ncase, in case (3), such an adjustment is likely to reduce the price-equilibrating variation\nin the same way as in this case it tends to reduce the price-compensating variation,\nthough this is not necessarily so, but rather depends on certain properties of the con-\nsumer's two indifference maps.!\n\nSimilar adjustments can be made in these quantities in the case when finite price\nchanges occur together with a change in a consumer's taste.\n\nIV\n\nChanges in a consumer's taste in general fall into three classes.\n\n(i) The change may alter his indifference map between a certain commodity X\n(measured along the abscissa) and money (measured along the ordinate) so that each\nindifference curve of the right-hand map lies, over the whole of its course, in relation\nto the axes, lower than (to the left from) its equivalent on the left-hand map (see Fig. 3).\nIn this case this change 1s favourable to the consumer whatever his income and whatever\nthe price of X. This is so because, irrespective of the price of X, he can reach an in-\ndifference curve representing a given utility, in the second situation with a lower\n\n1 The price-equilibrating variation in the usual sense can be defined for our case as the amount of\nmoney that would have raised a consumer with the taste T,, before the introduction of the new commodity,\nto the same level of well-being to which the introduction of this conrmodity has raised him. It is equal to\nIK since at K the consumer would be as well off as he is at U.\n\nThe price-equilibrating variation adjusted for the change in the consumers taste, on the other hand, is\ntheamount that would have raised a consumer tih the taste T,, before the introduction of the new commodity\nto the same level of well-being to which the introduction of this commodity, together with a change of his\ntaste from T, to T,, has raised him, i.e. it is the sum that would have raised him from B to C (since C repre-\nsents the same utility as U does, viz. & \u2014 3). This sum is, of course, BC.\n\nWe have assumed that BC \u00ab IK, i.e. that the adjusted price-equilibrating variation is less than the\nordinary price-equilibrating variation. This is likely to be true in case (3), but is not necessarily true. We\nknow that OB \u00ab\u20ac O'J since OB \u2014 O'I and O'I & O'J. This means that on the ordinate of the left-hand\ngraph the point corresponding to w \u2014 2 is nearer to the origin than the point corresponding to the same\nutility is on the ordinate of the right-hand graph. This makes it likely that the same applies to the points\non the two ordinates representating 4 \u2014 3, i.e. that OC \u00ab O'K, which would imply that BC \u00ab IK since\nOB - Q'I. But this argument is not conclusive.\n\nOn the other hand, in case (2) the adjusted price-equilibrating variation tends to be negative since in\nthe second situation (at U) the consumer tends to be worse off than he was in the first (at B).\n\nIn case (1) the adjusted price-equilibrating variation tends to be positive and is likely to be higher\nthan the ordinary price-equilibrating variation.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:06:07 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

This means that U is a position of higher utility than B, or at worst, of equal\nutility to B. (It will be a position of equal utility only if the equivalent of BE is IM\nitself and at the same time the price of X is probibitive for the consumer.) The con-\nsumer tends to enjoy his new taste for its own sake even if a prohibitive price of X\nprevents him from gratifying this new taste\u2014except for a limiting case. But even then\nhe is only indifferent to the change, not expressly hostile to it.\n\n(2) The curve equivalent to BE may be VW or a curve even higher than that.\n(VW is the highest indifference curve that has a point in common with the horizontal\nline drawn through 7.) In that case U is a position of lower utility than B, or at best of\nequal utility to B. (It will be a position of equal utility only if the equivalent of BE\nis VW itself and at the same time the price of X is nil) The consumer tends to dislike\nthe change in his taste even if the free availability of X permits him to gratify his new\ntaste to the saturation point\u2014except for a limiting case, when he is indifferent to this\nchange.\n\n(3) The indifference curve equivalent to BE may lie between 7M and VW. In\nthis case U is a position preferred to B if it lies above the curve equivalent to BE, is a\nposition less preferred than B if it lies below that curve, and is equally preferred to B\nif itlies exactly on that curve. Since the position of U depends on the slope of the price\nline IQ, this implies that U is a position preferred to B if the price of X remains below a\ncertain limit and a position less preferred than B if the price of X is higher than that.\nIn other words, in case (3) the consumer enjoys his new taste if the price of X permits\nhim to gratify his new taste to a sufficient extent, but dislikes it in the opposite case.\n(There is also a unique intermediate price of X, which makes the consumer indifferent\nto the change.)\n\nIn the real world case (3) seems to be the most common. A new want tends to be\nan additional source of satisfaction if it can be duly gratified, but tends to be a source\nof dissatisfaction if it cannot.\n\nWe have assumed that case (3) applies to Fig. 2. The indifference curve equivalent\nto BE is JP, which lies between 7M and VW. Moreover, the price of X is assumed to\nbe low enough to raise the point U above the critical curve /P. Consequently U is a\nposition preferred (\u00bb \u2014 3) to B (u \u2014 2).\n\nThe price-compensating variation in the usual sense can be defined for our present\npurposes as the highest amount of money that a consumer with the taste 7, could pay\nafter the introduction of the new commodity, without becoming worse off than he\nwould be 2f he had the same taste T, but if this commodity were not available to him\n(i.e. the amount he could pay without becoming worse off than he would be at the\nposition 7). This amount is ZG. Had the consumer to pay out this sum, he could still\nreach R, which represents the same utility as I does.\n\nThe price-compensating variation adjusted for the change in the consumer's taste,\non the other hand, is the amount that the consumer could pay after the introduction of\nthe new commodity, when his taste is T,, without becoming worse off than he was\nwith the taste T, before the introduction of the new commodity (i.e. without becoming\nworse off than he was at the position 5). This amount is only ZH. In effect, had the\nconsumer to pay out as much as IG, he could reach only R (wu \u2014 r1), which is a position\ninferior to B (s \u2014 2). On the other hand, if he pays only IH, he can still go to S (& \u2014 2),\nwhich involves the same utility as B did.\n\nWe might imagine that the consumer moves from B to U in two steps : first he\ngoes from B to I, which corresponds to the change in his taste, and then he goes from\nI to U, which corresponds to the appearance of the new commodity on the market.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:06:07 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Moreover, the nearer the two\ndates compared, the smaller this margin of doubt.\n\nUsually not only the person concerned can form a judgment as to whether his\nwelfare has increased or decreased from one time to another, but a careful observer\ncan also form a reliable opinion on that matter on the basis of this person's expressive\nbehaviour. Furthermore, psychology offers various projective techniques, which can\nusefully supplement simple observation in deciding the question of whether an indi-\nvidual's subjective well-being has risen or fallen.\n\n* * *\n\nThough utilities in terms of two different tastes of an individual are comparable\nonly with a certain margin of indeterminacy, we shall base our theoretical argument\non the simplifying assumption that they are exactly comparable. In this we shall only\nfollow the example of ordinary welfare economics (of constant tastes). In effect, the\ncomparison of utilities in terms of a given taste is also always subject to a certain\nmargin of doubt, yet welfare economics assumes their exact comparability.

Welfare economics, both of constant and of variable\ntastes, can confidently judge that one state of affairs is preferable to another only if\nthe difference in their theoretical welfare indices is sufficiently large, that is, is larger\nthan the estimated margin of indeterminacy. But within the course of our theoretical\nreasoning this complication may be safely disregarded.\n\nIn practice, the problem of whether a certain change in the consumers' tastes is\ndesirable or not, can be best decided by experimenting with a representative sample\nof these consumers. If this sample in general enjoy being habituated to spending their\nincome in a different way and to re-arranging their expenditure accordingly, then this\nmay be considered as being a good thing, and in the opposite case as being a bad thing.\n\nOn the other hand, if the sample are divided on that matter, their opinions may\nbe subjected to statistical analysis. A part of the variation may be explainable by\ndifferences in these consumers' relevant individual characteristics. For example, the\ndisagreement may be found to result from the fact that consumers of a certain sex,\nage, income, occupation, education etc., tend to favour the proposed change in their\ntaste, while consumers of the other sex, or of another age, income, occupation and\neducation tend to disfavour it. In such cases the proposed measure may be recom-\nmended for the former group of consumers alone.\n\nAnother part of the variation in the 'consumers' opinions may be impossible to\naccount for in this way.

Alternatively, these factors may also be included in the concept of '' objective\nsituation \".

Both of his methods, however, suffer\nfrom the fact that he assumes that a consumer's welfare is uniquely determined by his system of preferences\n(by his '' ordering \" in his terminology) and the objective situation. We have seen that this is not the case.\n\"Though a consumer's welfare may be said to be uniquely determined by his taste and his objective situation,\nthis applies only if his '' taste \"\" is defined so as to include information additional to his system of preferences.\n\nProfessor Schoeffler assumes also that, if the objective situation changes from X, to X, while the taste\nof a certain individual at the same time changes from T to T,, and if X, is preferred to X,, both in terms of\nT, and in terms of T,, then the welfare of this individual must be higher in the second position than it was\nin the first.

The\npurpose of this paper is to try to find a method of dispensing with that assumption,\nand of dealing with changes in the consumers' welfare when their tastes change, with\nor without changes in other economic and non-economic conditions.\n\nFor this purpose we must go beyond the assumptions of the usual ordinal utility\ntheory. We shall assume, not only that consumers are able to compare the utilities\nthey would derive from different groups of commodities at a given moment (on the\nbasis of given taste), but also that they are able to compare the utility (subjective\nsatisfaction) they derived from one group of commodities at the time /A,, when their\ntaste was T, with the utility (or subjective satisfaction) they now derive from another\ngroup of commodities at the time Z,, when their taste is T,. The empirical justification\nof this assumption will be examined in Section 2.\n\nIt should be noted that this assumption, though it goes beyond the usual ordinal\nutility theory, does not depend on the concept of cardinal utility since it by no means\nrequires that differences between different levels of utility should be comparable. The\nconcept of utility that we shall use is an ordinal utility concept, though an ordinal\nutility concept of a special kind.\n\nAdopting this assumption, one may still describe a given taste T, of a certain\nindividual in terms of any arbitrarily chosen ordinal utility function with the only\nrestriction, as usual, that preferred positions must be assigned a higher value of the\nutility function, and that equally preferred positions must be given the same value.\nOur assumption entails an additional restriction only in the case when this individual's\ntaste changes (say, to 7), for this new taste must now be described in terms of a utility\nfunction consistent with the one defined for the taste T,. In other words, if certain\nobjective situations have the same value for the individual on the basis of his present\ntaste T, as certain other situations had on the basis of his previous taste T4, they must\nbe assigned the same value of the utility function as the value ascribed to the latter\nsituations.\n\nFor instance, let us assume that the left-hand graph of Fig. r represents an\nindividual's indifference map belonging to the taste T4, and that the right-hand graph\nof the same Fig. shows his indifference map corresponding to the taste T',. If we\ndisregard the utility indices appearing on the graphs, it is impossible to tell whether a\ngiven point of the right-hand map represents, in terms of the taste 7;, a utility higher\nor lower than, or equal to, the utility of any particular point of the left-hand map in\nterms of the taste T,. To decide this, we need the additional information as to which\nindifference curves on the one graph and which indifference curves on the other graph\nare equivalent to each other, i.e. represent the same level of utility for the individual.\nThis piece of information may be called the correspondence rule between the two in-\ndifference maps. Our assumption of the comparability of the utilities corresponding\nto two different (subsequent) tastes of an individual implies the existence of such a.\ncorrespondence rule between his subsequent indifference maps.\n\nThis correspondence rule is expressed by the utility indices of the two graphs of\nFig. r. The indifference curves AB, CD and EF of the left-hand graph have been\narbitrarily assigned the utility values 4 \u2014 I, 4 \u2014 2 and w \u2014 3 respectively.

This is, in formal terms, identically the same phenomenon as that\nwhich we have been studying.\n\nIt is, however, conceivable that the products might fall into three groups, (X),\n(Y), (Z.) each of which was a near-perfect substitute for the others. It would then still\nbe true that the products within the groups would behave as complements ; so that\na rise in the price of one (X)-product would lead to increased production of all (X)-\nproducts, with (in consequence) diminished production of (Y)-products as a whole\nand of (Z)-products as a whole. Applying this construction to the factor-product case,\nsuppose that (X) and (Y) are two groups of products that are near-perfect substitutes\nfor one another, while the factors (as a whole) are a near-perfect transform into the\nproducts as a whole. Then, though a rise in the price of one (X)-product, other prices\nconstant, will increase the output of all (X)-products, and increase the input of all\nfactors, it may diminish the output of the (Y)-products.

In my preceding note I stated that if the technological transformation function\nis homogeneous of degree zero, then outputs and inputs cannot be analytical functions\nof the prices ; hence, Professor Hicks failed in proving his propositions : (a) if the\nprice of the product rises, all the factors will be increased ; (b) if the price of a factor\nfalls, the inputs of all the factors will be increased. Then I offered some alternative\nconditions to prove these propositions. Professor Hicks, however, modified his original\nproof by introducing the concept of '' near-homogeneity \" and succeeded in giving\nthe correct alternative proof. Thus we should conclude that if either Professor Hicks'\nor my conditions are satisfied, then propositions (4) and (b) are true.\n\nProfessor Hicks' near-homogeneity requires that a transformation function is very\nclose to a homogeneous function of degree zero, but does not necessarily demand that\nthe function is homogeneous of some degree. If, however, we assume that product (x)\nis a homogeneous function of degree (o \u2014 \u00c0 \u2014 1) of the factors (y,, . . ., ya), then, as\nwill be shown below, not only proposition (s) is true, but also all the factors will be\nincreased in the same proportions even though 7 is not nearly equal to unity.

It seems to me that the right way of best utilising the limited\nstatistical resources of the Colonies is to enumerate first of all the most important\nissues of current policy. On the basis of this information, one can then decide on the\nmost useful and illuminating income figures\u2014whether aggregates or sectors, and, if\nsectors, which sectors\u2014always, of course, bearing in mind the costs of collection of\nfigures and the margins of error which will be attached to them. The wrong way to go\nabout things is to assume that the sort of national accounts prepared in Western Europe\ncan be transferred lock, stock and barrel to these countries.\n\nAlthough Mr. Seers occasionally gives the appearance of being fascinated by\nLeontief matrices and the like fer se, I should judge that he would accept the general\napproach I suggest. Where we appear to disagree is, firstly, in the relative emphasis\non different policy issues (for example, Mr. Seers concentrates largely on income\nstability ; I raise such issues as the equity of the fiscal burden as well) ; secondly, in\nour analysis of the economic structure of underdeveloped territories (for example, the\npossibility of separating off the transport sector, the importance of '' non-Western \"\nactivity) ; thirdly (and consequently), in our assessment of the usefulness of construct-\ning accounts for the '' Western \" sectors only.

The\nquestion is one of the order of work. I do not want to name particular territories, but\nI doubt whether many people will deny that, in the flush of enthusiasm for the '' national\nincome,\" attempts to put together aggregative estimates, of very doubtful definition\nand accuracy and of very little use, have in fact been given a priority above the improve-\nment of basic statistics.! A set of \"sector\" accounts allows a coherent statistical\npolicy to be drawn up, with scarce professional resources allocated between the basic\nsector statistics according to three criteria : (2) how intrinsically important is a sector ? ;\n(b how important a contribution towards improvement of other sectors, and of\naggregative statistics, will be made by improving this sector's statistics ? ; (c) how\nmuch work is involved in improving its statistics ? (\" Importance \" in the first two\nquestions depends on the country's economic problems.)\n\nIt may be that asking these questions will lead to the same balance of statistical\nwork as is involved in proceeding directly to estimate the national income. But this\nwould be just a coincidence.\n\nNew York. DuonprEv SkERs.\n\n! To avoid an unbalanced picture, I should add that the demand for national income estimates has\ngiven a great stimulus to official statistics and led to much valuable work that would otherwise have been\nomitted.

                    "230 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nbe drawn will depend, of course, on the extent of savings institutions, whether corporate\nor not. How to treat ' voluntary \" savings is one of the most awkward problems of\npractical economics in all countries, and all I would assert is that somebody responsible\nfor an economic policy will be in a little better position if calculations of this sort are\nmade than if they are not made. Stabilisation policy in underdeveloped areas may be\nin many cases even more speculative than in developed countries (although I suggested\nsome special advantages of certain underdeveloped areas), but would Mr. Prest seriously\nargue that this procedure for indicating quantitative aspects should be abandoned\nmerely on the ground that, as he rightly says, it is unrealistic to hope to forecast the\ninflationary gap ?\n\nI do not wish to seem pedantic in continuously rejecting Mr. Prest's versions of\nmy argument, but the statement that '' variations in export prices are often to a large\nextent\" absorbed by increases in public or corporate savings, is not a '' universal\ngeneralisation \" covering all countries, nor does it state that such variations are fully\noffset. Handling the export surplus may raise considerable difficulties, but the one\nmentioned by Mr. Prest, the uncertainty about Marketing Board policy, does not seem\nrelevant, since in West Africa this is under Government influence, and one of the main\npurposes of such calculations would be to show the implications of various prices which\nthe Boards may pay farmers.\n\nLet us now take up the main issue\u2014whether to aim at '' aggregative,\" rather than\n* sector,\" accounts, The question of whether a savings-and-investment account can,\nor cannot, be used in the way I suggested is in any case not of great importance for\nthis issue. One major weakness of Mr. Prest's position is that he assumes that reliable\nestimates of local food sales can be readily obtained. In fact, he goes as far as to deny\nthat price collection is a large net additional burden on colonial statisticians, on the\ngrounds that '\" they already need to collect them for the compilation of retail price\nindices.\" Surely for price indices a statistical office will usually confine the coverage\nto a few towns, the number of items priced to a few representative foodstuffs, and the\ncollection to, at most, daily market visits. This would constitute a tiny and biased\nsample of the total of sales. It would seem rather inadequate as a basis for the uses to\nwhich Mr. Prest suggests income aggregates may be put\u2014such as assessing how much\nthe area concerned needs grants-in-aid or how fair its tax burden is.\n\nThe prices of food require a good deal of field work, and so do volumes of output\n(unless there are good crop surveys, for example, for land revenue assessment).! My\nmain point is that this work should not be allowed priority above extracting the clues\navailable in trade statistics and Government accounts (including tax statistics). These\nare fields of research which yield very highly per man-hour of research : the basic\ndata can usually be considerably improved, much information can be extracted from\nthem without a great deal of work, and these statistics are important in themselves for\nthrowing light on policy.? My original paper was not concerned, as readers of Mr.\nPrest's reply might have assumed, with whether the national income was worth\nestimating, but with the question of what the balance of statistical policy in under-\ndeveloped areas ought to be.\n\n1 Perhaps I should take this opportunity \u00f3f correcting one point in my paper : I implied that total\nfood output would be estimated by adding cash and subsistence estimates. For many underdeveloped\nterritories this is true, but in others total agricultural output can be estimated directly from crop censuses,\nand the problem is how to split it into '' cash \" and '' subsistence.\" It is probably easier in such cases to\ninclude '' subsistence \"' food in items of the sector accounts.\n\n? For example, reclassification of trade returns yields information on the value, volume and prices of\nimports of consumer goods, capital goods, etc.\u2014these are important clues on the value, volume and prices\nof consumption and investment.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:08:45 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "A Rejoinder\n\nMr. Prest's summary of my argument is hardly fair in detail or in general\nimpression. While I do hold that calculations of aggregate national income figures are\nsubject to severe limitations, for policy decisions, among other reasons, I specifically\nemphasised that they are o\u00a3 '' useless \". It also seems unreasonable of Mr. Prest to\nattribute to me sweeping generalisations such as that '' model building is a mirage,\"\nthat '' evaluation of local food sales is not of much interest,\" or that attempts \"' should \"'\nbe made to forecast food production. I would, moreover, point out : (r) High labour\nturnover in particular industries is not inconsistent with resources being specific : men\nmay, and do, move between agriculture and mining without being available for skilled\nbuilding jobs. (2) To say that lack of development involves reliance on the proceeds of\nexports, is not to define '* underdevelopment,\" still less does it imply that the United\nKingdom or New Zealand is underdeveloped.! (3) To accumulate several years' data\none need not wa?! several years : one can estimate tables for past years. (4) Discrep-\nancies between movements of aggregates make it difficult to pass from '' demand \"\nto \"supply \" analysis : this difficulty is not removed by calculating both aggregates.\n\nTwo of Mr. Prest's arguments are based on misunderstanding. My point about\n\" a large fraction of all economic transactions\" being covered by readily available\naccounts was meant to refer to the '' transactions \" one has to estimate for tables of\nnational accounts. The total of such '' transactions \"' is indeed of virtually no interest,\nbut this is irrelevant to the question whether a set of such tables can usefully be con-\nstructed, which was the question under discussion.\n\nSecondly, what one includes in an account depends largely on statistical conve-\nnience. The account for the \"transport system \" will, admittedly, be confined to\ntypes of transport for which statistics are readily available, mainly public transporta-\ntion, and I should perhaps have made that clear. Such an account may well be of\nlimited significance in some territories, but, fortunately, it will in many cases cover a\nlarge proportion of the transport of exports, and thus help to show how income from\nexports spreads through the economy\u2014which I believe to be one of the main purposes\nof national accounting in underdeveloped areas.? Incidentally, the fact that transport\nmay be undertaken by the same man who processes or distributes the commodity does\nnot necessarily make meaningless the attempt to show the '' transport \" component\nseparately. In the example given by Mr. Prest, the canoe may carry other things\nbesides dried fish, and the question of substituting a lorry for the canoe may arise one\nday. However, I agree that one can sometimes leave a large undifferentiated category\nin the national accounts without too much loss.\n\nTo turn to the issue of application of national accounting in underdeveloped\nareas, Mr. Prest once more exaggerates my position. It would certainly be incorrect\nto make an '\"' assertion that voluntary personal saving can be taken as zero.\" What I\nactually said was that '' we might not be far wrong to assume as a working hypothesis\nthat voluntary savings will be zero.\" The procedure suggested is to forecast various\nitems of a '' savings-and-investment \" table, and to show what demand for personal\nsavings will be implied by various sets of,policies for development, the budget, etc.\nIf the demand is large, this suggests certain dangers of inflation, and it is in this sense\nthat one uses a \"' working hypothesis \" of zero savings. The practical conclusions to\n\n1 This implication is a nice illustration of the fallacy of the undistributed middle.\n? However, the work of Mr. Maunder in Jamaica, shortly to be published in Social and Economic Studies,\nshows how extensive a picture of transport can be built up from fragmentary data.\n\nE 229\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:08:45 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Choice is just choice and does not\nconfer any ethical distinction on the chosen alternative. Hence no ethical contradiction\nis implied by intransitivity. That a social choice procedure chooses 4 in preference to\nB, B in preference to C, and C in preference to A 2n :/self should not excite apprehension.\n\nTo this argument there is an apparent objection. Consider, as Example (72), three\nalternatives, A, B and C, and assume that in A all individuals are at least as well off\nas in B, some better off, and that in B all individuals are at least as well off as in C,\nsome better off. Then it follows from the basic criterion of welfare (individual pre-\nference) that A is '' better than \" both B and C, and that B is \" better than \" C. 1f,\nthen, the social choice procedure were to choose 4 in preference to B, B in preference\nto C and C in preference to A, we should consider the third choice undesirable. Does\nthis not show that transitivity is a desirable property of social choice procedures ?\nNot at all. In Example (4?) it is not intransitivity that is shown to be undesirable, but\nthe fact that C is chosen in preference to A when it is known, from other sources, that A\nis \" better than \" C. Of course any acceptable social choice procedure wowld ensure the\nchoice of A over C. But this is not the same as building transitivity into the procedure ;\nrather it amounts to imposing an alternative condition on the procedure.\n\nThis argument will not be conclusive for those to whom transitivity is an end in\nitself. Intransitivity introduces into social choice an arbitrary element which may be\nuncomfortable to some people. If intransitivity is present, choice is not independent\nof the order in which the alternatives are '' fed \" into the choice procedure. Returning\nto Example (7), if the procedure is \"' intransitive \" and A4 and B are considered first,\nC will be chosen ; but if B and C are considered first then A will be chosen.\n\nBut if the argument is accepted, it removes any sting from Arrow's theorem. For,\nif transitivity is not required, there exist many social choice procedures which satisfy\nthe remaining conditions, for example, majority voting.

The consideration of '' all conceivable alternatives \"' yields no relevant informa-\ntion ; a decision based on the consideration of all conceivable alternatives would be\nno better informed than a decision based on the consideration of no conceivable\nalternatives. Some notion of the relative likelihoods of occurrence of alternatives is\nneeded. At any moment the community is faced, not with all conceivable alternatives,\nbut with a few of the attainable alternatives. Only the latter, and those likely to\nbecome attainable in the near future, are relevant to the selection of a social choice\nprocedure ; only in the light of particular choice situations can an individual appraise\na condition or set of conditions.3 Discussion of '* democracy,\" '' totalitarianism \" and\nother (partial) choice procedures remain without meaning until applied to particular\nchoice situations.\n\nThe implication of this discussion is that the conditions upon which individuals\nmight agree, and the choice procedures satisfying those conditions, should change from\nchoice situation to choice situ\u00e1tion.

It is not very long since economists believed\nthat there was a unique '' natural \"\" choice in which individual interests converged and\nwhich could be brought to light by the application of pure reason. Nowadays the\npresumption of a natural harmony of interests is discredited and '' the social problem \"'\nis viewed as that of effecting a compromise between chronically conflicting private\ninterests. Many, including the author, would go further and deny that there is any\nuseful sense in which the economist can speak of a '\"' best \" compromise. About all\nhe can do, without committing himself to w$obular value judgments, is uncover\nblatant inconsistencies among social choices\u2014as when the community fails to adopt\na course of action which would further the lot of everyone.\n\nProfessor Arrow has considered? the possibility that people may agree, unanimously\nand beforehand, on the minimum conditions which must be satisfied by a procedure?\nfor arriving at community choices. He states several conditions and concludes that\nthere does not exist a procedure which satisfies all of them. If the conditions were\nindeed '' worthy \"' of general acceptance, the conclusion would be useful but, in view of\nthe remarks of the first paragraph, hardly surprising. If, on the other hand, the con-\nditions can be shown to be unworthy of general acceptance, the significance of the\nconclusion vanishes.\n\nMany economists have found the conclusion both surprising and significant. This\nis evidenced by the tendency in the literature to focus attention on the mathematical\ndetails of Arrow's proof\u2014on the effects of relaxing certain conditions, of placing restric-\ntions on the set of alternatives, in general on the mathematical possibilities of cir-\ncumventing the conclusion.* We shall argue that Arrow's conditions are unreasonable\nand that the conclusion is uninteresting. In their uncritical adoption of Arrow's condi-\ntions, many economists, have revealed more than a trace of natural law romanticism.\n\nThe General Possibility Theorem may be summarised as follows :\nThere does not exist a social choice procedure which\n\n(7) provides a transitive ordering of the set of all conceivable social alternatives\n(assumed greater in number than two), and\n\n(Z4) provides a transitive ranking of any subset of the alternatives, which is\nindependent of excluded conceivable alternatives, and\n\n(24) is derived from individual orderings (assumed greater in number than\none) of the set of all conceivable social alternatives, where the method of derivation\nand the individual orderings satisfy certain conditions. The derivation must\n\n1T am indebted to Mr. Martin Bailey for several helpful comments on an earlier draft.\n\n? Kenneth J. Arrow, Social Choice and Individual Values (New York, 1951).\n\n* We shall employ the non-technical term '' procedure \"' in place of Arrow's '' social welfare function.\"\nThe latter is defined by Arrow as follows : '' By a social welfare function will be meant a $vocess or vule\nwhich, fov each set of individual ovderings Ra, . . ., Rp for alternative social states (one ordering fov each individual,\nstates a corresponding social ovdering of alternative social states, R.\" (Arrow, ibid., p. 23).

It has been suggested elsewhere (Kemp and Asimakopulos, '* A Note on ' Social Welfare\nFunctions ' and Cardinal Utility,\" The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science, Vol. XVIII,\nPP- 195-200) that the technical term '' constitution \" be adopted in place of '' social welfare function.\"\n\n1 An exception is the article of I.

Where technical progress is neutral and accumulation\ngoes on at just such a rate as to keep the ratio of capital to output constant, the share\nof capital and labour in output and the rate of profit on capital remain constant and\nthe model is free from '' internal contradictions.\"1\n\nIn other cases the complications arising from changes in the distribution of income\nbetween classes and. changing expectations of profits are too great to be digested by\nthe assumptions of equilibrium, and it is idle to pursue the argument any further\nwithout taking account of the problem of effective demand.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe tenor of our argument has been mainly negative and the level of abstraction\nmaintained in the analysis is very high. Nevertheless, we can draw some general\nconclusions from it. The conclusions sound obvious enough, but perhaps that is all\nto the good, as it shows that the propositions drawn from the abstract argument are\nnot in conflict with common sense.\n\nThe rate of profit on capital will tend to be higher, and real wages lower :\n\n(i) the more plentiful are the technical opportunities for mechanising pro-\nduction ;\n\n(2) the slower is the rate of capital accumulation in relation to the growth of\npopulation ;\n\n(3) the weaker is the force of competition (and the weaker is the bargaining\npower of the workers, when competition is weak).\n\nGiven the degree of competition and the rate of growth of population, the course of\nthe rate of profit over the long run (abstracting from short-period fluctuations) depends\non the interaction between technical progress and the rate of accumulation. Technical\ndiscoveries (unless extremely unfavourable to capital) are continuously tending to\nraise the rate of profit and accumulation is tending to depress it. Prosperous capitalist\neconomies are those where the rate of profit is falling in spite of rapid technical progress,\nand miserable ones those where the rate of profit is high in spite of technical stagnation.\n\nCambridge.

Theslope of thestraight line, \u00bb, B,\nis the ratio of an increment of output to the increment of real capital with which it is\nassociated, and at a constant wage rate an increment of output isan increment of profit ;\nthus this slope is the ratio of the increment of profit to an increment of real capital.\nTherefore, by producing f y; to cut the y axis in wyg we find the wage rate, OW s, at\nwhich Gamma and Beta techniques are indifferent. When output is OC, W.gC is\nprofit per man employed, and when output is OB, W,gB is profit per man. Similarly,\nOW ga (when af, cuts the y axis in Wg;) is the wage rate at which Beta and Alpha\ntechniques are equally profitable.\n\n!

And I must concede that when we\nstudy this, the paradox in large measure disappears. For Dr. Roosa turns out not to be\nconcerned, as Prof. Williams was in the passage referred to, with the holders of idle\nmoney, but rather with the institutional holders of Government securities. These, he\nsays, are nowadays so numerous and so sensitive that if the Central Bank can produce\neven a small change upwards or downwards in the price of such securities, they will in\nthe first case sell when they would otherwise have held, in the second case hold when\nthey would otherwise have sold ; in the one case offering the proceeds of sale in the\nprivate capital markets, in the other withholding from these markets offers of funds\nwhich they would otherwise have made. Thus, so the argument runs, a change in\nofficial rates is more easily and smoothly transmitted than used to be the case from the\nshort market to the long, and from the market for governments to the markets for\nprivate bonds, mortgages and equities. This all seems highly persuasive, provided we\ncan dismiss as a bogey the Keynesian alternative of money leaking away to, or welling\nup from, the earth on such a scale as to break the chain of causation. and thwart the\npurposes of the Monetary Authority. And personally I do not see why, in most normal\ncircumstances, we should not do so\u2014I do not think Dr. Roosa is claiming the ability\nto control earthquakes.\n\nThere still remain, however, to my mind, certain difficulties in the argument. At\nseveral points in its course it is hinted that the efficiency of the whole process depends\non the formation by lenders of an expectation that a small change in rates will be\nfollowed by further changes in the same direction\u2014Mr. A, who was thinking of lending\nin the private markets, will hold off those markets if he thinks he will be able to get\na better return on his money a little later on. Here I have two difficulties. First, I can\nsee the force of this argument if Mr. A is a holder of idle money ; but if, as Dr. Roosa\nis assuming, he is a holder of Government securities, does not the argument cut both\nways? For if Mr. A is expecting a further rise in private loan rates, he will also be\nexpecting a further fall in the price of his Government securities, and might as well\nperform his ex hyfothesi projected switch straightaway. Secondly, it is usual to\nassume that a rise in rates operates on borrowers partly by generating the offosite\nexpectation, namely that rates will be lower again in the future than they are now ;\nand Dr. Roosa in his text does not seem to dissent.! Yet it seems somewhat paradoxical\nto suppose that lenders and borrowers should consistently draw opposite inferences\nfrom the fact of an accomplished rise in rate. In a private letter which he has been\nkind enough to write me, Dr. Roosa seems rather to take the view that borrowers will\nshare the '' elastic \"' expectations of lenders, but will not, in the most important cases,\nbe in a position to act upon them by rushing in to borrow now ; i.e. borrowers will be\nmore affected by the ac\u00edual rise in the rate of interest, and lenders by its expected\nfurther rise. If this can be accepted, what I will still venture to call the Roosa paradox,\nnamely that a small rise in rates will both diminish the stream of loanable funds deman-\nded and the stream of loanable funds offered, can remain intact. At the back of my\nmind, however, I still cannot help wondering whether budgetary considerations are\nnot still leading the monetary authorities in both Britain and the United States to\ntake a more optimistic view of the restrictive effects of small changes in official rates\nthan in the long run will be found to be justified.\n\nCambridge.

            "found": "A COMPARISON OF WELFARE CRITERIA 161\n\nin the situations being examined.! This approach, however, wishes to evaluate different\ngeneral policies or situations independently of judgments on the distribution of welfare\nIt does this by making statements which do not conflict with a wide range of such\nfinal judgments. If the utility-possibility curve of one situation lies entirely outside\nanother so that everyone could be made better off for any initial distribution of welfare,\nthis analysis concludes that the first siiuation is potentially superior to the other.\nIf economists desire to have as little to do as possible with distribution judgments,\nthey should, it would seem, restrict themselves to this type of analysis. Of course, if the\npotentially superior general policy change is carried out, the selection of the particular\nwelfare position to which the move should be made requires a distribution judgment.\n\nThe economist might enlarge somewhat the scope of his study from this approach\nby considering only a range of possible welfare distributions. Many welfare positions\nmay be generally unacceptable for political reasons at the time a change is considered.\nThe relation of the situation utility-possibility curves in this range would be irrelevant.\nSince a distribution judgment is finally required to make a particular change in welfare,\none might go still further and decide that the relation of the curves within the politically\nfeasible range is relevant only to the extent that no welfare position should be judged\nto be the best under the circumstances, if it is possible to improve everyone's welfare\nover that position. But the choice of a welfare position satisfying these conditions\nmust be left to the investigator. Of course, this amounts to the Bergson approach\nexcept that social welfare functions, whose maximum welfare positions are within\nthe politically unacceptable range, are excluded. This would appear to be a more\nrealistic approach than that suggested by Little.\n\nIV\n\nIn current discussions of economics, one seldom hears a kind word for welfare\neconomics. The disillusionment caused by the destruction of the original claims that\nwelfare economics could be based on objective economic criteria, independently of\njudgments about interpersonal distributions of income, has led to general cynicism\ntowards the subject. Successive qualifications and retrenchments made in the field\nseem to have left only an idle plaything\u2014useful perhaps for learning certain general\nequilibrium relationships but little else. Basically, many of the objections reflect the\nsterility of static general equilibrium analysis, which has dominated economics for\nyears, as a concept for analysing the real economic world. Economists have much to\nsay which is useful concerning the allocation of resources, but in the real world the\nproblem is much more complex than the traditional approach can lead one to believe.\nThese differences between the model and reality and the importance of the non-\neconomic factors point up the insignificance of the contribution from the ''new\nwelfare \" economics for reaching policy decisions. Until the dynamic aspects of con-\nsumer behaviour and production theory can be handled better by economists, modern\nwelfare economics cannot be expected to make much of an analytical contribution\nto policy-making. Furthermore, welfare economics can never be more than ''a\nsystematic way of introducing from outside of economics various ethical norms.''?\nBut this in itself is a worthwhile objective. For almost every economist recommends\npolicy, and, unless the value judgments underlying the recommendations are presented\nin an orderly manner, we will continue to have those frustrating arguments which\nappear to be about economic analysis but often turn out to be a matter of ethics.\n\nCambridge, Mass.

Here Mr. Rees overlooks the fact that the greater the fall in prices\nin A, the more will the value of investment in A decline. Now Mr. Rees has not specified\nany assumption concerning real investment. But even if he has assumed that real\ninvestment remains constant (a reasonable starting assumption), it is completely\ninconsistent to allow the general level of home prices to fall and yet not allow for the\neffect of the fall in the money value of investment. If this inconsistency is removed\none finds that \"* there is in every period a fresh injection of an investment multiplier.''!\nIn fact, Mr. Rees' analytical inconsistency may extend further than this for he may\nnot.even be assuming that real investment remains constant after the initial auto-\nnomous change in expenditure, as can be seen from the quotation from his article\nmade in the second paragraph of the. present article.?\n\nParis. W. BECKERMAN.\n\nJournal, December, 1951, especially pages 816\u201417. This difficulty was not removed by the method adopted\nby the present writer of defining price-flexibility without reference to real income. For the definition of\nreal income as implicit in the formulation of the consumption function provided by the present writer\n(op. cit.) did not allow for the effect of changes in the relative price of imports on real income. In short, in\nthe formulation of foreign trade multipliers without the usual limitation of fixed prices, the problem of the\ndemand for imports is not solved merely by introducing the relative prices of imports and home goods\ninto the demand equations, for the concept of real income to which the marginal propensity to import\nmust be related also needs modification. But the effect on real income of changes in the relative price of\nimports depends on the relative weights given to import prices and home prices. These relative weights,\nunfortunately, cannot be assumed constant in a multiplier analysis dealing with finite changes (as distinct\nfrom the analysis of the type presented by A. C. Herberger, and Laursen and Metzler ; see H. G. Johnson,\nop. cit., p. 817n, for references), for the object of such an analysis is, in part, the examination of how they\nwill change. In other words, when the analysis is concerned with finite changes the demand equations need\nto be completely specified.\n\n1 See W. Beckerman, op. cit, page 411. In the published formulation by the present writer of the\nconditions determining the changes in the trade balance where prices are allowed to vary, the resulting\nformule for the foreign trade multiplier were not included. For the use of Mr. Rees or any other economists\nwho may be interested, these formule are as follows :\n\nThe final change in income (A) of countries 1 and 2 are (in the converging cases) :\n\n\u2014-YX\n(1 \u20147) a1 \u20147\") \u2014 9*9\"\nX\n\"\u00e0a-\"va-r)-ww\n\nWhere X \u2014 an initial change in income in country 2, and the other symbols have the meanings attached\nto them in the article referred to above. The actual change in the trade balance is thus equal to the change\nin the inne of each country times its total propensity for the balance of trade to change as income\nchanges (wu\n\n? The problem of allowing for a fall in the value of investment in models in which price changes have\nmuch wider implication of course than those mentioned above. Much work has already been done on\nmultipliers in which rea? investment is allowed to vary, particularly in trade cycle theory and also in foreign\ntrade multiplier theory (see W. Beckerman, op. cit., page 411 n., for references). But in most models in\nwhich prices have been allowed to vary the purely price effect on the money value of investment (i.e.\nignoring induced effects on '' real\" investment) has still not been fully allowed for. It would certainly\nappear that in so fat as trade cycle theory still relies heavily on the concept of the multiplier it must some\nday: include a serious attempt to incorporate price changes into the specific concept of the multiplier, and\nuntil this is done it is not possible to make much progress with the special probl\u00e9m of the foreign trade\nmultiplier.\n\nkb\u00e0-\n\nand \u00c0'\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:16:06 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Scrutiny of our system shows that if (1) to (5)\nholds, and if all but one of the commodities in (5) show a balance between total world\nproduction and consumption, then the remaining commodity cannot fail to be in\nbalance. The interested reader may verify this in the general case or in the case of a\nfew goods, factors and countries. With one of our equations dependent and redundant,\nour worries over the over-determinacy of the system are at an end.\n\n27. Of course the quality as well as the quantity of our equations must be taken\ninto account. It is for this reason that the inequality signs were included in (2) and (3).\nWhen comparative advantage or technology decree that the amount of some input\nis to be zero in some industry, we lose a marginal productivity equality, replacing it\nby thestatement that the wage must not beless than the value of marginal productivity.\nSimilarly, if supply and demand should cause a factor to become a free-good with\nzero :, we would no longer in (3) require more than that its sum in all uses should not\nexceed the total available. Within the production sphere we could perhaps rule out all\nindeterminacy if the production functions all had nice regular curvature properties,\nwith every marginal productivity running the gamut from infinity to zero.\n\nSo long as we are no longer striving to prove the geographical equalisation of\nfactor prices, it is no longer necessary to require that there be as many goods as factors,\nor that the goods differ in their factor intensities ; but if we do assume inelastic\nsupplies of the factors and fixed coefficients of production, singular cases can arise in\nthe production sphere where inelastic supplies may overlap with inelastic demands\nwith a resulting indeterminacy of pricing. But contrary to what some of the older\nwriters thought, the inequalities in our equations make it quite impossible that\nnegative prices or negative production should ever result.\n\n28. Our equations are not complete if we do not go beyond the production sphere.\n'The demand-supply relations of (4) were shown by Walras and Marshall to be quite\ncapable of intersection more than once, so that multiple equilibria are possible both\nin the domestic and international sphere. In terms of a rudimentary theory of dynamics,\nor the laws of motion that govern the way a system out of equilibrium behaves, we\ncould distinguish between locally-stable and locally-unstable equilibrium points.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n37. 1 need scarcely add the caution that the above description is of a very\nidealised, statical, competitive situation, where monetary considerations scarcely\nraise their ugly heads. Yet, both from the standpoint of insight into the nature of\npricing and into the normative aspects of laissez-faire not here discussed, I think that\nthis particular set of idealised assumptions has much to be said for it\u2014not only for\nquasi-aesthetic reasons, but also for the light it casts on so many of the often-confused\nissues of economic theory.\n\nCambridge, Mass.

Mr. Henderson\nsuggested that one way to compare direct and indirect taxes was to discover that\nsystem of indirect taxes which yielded, at each level of income, the same amount of\nrevenue as a progressive income tax.* He then showed that, Zf money income is held\nconsiant (if leisure is held constant) the direct tax proves ' superior\" in the con-\nventional sense of this term. But if leisure is 40? held constant, we know that the\nindirect tax can be the \" superior \" tax. The comparison of direct and indirect taxes\nwith the same '' tax formula \"' then becomes difficult. For, one reason why a change\nfrom direct to indirect taxation can increase a man's real income, is that it reduces\nthe proportion of his income paid in tax. In other words, it reduces the progressiveness\nof the tax system. Mr. Henderson is, therefore, right, in a sense, when he claims that\n* jt is not the change of method which is causing the change in output but the chang\u00e9\nin the tax formula from the point of view of the tax payer.\"? Once one moves away\nfrom a two-dimensional world, however, it is no longer true that there will be a direct\ntax system which has the same formula from the point of view of the Exchequer\nand is always '' less onerous to the payer.\"'?\n\nMr. Henderson is perfectly correct in claiming that a direct tax system can always\nraise a g?ven amount of revenue from a given money income more painlessly than an\nindirect tax. But once the amount of leisure is allowed to vary, money income will\nvary too. The best way in which the problem can then be approached is by discovering\nwhich tax system raises a given revenue most efficaceously from a given '' potential\nincome \"' or a given '' income earning capacity.\" It will then be found that a direct\ntax system will nearly always impose an '' excess burden \" as compared with some\nsystem of indirect taxes.\n\nLet us now sum up the argument and consider some implications of our results.\nWe have seen that some form of indirect taxation will be superior to direct taxation\nif individuals are able to decide how much they work. The discovery of the goods on\nwhich indirect taxes are required remains unsolved until we have more adequate\nstatistical information about demand equations. Only in particular cases\u2014such as the\npractically unimportant one of com$letely inelastic demand\u2014can one make dogmatic\nstatements about the '' optimum \" system of indirect taxation.\n\nIt should, however, be made quite clear that nothing in our analysis conflicts\nwith the acknowledged superiority of the poll tax over all other forms of tax. Nor, of\ncourse, does anything in this article deny that a change from direct to indirect taxation\nmight well reduce the progressiveness of the tax system, without enabling anyone to\nprove that it was less progressive. Such a proof is obviously impossible because no\none knows the shape of all indifference maps.\n\nLondon. W. J. ConrErT.\nD. C. HAGUE.\n\n! Op. cit., pp. 541-3.\n?

Once this is achieved all disequilibrating elements disappear\u2014the\nsystem is in equilibrium.!\n\nThe difference between this approach and Dr. Hansen's should be clearly noted.\nIt is more than a mere reversal of the order of the disinflationary measures suggested\nby the latter. The first phase of the policy is not a measure to extinguish inflationary\nexcess demand\u2014it is a move to re-establish the equilibrium relationship between\nprices and wages. Only the second phase is genuinely disinflationary.\n\nThe foregoing discussion should not be construed as denying the possibility of the\nexistence of a labour shortage. This term is generally understood to mean that there\nis not enough labour to produce an output which would fully satisfy the total demand.\nThe entrepreneurs may desire to employ additional workers even if that implies\nincreasing their wages because they expect that at least a part of the currently un-\nsatisfied demand will remain active at a higher price. The labour shortage in this\nsense is caused by the existence of the excess demand for commodities, and so it is\nbound to disappear as soon as the entrepreneurs realise that the excess demand for\ncommodities has itself disappeared. On the other hand, Dr. Hansen's approach implies\nthat the capitalists, in order to secure additional labour, may agree to pay higher\nwages even if they are not allowed to raise prices. (The rise in prices mentioned by\nDr. Hansen is not caused by the marking-up designed to offset the wage concessions\nbut by the re-opening of the commodity gap due to the increase in demand resulting\nfrom the rise in wages.)\n\nIt appears to the present writer that it is legitimate to assume that if wages are\ncontrolled they are normally so fixed as to correspond, at least approximately, to the\nmarginal productivity of labour, and that wage increases necessary to establish and\nmaintain a healthy price-wage relationship may be allowed for in advance.? In these\ncircumstances the neglect of the factor gap is perfectly justified\u2014the persistence\nof labour shortage after the deflation of the demand for commodities is only possible\nas a result of miscalculations and other frictional causes which the ordinary operation\nof market forces may gradually eliminate.\n\nThe foregoing discussion of Dr. Hansen's models suggests that his denial of the\nsignificance of the excess of ex-ante Investment over ex-ante Saving for the analysis\nof inflation is valid only within the framework of his particular approach to this prob-\nlem.? But as this essay has sought to show, the traditional approach remains superior\nbecause the concepts it uses have, under the conditions of suppressed inflation, real\ncontents of great significance while the majority of Dr. Hansen's concepts are, under\nthese conditions, purely formal. The usefulness of the concept and analysis of the\nInflationary Gap lies in that it expresses the magnitude of the restriction of demand\nwhich must be. enforced if the inflationary forces are not to generate the spiral of price\nand cost increases. It follows that the problem cannot be analysed in terms of aggre-\ngated private (erroneous) expectations, but must be dealt with in terms of global\nmagnitudes. Thus, the traditional approach provides a better explanation of the\nnature of the phenomenon and a sounder theoretical basis for policy.\n\nLondon. K. K. F. ZAWADZEI.\n\n!'This equilibrium may, admittedly, be only temporary. Once controls are removed the bargaining\npower of labour obtaining under conditions of full employment may tempt them to press for higher wages,\nthe capitalists retaliating by means of a price rise rather than by a reduction in output and employment.\nThe desire of the workers to raise wages above the level dictated by marginal productivity may, however,\nbe treated as a new and extraneous inflationary shock.\n\n?

In these terms questions beginning\n** What would happen if '\" would have exact answers.\n\nBut what is really remarkable is that Harrod's discovery of an equilibrium growth\nof output required no formal consideration of prices, and the development of a price-\ninterest equilibrium in Sections II and III above could have proceeded without refer-\nence to the equilibrium output path. Equations (2) and (5) are quite independent of\neach other. The equilibrium conditions for price and output are uncoupled. Economic\nintuition says that this is all wrong. The equilibrium of output ought not to be main-\ntainable when prices are out of line, and vice versa. From another angle, the equations\ndo not reflect the fact that one could affect output by operating on prices.! This\nwould appear naturally in an attempt to build up a causal dynamics.\n\nA mechanical first step in this direction could be made by letting the choice\nbetween consumption and investment depend on the interest rate and price level in\nsome arbitrary but simple way. I do not carry this out here, although the formal\nexecution would be fairly easy, because I am not convinced that this obvious line of\napproach is necessarily the best one. Another possibility would be to think of investors\nas Ramsey-type utility maximisers over time. A certain amount of depth could be\nadded by assuming the existence of two goods differentiated with respect to their\nutility in consumption and in investment.

But can they be used in some way as a measure of the\nprogress of development ? Apart from the difficulties of interpreting movements in\nthe national product discussed above, such movements are only indirectly linked to\ndevelopment\u2014they may be due to other causes than the development programme and\n(more important) the effect of development is far more extensive than can be indicated\nby short-run changes in the national income. Thus, building \u00e0 factory permits an\nincrease in national income when the factory is ready for production, but it also provides\nexperience for the building industry during construction, and leads to new industrial\nand technical jobs, raising the technical level of the local population, and at a further\nremove it reduces the dependence on imported supplies and (possibly) the sensitivity\nto cyclical fluctuations. But it may make the shortage of housing and other social\namenities more acute, particularly if the factory attracts to a town more workers than\nit can employ, and urbanisation helps to destroy the existing social structure, with\nall that this implies. In brief, many of the main effects of development are on variables\nwhich are conventionally excluded from the national product, but, nevertheless, are\nof great, perhaps overwhelming, importance.\n\nIt is, in fact, probably safer not to claim that development problems can be\ndecided statistically, let alone on *' national product \" criteria. The consequences of\nvarious decisions for the labour market, for foreign exchange earnings and expenditure,\nfor the level of incomes, possibly even for prices, can be assessed. But in the end, after\nall the facts have been collected, someone has to sit back and look at the complete\npicture, including many economic but immeasurable considerations, and many non-\neconomic considerations, before deciding on the scale and type of development.\n\nTo say that statistics cannot imply the answer themselves to such complex and\ncontroversial problems is not to say that they are useless for such problems, still less\nthan they are useless for all problems. I have tried to indicate how the problems of\ninflation and of food supply might be cast in quantitative terms. If there is no such\nfactual guidance, administrative decisions will be taken in blindness and ignorance,\nsolely on intuition. But the most useful policy, granted the shortage of qualified people,\nis to concentrate on improving specific rather than aggregative data : much help\ncannot be given to the administration, or much goodwill gained for a statistical depart-\nment, unless statistical policy is designed for the problems of the territory and the\nstatistical resources available.\n\nOxford.

A structure of production which permits excess flows of\nintermediate products from one activity to be used in another, rather than be wasted,\nis obviously more efficient than one which does not.\n\nThe existence of a barrier to transfer is not alone sufficient to create differences\nin the efficiency of alternative structures of activities. There must also be present\nsufficient '' complexity \" in the technology. More formally, the conditions created by\nbarriers to transfer may, as far as this example is concerned, be treated as follows.\nIgnoring disposal activities and distinctions between sectors, the technology matrix A\nis of order NxK, where N is the dimension of the commodity space, and K the dimension\nof the activity space.

(The number r is obviously unaffected by the restriction x 2 o.) Thus, if\nthe number of linearly independent rows of A, is increased relative to K, the rank, pr,\nwill be in general increased relative to K and the number of linearly independent\nvectors x satisfying (5.0) will be decreased. If p; is too large relative to K, disposal\nactivities must be joined to A4, to permit positive levels of activity to be found without\nviolating (5.0).\n\nThe distinction between sectors, and the introduction of a barrier, in the example\njust analysed have the effect of making p; large relative to K ; conversely, the intro-\nduction of transfer activities for the intermediate products decrease p; relative to K,\nconsequently enlarging the set of attainable points.\n\nIt should be noted that the enlargement of the achievable point set is accomplished\nby introducing new facets in the boundary.

The complications are due partly to special peculiarities\nof the particular type of firm under study, and partly to the large number of variables\nintroduced. As a result the model bears some resemblance to firms of this kind in the\nreal world, and has been found by the writer to be a useful tool in studying newspaper\neconomics. The lesson might be that provided we are prepared to introduce sufficient\nvariables and assume reasonably realistic relationships between them, the models of\npartial equilibrium can be as useful as those of macro-economics.\n\nThe features of our model which have complicated the analysis may be summarised\nas follows :\n\nI. Our firm produces (at first) two products, the quantities supplied of one of\nthese determining the quality of the other. At the end a third product is introduced.\n\n2. On the non-advertising side, quality rather than price has been assumed to be\nvariable. This assumption is justified purely because newspaper managements are in\npractice constantly varying the quality of their products, while regarding prices as far\nless variable. The assumption of constant quality and variable price would have\nproduced a far more simple and orthodox picture.\n\n3. On the advertising side we have assumed price and quality, as well as quantity,\nvariable.\n\nMelbourne, Australia. W. M.

Can we accept an\nargument which makes the facts a doctor must consider irrelevant to the patient's\nchoice ?\n\nSecondly, there is a more abstract argument. In all such cases we may take two\npoints of view : ex ante and ex post. Looking ahead, we do seem to be in a quandary.\nIf, however, the occurrence permits us to look backward\u2014if, for instance, death does\nnot intervene\u2014we may note that only that sub-class of these events which ended in\nfailure were really crucial. For all the others we are able to go on and perform the\nexperiment again. Hence we may generalise that decisions of this class will turn out\nto be crucial contingent upon negative outcomes. Whenever we look upon an event as\ncrucial we should keep in mind that if a desirable outcome presents itself we will face\nother events of the same sort. If we lose, this is cold consolation, but we will not always\nlose. Here, for once, it is wise to accept an argument analogous to Descarte's argument\nfor belief in God. We should base our decisions on probable knowledge, for if that\nfails to save us we have lost nothing which could be reliably saved by any other method ;\nbut if it succeeds we will have acted wisely. In the long run of such action\u2014if there\nis a long run\u2014we will have maximised our chances of success, and indeed we will\nmaximise our prospects for a long run itself.\n\nFinally, to. test one lingering doubt on the matter of the relevance of probability\nto crucial choices (even in the death case), imagine how one's responses might be\naffected if one supposed the values for the probability were heavily on the side of\nfailure (or death) for some particular choice. How long could one remain indifferent\nto such probable knowledge ?\n\nIf we accept the preceding analysis we will apply probable knowledge to single\nevents. We may assign the probability of the class of events to a single event by\n\"' positing \" that event with a weight equal to the class probability. Then, if we act on\nthe basis of the posit, we will maximise our chance of success in the long run of all\nsuch decisions.!\n\n(4) The material discussed in this paper is not broad enough in scope for a theory\nof choice since it lacks, for example, any consideration of the varying extent to which\nsome measure of utility attaches to one alternative or another. But such matters are\nnot part of the task of replying to the attack against probability, and they may,\ntherefore, be omitted here.\n\nIn the preceding discussion we have been led to the conclusion that knowledge\nbased on probability calculations may be applied legitimately to apparently singular\nevents. For the problem of inadequate evidence the argument clarified the subtle\nmeans that we have to make efficient use of a larger amount of evidence. For the\nproblem which arises when our interest centres upon a single event the argument\nshowed that interest is rarely so narrow, and when it is properly conceived in terms of\nrelevant classes the application of probability to such a case is justified.\n\nNew York.

For example, the monopolist would gain little by offering to\nsell. electric refrigerators at a quantity discount.

To the consumer it will always be inferior to P,\u2014\nwhich, however, is an irrelevant comparison because, \u00e0s already noted, the consumer\npays a different total tax at the two points ; but as compared to P, we can distinguish\nthree possibilities. (a) If the previous rate of the excise tax on Y is equal to the rate\nof the new excise tax on X (as it is in Fig. 4), the new equilibrium point P, for the\nconsumer, under the combination of excise tax on Y with income tax, must lie at the\npoint of intersection of the new budget line D'E' with the budget line AC, passing\nthrough P, AC, which represents the consumer's opportunities when the two excise\ntax rates are equal and levied at the same time, will be parallel to the no-tax budget\nline WB. At every point on this line the consumer would pay the same total tax,\nequivalent to AW. Therefore, the consumer will pay the same total tax under either tax\nstructure only at the point where the two budget lines, AC and D'E', intersect. Given\nthe convexity of indifference curves, P, must be on a lower indifference curve than P4,\nas it is in Fig. 4. The consumer would prefer the addition of the excise tax on X to\nthe addition of the equivalent income tax.\n\n(b) If the previous rate of the excise tax on Y is greater than the rate of the new\nexcise tax on X the consumer will still prefer the addition of the excise tax on X to\nthe addition of the equivalent income tax, that is, an income tax yielding in con-\njunction with the changed revenue from the old excise tax on Y the same total revenue\nas the two excises together. The consumer's new equilibrium point, with the income\ntax and the excise tax on Y in force, will lie below P, (his equilibrium point with the\ntwo excise taxes in force) and to the left of the budget line AC. This equilibrium\npoint will always be inferior to P,.\n\n(c) If the rate of the old excise tax on Y is smaller than the rate of the new excise\ntax on X, the consumer will reach a new equilibrium position which may be inferior,\nequal or superior to P,. There is a certain ratio between the rate of the old excise\ntax on Y and the rate of the new excise tax on X for which P, lies on the same indif-\nference curve as P,.! At this ratio, therefore, the consumer will be indifferent as to\nwhether he has to pay the excise tax on X or the equivalent income tax. For a ratio\nsmaller than this, the consumer will prefer to pay the equivalent income tax, rather\nthan the excise tax on X. The consumer always prefers the tax combination which\ncauses the least divergence from the equilibrium price ratio of X for Y that would\nexist without taxes. When excise taxes on both X and Y are imposed, the two distor-\ntions of the price ratio that will result from the two excise taxes will cancel out when\nthe rates are equal, and only partially cancel out when the rates are unequal.\n\nWe now see that the usual '' proof \" of the superiority of the income tax, the\ncontention that the excise tax places an excess burden on the consumer, is valid for\nall situations except Case (4). It is never valid if the consumer has initially been\npaying an excise tax on Y at a rate equal to or greater than the rate of the new excise\ntax on X, and it may or may not be valid if the rate of the old excise tax on Y is\nsmaller than the rate of the new excise tax on X. To sum up the entire analysis, the\nconsumer always prefers the tax combination which causes the least divergence from\nthe equilibrium price ratio of X for Y that would exist without taxes.\n\nBaltimore.

Nevertheless, it might be instructive to go\nback to Fig. 1 to see how the '' objective \" risk function fits into the '' subjective \"\npreference scheme.!\n\nLet us first start with Kalecki's assumptions of constant returns to scale, and\nconstant risk to scale. As we have seen, as loan capital is added to the entrepreneur's\nown capital, initially only the entrepreneur's risk increases, and only after a certain\nminimum loan-to-asset ratio part of the risk is shifted on to the lender. If the entre-\npreneur's own capital were greater than OT, the entrepreneur would, therefore, have\nno incentive to borrow.? Thus, under Kalecki's assumptions, we have to postulate\nthat the entrepreneur's own capital is smaller than OT, say, OA. In such a case, by\nborrowing, the entrepreneur can reach a higher indifference curve. If, however, we\nabandon the assumption of constant risk to size, the rationale of contracting loans\nbecomes clearer : as the entrepreneur borrows, the whole x'y' plane, which represents\nthe risk to the enterprise, shifts in a way favourable to the enterprise.\n\nKalecki's analysis leaves another puzzle : if constant returns to scale prevail,\nand if risk remains constant regardless of the size of the firm, while the entrepreneur\nprefers, other things being equal, not to commit all of his capital in one enterprise,\nwhy is it that firms grow, and what determines their minimum size ? It appears that\nto answer that question one has to fall back on an explanation based on indivisibilities,\nor else to admit that risk declines with size.\n\nIn the case of large, widely held corporations, the analysis presented in Fig. 1\ndoes not apply, as the individual's holdings of the stock of a large enterprise is usually\ninsignificant compared with the total outstanding stock, and forms a small fraction of\nthe individual's total assets. The floatation of equity capital is not limited, therefore,\nby the individual's dislike of committing himself too far in one enterprise. Kalecki (6)\npostulates that the existing stockholders insist on stock dilution in order to retain\nfor themselves monopolistic profits. It seems more likely, however, that equity issues\nare limited mainly because the state of the market puts a limit on potential expansion.\nThis explanation seems more plausible than Kalecki's, which would still leave the\npuzzle of the low loan-to-assets ratio in large enterprises.\n\nIV\n\nKalecki postulated the '' Principle of Increasing Risk '\"' in order to give a general\nexplanation of the limit of investment per unit time, both in the individual firm, and\nin the aggregate. The '\"'principle \" was also meant to supplant the explanations\ngiven by the theory of monopolistic competition. It does not appear, however, that\nincreasing risk does, in fact, provide us with such a general explanation, for while the\nentrepreneur's risk rises as his commitments increase, and while the entrepreneur's\nand the lender's risk increase with increasing loan-to-asset ratios, the risk faced by\nthe enterprise declines with size.\n\nEmpirical data suggests that the principle might be more relevant in the case\nof small than in the case of large enterprises. The most realistic explanation of the\nrate of expansion of the latter is still given by monopolistic competition.\n\n1 As long as we can assume that with given odds the individual prefers a greater gain or a smaller loss\nto a smaller gain or greater loss, and with given gains and losses the more favourable odds are preferred,\nthe analysis conducted in ''objective '\" terms applies to ''subjective \" decisions. Where '' subjective \"'\npreferences fail to coincide with mathematical probabilities, arbitrage becomes profitable, as in the case\nof investment trusts.\n\n? Beyond OT the entrepreneur would be unwilling to invest his own capital, because of the risk involved.\nBut if he borrows, the risk would increase even faster, and hence there would be no incentive to borrowing.\nWhen, however, the lender's risk increases, the risk premium paid by the entrepreneur is equivalent to an\ninsurance premium : a small absolutely certain loss is exchanged for a possible large one, which might\noccur if the entrepreneur invested more of his own capital, instead of borrowing.\n\n8 Vol 20\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:32:39 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "II2 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nIt is difficult to find examples of totally uncorrelated risks : the drilling of wildcat\noil wells is possibly the best one. The risk of total failure in a one-well wildcatting\nenterprise is very high. The risk of total failure of a large oil concern is very low,\nthough the risk of any one well being dry is the same for a large and for a small concern.\n\nThe assumption of total lack of correlation between the risks attached to individual\nunits of investment made by the same enterprise is clearly unrealistic, but it is equally\nunrealistic to assume that the risks are perfectly correlated, which is the condition of\nconstant risk to size.! Available evidence shows that small enterprises are more risky\nthan large ones : their discontinuance rate is higher, the variation of profits over the\ncycle is greater, and, at any given time, the range of profitability is higher. The overall\nprofitability of large and small enterprises over the whole cycle seems roughly equal.?\nIt is, therefore, reasonable to assume that risk declines with size and that riskless\nprofit remains the same. The declining risk at constant returns to scale is shown in\nFig. 4 by the dotted lines. Lines AG, B'E' and F'Q' replace now the lines 44\", BE and\nFQ respectively.\n\nIf \" increasing risk \" could be used as a universal explanation of limitation of\nexpansion per unit time, we could expect higher loan-to-asset ratios in the case of\nlarge than in the case of small enterprises, which would permit larger enterprises to\nexpand faster than smaller ones. Facts do not support this hypothesis. Although\nlarge enterprises contract their loans at much lower cost than small firms do (which\nis in keeping with the theory, for risk is less in large enterprises) :\n\nThe equity capital of the small firms provided only about r/2 of their total\nassets, compared with about 2/3 or 3/4 of the assets of the large corporations.\u2014\n[Osborn (xo).]\n\nObviously, the principle of increasing risk does not explain the difference between\nthe financial structure of large and small corporations. Moreover, if increasing risk\ndid provide an explanation for the limit of expansion per unit time of small corpora-\ntions, it clearly does not do so in case of large corporations where the loan-to-asset\nratio is lower, and the weighted risk is smaller.\n\nTo solve our dilemma we have to fall back on explanations based on considera-\ntions of market imperfections and monopoly elements. Small firms do not have a\nready access to the equity market, and the potential lenders are in a strong monopoly\nposition, as shown by Nicholson (9) and others. A large proportion of small firms'\nloans are contracted on a short-term basis, an expensive source of capital, because of\nthe difficulty of floating long-term obligations. Large firms, on the other hand, are\nin a strong position on the finance market ; there is no evidence that large firms\nwould expand faster if more finance were available, as the expansion rate is very\nlargely regulated by considerations of potential demand. Another factor also has to\nbe taken into account: small firms are mostly closely held corporations, and the\nsmall entrepreneur might put a high financial value on ownership and control. The\nissue of equity shares might involve the loss of control. Thus the small entrepreneur\nmight be more willing to contract loans than to issue equity shares. In large enter-\nprises ownership is usually divorced from control, and, therefore, the deterrent against\nthe issue of equity shares does not exist.\n\nThe *' risk function \" of the entrepreneur and of the lender as developed in this\nsection is seen to be much more complicated than the simple Kalecki-Klein function\ndescribed at the beginning of this paper, and it cannot be adequately described by\n\n1 The advantages of size increase the faster, the greater is the probability of large loss per unit invest-\nment, and the smaller the correlation between the risks. Very large concerns can take great risks without\nendangering their position, which incidentally disposes of the frequent claim that high taxation of profits\n\nwipes out risk capital.\n?

As loans are contracted, the entrepreneur's risk rises (as shown by the\n\nm\nBB'E curve) to a maximum \u00c9,4* \u2014 x X 5j. The lender's capital is riskless up to the\ni\u2014k--1\n\npoint where L \u2014 ,Where Fanax is the greatest losson the part of the firm\n\nto be taken under consideration. The lender's risk (shown by the FQ curve) rises\nasymptotically toward a maximum equal to the total risk of the firm.\n\nThe intersection of the entrepreneur's risk curve with that lender's risk curve M\ndetermines the maximum loan O'N which the entrepreneur could profitably contract\nwith a given amount of own capital x.! Klein and Kalecki assume that point M always\noccurs. It is obvious that the condition of occurrence of M, namely \u00c9 max 4- Q max - P,\nwill always be satisfied for some L in case of diminishing returns where P can be made\narbitrarily small by increasing total investment. Under constant, and a fortiori, under\nincreasing returns, there is no logical reason why the condition should be fulfilled.\nIf finance acts as a limiting factor, it is more probable that it does so in either of the\ntwo following ways : (1) market imperfections put an absolute limit to the amount\nof finance which any one enterprise can obtain, or (2) at a certain point, the supply of\nfinance in the form of loan capital becomes very inelastic, because of the preference\nof loan-capital owners for low-risk, low-reward investments. The latter limit has\nalready been discussed in Section 2 above.\n\nThere is much evidence, that, contrarily to our assumption, the weighted risk of\nthe firm does not remain constant with size, but on the contrary that it declines. If\nrisk were attached to individual units of investment in a random fashion, we could\nwrite a binomial expansion to indicate the decline of risk with size. To illustrate : if\nthere are two identical units of investment, and if in each case there is a 0.8 probability\nof a 20 per cent profit and a o.2 probability of a 1o per cent loss, then the weighted\nrisk for each unit is o.02. If the two events are totally independent, the weighted risk\nfor both investments taken jointly is o.0004. The '' riskless profit '\" remains, of course,\nunchanged.\n\n1 We assume, of course, that the lender's charges are sufficient, and no more than sufficient, to cover\nthe increasing risk charges,\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:32:39 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In this paper it will be shown that the '' principle of increasing\nrisk \" does not provide a sufficient explanation of the limit of the rate of investment\nin the general case, for although the entrepreneur's risk and the lender's risk increase\nwith the size of the loan, given an arbitrary amount of the entrepreneur's own capital,\nthe risk of the enterprise as a whole declines with increasing size. A determinate\nsolution arises only under special assumptions, but the investigation of the \"risk\nfunction \"' is fruitful in that it sheds light on the differences in financial structure and\nin the rate of growth of undertakings operating under different risk conditions.\n\nI\n\nUnder the assumptions of perfect competition the size of the individual firm and\nthe rate of expansion of the firm are indeterminate. The Theory of Monopolistic\nCompetition attempts to explain how investment per unit time is determined, but the\nexplanation is clearly inadequate :\n\nImperfect competition . . . operates to limit the portion of & (the available\ncapital) invested in any particular field, but not the limit to the total amount of &.\nOn the other hand, imperfect competition cannot account for the fact that in a\ngiven industry large and, small enterprises are started. [Kalecki (6, p. 98).]\n\nIt seems dangerous to assume that monopolistic competition prevails in all fields\nof economic activity without exception, and yet investment per unit time is clearly\ndeterminate in all the fields. According to Kalecki (4, 5, 6) the limiting factor is the in-\ncreasing risk attached to the marginal unit of investment, and not the declining\nmarginal efficiency of capital :\n\nThere are two reasons for the increase of marginal risk with the amount\ninvested. The first is the fact that the greater the investment of an entrepreneur\nthe more is his wealth position endangered in the event of unsuccessful business.\nThe second reason is the danger of ''illiquidity \" . . . the amount invested &\nmust be considered as a fully illiquid asset in case of a sudden need for '' capital.\"\nIn that situation the entrepreneur who has invested in equipment his reserves\nand taken '' too much credit \" is obliged to borrow at a rate of interest which is\nhigher than the market one. . . . If, however, the entrepreneur is not cautious\nin his investment activity it is the creditor who imposes on his calculations the\nburden of increasing risk charging the successive portions of credit above a certain\namount with rising rate of interest. [Kalecki (5, p. 442).]\n\nInvestment is thus determined by the intersection of the marginal efficiency of\ncapital curve with the increasing risk curve. The smaller the initial capital of the\nentrepreneur, the greater is the entrepreneur's risk at any given level of investment.\nThe smaller the entrepreneur's investment, the less can be borrowed, and hence the\nsmaller the maximum absolute expansion per unit time. The maximum aggregate\ninvestment per unit time can be readily obtained by summing up the individual\ninvestments.\n\nIO5\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:32:39 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

As the period proceeded, additional domestic\nresources had to be utilised in the form of an increased quantum of exports to obtain\nthe same previous quantum of imports.\n\nIf the long period deterioration in the terms of trade had been due to a greater\nrate of increase in productivity in the output of primary commodities than of manu-\nfactured articles, the deterioration would not have been so significant from the view-\npoint of the primary producing countries' '' real sacrifice.\" There are, however, some\nindications that productivity increased more rapidly in industrialised Britain than in\nprimary production in the countries from which Britain imported.! It can then be\nargued, in conformity with the Singer-Prebisch thesis, that the more rapid rise in\nBritain's standard of living than in the underdeveloped countries exporting to Britain\nmeant that the underdeveloped countries helped to maintain, in the prices which they\npaid for their imported manufactures relative to those which they obtained for their\nprimary products, a rising standard of living in Britain, without receiving, in the\nprice of their own products, a corresponding equivalent contribution towards their\nown standards of living.* This is a provocative hypothesis, but without additional data\nit cannot be verified. It must, of course, also be observed that had population not\nincreased so rapidly in underdeveloped areas the rise in fer cafita real income would\nhave been substantially greater.\n\nFurther, the confinement of our analysis to the commodity terms of trade makes\nthe fall in the prices of foodstuffs and raw materials appear exceptionally unfavourable.\nAfter all, the export volume of primary producing countries expanded notably during\nthe period when the commodity terms of exchange moved against primary producing\ncountries. We may, therefore, want to correct shifts in the commodity terms of trade\nfor changes in the volume of exports. The '' income terms of trade \" is then the more\nappropriate measure, for such an index shows the volume of imports obtainable from\nthe income of the country's exports. When there is considerable expansion in the\nvolume of a country's exports, the income terms of trade will indicate less deterioration\nthan will the commodity terms of trade, given the same degree of change in export\n\nrices.\n\nP Finally, while the offer curve analysis can suggest what forces should be examined\nto determine why the terms of trade change, such an analysis cannot yield unambiguous\nwelfare conclusions when, as in the present problem, we have to consider the distri-\nbution of gains and losses over time. Difficulties in assessing the distribution of gains\nand losses over the path of change will be appreciated and will be recognised as the\nmain reason why our discussion of the relevance of changes in the terms of trade to\neconomic welfare is necessarily less conclusive than the usual static analysis as repre-\nsented by a production frontier-cum-community indifference map. We have con-\nsidered some of the qualitative tendencies which improvement in Britain's terms of\ntrade implied for Britain's gains from trade, but we cannot quantify these gains, and\nthey must always be considered along with the limitations we have discussed.\n\nWilliamstown, Massachusetts.

In a free\neconomy this increase of demand leads to rising prices and so to rising costs and\nincomes ; ie. it sets off inflation. In a controlled economy it is theoretically possible\nthat there will be no such repercussions upon prices, and hence no secondary effects\nupon incomes, because controls succeed in stifling the initial increase in demand.\nBut, as has already been noted, controls can be effective only if they do not pull too\nstrongly against market forces, which are now strengthened by the increase of demand.\n\nCost inflation occurs in its purest form in a controlled economy. In this case an\nautonomous rise in costs, e.g. a rise in the real wage rate or in prices of imported\nmaterials, can set off inflation only if there is already excess demand to absorb this\nrise of costs into prices, or if the rise in costs itself swells aggregate demand. This\nlast possibility depends upon business expectations and credit policy, and, more\ndirectly, upon whether the rise in costs leads to an immediate rise in incomes. Such\na rise occurs if there is an increase in real wages, but it does not occur if the rise in\ncosts is caused by an increase in import prices. It appears, therefore, that directly or\nindirectly demand is the fundamental factor in all inflationary processes, and that\nmeasures to restrain or reduce aggregate demand are fundamental for the control of\ninflation.!\n\nAuckland, New Zealand.

The threshold prevents the. indifferenc\u00e9 curves from\nmeeting the X axis. But this mild restriction merely affects the area covered by the\ncurves, and leaves unaffected their shape and form. The indifference maps concerned\nwill still look very much like ordinary indifference maps.\n\nThe same conclusions hold when both commodities are indispensable. In Fig. 2\nboth Y and X are indispensable goods (so no saturation loci can appear in this finite\nrepresentation of the indifference map). Let OP be the smallest amount of Y needed\nfor survival when X is considered as a variable, all other goods held fixed as given.\nSimilarly, let OQ be the smallest amount of X necessary for survival. If these minimum\namounts are independent of the quantities of X and Y held, the threshold loci will be\nstraight lines parallel to the axes, such as PP' and QQ'. All the indiffereuce curves will\nbe contained within these two lines and so prevented from meeting the axes.\n\nIf X and Y can be substituted for each other in meeting the survival needs of the\nindividual, their threshold amounts will vary. The threshold loci will then approach\nthe axes somewhat in the manner of the curves O'Q\"' and O'P\" in Fig. 2. If X and Y\ncan never completely replace each other in meeting the need for survival (so that\neven with an infinite amount of Y, say, some X would still be required), the threshold\nloci will never meet the axes and neither will any of the indifference curves. The\ntwo threshold loci may lie entirely on the same indifference curve, depending on the\ngeneral shape of the indifference curves and the location of the point O' from which\nboth loci start. That is, the two loci may, in effect, form an indifference curve. This,\nagain, is not likely to be the general case.\n\nIf X and Y can completely replace each other? for finite quantities in meeting\nthe need for survival, the threshold loci meet the axes. Then the ends of some indiffer-\nence curves may lie on both axes, the ends of others may lie on one axis and one\nthreshold locus, and the ends of all the others may lie on both threshold loci unless the\nloci coincide with an indifference curve.\n\nHowever, on all indifference maps for two indispensable goods (as on the maps for\none indispensable good) the effect of indispensability is the same\u2014\"'' empty \"' regions\narise in the neighbourhood of the axes over the range of values for which the goods\nare indispensable. It is as if the end portions of some (if not all) of the indifference\ncurves were erased. This only affects the extent of the curves and not their shape or\nform.? The restriction can easily be removed by merely shifting the origin of the\nindifference map affected. That is, the origin may be redefined to include the threshold\namount(s) of the indispensable good(s) with the other impounded quantities.* Thus,\nin Fig. 1 the origin could be shifted to the point P and in Fig. 2 to the point O'. If\nthis were done these indifference maps would be perfectly regular.\n\nOttawa, Canada. J- \u00c0. GALBRAITH.\n\n1Professor Hart, however, treats this as the general case. He looks upon the two threshold loci as\nalways forming an indifference curve\u2014his curve of ''zero satisfaction \"\u2014 and proceeds from there to\nbuild up his indifference maps for two indispensable commodities. (Cf. '' Peculiarities of Indifference Maps\nInvolving Money,\" op. cit., pp. 127-8.) 1\n\n? The possibility that X(Y) can completely replace Y(X) while Y(X) cannot completely replace X(Y)\nis easily handl\u00e9d. One threshold locus will meet an axis while the other will not.\n\n? Professor Hart concluded that the effect of indispensability is to '' restrict us considerably in our\ndrawing of indifference curves \"' (ibid., p. 127). The conclusion of this note is that if indispensability\nplaces any constraint on the choice behaviour of the individual that constraint can easily be dealt with\nby appropriately cutting off the extremities of a regular set of indifference curves.\n\nWhere the threshold loci are not straight lines this procedure would entail eliminating from the\npreference maps the end portions of some of the indifference curves.

                    "158 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\n6. This last section will discuss briefly the significance of the integrability con-\ndition in utility theory. Georgescu-Roegen, in an important paper published in 1936,!\ndemonstrated that the possibility that indifference elements could be integrated into\ncurves or surfaces did not, of itself, guarantee that those curves and surfaces were\nindifference curves and surfaces.? The condition that the two types of surface, integral\nsurface and indifference surface, should coincide is that indifference should be a\ntransitive relation. If transitivity is assumed, however, Georgescu-Roegen showed\nthat that condition alone is sufficient for the indifference elements to be integrable.\nThus the integrability conditions as such are irrelevant, for if they are obeyed when\nthe transitivity condition is not fulfilled, then the integral surfaces are not necessarily\nindifference surfaces ; and if the transitivity condition is satisfied, then the integra-\nbility conditions are redundant. It is the transitivity condition alone that is im-\n\nortant.?\n\nP This line of reasoning may be applied to the revealed preference theory. The\nHouthakker theorem establishes the transitivity of revealed equivalence. Once this\nis established, the integrability of the '' equivalence \" elements follows almost as a\nby-product of the theorem. If it were demonstrated only that the ''equivalence \"\nelements were integrable, without at the same time demonstrating that the '' equiva-\nlence \" is transitive, then the existence of a consistent total utility function would\nnot be proved. Put in another way, the integrability conditions are a necessary but\nnot a sufficient condition for the existence of a total utility function ; while the\ntransitivity condition (the other conditions for equivalence being satisfied) is both\nnecessary and sufficient.\n\nLondon.

Then we apply the axiom of semi-transitivity to the whole of the three\nsequences. We start at P?X? -|- 2D and proceed to P9X? (by way of P1X1! -- D) along\nthe originally superior income-sequences, which are now looked at in the inverse\ndirection, so that each consecutive batch is either equal or revealed to be inferior to\nits predecessor. From P9X? we continue along the original inferior income-sequence\n(in the original direction) to P2X?? \u2014 I) \u2014 P?X? 4- 3D.\"? Since this result contradicts\nthe axiom, and a similar result follows if P?X?? \u2014 P?X?, the proof is completed.\nTransitivity is established, X?, X! and X? are equivalent batches, and the surfaces\nthat such batches define may be called indifference surfaces and identified with the\ncontours of a total utility surface.\n\n3. The error in this proof lies in the italicised phrase above. It is true that we\ncould construct a superior income-sequence from P!X! to P?X? -- D, but it does not\nfollow that it will be possible to do so from P!X1! 4- D to P?X? -- 2D. If it were always\npossible to do so, that would imply that the boundary line through PX! 4- D (an\n** indifference line \" through this point) always lies below the line joining PiX! -- D\nand P?X? -- 2D. This will not in general be true, for there are no special restrictions\non the behaviour of such a boundary line implied by the assumptions of the problem.\n\n4. The proof can, however, be corrected. In order to do so, it is necessary to\nmake use of the result from the theory of differential equations? that the solution of\nthe differential equation for the boundary line is continuous in P9X?.\n\nThe economic meaning of this result may be put in the following manner : Let\nXy, and X, be two batches (incomes) on income-consumption curves /, and /, respectively,\nsuch that X, is revealed neither superior nor inferior to Xy. Now increase the batch\nX, by an infinitesimal amount of goods, to the new batch X,!. Thenthe batch X,! on /,\nwhich is revealed neither superior nor inferior to X,, can differ from X, only by an\ninfinitesiminal amount of goods. It cannot differ by a finite amount.*\n\n5. Equipped with this result, we may now give an alternative proof of the\nerroneous stage in Mr. Houthakker's argument. For ' presumably equivalent \"'\nbatches at prices P! and P?, the theorem above states that P?2X? is a continuous\nfunction of P1X!, If P?X? 4- 8 (for prices P?) is presumed equivalent to PX! -- e (for\nprices P), (8, e \u2014 o), it follows that there is an e, \u2014 0o such that 8 \u2014 2D for all e \u2014 e.\nWe can thus construct superior income-sequences from P9X? to P1X1 -- 3e,, and from\nPX -- 4e, to P?X? 4- 2D, and the proof proceeds as before.5\n\n1 The italics are ours.\n\n? Houthakker, op. cit., pp. 170-1.\n\n3 See P. Franklin, A4 Tveatise on Advanced Calculus (Wiley, 1940), pp. 520-4.\n\n* In terms of the ordinal preference theory, the corresponding result would rule out the possibility of\ntwo indifference curves lying infinitely close in one section, and at a finite distance apart in another section,\nof the relevant range.\n\nIt is worth observing that the theorem on the existence of the '' presumably equivalent\" income,\nwhen translated into ordinal preference terms, appears as the second part of Wold's Axiom V in his exposition\nof utility theory. See H. O. A.

                    "A\u00c0 Note on Revealed Preference and the\nTransitivity Condition\n\nI. The main purpose of this note is to draw attention to what appears to be an\nerror at one stage of Mr. Houthakker's proof that integrability is implied by the axioms\nof revealed preference theory.! We shall amend his proof, and take the opportunity to\ncomment on the significance of the transitivity condition in utility theory.\n\n2. The first steps of Mr. Houthakker's proof, which build upon the work of\nSamuelson? and Little,? may be quickly summarised as follows :\n\nLet P' be a set of prices of \u00bb goods (f, 5f, . . ., $45), with the condition 5j! \u2014 1\nimposed to avoid complications due proportional price sets. Similarly we let Xs be a\n\nLO\nset of quantities of the goods (x,5, x95, . . ., x45) and we write P'!Xs \u2014 Z ji!xi5, the\ni1\nincome required to buy X5 at prices P*.\n\nUsing the axioms of revealed preference theory, and an assumption that demand\ncurves have continuous derivatives with respect to prices and income,* Mr. Houthakker\nshows how to construct superior and inferior income-sequences from quantities X?\nbought at prices P? to quantities bought at another price-set P!. These sequences\nare all constructed through intermediate price-sets that are linear combinations of\nP? and P!. As the difference between successive prices decreases, the superior and\ninferior income-sequences are shown to tend to the same limit determining quantities\nX! at prices P!, Mr. Houthakker then attempts to demonstrate that X? and X! are\n'' equivalent \" in the sense of formal logic, i.e. that the relation connecting them is\n(a) reflexive, (b) symmetric, and (c) transitive.\n\nIt is relatively easy to demonstrate (a) and (b). In order to prove the third relation-\nship, transitivity, it is required to introduce a third price set, P?, at which quantities\nbought, X?, are obtained, by similar reasoning to that above, as '' presumably\nequivalent \" to X1. Another batch of goods X??, bought at prices P?, is shown to be\npresumably equivalent to X? by direct comparison of the two batches. It is then\nnecessary to show that if X! is presumably equivalent to X?, X? presumably equivalent\nto X!, and X?? presumably equivalent to X?, then X?? and X? are identical batches.\n\nMr. Houthakker uses a reductio ad absurdum proof by assuming first that\nP?X?? \u2014 P?X?, and letting P?X23? \u2014 P?X? \u2014 4D. The proof proceeds : '' Now we\ntake a superior income-sequence starting at P9X? and ending at an income P!X! -- D\n\n* We are indebted to Mr. Houthakker for his helpful comments on an earlier draft of this note.\n\n1H.

Vol. 1, 1949, pp. 90-9, and A Critique of Welfare Economics, Oxford, 195o, Chapter II and appendix.\n\n5It is not very clear in Mr. Houthakker's exposition where he uses this assumption of continuous\nderivatives. The condition would appear to be too strong, for on p. 167, where it is brought in for the\nsuperior income-sequence, no such assumption appears necessary, while for the inferior income sequence a\nless stringent assumption\u2014a Lipschitz condition\u2014would appear to suffice.\n\nA similar difficulty occurs in footnote 2 to p. 171, where Houthakker asserts that part of the proof\namounts to showing that a line integral is zero along a closed path, and hence gives a '' well-known inte-\ngrability condition.\" The path considered in the proof, however, is of a special type where the line integral\nmeasured between any two points on the path is zero. This does not appear to imply that the line integral\nis zero along every closed path, \u00e0s is required for integrability.\n\nI56\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:35:15 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "22 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nThe significance of this modification becomes apparent when we consider the\npossible efficacy of a policy designed to keep the economy moving along the full employ-\nment ceiling. Suppose that the level and rate of growth of autonomous investment\nare sufficient to set the system moving along its ceiling. In the Hicksian model this\nwill involve induced investment growing at the same rate as autonomous investment ;\nfor P must be \u2014 o with & \u2014 o. Thus, if autonomous investment is only just sufficient\nto achieve the ceiling, a collapse may occur through the difficulty of securing smoothly\nincreasing autonomous investment : a sudden \" trough \" in the autonomous invest-\nment '' line \" would be enough to cause a collapse of induced investment and a slump.\nFor safety, therefore, autonomous investment would have to be sufficient to keep\nemployment '' over-full \". (Trade Cycle, p. 167). Once we recognise, however, that the\nvolume of induced investment depends on the magnitude of 5, another possibility is,\nin theory, available, that autonomous investment may be sufficiently productive for\ninduced investment to be practically zero along the ceiling. If this were so, a sudden\ntrough in autonomous investment would be unable to do m\u00fcch damage, and over-\nemployment would become unnecessary. Our modification points the way, therefore,\nto a greater faith than Dr. Hicks himself has in a policy designed to eliminate cyclical\nmovement rather than one which aims merely to quieten it. Its advantage over the\nover-employment solution is that induced investment is eliminated not by repressing\nan existing desire for it, but by preventing the emergence of the desire. But the prac-\ntical difficulties are obviously very great.\n\n(b) Deviations from Equilibriwn. An exhaustive analysis of this subject will not\nbe attempted.

There we found that prices would be constant\nif investment grew geometrically at the rate A (1 \u2014 c).

Even when entrepreneurs are d/sfosed to carry out large investment\nprogrammes in response to current increases in the conditions of demand for their\nproducts, they will not have the ncentive to do so if the economy is on its equilibrium\npath and autonomous investment is sufficiently productive to prevent prices from rising\nin relation to costs.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:37:03 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

There are really two questions here : (1) is the magnitude\nof h sufficient to make the Hicksian equation (39) gravely inaccurate, and (2) what kind\nof difference in behaviour of the economic system is involved when we substitute\nequations (41) and (42) for (39) ?\n\n(r) We discussed the limits between which the coefficient A must lie in Section 3\n(in particular equations (16)-(18)) There it was shown that, for the individual\nfirm, ^ must be positive but less than the ratio of equilibrium output capacity to\nequilibrium capital. For the economy as a whole, however, a further limitation is\nimplied : A must be less than unity ; for in a macroeconomic system output and\ncapital are measured in terms of the same units, for example units of value, and it is\ninconceivable that an increment in capital should increase the value of output by as\nmuch as the value of the investment itself. Indeed at a guess we might suppose that /\nis of the order of magnitude of 5 per cent per annum. This means that the degree of\ninaccuracy involved in the implicit assumption of Dr. Hicks and others that / is zero\ncannot be very large.\n\n(2) However, it is still worth while to investigate the ind of difference made by\nthe recognition that A is positive, especially as, to the extent that investment is con-\ntrolled by central policy, its productivity is to some degree susceptible of choice. We\nshall consider first the effect on the equilibrium path, and then the effect on the devia-\ntions from equilibrium.\n\n(\u00ab) The Equilibrium Path.

Mr. Kaldor argues that the rate of growth of autonomous investment cannot properly be\nregarded as an independent variable, but must be related to the technical ratio between capital and output ;\nsince Hicks does assume the rate of growth to be independent, what is growing autonomously in the Hicks\nmodel cannot be autonomous investment at all, but must be unproductive expenditure, not 4, but K\n(pp. 841-847).

Moreover, although it is recognised that this\nresult depends upon the assumption of constant prices, the implication is that the\nrelaxation of this assumption would not materially affect the conclusion.? Our own\nanalysis indicates that the whole purpose of geometrically growing investment is to\nkeep prices from falling ; if they were allowed to fall, this would not disrupt the\nequilibrium between demand and supply\u2014they would fall in order to preserve that\nequilibrium\u2014but it would discourage investment and the creation of capacity, and\nmight discourage employment of labour, if there were not a sufficient offset through\nincreased consumption. Further, the sag of prices might equally well be avoided by\nincreasing 405-productive expenditure, that is by means of projects that would create\ndemand without adding to supply. It can be shown that in this case only arithmetically\nincreasing autonomous expenditure and income are implied. For, from equation (32),\nthe rate of change of aggregate demand when autonomous expenditure, K, is variable, is\n\ny\u00bb Kt G-0\n\nI\u2014c\n\nK' ;\n\u20141I- ; fer ?' \u2014 o.\n\nAnd similarly, for ?' \u2014 o,\n\nY$' \u2014 \u00c0I \u2014 hq (fo \u2014 $2).\nWhence, with Y?' \u2014 Y5', K' \u2014 h(x \u2014 c) I \u2014 h(x \u2014 c) q (fe \u2014 $\u00bb) \u2014 constant ....(38)\nIn this case investment, so far from growing at a constant geometric rate, is maintained\n\nat a constant level. The annual increase in Government expenditure will have to be\nh (x \u2014 c) times the constant level of investment.\n\nThus it is not true that geometric growth is implied by the very nature of\ncapitalistic production, if equilibrium is to be maintained, even if by '' equilibrium \"\nwe mean '\"' constant prices.\" And even if all expenditures except private consumption\nare '' productive,\" geometric growth is required not to maintain equilibrium between\ndemand and supply, but to keep prices constant, if that is desired. Domar's analysis\nis misleading in so far as it ignores the part played by capital accumulation in exerting\na downward (or at least relieving an upward) pressure on prices.\n\n6. Productive Investment, Price Changes and the Accelerator.\n\nIn Part I, Section 3, it was maintained that, while an output accelerator is open\nto the objection that it ignores the productivity of investment, a demand or price\naccelerator is a more reasonable hypothesis from the point of view of the theory of\nthe firm.

Diagram 6\ntells us the level of employment corresponding to the level of income '' determined \"'\nin Diagram 5.\n\nThe analogy with price-determination in a particular industry is clear. Indeed,\nthe analogy only fails to be complete because the aggregate demand curve is completely\ninelastic with respect to ?\u2014which would certainly never be the case in a particular\nindustry. The result is that Diagram 5 determines only the ratio of prices to wages,\nthe level of income being predetermined by the saving-investment relation. But the\nassumption of complete inelasticity of aggregate demand with respect to 5 is certainly\nnot necessary, nor indeed is it likely to hold in reality. Quite apart from the effect of\nchanges in $ on investment we should expect consumption-saving decisions to be\nsomewhat affected by the level of real wages. In fact the original Keynesian formula-\ntion, in which the equalisation of saving and investment determines income in terms\nof wage units, amounts to the assumption that Y? is a rectangular hyperbola, that\naggregate demand has an elasticity of unity with respect to f.\n\nExcept in the case where entrepreneurs keep enough reserve capacity in hand\nto render 7 zero, the equation for Y5 is dependent on Q as well as $, so that our aggregate\nsupply curve's position will alter if Q alters. Strictly speaking, Q cannot be constant\nso long as I is positive ; but Keynes supposes that it can be treated as constant in\nshort-period analysis.\n\nSuppose, however, that we wish to analyse the effects of capital accumulation\non f, Y and N. The investigation would be worth while only if it could be held that T,\nthe \"' investment period,\" is long enough for the economy to move towards stationary\nequilibrium within that period. Let us assume that this is so.\n\nThe curve Y5 will shift to the right by an amount 7 per unit of net investment,\nand will go on moving to the right until net investment becomes zero. It is perhaps\nless immediately obvious that changes in Q will also affect Y?. We have already\nmentioned the reason for this (Section 4 above) : it is due to the fact that the invest-\nment equation itself is not independent of the aggregate supply function. For, under\nthe assumption of linearity and neglecting the rate of interest, the original form of\nthe investment equation is, from (25) above :\nit by equation (29).

SUMMARY\n\nA survey of the literature reveals that there has been a great deal of confusion\nin the matter of external economies and the downward-sloping supply curve, and that\nnowhere have the conditions of the interrelationships been worked out in detail.\nThis paper has attempted to work out these interrelationships, and its main points\nmay be summarised as follows :-\n\n(i) When there is a circular interdependence among the supply curves of the\nfirms in an industry, it is impossible to obtain the industry supply curve by the process\nof simple summation. A unique industry supply curve may be obtained, however,\nby the solution of a set of simultaneous equations, either directly or by successive\napproximations.\n\n(2) When such circular interdependence exists, the industry supply curve may\nbe either more or less steep than the supply curve derived by blowing up the supply\ncurve of the typical firm\u2014depending upon whether there exist external diseconomies\nor external economies.\n\n) The necessary condition for the industry supply curve to be actually forward-\nfalling is that there be present external economies of such magnitude that any increase\nin industry output sets in motion forces which make all firms together wish to increase\ntheir output more than the original increase.\n\n(4) This forward-falling supply curve is not a true supply curve in the sense of\ntracing out the quantities that will be supplied with shifts in the price offered to the\nindustry ; itisrather the locus of price \u00e0nd quantity traced out by shifts in a sufficiently\nsteep demand curve. \u2014\n\n(5) The question of stability of equilibrium between demand and forward-falling\nsupply was investigated, leading to the familiar condition that the demand curve\nmust cut the supply curve from above. If, however, the demand curve cuts it too\nsteeply, the possibility exists that an unstable cobweb might be generated.\n\nNew York, N.Y. RosERT W. A\u00c1pAMs.\nMinneapolis, Minn. JouN T.

In all cases the trend, where continuous, appears to be linear. However, to\nascertain the value of the trend parameter is an exercise of dubious usefulness until\nmore direct and detailed information is ascertained regarding the character and\ndevelopment of the industries concerned.\n\n5. The materials coefficients show several marked characteristics. They tend on\nthe whole to be approximately constant for short periods of a few years. For half\nthe industries examined, at least the major coefficient is approximately constant for\na long period, usually a decade or more. There is significantly little evidence of sub-\nstitution relations between inputs and still less of diminishing technical marginal\nrates of substitution. Moreover, where definite evidence of substitution was found\nthis appeared, with few exceptions, to be associated with a change in the nature of\nthe product, e.g. bakeries, biscuits, confectionery.?\n\n6. It does seem after all that production functions tend to be of a fairly simple\nform. The hypothesis of a constant employment coefficient is certainly incorrect for\nthe majority of industries examined (measuring labour in man-years), but this is\nbecause a portion of the labour force is fixed over significant ranges of output\u2014a\ncomplication of which account may readily be taken. Evidence of price substitution\nis surprisingly meagre and, at least in the short period, very many materials coefficients\ntend to be constant. However, this is certainly not universally true even if only\nbecause the output of the recorded '' industries \" is sometimes not homogeneous. The\nproblem of non-homogeneity of product\u2014and hence of aggregation\u2014is likely to prove\nof decisive importance in any ultimate attempt to set up a complete working model.\nThe investigation is being extended to further consider this problem.\n\nThe results of the investigation, however, show promise. It may well yet be\nthat some modified variant of the Leontief system might provide a satisfactory model\nof short-term change. For the present, however, the most that can definitely be said\nis that the results of this pilot analysis warrant a large-scale project. This should be\ndevoted to direct field investigation of the production functions of firms and industries.\n\nCambridge.

Thus, in the special case where the ith commodity is either a good consumed\nor a good transformed (but not both), the demand (or supply) function of the :;th\ncommodity will have precisely the same formal properties as the corresponding function\nin ordinary consumption theory. More generally, if the ith commodity is a good which\nis both consumed and transformed, then one has always to deal with a situation where\ntwo prices change simultaneously (since the ;th x and the sth z have the common price\n$i). Hence, the effect of a change in any p; upon the demand or supply of any x; or zi\nwill always be ambiguous ; firstly because income effects (which apply in producer-\nconsumer theory to the demand and supply of all commodities, whether they are\nconsumed or transformed) will be ambiguous in size and sign, secondly because even\nwhen 7 \u2014 j and the usual second order stability conditions are satisfied, the demand\nor supply of, say, x; (taken alone) may move in either direction.! However, the combined\ndemand for (supply of) xi and zi (viz., xi -- zi) will change in the opposite (identical)\ndirection to a comQensated change in their common rice, 5i.* The only ambiguity regard-\ning combined demand and supply is due to income effects. Graaff reaches a different\nconclusion (see his discussion at pp. 84 and 86) because he does not use all the second\norder stability conditions at his disposal? 1f the proper condition is applied, the\nsubstitution term in Graaff's equation (9) will, in fact, be found to be negative for\n$ - j.* Still arguing by analogy with ordinary consumption theory, therefore, it\nappears that 2\u00bb $roducer-consumer equilibrium analysis, substitution effects alone cannot\nossibly be a source of (Hicksian) instability.5 Indeed, this follows as a special instance\nof the following completely general proposition : \u00a3o every theorem in ordinary consum$-\ntion theory there corresponds a theorem in producer-consumer analysis.

We cannot attempt such\nan investigation here ; it would not be profitable to do so without looking also at the\nsupply side and the distribution of consumers' incomes, and this would take us much\ntoo far. The preceding analysis, combined with the extensive work on imperfect\ncompetition in the theory of the firm, may be helpful as a starting point.\n\n* * *\n\nWe have so far discussed cases in which the quality of a commodity was described\nby one variable, its unit price under some basic price system. This approach clearly\nhas severe limitations, most of which we have already indicated. A\u00c0 much greater\nflexibility can be attained by introducing more variables to specify a variety of an\nitem of consumption. If we are speaking of an overcoat we may, e.g., give quantitative\nexpressions for its size, weight, colour, warmth, etc. The consumer will then be sup-\nposed to have preferences for various combinations of these characteristics, rather\nthan for overcoats which are only described by their price. On the other hand, the\nprice of the coat will also depend on these characteristics, since they are produced by\ndifferent factor inputs (in the widest sense). Here we again meet a situation where\nthe supply side cannot be ignored ; in the single-variable case this was only possible\nbecause supply problems were implicitly assumed to be solved in the form of a price\nschedule which could only shift or tilt.\n\nAn adequate discussion of the multi-quality case will therefore have to await\nfurther reconnaissance, in the area between consumption theory and the theory of the\nfirm. Some of the methods used in the present paper can easily be extended to these\nproblems.\n\nFinally, we should remark that the multi-variable specification as just outlined\nrepresents a fundamental change in the approach to consumption theory, since attention\nis paid to the reasons why consumers want certain goods. This may also prove interest-\ning for studies of the demand for newly invented goods.

But, in practice, security values appear\nto approximate the discounted value of their future yields ; and, again in practice,\nthe demand for money seems to move in rough proportion to aggregate expenditure.\nHence, while the Duesenberry argument on this point is logically weak and is lacking\nin generality, assumption (e), taken as a premise rather than as a theorem, seems\nplausible enough.\n\nFinally, the empirical validity of assumption (f)\u2014that elasticities of supply are\nall infinite\u2014is open to suspicion. But this assumption seems to be approximately\nsatisfied in practice over the long run. When historical periods are being considered,\ntherefore, the Duesenberry theorem should not be greatly affected even if this assump-\ntion is not strictly valid. The same observation does not apply so clearly, however,\nto the micro-economic theorem presented in this paper.\n\nTaking all of the above assumptions together, everyday empirical knowledge\n\nforces one, at the very least, to assume an ambivalent attitude toward the micro-\neconomic theorem presented above. The Duesenberry constant-savings-ratio theorem,\nhowever, seems to have a fairly sound empirical basis; and while the Duesenberry\nresult obviously provides no more than a partial explanation of the empirical mystery\nfrom which it stems, the explanation is elegant and powerful as far as it goes.\n5. This brings us to the end of our argument. As we have seen, on the elementary\nlevel at which the preceding argument has been conducted, interdependent preference\nanalysis differs but little from ordinary consumption theory ; hence, while one some-\ntimes gets different and slightly more general results in \"' interdependent \" as com-\npared with '\" independent \" preference analysis, it is only in this very limited and\npractically unimportant sense that the two kinds of theory may be said to be at\nvariance with one another. One gets the impression, therefore, that the interdependence\npostulate is comparatively innocuous as concerns established doctrines; but this\nremark may require considerable qualification in the light of subsequent, and perhaps\nmore sophisticated, inquiries.\n\nOf course, the general interdependence postulate is so general as to be completely\nuseless ; but as Professor Duesenberry has tried to show\u2014and our discussion seems to\nsupport his findings om the whole\u2014by making special assumptions the concept of\ninterdependent preferences can be made into a useful tool for dealing with a variety\nof practical problems. The empirical validity of some of these assumptions is open to\nquestion, since, in the nature of the case, they are partly arbitrary. But this is a\ndifficulty that is present in almost all special economic studies ; it does not really\ndetract from their interest or explanatory usefulness.\n\nSo far as the present investigation is concerned, then, the interdependence postu-\nlate seems to satisfy the pragmatic criteria set forth earlier (p. 166). And while\nsome of the implications of the postulate will require further study before being fully\nadmitted into the society of respectable doctrines, there seems to be no reason why\nthe basic Duesenberry ideas should not be accepted as an integral part of the pure\ntheory of consumer behaviour.\n\nOxford.

Then, arguing along familiar Keynesian lines, the outcome will\nbe a fall in income and a consequent reduction of the rate of interest. As this lower\nrealised rate of interest repeats itself over a period of time, it will come to dominate\nthe average of past rates on the basis of which expectations of future rates are formed,\nand so in the long run the expected future rate will fall, bringing down with it the\nKeynesian liquidity preference curve. Productivity and thrift would thus, over a\nlong enough run, determine the expected future rate even if their future movements\ncould not be predicted at all. This result would only fail to follow if security-owners\nwere so firmly attached to their expectation of the future rate of interest that they\nabsolutely refused to lend at a rate lower than the expected rate, and rushed to lend\nat any higher rate. This would be an extremely difficult assumption to justify, and\nwould make interest theory completely uninteresting. ]\n\nIn consequence of these considerations, Professor Robertson seems justified in. his\nconclusion that liquidity preference, as Keynes formulated it, is unlikely to exercise\nany important influence over the long-run trend of the rate of interest. If, however,\nas he suggests, the liquidity preference concept is broadened to include the demand\nfor money to hold for precautionary motives, then liquidity preference does become a\nlong-period phenomenon.\n\nThe question which then arises is whether liquidity preference in this extended\nsense will be interest-elastic in the long run (Professor Robertson agrees that it will\nbe interest-elastic in the short run). In dealing with this question, Professor Robertson\nprefers to argue in terms of the relation between the rate of interest and K, the propor-\ntion of their resources over which people wish to keep command in monetary form,\nrather than in terms of the relation between the rate of interest and the absolute\namount of purchasing power people desire to hold as an asset. Since wealth will be\ngrowing over the course of time, the former is a more convenient form in which to\ncarry on the discussion.!\n\nProfessor Robertson's argument on this score is extremely difficult to grasp, but\nit seems to run as follows: the wealth owner, in deciding what proportion of his\nresources to hold in the form of money, equates the marginal '' convenience and\nsecurity \" yield obtained by holding cash with the marginal satisfaction derived from\nthe rate of interest earned on investment. As capital.accumulates and the yield on\ninvested capital declines, the marginal '' convenience and security \"' yield from holding\nmoney is equated with the (lower) marginal satisfaction gained from the lower rate\nof interest. Therefore, Professor Robertson concludes, in the long run the proportion\nof resources held in the form of cash will be influenced little, if at all, by the rate of\ninterest.\n\nIf this is Professor Robertson's argument, then he has failed to prove his point,\nfor the conclusion does not follow from the argument. Indeed, what he seems to have\ndone in this argument is to confuse two propositions. The first is that the marginal\nconvenience yield from holding money will be equated with the marginal satisfaction\nderived from the interest earned on investments ; as the rate of return on investment\nfalls, the marginal convenience and security yield of money holdings will also fall,\nthrough the adjustment of cash holdings to equalise the two marginal rates of return.\nThis proposition is quite valid. The second proposition is that as the rate of return on\ninvestment falls, the marginal convenience and security yield from a g\u00e9ven money\nholding will also fall, so that the equalisation of marginal returns from investment and\ncash holding will require little or no increase in the cash holding. This proposition,\n\n1 Professor Robertson's definition of K as a fraction of resources is rather unusual, since K in the\nCambridge equation is defined as a fraction of income. Perhaps Professor Robertson wrote '' resources \"'\nwhere he meant to write '' real income \"; in any event, the ensuing discussion can be applied to whichever\ndefinition is intended.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:46:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In short, the appropriate monetary policy in face of rising\ninterest rates depends not only on the cause of the rise, but also on the results the\nmonetary authorities desire to achieve.\n\nThese considerations raise the question as to how far Professor Robertson is\njustified in his claim that Keynes fell into the trap of confusing the two causes of\nrising interest rates in his comments on the boom of 1936-7. Keynes does qualify\nhis recommendation to increase the public's supply of idle balances by the phrase\n\" unless we deliberately desire to raise the rate of interest,\" which allows for the possi-\nbility that the monetary authorities might wish to do so; it is also possible that he\nfelt that the boom of 1936-7 had not gone far enough to justify the monetary authorities\nin allowing rising interest rates (whatever the reason for which they rose) to exercise a\nrestricting influence. Further, since Keynes does not specify what ' change in the\natmosphere or the circumstances \" would permit the extra idle balances to be subse-\nquently withdrawn, there is some room for difference of opinion over what he had in\nmind.\n\nWhat Keynes meant is, therefore, not absolutely clear. It may be that, as Pro-\nfessor Robertson claims, he did fall into the trap of confusing the two reasons for\nwhich interest rates may rise, and advocating an increase in the quantity of money\nwhenever the rate of interest tends to rise, and a decrease whenever it tends to fall.\nEven so, this would not be equivalent to advocating the creation of money in the\nboom and its destruction in the slump, unless it is assumed that the rate of interest\nrises only in response to expanding trade and falls omjy in response to contracting\ntrade. If, in any slump, the rate of interest were to rise as a result of Professor\nRobertson's ''fear\" cause, the Robertsonian interpretation of Keynes' meaning\nwould lead, not to the destruction, but to the creation of money in that slump.\n\nXIII LIQUIDITY PREFERENCE IN THE LONG RUN!\n\nProfessor Robertson is correct in his contention that Keynes, in basing the demand\nfor idle balances almost exclusively on the speculative motive, unduly restricted the\nliquidity preference theory to short-period phenomena. If the demand for idle balances\ndepends entirely on the prospect of a rise in the interest rate, then the liquidity prefer-\nence curve will depend on the rate of interest expected in the future; in other words,\nit will describe the liquidity demand for money, not as a function of the ruling rate of\ninterest, but as a function of the difference between the ruling rate and the rate expected\nin the future. The expected rate of interest is itself left undetermined.\n\nProfessor Robertson contends that the rate of interest expected in the future\ndepends ultimately on the forces of productivity and thrift. This is obviously true if\nthe owners of securities can estimate fairly accurately the future course of the rela-\ntionship between these forces. But it will also be true (in the long run) if the owners\nof securities can form no judgment at all about the future course of the willingness to\nsave and the opportunities for investment, and rely instead on the expectation that\ninterest rates in future will be some average of the rates ruling over some finite past\nperiod. For suppose that expectations are formed in this way and that, starting from\na position of equilibrium in which the relation between the marginal efficiency of\ncapital, the propensity to save, liquidity preference and the quantity of money is such\nthat the rate of interest expected on the basis of past experience is actually being\nrealised, there is a fall in the marginal efficiency of capital schedule or a rise in the\n\n1 Robertson, op. cit., pp. 25-7.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:46:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "I00 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nXI. INCREASED VELOCITY AND THE RATE OF INTEREST IN A CUMU-\nLATIVE PROCESS!\n\nAs with an increase in the quantity of money, the effect on the rate of interest\nof an increase in the velocity of circulation depends on the subsidiary assumptions\nmade. A decrease in the desire to hold idle balances must, if nothing else is assumed\nto change, have the effect of lowering the rate of interest to the point at which the\nincreased transactions balances required to circulate the increased income generated\nby the increased investment produced by the lower rate of interest, plus the increased\nliquid balances held as a result of the lower interest rate, together become equal to the\n(unchanged) stock of money. Only if there is full employment before the change\noccurs will the rate of interest ultimately be the same as it was before. If, on the\nother hand, it is assumed that the reduced desire to hold idle balances is accompanied\nby an increased desire to invest (or consume), which is what is involved when an\nentrepreneur \"' activises \"\" an idle balance by purchasing commodities or hiring labour,\nthen the increase in velocity will raise the rate of interest by raising income and draining\nmoney out of idle balances into transactions balances. But the rise in the rate of\ninterest must be attributed to the decision to increase investment, not to the decision\nto hold a smaller idle balance.\n\nPut another way, a decision to reduce idle balances may be eher a decision to\nhold another kind of asset instead (i.e. to hold securities) or a decision to reduce one's\nassets in order to increase current expenditure. In the former case the rate of interest\nis lowered, in the latter case it is raised. In both cases the conclusion will only follow\nif the decision is taken as the result of a lasting change in attitude.\n\nIt is true, as Professor Robertson points out, that the Keynesian theory does\nthrow the emphasis on substitution between money and securities. But this does not\nprevent analysis in Keynesian terms of decisions to reduce idle balances in order to\npurchase goods : the decision needs merely to be separated into its two parts, and the\nsame conclusion about the effect on the rate of interest will follow.\n\nXIIL KEYNES ON THE BOOM OF r936-7?\n\nIt is certainly true, as Professor Robertson maintains, that the rate of interest\nmay rise et/her as a result of an increase in business confidence, leading to an increased\ndesire to invest, or as a result of a decrease in investors' confidence, leading to an\nincreased desire to hold money. This conclusion, however, also follows from the\nKeynesian theory: ceteris paribus, either a rise in the marginal efficiency of capital or\nan increase in liquidity preference will bring about a rise in the rate of interest, though\nin the former case there will be a rise in income and employment, in the latter case a fall.\n\nA rise in the rate of interest may, therefore, mean two things, according to the\ncausal forces at work. Which of the two causes is operating is obviously an important\nquestion in deciding on the appropriate monetary policy to pursue, and it would be\nfatally confusing to assume that a rise in the rate of interest is always the result of\nthe same cause.\n\nHowever, an equally important question in choosing the appropriate monetary\npolicy is the result which it is desired t\u00f3 produce. If, for example, the rate of interest\nis tending to rise as a result of increasing confidence, the monetary authorities might\nwish to prevent this rise in order to permit activity to increase still more; they might\nfear that rising rates of interest would choke off the rise of income before it had reached\na satisfactory level.

The\nincreased volume of output and possibly higher level of prices consequent on the\nincreased rate of investment willlead to the absorption of some of the increased\nquantity of money into transactions balances, so that the rate of interest will subse-\nquently rise above its initial (reduced) level. But it will not rise to its previous level,\nbecause at that level the volume of output and level of prices would be what they were\nbefore the quantity of money was increased ; the community would only desire to\nhold the amount of money existing before the increase was made ; and so the supply\nof money would exceed the demand for it at that rate of interest. Put another way,\nunless there is full employment the increased quantity of money will not be entirely\nabsorbed by the bidding up of prices, but must be absorbed in part by a rise in the\nlevel of output ; but a rise in output will only occur if the rate of investment is higher,\nand, given an unchanged willingness to invest, this requires that in equilibrium the\nrate of interest be lower than before. This is approximately the argument of Mrs.\nRobinson, to which Professor Robertson refers, and it is perfectly valid on the assump-\ntion that the willingness to invest (marginal efficiency of capital) remains constant.\n\nIf, on the other hand, it is assumed that the willingness to invest rises as a result\nof the increase in the quantity of money, for example, as a result of more optimistic\nexpectations generated by the rise in prices or output, then there is no reason why the\nrate of interest should come to a halt at or below its previous level. Furthermore, if\nthe willingness to invest rises cumulatively, the rate of interest will rise cumulatively.\nHowever, a cumulative rise in the willingness to invest is not an automatic accom-\npaniment of the increase in the quantity of money ; it must result from some sort of\nadditional assumption being introduced into the analysis. If the same assumption is\nintroduced into both theories, the Keynesian and loanable funds theories will yield\nthe same conclusions.\n\nIn short, the difference between the conclusions reached by Professor Robertson\nand Mrs. Robinson respectively results from a difference between the assumptions they\nmake. Mrs. Robinson assumes that the increase in the quantity of money has no\ninfluence, direct or indirect, on the marginal efficiency of capital: Professor Robertson\nassumes that the increase in the quantity of money indirectly produces a cumulative\nrise in the willingness of traders to borrow from the banks.\n\njust how this occurs is not made explicit in the argument under consideration,\nsince Professor Robertson does not offer his own explanation, but instead quotes two\nand a half sentences from Marshall. The Marshallian fragment, however, is not an\nexplanation but a declaration, since it merely states that the rise in the rate of interest\nis cumulative, without offering any reasons. Professor Robertson would have been\nbetter advised to advance his own explanation, or at least to have presented a more\nsatisfactory quotation from Marshall.\n\nX. KEYNES ON FISHER!\n\nIt seems fairly evident that, as Professor Robertson maintains, Keynes misunder-\nstood the mechanics of Fisher's argument ; this is the more surprising as Fisher's\ntheory is closely analogous to Wicksell's, and Keynes in the Treatise drew rather\nheavily on Wicksell's work. But it is difficult to see what sort of inhibition in Keynes'\nthought is implied by this misunderstanding.\n\n!

For the analysis of the problem under discussion, the\nRobertsonian concept is more clear-cut, since abstention from consuinption which is\nperformed in order to increase one's holding of cash implicitly includes an increase in\nliquidity-preference, which tends to complicate the analysis. The assertion criticised\nby Professor Robertson, that increased saving only reduces the rate of interest and\nstimulates investment \u00a3hrough reducing aggregate income, implicitly assumes that the\nincreased saving is being performed in order to build up cash balances\u2014i.e. it relies\non a hidden increase in liquidity preference. For the case in which an increase in saving\nis an increase in the demand for securities, it can easily be shown (e.g. by use of the\nfamiliar Hicksian 1S-LM diagram) that the reduction in income and employment\nwhich follows an increase in the propensity to save results, not from the increase in\nthe propensity to save as such, but from the fact of liquidity-preference, which partially\nprevents the increased desire to save from leading to increased investment.\n\nThe version of the sequence of events presented by Professor Robertson, however,\nis only one of a large number of possible dynamic sequences ; it assumes a one-period\nlag between the receipt and disposition of income, but no lags between reduced con-\nsumption and increased purchases of securities, between increased purchases of\nsecurities and increased issues by borrowers, and between increased issues and increased\nreal investment. It would seem to be more realistic to assume lags of some length in\nthe last three stages, in which case it would be true to say that the ultimate reduction\nof the rate of interest and stimulation of investment comes about /rough a. (transi-\ntional) reduction in income and employment. In any event, Professor Robertson's\ncriticism does not invalidate the main Keynesian point (with which he agrees) that,\ngiven liquidity preference, an increase in saving will reduce income and employment.\n\nIX. THE QUANTITY OF MONEY AND THE RATE OF INTEREST IN A\nCUMULATIVE PROCESS. (THE GIBSON PARADOX)!\n\nAny theoretical explanation of the fact that rising activity and rising interest\nrates generally go together must postulate that the incentive to invest is rising over\ntime. This assumption may be expressed in various ways, e.g. that the demand for.\nloanable funds is increasing, that the '' real\" or '' natural\"' rate of interest is rising\nso as to remain consistently above the '' money \"' rate of interest, or that the marginal\nefficiency of capitalis rising. If this assumption is not made, then an increase in the\nquantity of money cannot lead to a rise in the rate of interest above its previous level.\nThe most that can happen is that the rate of interest returns to its previous level, the\nsequence of events being as follows: the initial increase in the quantity of money\nleads to an initial reduction in the rate of interest ; this in turn stimulates investment\n(and possibly reduces the willingness to save); the resulting increase in effective\ndemand leads to a bidding up of prices, so that the increased quantity of money is\nabsorbed into transactions balances; and this goes on until the rate of interest rises\nto its previous level, at which point the stimulus to activity which resulted from the\nincrease in the quantity of money disappears. This sequence, however, will only occur\nunder conditions of '' full employment,\" defined as a condition in which any increase\nin effective demand leads to a cumulative rise in the prices of goods and factors of\nproduction. Under conditions of other than '' full employment \"' in this sense, on the\nother hand, the increased investment stimulated by the initial reduction of the rate\n\n!

                    "SOME CAMBRIDGE CONTROVERSIES IN MONETARY THEORY 97\n\nWhat Keynes actually argued was that, since individual saving from a given\nincome might rise or fall with the rate of interest, on balance aggregate saving from a\ngiven income is unlikely to be affected by the rate of interest. This implies that in\nequilibrium the rate of interest does influence individual saving as well as individual\nwillingness to hold idle balances; so that implicit in the Keynesian theory is the\nthree-fold marginal equivalence to which Professor Robertson refers. But since\nchanges in the rate of interest are assumed not to affect total saving from a given\ntotal income, this dependence of the rate of saving on the rate of interest is of purely\nformal significance, and does not affect the determination of the equilibrium income\nand rate of interest. If, in place of Keynes' argument, one were to argue that savers\nsave from habit or other non-interest-calculating motives (e.g. the Duesenberry theory)\nthen there would be no three-fold marginal equivalence of the rate of interest, the\nmarginal utility of not-consuming, and the marginal convenience of holding money ;\nthere would only be an equivalence of the marginal convenience of holding cash with\nthe rate of interest.\n\nHowever, the important issue between the Robertsonian and Keynesian theories\nis not over the question as to whether the rate of interest influences the level of saving ;\nsuch a relationship is explicitly introduced in most post-Keynes models of the General\nTheory. The fundamental issue is whether saving is sufficiently positively interest-\nelastic for saving from a full-employment income to be equal to investment at some\npositive rate of interest ; this question is discussed more fully in the last section of\nthese notes.\n\nVIII. INCREASED THRIFT AND THE RATE OF INTEREST!\n\nWhether Professor Robertson is right or wrong in his contention that Keynes\nbelieved that an increase in thrift would lower the rate of interest and promote an\nincrease in investment only under full employment conditions is a matter of opinion\non which it is hard to find convincing evidence one way or another. Keynes certainly\nmade statements in the General Theory which implied this view, but the formal logic\nof his theory shows that, whatever the state of employment, an increase in thrift will\ntend to reduce the rate of interest and so promote an increase in investment.\n\nThe steps of the analysis are as follows : a rise in the propensity to save means that\nin equilibrium income will be lower for any given volume of investment ; consequently\nmoney will be released from transactions balances to idle balances, and this will lower\nthe rate of interest (assuming that liquidity-preference is not infinitely interest-elastic) :\nthe fall in the rate of interest in turn will lead to an increase in the rate of investment\n(assuming that the marginal efficiency of capital is not completely interest-inelastic).\nThis particular controversy is therefore a dead issue.\n\nProfessor Robertson, however, disagrees with the Keynesians over the causal\nsequence by which the act of thrift lowers the rate of interest. Specifically, he claims\nthat it is misleading to say that an increase in thrift lowers the rate of interest t/yrough\nlowering total incomes ; rather, he argues, the increase in thrift lowers the rate of\ninterest directly, through swelling the demand for securities, thus raising their prices\nand.lowering the rate of interest: the fall in the rate of interest induces people to hold\nlarger idle balances, so that the money put onto the securities market by the increase\nin thrift does not all find its way out again in the form of increased investment ; invest-\nment is less than saving and income falls as a result.\n\nProfessor Robertson's criticism of ' the Keynesian version \"' is logically perfectly\nsound, once it is realised that his concept of \" thrift \" (which is nowhere explicitly\n\n!

                    "96 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\ntwo assumptions, creation only of idle money and the absence of idle money in equili-\nbrium, are not inconsistent. The notion that they are would seem to spring from the\ndynamic nature of Professor Robertson's approach, which apparently leads him to\ninterpret '' zero idle money \" to mean that idle money can never exist, even moment-\narily. On that interpretation the two assumptions would be inconsistent; but it\nseems obvious from the static nature of the Keynesian theory that Keynes was thinking\nonly of the equilibrium positions before and after the increase in the quantity of\nmoney, and on this interpretation no inconsistency arises.\n\nProfessor Robertson's arguments on this score also reveal a difference of assump-\ntion between Keynes and Robertson as to how new money comes into existence.\nKeynes assumes that new money is created by the purchase of securities by banks\n(particularly the central bank), which means that the banks are giving the public\ndeposits in exchange for some of its holdings of existing securities. As a result, the\npublic is left with an increased stock of money and a decreased stock of securities ;\nnew money is therefore in its origins an addition to the stock of money held as an\nasset, ie. a contribution to idle balances. Professor Robertson, on the other hand,\nassumes that new money is commonly created through increased lending by banks to\nbusinesses to meet increased working capital requirements ; new money therefore\noriginates as an increase in active balances, in response to an increased demand for\ncapital.\n\nF The difference is an important one (see section IX below, on '' The Gibson Para-\ndox \"). It is partly explained by the fact that Keynes is thinking in terms of monetary\npolicy, operating in a framework in which it is assumed that the willingness to consume\nand to invest is given ; Professor Robertson is thinking of normal commercial banking\noperations, responding to an increased demand for capital. On a more general level,\nthe Keynesian theory assumes that bank-financed investment is not an independent\nsource of economic change, whereas the Robertsonian version assumes that it may be.\nPart of this difference of opinion is doubtless a difference in the situations which the\nrespective authors have in mind, Keynes thinking almost exclusively of the 1930s\nand Professor Robertson thinking more of the history of industrial fluctuations; part\nof it is a difference of opinion over the importance of bank-financed investment as an\nindependent variable. The latter difference is a question of fact, to which the answer\nmay be different for difference historical periods.\n\nVIL. THE THREE-FOLD MARGIN!\n\nProfessor Robertson is quite right in arguing that the proposition that the rate\nof interest governs the desire to hold idle money is not inconsistent with the\nproposition that the rate of interest may also govern saving.\n\nIf saving does depend in some way on the rate of interest as well as on the level\nof income, however, this dependence can very easily be introduced into the Keynesian\ntheory. It merely means that instead of one propensity to consume (or to save) there\nwill be one for each rate of interest: and the relation between saving and interest\nwill have an influence on the determination of the equilibrium levels of income and the\nrate of interest. When income is in equilibrium, the rate of interest will not only\nequate the demand for money at that level of income with the existing stock of money,\nbut will also equate the rate of investment with the saving that the community is\nwilling to do from that income at that rate of interest. Nor does it matter, within the\nlimits stated by Professor Robertson, whether saving is assumed to rise or fall as the\nrate of interest rises.\n\n1 Robertson, op. cit., pp. 16-8.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:46:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "SOME CAMBRIDGE CONTROVERSIES IN MONETARY THEORY 95\n\nand prices are usually, in fact, associated with rising rates of interest,\" is also irrelevant.\nKeynes is describing a logical system in which it is assumed that the propensity to\nconsume and the marginal efficiency of capital are given: on the first assumption,\nincome will only be higher if the level of investment is higher ; on the second assump-\ntion, investment will only be higher if the rate of interest is lower. Consequently a\nhigher level of income is necessarily associated with a lower rate of interest. Professor\nRobertson is referring to a historical situation in which the quantity of money is\nrigid or sticky and income is rising as a result of a rise in the marginal efficiency of\ncapital or the propensity to consume. On these assumptions, the Keynesian theory\nwould also show rising output and prices associated with rising rates of interest. The\ndifference of assumptions is the key to the solution of this particular disagreement ;\nthe same difference of assumptions reappears in the controversy over the relation\nbetween the quantity of money and the rate of interest (fra, section IX).\n\nV. THE CONFUSED STATEMENT FROM THE GENERAL THEORY, p. 165!\n\nProfessor Robertson is entirely justified in denouncing Keynes' statement that\n* the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital may be said to govern the terms\non which loanable funds are demanded for the purpose of new investment; whilst\nthe rate of interest governs the terms on which funds are being currently supplied.\"'\n\nThe sentence seems to assume that the rate of interest is fixed by the quantity\nof money in conjunction with liquidity preference, independently of the level of invest-\nment ; in fact, the rate of interest in the Keynesian theory depends on the quantity\nof money in conjunction with boh liquidity preference and the level of income, and\nthe latter in turn depends on the level of investment as determined by the marginal\nefficiency of capital and the rate of interest. It is, therefore, not possible to analyse\nthe determination of investment in the Keynesian theory in the way implied by the\nsentence, since the rate of interest is not determined independently of the level of\ninvestment. Most of Keynes' chapter 14 is rather confusing for this sort of reason ;\nthe subject is more easily understood with the help of the Hicksian IS-LM diagram.\n\nVI. THE ALLEGED INCONSISTENCY IN THE SCHEME OF THE GENERAL\nTHEORY?\n\nThe inconsistency in the scheme of the General Theory consists, according to\nProfessor Robertson, in the fact that in the theory the banks can only operate by\nincreasing \"idle money \" ; but that on certain pages Keynes assumes that, even if\n* jdle money \"' is zero, total money can be increased and the rate of interest pushed\ndown. This alleged inconsistency turns out on inspection to be groundless. If the\ndemand for idle money is nil, then one of the characteristics of all positions of ultimate\nequilibrium is that the stock of idle money will be nil; but, even if the banks are\nrestricted to creating idle money (e.g. by purchasing securities), this does not mean\nthat they are powerless to increase the quantity of money, as Professor Robertson's\nargument would imply. The effect of such purchases of securities would be initially\nto create idle money, whose holders would immediately seek to reinvest in securities ;\nthe result would be to drive up the prices of securities, and drive down the rate of\ninterest to the point at which the increased investment induced by the lower interest\nrate raised the level of income sufficiently to absorb the unwanted idle money into\nactive balances. In the new position of equilibrium, idle money would again be zero ;\nbut the rate of interest would be lower and the level of income would be higher. The\n\n1 Robertson, op. cit., p. 11.\n?

When (1) was reprinted in\nReadings in Theovy of International Trade (1948), Stolper and I omitted the second complete sentence of\np. 59 because we discovered that we had stubbed our toes in the manner attributed to Ellsworth in (2).\nThe surrounding sentences we recognised to be inexact but we let them stand because they correctly portray\nthe Ohlin-Heckscher view. The bracketed sentence added by me on p. 355 of the 1948 reprinting is too\nsweeping and unqualified.

In (3), p. 193, the statement that almost equal factor intensities makes for uniform cost ratios and\nreduces the need for trade is correct; but the possible implication, that this fails to impair the Ohlin-\nHeckscher point that goods mobility is an effective compensation for factor mobility, is false. To ensure\nthat the equations on p. 188 of (3) have a single solution, the second footnote should have added to it the\nhypothesis that a diagonal element of A is one signed ; see Meade, op. cit., p. 133, fn. r, for my restatement\nto meet this point. The possibility of increasing marginal productivity mentioned on (3)'s p. 196 and\nfootnote can be ruled out if we are willing to make the '' additivity assumption \" of linear programming.\nThe important empirical issue of identical production functions seems in no need of expansion; the\nempirically less important, but logically interesting, case of changing factor intensities seems worthy of\nstress to theorists.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:47:50 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

But whether the fractionalisation of the firm's\nmarket is extensive or intensive the end result is the same.\n\no, o 0j 0,\n\nOUTPUT\nFig. 3\nThe divergence of the demand curve from the average revenue curve is not con-\nfined to this special case. It would follow in the first and more general case that only\nin the rare circumstances where the elasticity of demand was uniform in all of the\nfirm's markets, i.e. where the percentage of profit on price or standard cost was the\nsame, would there be any identity between the average revenue curve of the firm\nand its demand.curve, however conceived.!\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe foregoing analysis should suggest that price discrimination and multiple-\nproduct production are not exceptions to general practice, but are rather the essence\nof customary action. The distinction between a producer selling a single product at\ndifferent prices and one selling different products in varying markets at differing\npercentages of profit is a distinction of degree only. What a firm has to sell is not a\nproduct, but rather its capacity to produce. In so far as firms are motivated by the\nmarginal principle, there is a tendency to push production towards the point where\nmarginal cost is equal to demand price for the least profitable unit produced. In this\nmanner \"' capacity \" operation is achieved. The limits to the process are institutional\nrather than theoretical. Under conditions of monopolistic competition this probably\nresults in a situation where only normal profits are obtained. Whatever the amount\nof profit, it is obtained only by constant manipulation of the price and product line.\nThe theory of price discrimination must be viewed as the heart of price-cost theory\nrather than a peripheral case. The firm that does not discriminate in its pricing policy,\nor differentiate in its product line, or invade new markets, dies in the competitive\nstruggle\u2014and '' business management does not commit suicide.\"\n\nCollege Park, Maryland. Eri W. CLEMENS.\n\n1 Tt is extremely questionable whether the ordinary concept of '' the demand curve of the firm \" can\nbe applied at all in the real world of multiple-product firms. In this instance it is assumed to be the same\nas Joan Robinson's aggregate demand curve (in terms of standard units) which is obtained by adding the\nvarious demand curves horizontally.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:50:04 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In order to obtain\na geometric solution in this case, one would have to move in a counter-clockwise\ndirection, or, alternatively, interchange dependent for independent variables in the\noriginal set of equations.

The\ntransactions function, equation (e), says that the portion of the money supply devoted\nto transactions is determined by the level of income. An increase in spending, or\nincome flow, is a manifestation of an increase in activity and, hence, involves an\nexpansion in the community's requirements of money for transactions. The linearity\nof this function and its zero intercept mean that the velocity of active balances is\nassumed to be invariant with respect to income. An increase in the slope of the function\nimplies an increase in this velocity of circulation. In addition, the shape of the trans-\nactions function is affected by the community's credit structure and system of pay-\nments.\n\nThe liquidity function, equation (f), shows that the rate of interest is determined\nby the schedule of liquidity preference and the quantity of money held as an asset.\nAt a low rate of interest, the liquidity function becomes perfectly elastic,! portraying\nthe tendency for the rate of interest to be rigid downward at low levels. The shape of\nthis function reflects the community's preferences with respect to the risk and incon-\nvenience which accompany illiquidity as compared with the cost of maintaining\nliquidity. Any change in the community's expectations as to the prices of assets other\nthan cash will also affect the shape of the function.\n\nIt is assumed throughout that the prices of commodities and services are constant,\nperfect competition reigns in all markets, the stock of capital is quite large relatively\nto its annual increment, and that the rate of technological change is zero.

The variables are Y, C, 7, R, M, and M;.\nY is the aggregate flow in income during a specific period. C represents aggregate\nexpenditures by the private sector of the community on consumer goods and services.\nI represents net expenditures by the private sector of the community on investment\ngoods. R, the rate of interest, symbolises the structure of interest rates rather than\n\" the \" rate of interest.? M, stands for that portion of the money supply held for the\npurpose of satisfying the transactions and precautionary motives. M, represents\nmoney held as an asset\u2014that is, to satisfy the speculative motive.\n\nThe parameters of the model are \u00bb and g, representing the quantity of money and\ngovernment expenditures on goods and services, respectively. These parameters are,\nconsequently, exogenous to the private economy. Changes in the parameters indicate\nintervention by the government through monetary and fiscal policy.\n\nThe system of equations which connect and determine the six variables is :\n\n(a) Y-\u2014CcI-c-g\n\n(b m-\u2014M,r-M,\n\n(6) C-F(Y)\n\n()  I\u2014E(R)\n\n(6) M,\u2014T(Y)\nR \u2014 L(Mj).\n\nEquation (a) states that aggregate income is composed of consumption and invest-\nment expenditures on the part of the private economy plus total government expendi-\ntures on goods and services.? Equation (b) gives us the Keynesian classification of\nmoney balances.\n\nThe consumption function, equation (c), is a schedule of consumption expenditures\nat various levels of income, where O \u2014 dC/dY \u2014 r. The shape of the consumption\nfunction depends upon a host of other variables assumed to be constants in the model.\nThese constants include: the community's attitude toward thrift; expectations\nregarding prices, the supply of consumer goods, and the level and certainty of income;\nthe tax structure ; the social security system ; the distribution of income and wealth,\nand the form in which wealth is held ; population size and distribution ; the extent\nof foreign trade ; corporate dividend policy ; education; and advertising.\n\nEquation (d) is the investment demand function, or the schedule of the marginal\nefficiency of capital. This function shows the relation between R and 7. That is, given\nthe schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital, the rate of interest determines the\nrate of investment. Other variables, for our purposes assumed to remain constant,\nwhich determine the shape of this function include: entrepreneurial anticipations\nwith respect to market demand, the algebraic rate of change in the level of income,*\nthe community's stock of capital, the rate of innovation, the marginal physical pro-\nductivity of capital goods, and the tax structure.\n\n1'* Investment \"' in the sense of an addition to real capital should be distinguished from '' investment \"\nin popular usage which includes the purchase of securities and existing real assets.\n\n* It would perhaps be more realistic to treat R as an index of the availability of capital rather than as\na structure of posted interest rates.\n\n3 Since taxes have not been introduced explicitly, government expenditures are financed by borrowing\n\nor by printing paper money. Hence a change in g may effect a change in s.\n1 It follows that the acceleration principle appears only implicitly in the model.\n\n12\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:50:31 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

It follows that, with regard to their respective\nsystems of units, G and H have the same corresponding elasticities. Now the physical\nnumber pattern of G may be obtained from that of H merely by altering the system\nof units. But elasticities are invariant with respect to changes in the system of units.\nHence the basic properties of a system of production of this type, as described by its\nelasticities, are uniquely determined by the relative value pattern of all outputs. This\ntour de force permits Leontief to employ a system of units based on the quantity bought\nby one dollar at date zero.!\n\n9. In conclusion, it may be pointed out that Professor Leontief has hitherto been\nforced to aggregate '' industries \" into a very few groups indeed.? While this is no\ncriticism of the theoretical schema, it is to be expected that the values of the elasticities\nobtained were appreciably affected.?\n\nIn the articles published since the epoch-making '' Structure \", Professor Leontief\nhas manipulated his system in various ways\u2014including the separation of wage and\nprofit incomes.

If the very rough hypothetical figures for c which we have used may be\nconsidered as reasonable, a high optimum tariff would be justified only in those\ninstances where the foreign elasticity of demand for a country's exports is so small\nthat the increase in foreign exchange which can be obtained from increased exports\nbecomes negligible. In those instances the terms of trade argument for a tariff, or the\nterms of trade argument for over-valuation of a currency plus restrictions on imports,\nor the terms of trade argument against depreciation, merges into the argument that\nthe foreign currency receipts cannot be significantly increased by a moderate degree\nof depreciation. The validity of this argument hinges, of course, primarily on the\nnumerical value of 7p, \u00e0 question on which, unfortunately, we know far too little.\n\nWashington, D.C. J. J.

A similar pattern, although at a generally higher\nlevel, prevailed with regard to strawberries (see Table IV). In both cases the price\nelasticity was apparently higher at the beginning of the season than at its end. While\naccording to Table I annual price elasticities exceeded seasonal ones, there are some\nweekly elasticities which exceed the seasonal and annual values.\n\nThe question arises how to explain this pattern of weekly price elasticities. A\ntentative and, at best, partial explanation may be offered. It appears that the pattern\nof price elasticity changes closely resembles that of seasonal price changes of many\nperishable fruits and vegetables. The latter can be explained in terms of changes in\nthe supply; availability of effective (technical as well as economic) substitutes ;\nseasonal demand, etc. One may consider supply variation as the most important\nsingle factor. Early in the season most products are offered in small amounts, which\nincrease as the season proceeds only to decrease at its end. The price pattern is inverse.\nThe seasons of most fresh fruits and vegetables begin a few weeks apart, each one\nhaving a similar supply and price pattern. Thus, when early in the season a product\nreaches the market in small quantities and its price is high, it faces numerous effective\nsubstitutes in the form of other fruits or vegetables whose season had started earlier\nand which now are in larger supply and sell for relatively low prices. A similar argu-\nment can be used with regard to the end of the season, the only difference being that\nthe competition comes from products whose season started later than that under\nconsideration. With regard to the price elasticity during the mid-season, one could\nargue that the product's relatively large supply and low price keeps the number of\neffective substitutes to a minimum.\n\nIn summary, most commodities for which empirical demand analyses could be\nprocured, are inelastic in demand. In many instances the high (or low) price elasticities\nappear to go hand in hand with the availability of good (or poor) substitutes. However,\nsubstitutability alone does not appear to offer a sufficient explanation. The price\nelasticity of demand of the same product is higher, the closer the selling stage to the\nultimate consumer. Storability appears to have little effect on price elasticity. The\nfew industrial goods for which demand analyses are available are all highly inelastic.\nOf the farm products, most staples have inelastic demands while many fresh perishable\nfruits have elastic ones. The relation between the price elasticity of a whole product\nor group of products and part thereof appears quite complicated and requires more\nevidence before conclusions can be reached. The weekly demand elasticity of perishable\nproducts in seasonal supply is relatively high at the start of the season, then declines\nas the season progresses, and finally increases during its later part.\n\nJerusalem.

The supply of such funds will presumably be highly elastic at a contango rate\nslightly above the rate (per fortnightly settlement period) charged by the banks for\nshort loans to the Stock Exchange. Because of this high elasticity the rate charged by\nthe banks appears to set a maximum to contango rate.\n\nIt is also possible for bear carry-over to exceed bull carry-over since money may\nbe borrowed in return for payment of contango (or for receipt of backwardation), i.e.\nshares may be given on, not only by bulls, but also directly by others (mainly jobbers)\nwho are long of shares.? They will presumably be prepared to do this, not only if there\nis a backwardation, but also if contango rate is somewhat below the rate (per fort-\nnightly account period) on loans to the Stock Exchange. It follows that an excess of\nbear carry-over against bull carry-over does not necessarily involve a backwardation\nand thus that the existence of a contango does ^oi necessarily mean an excess of bull\ncarry-over. On the other hand, a backwardation does necessarily mean an excess of\nbear carry-over and probably also an excess of bears over al] bulls, since most bulls\nwill find it profitable to carry-over when there is a backwardation.\n\nBear carry-over can only exceed bull carry-over by a limited amount equal to\nthe maximum number of shares that those with shares will give on, while bull carry-\nover can exceed bear carry-over to a very great extent since money can be attracted\ninto the market from outside. Consequently, while there is the fairly low and definite\nupper limit to contango mentioned above, there is no such limit to backwardation\nwhich may rise to extreme heights if the bears cannot cover themselves easily by\nreversing their transactions. A high backwardation will be accompanied by a rise in\nshare prices at the end of the period, for the covering purchases by bears will send up\nprices which they had themselves depressed earlier by their sales.\n\nLondon.

One factor which will make for flat individual\ncurves is a large capital (so that v increases relatively slowly with size of commitment).\nThis and the first condition mentioned above can be included together as a large\ntotal capital of all speculators together. Another factor which will make for flat\nindividual curves is a small dependence of P^; , upon P;, and a small and slowly\nincreasing 7 due to low uncertainty in those expectations. Finally, differing heights\nof individual curves may be caused by differences in price expectations. Thus, in\nsummary, we can say that the total speculative demand curve will be flatter and lie\nfurther to the right as :\n\n(r) The total capital of all speculators is greater.\n\n(2) The supply-demand curve of short-term loans to/from the Stock Exchange\nis lower and flatter and speculators consider the bond market less profitable.\n\n(3) Expectations are less affected by short-run movements in share prices.\n\n(4) Expectations are held with a higher degree of confidence.\n\n) The degree of unanimity among speculators is greater.\nIt is unlikely that the curve will remain unchanged from one period to the next,\nfor any of the following will alter it :\n\n(ri) A change in conditions in the money market.\n\n(2) A different price expected for the next period or an altered degree of\nuncertainty.\n\n(3) A different shareholding at the beginning of the current period.\n\nIII.\n\n\u00c0 buyer who, instead of paying and receiving delivery when the settlement\ncomes at the end of the fortnightly account period, makes arrangements to postpone\npayment and delivery until the following settlement is said to carry-over.

Similarly, a seller is said to carry-over if he makes arrangements\nto postpone making delivery of and receiving payment for the shares he has sold.\nThus in effect he is lending money, and for this he receives contango. \u00c0 negative\ncontango rate is called a backwardation.\n\nThe factors which determine the total holding of bulls have been listed in\nSection II.

In doing this we must remember that\nchanges in P; will affect the value of 7 corresponding to any given shareholding (with\na given P^; | ,) in two ways. Firstly, such changes alter the value of that number of\nshares, and thus the size of commitment, and, secondly, if part of the speculator's\nassets was held in the form of shares to begin with, price changes will alter his wealth,\nwhich also will affect \u00bb.! This latter point means that the number of shares a bull\ndesires to hold at any given price depends partly on the number he already has and\nsimilarly for the bear, his short position being a liability. In spite of these two com-\nplications, however, the demand schedule is still determinate, given the composition\nof the speculator's initial asset holding as well as its total and the other factors men-\ntioned above. The schedule will have a discontinuity at a shareholding of zero, i.e.\nthere will be a range of prices at which the speculator will be neither bull nor bear.\n\nWe must now consider two complications concerning the anticipated price, P^; |. ,.\nThe first is the question of whether only the price expected for the period immediately\nfollowing is relevant. Suppose, for example, that price is expected to rise, but not\nuntil 2 4- 2. Since the speculator can make a gain whether he buys shares now (/) or\nin Z 4- rz, which of these two alternatives he chooses depends on the net advantages of\nholding the shares over the time up to the end of \u00a3 J- 1. So P^; , , alone is relevant\nto what he does in 4. This assumes that the speculator thinks he knows when price\nwillrise. If he does not he will act as 7f he expects it to rise next period.\n\nThe second complication is that anticipated future price may not be independent\nof current price, P;.? Here we may usefully distinguish two types of speculative\nexpectation. Firstly, that which is based on market movements and may change\nfrom period to period. In this case we may expect P^; .. , to move in the same direction\nas P;, and the speculator's demand curve will be steeper than if his expectations are\nof the second type: based more on external factors (such as dividend prospects), so\nthat movements in the current price have no effect on his P^;\n\nThe aggregative speculative demand schedule cannot be obtained by simple\nsummation of the individual schedules because ceteris paribus the holding of any\nindividual speculator will change if 7 changes, and whether this be contango rate or\nthe rate on short-term loans it is not independent of total speculative commitments.\nBut if the supply-demand schedule of short-term loans to/from speculators is given\nthere will be a determinate aggregate demand schedule for shares and a determinate\n\nl'This point is made in terms of the liquidity preference curve by Kragh in his ''Two Liquidity\n\nFunctions and the Rate of Interest : 4 Simple Model\" (REviEW or Ecowouirc Srupres, Vol. XVII, No. 2).\n\n?

                    "Ihe Speculative Demand for Securities\nand Carty-Over\n\nI.\n\nNearly all writers on interest theory, whether they favour a stock approach or a\nflow approach, seem now to be agreed that the demand for securities of speculators\nmust be included in any analysis of the formation of interest rates. There is perhaps\na smaller degree of agreement as to whether analysis in terms of the demand and\nsupply of money is permissible. This latter problem boils down to the question of what\nassumptions are made. If bonds and money are the only assets held by wealth-owners\nand if the aggregate demand for both goods and factor services equals their aggregate\nsupply, then any excess demand for money must reflect an equal and opposite excess\nsupply of bonds. In such circumstances, we can say indifferently that the bond-rate\nof interest is determined by the demand and supply of money or by the demand\nand supply of bonds. An analysis restricted by such assumptions can, however, only\nbe a first approximation. Where we wish to consider, say, shares and short-loans as\nwell as bonds and money, discussion of the price-formation of any of the first three\nis best carried out in terms of the demand and supply of the asset in question.\n\nNo analysis of speculative demand can be satisfactory unless the existence of a\nmoney-market is assumed. Only if short-loans to the Stock Exchange exist can the\nactivities of bull speculators be adequately included, since if there is no short borrowing\na speculator's money balance can only be positive and never negative, thus making\nthe analysis asymmetrical. Granted this, the case is made for analysing the price of any\nsecurity in terms of its demand and supply.\n\nThis paper is concerned with only one type of demand, speculative demand.\nFirstly, an attempt is made to restate the main determinants of the position and shape\nof the stock speculative demand curve for shares which, as this is a second approxima-\ntion only, are assumed to be homogeneous. Secondly, having assumed carry-over\nfacilities to exist for share transactions, an analysis is given of the determination of\nthe contango (or backwardation) rate.!\n\nII.\n\nTo start with we must explain the meaning given in this paper to the term\nspeculator. As Dr. Wilson? has pointed out, Keynes' \" speculators who are trying to\nbeat the gun are a very different type from Mr. Kaldor's careful arithmeticians with\ntheir eyes fixed on the relationship between expected short-term rates and the yield\non high-grade bonds.\" Here we shall define a speculator as a person or institution\nwhose security transactions are made largely in order to secure short-run capital gains.\nThis is nearer to the Keynesian type than to Mr. Kaldor's.\n\nBy the stock demand curve or schedule of a speculator we mean the curve or\nschedule relating the number of shares he wishes to hold at the end of the current\n\n1! Much of the analysis is based on Mr. Kaldor's '' Speculation and Economic Stability \" (REvrgWw or\nEconouirc SrupiEs, October, 1939), though there is the important difference that his equations seem to\nrelate to the market as a whole, whereas my equations relate to an individual speculator and no unanimity\nis assumed.

It lies rather in the fact that the political unpalatability\nof significant decreases in government spending is matched only by that associated\nwith meaningful increases in tax rates. The crucial aspects do not rely upon the too\nexclusive use of one particular method, but upon the popularity of moderate inflation\nresulting in the failure to employ any effective alternative.\n\nMichigan.

Macro-\nanalysis tends to obliterate many significant interrelationships : in the words of Arthur F. Burns, '' the\nturbulent life that goes on within the aggregates \" is glossed over. Some form of aggregative approach is\nusually the fount out of which stability creating fiscal recommendation flow, and yet the hoped-for results\ncan hardly be more accurate than the theoretical analysis upon which they are based. For instance, the\ninternal structure of government expenditure and taxation\u2014their composition\u2014vwill be an important\nmatter. Various types of taxes will have varying effects upon consumption and investment decisions and\n\u00a3overnment expenditure will have effects in part dependent upon the specific channels into which it is\n\nirected.\n\nIn addition the existence of leads and lags within the structure of the price and quantity components\nof consumption and investment can hardly fail to affect the results. A static theory concentrating upon\neventual equilibrium positions is not adequate to deal with the process of change. In a very real sense,\ntherefore, the above is no more than a first approximation to policy, its main value resting in the broad\ntendencies and principles elucidated rather than in the quantitative refinements of detail. The fact that the\npurpose of this paper is quite restricted, with limitations of space prohibiting discussion of these factors,\nShould not be taken to imply unawareness of their presence. Considerations regarding forecasting difficulties,\ntiming, and flexibility reinforce the view that fiscal policy alone can hardly maintain stability, assuming\nsuch to be the goal. For an able presentation of these problems, cf. Albert G. Hart, '* Model Building and\nFiscal Policy,\" American Economic Review, Vol. XXXV, No. 4 (September, 1945), pp. 531-58.\n\nThe particular models above, finally, are not meant to represent the detailed complexity of the real\nworld. In addition to the assumptions of a linear net tax withdrawal function, constant investment, no net\ncorporate savings, a closed non-war economy and a stable consumption function (which depends only upon\ndisposable income), others do equal damage to reality. Thus it is implied that output is of unit elasticity\nwith respect to effective demand up to full employment, from which point the elasticity of the price level\nwith respect to effective demand becomes unity. The existence of bottleneck areas is likely to raise prices\nlong before '' full employment \"' is realised. On this cf. the still fresh discussion of L. M. Lachmann, '' Invest-\nment and Costs of Production,\" American Economic Review, Vol. XXVIII, No. 3 (September, 1938),\npp. 469-81.\n\n?

To demonstrate that interest was a reward for the act of saving, rather than an\nincome in the nature of a surplus, it was necessary, first, to discover some aspect of\nthe saving process which could plausibly be presented as involving a real cost or\nsacrifice on the part of the saver, and, second, to posit a direct functional relationship\nbetween the volume of saving and the rate of interest. It is sometimes assumed by\nhistorians that the idea of a functional connection between the supply of capital and\nits return (involving the recognition of a real cost lying behind accumulation) was a\nnecessary element in the Ricardian theory of equilibrium.! This does not appear to me\nto have been the case : the idea was not, in fact, developed until it was found desirable\nto stress the existence of such a cost.\n\nThe tendency to think of saving as a function of the rate of interest, then, may at\nleast in its origin have been associated with the desire to show, first, that the economic\nsystem was fundamentally stable, and, second, that it was not founded on the exploita-\ntion of the labourer. But one other factor of some importance intensified the tendency,\nand was largely responsible for the failure of orthodox economics to exorcise it before\n1936. Professor Myint has recently drawn attention to the significant difference\nbetween the economic problem with which the Classical economists were concerned,\nand that with which we are mainly concerned to-day.? The Classical economists were\nchiefly interested in the problem of zncreasing the wealth of the nation\u2014in securing\nabundance. Modern economists, on the other hand (at least since the 1870's), have\nbecome interested primarily in the problem of allocating a. given pool of resources as\n*' efficiently \" as possible\u2014in making the best of scarcity.? Now, for obvious reasons,\nthe idea that saving should be regarded as a function of the rate of interest has usually\nbeen associated with theories which think in terms of the amount saved out of a given\nincome. The idea that saving should be regarded as a function of income, on the\nother hand, has usually been stressed by economists who were mainly interested in the\ncauses of variations in income. The transfer of attention from the Classical to the\nmodern economic problem, then, meant that the Classical concept of saving as a\nfunction of income, upon which Joplin built his analysis in the Owilines, began to\nappear, not only as inferior to its successor from an apologetic point of view, but also\nas actually irrelevant.\n\nGlasgow.

This may\nbe considered the limiting case of a model with a labour market wholly insensitive to\nmarket forces. At the other extreme may be postulated a Walrasian model of a purely\ncompetitive labour and resource market which would yield a set of factoral prices and\nincomes untouched by the influence of social power. One could start with the Marxian\nversion and re-work by including elements from the Walrasian version ; or contrari-\nwise, more insight might be achieved by commencing with the Walrasian version as\nthe most general case subsequently modified by intrusion of the specific Marxian\nlabour market with its distortionary effects, its open-ended areas, and the element of\nclass struggle which it provides.\n\nThe Marxian analysis of the social power patterning of the working process within\ncapitalist enterprise and of the productive and distributive process of the capitalist\neconomy comprises one of the many focal centres of interest for modern theory in the\nMarxian corpus. Though this patterning was elucidated in the setting of the Mehrwert\napproach there is no logical connection between the two. Whether income be rigidly\ndichotomised or differentiated into many fluid groupings would be relatively indifferent\nto the question of the social power patterning of workshop behaviour in all its dimen-\nsions and of the functioning of the labour market generally.\n\nThus the continued adequacy for purposes of present-day social and economic\ntheory of the Marxian Mehrwert approach and concept of pure capitalism remains a\nhighly dubious one. Its primary field of application\u2014that of the elucidation of exposure,\nboth of exploitation and of the ideological mystification involved in a vulgar bourgeois\nideology\u2014has to a very great extent been outmoded by the transformation in social\nideology and popular mentality on the one hand and by the far-reaching permeation\non the other hand of anti-bourgeois outlook into the thought-categories of current\nsocial science. The very subject matter of analysis has been thoroughly transformed in\nmany crucial aspects involving the formation of new institutional Gestalt patterns.\nTo be sure the Marxian organon retains its full measure of logical validity and analytical\ncoherence vis-\u00e0-vis its subject matter and with given purposes in view. \"We found the\norganon to be only slightly dependent upon the labour value theorem whose presence\nor modification would not occasion significant logical disturbances and constituted a\nsource of not unfruitful insight.\n\nYet our paper has not suggested that the Marxian organon can simply be neglected.\nIf our theory had developed in keeping with the development of its materials, the\nMarxian organon would have been fully assimilated into a body of workable theory\nand knowledge differentiated into more complex and revealing patterns than either its\nprecursors or raw materials. Only a person with a live sense of humour would suggest\nthat this has been the case. We have innumerable beginnings but few completions ;\nwe have a vastly enriched body of materials but more discordance; we have a pro-\nliferation of departmental enquiries with impoverished integration as social study with\na socio-economic core. So long as this is the case both the Marxian Mehrwert concept\nand analysis of capitalism can be neglected only at one's peril. From Marx, too, one\ncan derive not only an elucidation of a phase of capitalist development, but an analytic\nmethod rich with fruitful possibilities: the art of abstraction to isolate essential\nreality, deliberate integration of psychological-social-economic foci of interest into\nunified logical structures, the disclosure of a developing complexus of activity.\n\nCambridge, Mass.

This is in fact what\ntranspired in the earlier discussion of Lange's definition.\n\nWhat Mr. Ichimura has shown is that there is more to it than that. This looseness\nor unfirmness only holds with respect to the original relation between changes in\nmarginal valuations\u2014which is a matter, in terms of the distinctions made in the\npreceding paragraph of this note, of the movement from situation 7 to situation I7;\nComplementarity and competitiveness are not a matter of that movement; they are\nconcerned with the movement from situation /7 to situation 777. Here it is much\nmore reasonable to expect that we shall find the firmness we seek. We are digging\ndown nearer to the level at which we have to say : '' If, for whatever reason, I want\nmore 4A, I shall want more B too.\" But we can never quite get to that level, for it is\npossible that the reason for which I want more A, may be such that it carries with it\na diminished demand for B. That special case cannot be ruled out.\n\nIt is not surprising that variations in prices, being general, unbiassed sorts of\nthings, not tied up with particular reasons, should dig down as near to this level as\nwe are likely to get. That is, I think, the fundamental meaning behind Mr. Ichimura's\ntheorem.\n\nThe careful reader will have noticed that the movement from II to III always\nrelates to the system of wants which exists affer the change in wants has taken place,\nand that therefore it is not the same system which exists after one initial change\n(J to II) as would exist after an initial change which had been different. Thus it is\nnot inevitable that complementarity of X and Y with respect to one parameter should\nimply complementarity with respect to another. Certainly there is a lack of firmness\nfrom this cause; but if the change in wants is not too great, it seems fair to say that\nthis difficulty is comparable with the difficulty which persists in the case of price-\nchanges with given wants (when there is a movement from one part of a given indiffer-\nence-map to another). We can therefore accept the conclusion that Ichimura-related-\nness and indifference-relatedness are identical in more than the formal sense; they\ndo both represent something which we can expect to use as a fairly firm classification\nof consumers' behaviour.\n\nOxford. ].

MEADE'S THEORY OF COMPETITIVE SPECULATION 189\n\nIn the presence of organised commodity speculation utilising a futures market, a\nspecialisation of function occurs in which the purely speculative functions of price-\nappraisal and of risk-taking are divorced from the physical holding of stocks. The\nspeculator deals in contracts for future delivery and, in the pure case, never handles\nthe actual commodity ; he carries no physical stocks which might produce a con-\nvenience yield, nor does the nature of his business permit gaining a convenience yield\nif he did hold stocks ; he has no costs of holding except commissions for executing the\nfutures contracts, and interest on the required ' margin \" to guarantee his financial\nresponsibility, and these costs do not '' increase \"' as is necessary for emergence of a\n'\"' speculators' surplus.\" The physical holding of stocks, in this situation, is left to\nhedgers, and it is the hedgers who benefit from the '' surplus \" that Mr. Meade finds\naccruing in the presence of speculative holding.\n\nApart from this divorcement of functions, and consequent separation of the\nrecipients of speculative profit (or loss) from the recipients of holders' surplus,\nspeculation through a futures market may produce the same effects as speculation\nthat involves physical holding of the commodity by the speculator. If the effects are\ndifferent, it is because in the presence of a futures market the pure speculation is to a\nconsiderable extent done by different people, and because the holders of physical\nstocks act under the guidance of a rather accurately known prospective return for\nholding, instead of having to be guided only by their appraisals of prospective price\nchange.1\n\nApart from the need for this supplementary observation, I find Mr. Meade's\nanalysis and conclusions penetrating and sound in theory, and highly pertinent to the\nreal world. As applied to organised commodity speculation, the assumptions conform\nwell with reality except as regards their neglect of the separation that then occurs\nbetween speculation and the physical holding of stocks; and the conclusions are\nreadily modified to conform to that situation.\n\nIt is interesting to observe in passing that statistical studies indicate that in\nmarkets where futures trading has been prominent, the general conditions of perfect\ncompetitive speculation have been closely approximated. As regards wheat in the\nUnited States, which historically has been the great holder of the excess stocks in\ntimes of world wheat surplus,? the tendency seems to have been slightly on the side\nof somewhat excessive willingness to hold in times of surplus.? This suggests a slight\ndegree of '' excessive \" speculation in Mr. Meade's sense, though not necessarily exces-\nsive speculation in the popular sense in which excessive speculation is associated with\nunwarranted price fluctuations over short periods.*\n\nStanford, California.

Whether or not he was the original selecting agent it thus appears\nlegitimate for the economist to take at least a negative part in the process of formulating\nends.\n\nFurthermore, it can be argued that the rejection of given end(s) on grounds of\ninconsistency and insufficiency is an important step towards the choice of a new set of\nends. Repeated rejection of all ends which do not meet these two requirements would,\nin fact, place recognizable boundaries\u2014relative ones to be sure\u2014within which the\nunchosen but necessary ends would have to fall. Since the formulation of ends in our\nsociety is a continuing process, the restriction of the economist to a '' negative \" role\nis a fairly meaningless limitation. If the argument of the last two paragraphs is\ncorrect, Mr. Henderson (along with Lionel Robbins) has presented much too narrow a\npicture of the economist's role in policy formation.\n\nIII.\n\nWe have seen that Mr. Henderson cannot legitimately give the job of end-selection\nto the Cabinet (or to any other group) without exploring the problem of who should\nchoose the ends for society. If we operate within the framework of a '' mass demo-\ncracy,\" Mr. Henderson has indirectly placed his finger on one requirement which must\nbe fulfilled by the end-selecting agent. The democratic process can be pictured as one\nin which the voters of the community choose between alternatives which are\npresented to them, but cannot themselves set up these alternatives.? For obvious\nsociological reasons, the agent who presents the alternatives must be an individual or\nsmall group. In addition, the voters must be supplied with the information on which\nto judge between alternatives. This function must also be performed for the electorate\nrather than by it. Even though the Cabinet is a small group there is no reason to\nsuppose that any single group will present all the alternatives and all the information\nneeded. The democratic process implies not one but a series of such groups.\n\nUnfortunately, there is nothing in this process which insures that the choices\nmade by the voters will form themselves into a usable ranking of alternatives for the\ncommunity (community preference system). This becomes clear when we consider\nthat: (r) the individual voters may be ignorant, apathetic, or possessed of ill-defined,\nnon- or irrational preference systems ; (2) the original set of alternatives on which\nthe vote was cast may have been incomplete ; (3) as Professor Arrow has pointed out,\nthe community preference system need not be \"rational\" even if the preference\nsystem of each voter is rational? ; and finally, (4) the voting process is discontinuous\nso that it is necessary between elections to judge what the electorate would desire if a\nvote were taken.*\n\nProblems of this order may have been in the back of Mr. Henderson's mind when\nhe elevated the Cabinet to the position of end-selecting agent and relegated the\neconomist to the job of passive deducer. Certainly, the existence of such problems\n\n! Even if the economist were not permitted to initiate ends, in our society he is free to choose his place\nof employment. Thus he is free to reject any set of ends by rejecting employment offered by a given end-\nselecting agency. He can choose another set of ends by finding a new job.\n\n2]. A.

Little objects\nstrenuously to some remarks made by Mr. A. M. Henderson in a recent issue of this\nReview. Mr. Henderson put forward the notion that the Cabinet is the proper agency\nto translate '' the national interest \"' into a series of specific goals. Further, he implied\nthat as economists we must wait for the Cabinet's interpretation, accept it, and then\nproceed with the construction of our deductive systems.\n\nTo all this Mr. Little protests. After stating that the role of the economist is (hope-\nfully) broader and less servile than Mr. Henderson implied, Mr. Little goes on to argue\nthat the value premises used by the welfare economist can originate in a great many\nplaces: in the Cabinet, Parliament, the local pub, or in the mind of the individual\nperforming the deductions. For this reason he feels that Mr. Henderson was wrong\nin restricting the economist to those value premises enunciated by the Cabinet.\n\nIt is my contention that Mr. Little was right in objecting to the Henderson\nposition\u2014but for inappropriate reasons. If I have read the arguments of these two\nmen correctly, there is no necessary antagonism between their positions. Mr.\nHenderson probably accepts the idea that '' value conclusions can only be deduced\nfrom value premises.\" Further, he undoubtedly realises that these premises can arise\nfrom any of a wide variety of sources. The problem, however, is not where they could\narise but where they should arise.\n\nTo reach the conclusion that the Cabinet should select the detailed ends toward\nwhich the whole society ought to move, Mr. Henderson must have had some set of\npostulates about the political system in the back of his mind. But Mr. Henderson has\nshrouded in secrecy the postulational system from which he deduced his conclusion\nabout the Cabinet. Both Mr. Little and I are inclined to disagree with Mr. Henderson's\nchoice of the Cabinet as the end-selecting agency, but until he is more specific about\nthe reasons for his choice, it is impossible for me to state with any certainty the nature\nof my objections. They could either be with his postulates, his deductions, or with\nboth.\n\nII.\n\nWhether or not Mr. Henderson had stated explicitly his assumptions concerning\nthe political system, it seems to me that one may still object to the narrow role assigned\nthe economist. Let us suppose that initial ends (postulates) have been given to the\neconomist (by himself or others) and that he has accepted the task of performing\ndeductions. This is the conventional picture of the economist's role and is, therefore,\nsuitable for analysis. Notice that in his generally accepted capacity of deducer, the\neconomist is permitted at most to restate the ends and then only in a manner which\nwill not influence the choice of the agent who does the selecting. But what if the ends\nturn out on examination to be inconsistent ? Surely the economist has a right to\nmention these inconsistencies. Presumably, the economist can also tell the selecting\n\n1I. M.

Finally, a word might be said about general equilibrium theory. Although the\nsubstitution term in (9) is symmetrical, the presence of the co-factors of off-diagonal\nelements makes it impossible to say anything about the sign of the substitution term,\neven when we come to analyse the effect on the net demand for a commodity of a\nchange in its own price. In the usual theories of the consumer and the firm, it will be\nrecalled, the second order conditions for a maximum (of utility or profit) enable us to\ndetermine quite unambiguously the sign of such substitution terms. In the present\ntheory, however, all we know is that D must be the matrix of a quadratic form, negative\ndefinite under constraint ; and this does not enable us to attribute a definite sign to\nco-factors of off-diagonal elements in the determinant of D. Thus the substitution\nterms are less well behaved than in a general equilibrium theory based on utility\nmaximisation for consumers and profit maximisation for firms. It is not difficult to\nsee how this leads to additional chances of instability, but there would be little point\nin pursuing the matter further at this juncture.\n\nCambridge. J. \u00bb& V.

The differences between these\ntwo capital values of the stream are positive or negative according to the signs of the\nsurpluses themselves ; but the effect of any one surplus on the difference between the\ncurrent capital values depends not only on its own present discounted value, but on\nthe number of times the effect of the difference between the rates of interest has been\nrepeated.\n\nNow if the marginal stream contains net inputs (negative surpluses) which, because\nthey are long deferred, affect the capital value very little, but which for the same\nreason are weighted so heavily in the average that they make the average period of\nthe marginal stream negative, then these same deferred inputs will exercise a very\nstrong influence on the difference between the capital values of this stream at different\nrates of interest. This influence will make it impossible for a marginal stream with a\nnegative average period to be unprofitable at one rate of interest and to become\nprofitable with a slightly lower rate. But unless a stream does this it is not fitted to\nbe a marginal stream in the sense outlined above.\n\nIt has seemed worth while to publish this proof, though the writer is well aware\nof its deficiencies in mathematical elegance and clarity in comparison with the\nappendix and text of Value and Cajal, for two reasons. The difference between\nevaluating a stream from /' onward now, and evaluating it at 7\", may have some\ntheoretical interest, especially in relation to problems of changes in the valuation of\nfixed assets.

And whatever our standard of reference may be, most\nplans have some consequences that are commitments to efforts or sacrifices in the\nfuture, in such a way that, from the present point of view, certain inputs become\ninevitable (to avoid greater loss) at such future dates.\n\nSingapore.

It will be noticed that the lower branch\nof the potential surprise curve is drawn to the north of the east-west axis representing\nzero potential surprise, whereas the upper branch is drawn to the south of that axis.\nThe reason for this lies in the logic of the contours of the $-surface : when a particular\noutcome involving potential surprise is to be compared with a lower outcome associated\nwith zero potential surprise, the southern section of the $-surface is the relevant one,\nbut when it is to be compared with a higher outcome associated with zero potential\nsurprise, the northern section of the $-surface is relevant. Consequently, the branch\nof the potential surprise curve representing outcomes greater than the outcome regarded\nas neutral when associated with zero potential surprise must be drawn in the south-west\nquadrant, and the branch representing lower outcomes must be drawn in the north-\neast quadrant.\n\nThe projection of the potential surprise curve on the $-surface, which is traced\nout in the south-west quadrant by the paper upright, is the stimulation function; it\ndescribes the stimuli experienced by the individual in considering the various possible\noutcomes of the given course of action. According to Mr. Shackle's theory, the\nindividual evaluating the attractiveness of the given course of action is influenced by\nonly two of the possible outcomes, namely those giving the maximum and minimum\nstimulus. These are the highest and lowest points on the stimulation function, and are\nshown in the model by the tangency of the stimulation function to a contour of the\n$-surface. The two points are termed respectively /he jrimary focus-gain and the\njrimary focus-loss. For comparison with other possible courses of action it is convenient\nto \" standardise \" them by finding the zero-potential-surprise outcome which would\ngive the individual the same stimulus ; this is facilitated in the model by the projection\nof the east-west axis vertically upward on to the $-surface.\n\nThe determination of /he standardised focus-gain and the standardised focus-loss is\nonly the first step in Mr. Shackle's analysis of economic decisions taken in the face of\nuncertainty ; the next step is the analysis of the decision between different possible\ncourses of action, each with its standardised focus-gain and focus-loss. This decision\ndepends on the individual's attitude towards uncertainty, which Mr. Shackle describes\nby means of /he gambler-preference map. The present model, however, relates only to\nthe first step of the analysis; but it may be useful to conclude by comparing it with\nMr. Shackle's own treatment of the $-surface.\n\nThe difference between the two is most readily appreciated by comparing the\ncontour maps of the two surfaces. Fig. 2 presents the contour map of the present\nmodel; it is viewed from the opposite direction to that of the photograph, but the\ndirections of the photograph have been retained for convenience. Fig. 3 is the contour\nmap employed in Mr. Shackle's book.? From a comparison of the two maps, it is clear\nthat Mr. Shackle has suppressed all the contours of the $-surface lying to the east of\nthe neutral-outcome contour and south of the east-west axis, and all the contours\nlying west of the neutral-outcome contour and north of the east-west axis. He has\nthen rotated the north-east quadrant through 180 degrees to bring both segments to\n\nl'There is, of course, no need to assume that the possible outcomes vary continuously : one could\nequally well assume that the potential surprise curve and stimulation function consist of a finite number of\npoints. The analysis would be exactly the same, except that it would no longer be possible to describe\nmaximum and minimum positions in terms of tangencies. Mr. Shackle does not make this point, although\nit increases the generality of his technique.\n\n3 Tbid., p. 23.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 08:04:01 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

It increases with movements away from the east-west line in\neither direction, up to a limit corresponding to absolute disbelief.\n\nThe intensity of the stimulus to the individual considering the possible course of\naction imparted by his imagining any particular outcome in conjunction with any\nparticular degree of potential surprise is measured in the vertical direction. The\nbase-plane is taken to represent the degree of stimulus corresponding to a neutral\noutcome, so that points corresponding to greater stimuli lie above it, and those corres-\nponding to lesser stimuli lie below it. The $-surface, which is the locus of all these\npoints, consequently intersects the base-plane along a curve which passes through the\npoint corresponding to a neutral outcome with zero potential surprise, i.e. the inter-\nsection of the east-west and north-south axes.\n\nThe shape of the $-surface itself is such that any horizontal cross-section of it\n(e.g. by the base-plane) resembles an elongated S or the summation sign of the integral\ncalculus, and intersects the east-west axis from the south-west direction at something\nless than a right-angle. The reasons for these characteristics are as follows. If we\nconsider those combinations of outcome and potential surprise which will give the\nindividual the same stimulus as a given outcome with zero potential surprise, it is\nobvious that the same stimulus will be imparted ezher by a more valuable outcome\nwith some degree of potential surprise, or by a less valuable outcome with some degree\nof potential surprise. Thus the contours of the $-surface cut the east-west axis from\nthe south-west direction. The S-shape arises from the fact that no finite outcome can\ncompensate for, or be compensated by, infinite potential surprise (absolute disbelief).\nConsequently, the contour lines must approach asymptotically to the outer limits\ncorresponding to absolute disbelief. It is also obvious that, in moving from south to\nnorth across the surface, successively higher contours will be encountered ; conse-\nquently, the contours corresponding to successively higher stimuli must lie inside one\nanother south of the east-west line, and outside one another north of the east-west line,\nthroughout their length.! On both the upper and lower sides of the model, the contour\nlines are drawn directly on the $-surface when it lies above the base-plane, and pro-\njected on to the base-plane when the $-surface lies below it.\n\nAny vertical east-west cross-section of the $-surface as it is represented in tbe\nmodel would be a curve, concave to the base-plane when above it and convex to the\nbase-plane when below it. This would imply that the marginal intensity of stimulation\ndiminishes as the value of the outcome increases. This implication is purely a result of\nthe limitations of the material from which the model is constructed ; it is not required\nby Mr. Shackle's theory, which assumes only that the intensity of stimulation is\norderable.\n\nThe \u00f3-surface represents the psychological attitude of the individual towards all\nconceivable combinations of possible outcomes and degrees of potential surprise.\nTo analyse his evaluation of a particular possible course of action, it is necessary to\nintroduce into the model his estimation of the possible outcomes of that particular\ncourse of action, and the degree of potential surprise associated with each. It is\nassumed with Mr. Shackle that there will be an '\"' inner range \" of such outcomes,\nassociated with zero potential surprise, and that outside this range successively higher\nor lower outcomes will be accompanied by increasing potential surprise.\n\n1 The instructions of footnote 2, supra, ensure this result. For reasons of simplicity, the contour lines\non the model are not drawn in sufficient extension to show their relationship to one another as they approach\nthe limit of infinite potential surprise.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 08:04:01 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

All these profiles will pass through the y-axis, the line $ \u2014 o, x \u2014 o, at some\n\n0$\npositive slope Aa 70, while we shall have also 0 (5 ) \u00ab0, and the surface will\ny\n\nthus have, as it were, a \"ploughshare\"' form, a clockwise twist as we go from lower to\nhigher values of y. This contrasts, as Mr. Mars has pointed out, with the assumption\nimplicit in Figs. II 3, II 4, etc., of Expectation in Economics that at rather high values\nof y and low numerical values of x we shall have $ \u2014 o. Through this assumption my\ndiagrams show the two sloping sheets of the $-surface separated from each other,\nexcept at the point x \u2014 o, y \u2014 o, by a V-shaped flat region of the xy-plane over all of\nwhich $ \u2014 o. The meaning of the assumption is that very small imagined gains or\nlosses, associated with very high potential surprise, will have no power to interest the\nenterpriser and will, therefore, be '' subliminal.\" The influence that a particular choice\nof geometrical symbolism can have on one's thinking is here strikingly illustrated, for\nwhile in my own diagrams my own assumption appears, I think, quite natural, the\ncase would be quite otherwise if my assumption were incorporated in Mr. Mars'\ndiagrams. There it would break the smooth downward sweep of all the profiles except\nthat at y \u2014 o (the curve M AL itself), and would thus, according to my feeling, appear\n\" unnatural'\" In Mr. Mars' diagrams the assumption would be represented by a\nplatform between two cliffs, one above and one below it, while in my diagrams it is\nsimply the flat floor of a valley from which. the sloping sides rise on either side. As to\nwhich assumption is the more realistic, it is for others to judge; the point is not of\ngreat importance.\n\nI turn now to Mr. H. G. Johnson's version of the $-surface, and here again I incline\nto think that zsthetic considerations have played some part. Mr. Johnson has actually\nconstructed in wood a physical representation of his variant, and has written an\nexplanatory article with diagrams and a photograph.? At a first glance, Mr. Johnson's\nversion appears simpler than my own, and has a quasi-symmetry which, even apart\nfrom the pedagogic advantages claimed for the model, is undeniably attractive. A\nmore important characteristic is that this variant gives us a certain extra scope, in\nthat it allows us, if we wish, to assume that \u00f3 is an ?ncreasing, instead of a decreasing,\nfunction of potential surprise, over some range of x, without having to resort to any\nodd-looking or complicated form for the $-surface. I am doubtful whether such an\nassumption would ever be appropriate, but the possibility of pointing to the parts of\nthe model relevant to such an assumption, and asking why the potential surprise\ncurve avoids them, might be valuable didactically. At any rate, the inclusion (and the\npossibility of including) these regions is as justifiable and useful as the inclusion, in a\nCartesian diagram, of all four quadrants when perhaps only one or two are going to be\nassigned a role and meaning in the particular argument.\n\nG.

Rather can we\nassume that the absolute level is important because of long-term expectations. Thus\nour investigation indicates that the banks' liquidity preference was a matter of both\nshort-term and long-term expectations. If the former alone were relevant and if they\nfollowed the current rate closely, the curve of Fig. 1 would be vertical, while if only\nthe long-term expectations were relevant the curve would, as in Philip's argument, be\nhorizontal.

Under '' normal\" conditions\nthe picture might be very different. Not only might the curve have a different shape\nfor reasons related to the pattern of expectations, but it might also lie more to the\nleft for the reason that during the war the banks held a large cash reserve, in order to\nbe ready for the big withdrawals (to finance investment in stocks and increased con-\nsumption) that were expected to happen when peace came. Developments in 1945\nindicate this. After the capitulation there was first a fall in the rate of interest with\nunaltered liquidity and then a fall in liquidity with the rate of interest unchanged.\n\nFinally, it should be pointed out that this analysis has touched only one corner of\na relatively unexplored and very interesting field. The structure of the money and\ncapital market is much more complicated than would appear from what has been said.\nFurthermore, the liquidity preference of sectors other than the banks has been ignored.\nLastly, all the modifications that a dynamic analysis would introduce need to be\nconsidered.\n\nCopenhagen.

A third, and possibly even larger,\nsource of economy arises from the fact that with commodities marketed under the\ndistributors' brands the manufacturer is relieved of selling costs? and, consequently,\nthe chain and mail order houses are able to secure extra discounts ('' advertising\nallowances \") from the manufacturers.? In the case of electric refrigerators, for example,\nthe price of Sears Roebuck's brand in the U.S. was lower, for all models, than that of\nmanufacturers' brands, by anything between 15-30 per cent. The distinguishing\nfeatures of \" retailers' domination\" ' are, therefore: (a) that advertising and other\nselling expenses are low, because the manufacturer is relieved of them, while the\nretailers' advertising and other brand-promotional costs are much lower, and generally\ndo not exceed a small percentage of the retail price; (5) there are other sources of\neconomies in distribution costs, due to the chain-store type of organisation, notably a\nhigher volume of turnover per store and a higher rate of stock-turn, both in the retail\nstage and in the wholesale stage.\n\n43. The question whether these economies in distribution costs could be matched with\na high degree of efficiency in production, if this system of marketing organisation\nbecame general, ultimately turns on whether the number of independent wholesaling\nunits, existing side by side, would turn out to be large or small. If the functions of\nwholesaling could be concentrated in a few hands, there is no reason why the degree\nof concentration and standardisation of production achieved should be any less (it\nmight even be greater) than with manufacturers' oligopoly. The available empirical\nevidence certainly suggests that manufacturers' brand control, whatever its advantages\non the production side, is generally associated with wasteful methods of distribution,\nand that there are strong inherent advantages in a system which separates the functions\nof wholesaling from that of manufacturing.\n\nCambridge.

This is certainly so when the elasticities of demand\nfor imports and exports are high ; owing, however, to the influence of the first term of\nthe numerator of (2), a favourable change in the terms of trade may be more likely than\nMrs. Robinson's result would suggest, when the elasticities of demand for imports and\nexports are low.\n\nLet us collect our results in this section. We have seen that if the supply elasticities\nand the elasticities of demand for imports and exports are all low, the change in the\nterms of trade is very uncertain. It may be adverse or favourable, large or small. We\nhave seen that, if the supply elasticities are sufficiently large compared with the demand\nelasticities, then the change in the terms of trade will be adverse ; but that in this\nconnection Mrs. Robinson's formula underestimates the likelihood of an adverse\nchange for high values of the elasticities of demand for imports and exports, and may\noverestimate it for low values of these elasticities. Lastly, we have seen that for high\nvalues of these elasticities of demand the change in the terms of trade will always be\nsmaller than the fall in the exchange rate.\n\nVII.\n\nOne can but conclude this article on a negative note. In the foregoing paragraphs\nwe have taken only the first and perhaps most essential step towards a comprehensive\ntreatment of the problem. We would be wise to remind ourselves of the many simpli-\nfications we have made. We have reduced the very large number of types of com-\nmodity in the real world to four only. We have taken no account of the import content\nof exports. We have assumed that changes in the distribution of income have no\neffect on the demand for commodities. We have left unconsidered all reactions on\nrates of interest and on opportunities to invest. And we have made further special\nassumptions as we went along. Yet with the help of all this simplification and of a\ngreat deal of tedious, if pedestrian, mathematics, we have achieved regrettably little\nin the way of positive result.\n\nThis I believe to be in the nature of the problem. It turns out indeed to be a far\nmore complex problem than the simplicity of Mrs. Robinson's treatment would\nsuggest. Nevertheless, so long as factors of production are not fully employed, it is a\nreal problem, and one which may have considerable practical importance. The\nKeynesian nature of the problem should, I think, be emphasised. We saw in section V\nthat any classical approach was entirely inapplicable. However, the unfortunate truth\nremains that as soon as we dispense with the classical assumption of full employment\nin the field of international trade we find ourselves in very difficult waters. Possibly,\nin the end, inverted commas may prove to be our only practicable means of support.\n\nOxford. CHARLES KENNEDY.\n\nNOTES.\n\n1! Cowles Commission : The Principia Press, Inc., 1944.\n\n? F.

A shift in liquidity preference\u2014brought about by a proportionate change\nin the preference of each individual\u2014will leave (x), (2), (5), (6), (7), (8), and (9)\ninvariant. In both cases (3) changes proportionately.\n\nThe invariance of (7) under both changes is trivial, inasmuch as by definition\nthis is always zero in equilibrium. The invariance of (5) is also trivial for any exchange\neconomy. For in such an economy we start off with given quantities of initial stocks ;\nthe only thing that might change is their distribution among the individuals in the\neconomy. Hence, as long as we continue to assume that a consistent solution exists,\nand as long as the initial stocks of the commodities in question are assumed to remain\nconstant, this invariance must hold by definition. Correspondingly, invariance (9)\ncannot hold for a change in the amount of money ; and it must hold for a change in\nliquidity preference which leaves the initial stock of money constant.\n\nInvariance (5) becomes non-trivial only in an economy in which production as\nwell as exchange takes place. For such an economy it would be significant if a change\nin liquidity preference or in the amount of money left the equilibrium owifuts of goods\nand services invariant. In the classical production-exchange economy this, of course,\ndoes happen ; for the production decisions of the firm depend only on relative prices ;\nand, as we have seen, these remain constant. The crucial question here is whether\nthis dependence of the firm's decision on relative prices alone will remain once we\nmake the theory of the firm more realistic by introducing into it considerations of\nliquidity and asset holdings. This is a question that requires, and is receiving, much\nfurther investigation. (See recent and forthcoming papers by W. W. Cooper, A. M.\nHenderson, J. Marschak, and others.) Intuitively it seems to me that from this analysis\nwill emerge something analogous to the '' distribution effects \" discussed in Section 5\nabove; and that if we abstract from these effects, invariance (5) will remain\u2014 provided\nresources cannot be diverted to the production of money.\n\nThe invariance of (r), (2) and (5)\u2014relative prices, the rate of interest, and the\nquantities of goods\u2014is the essence of the classical theory of interest. These invariances\nare the bases of its insistence that the long-run rate of interest is a real, and not a\nmonetary, phenomenon ; that the rate of interest can be affected (comparative statics)\nonly by changes in one of the real underlying factors of the economy\u2014say, changes\nin the initial stocks of one of the commodities ; and, finally, that it is independent of\nchanges in the '* monetary sector \"' of the economy\u2014changes in the amount of money\nand the level of liquidity preference. The preceding sections have shown the conditions\nunder which these propositions are true.\n\nJerusalem. DoN PATINKIN.\n\n!
