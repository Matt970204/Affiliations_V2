This type of economic organization has been called forth\nby the doctrine of total war. Besides the traditional use of the military proper, total war\nembraces two new weapons: psychological and economic warfare. In the economics of the\nmilitary state there is no distinct line of demarcation which separates war from peace.\nWar is no longer regarded as a passing stage of abnormality to be replaced in short by\nnormal conditions of peace; and war economics is no longer a special branch of public\nfinance but penetrates the whole of economic science.\n\nIn the economics of the military state, there is no unused capacity, industrial or other-\nwise, since all resources are placed in the service of war preparation and war. The profit\nmotive is retained, but is subject to important modifications. Private initiative, inasmuch\nas it is recognized and allowed to emerge, is vested with the function of serving the\neconomics of the military state. Depletion of the stock of accumulated wealth, as a source\nof current consumption, is co\u00f3rdinated with current production, the other source. The\ntraditional concept of normalcy with its excess of national income produced over national\nincome consumed is abandoned.\n\nEvolution of War Economics in Recent German Literature\n\nThe intensive occupation with the economic aspects of war preparation\nand warfare which started in Germany with the advent of the Hitler\nregime has resulted in a stupendous volume of literary output in the course\nof the years. Research institutes and university chairs for the investigation\nand propagation of war economics were established by the authorities, who\nalso assumed financial responsibility for the printing and publishing of\nnumerous treatises and monographs on war economics. All this is re-\nmarkably different from the situation in 1914 when Werner Sombart spoke\nof the economists as follows: \"W'e had nothing to give that could have\nbeen of direct service to the great cause. Nothing has become more clear\nin our minds than this: our co\u00f3peration was not needed in any respect.\"\nCorrespondingly it is said now that \"economic science cannot be acquitted\nof the grave guilt of insufficient preparation for the [first] World War.\"?\n\n\"Though attempts have been made to appraise nazi economic policies\nas the result and outcome of German economic development within the\nimmediate and more remote past, it does not seem possible to regard\n\n!NV.

The first, approved June 25,\nwas a series of amendments hastily thrown together in what was then thought to be the\nclosing days of the congressional session. This Act (1) reduced the amounts of personal\nexemptions, (2) increased by about 10 per cent individual and corporation income taxes,\n(3) increased surtax rates in the middle brackets and (4) increased most excises.\n\nThe Second Revenue act of 1940, applicable to corporations only, has three important\nfeatures: (1) it levies a special tax on the excess profits of corporations; (2) it suspends\nduring the life of the excess profits tax the Vinson-Trammell act designed to limit profits\nfrom naval, airplane and other defense contracts; and (3) it permits accelerated (five-year)\namortization of the cost of certain facilities necessary for national defense. The Act also\nprovides for those in military and naval services a new system of life insurance and credit\non annuities under the Railroad Retirement acts. An amendment is made to the Social\nSecurity act for employers who had not received credit for contributions to state funds\nbecause they were late.\n\n\"The first Act is expected to augment revenues by $729,000,000 for the fiscal year 1941,\nand by about $1,000,000,000 in a full year of operation. The second is expected to increase\nrevenues still further by about $500,000,000 in the calendar year 1941, and by $900,000,000\nto $1,000,000,000 when the defense program becomes fully operative.\n\nThe Fiscal Situation\n\nNo year since the World War has seen such changes in the federal fiscal\npicture as 1940. In January the President estimated that the deficit for the\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1941, would be $2,876,000,000. His estimate\nfor national defense expenditure for 1941 was about $1,940,000,000. This\nsum was only a fraction of the amount soon deemed necessary as he saw\nthe German army overrun country after country in Western Europe. A\nrevised estimate in June was for $3,250,000,000 defense expenditures; in\nAugust for $5,000,000,000. Total expenditures for 1941 were estimated in\nAugust at $12,000,000,000 in contrast to $8,000,000,000 in January. These\namounts do not tell the full story. Congress was asked to appropriate in-\ncreasingly huge sums for defense, not all of which could be expended in\nthe current fiscal year. Exclusive of the cost of enforcing the acts for com-\npulsory military training and putting the National Guard into active mili-\ntary service, Congress had appropriated over $14,000,000,000 for defense\npurposes by August 5, 1940.\n\nEven in May before the situation in Europe became so bad, and while\ndefense appropriations were comparatively small, Secretary Morgenthau\nbecame concerned over the $45 billion debt limit. At that time the work-\ning balance was $1,3500,000,000, a sum the Secretary thought unwise to re-\nduce. Although the President had suggested additional tax revenues ot\n$460,000,000 in his January message, Congress ignored the request, and\n\n'Preceding federal revenue acts passed since the adoption of the Sixteenth (Income\nTax) amendment to the Constitution have been discussed in earlier volumes of the\nAmerican.

During the 1930's, as a rule, deposits were\nnot used for current spending on consumption to the extent commonly supposed. In one\ndepressed area, however, spending and unemployment were the main reasons for with-\ndrawal. (2) The activity of savings deposits is marked by sharp seasonal fluctuations, but\nthe annual rate of turnover is more stable than that for demand deposits. Medium-sized\nbalances ($400-800) are the most active. (3) The data indicate that over 40 per cent of\naccounts are closed before becoming a year old. Older and larger accounts, however, make\nup a large part of total deposits.

The purpose of the investigation\nis to acquire a clearer notion of the nature of savings deposits. The prin-\ncipal characteristics considered are the uses of saved funds, and the activity\nand age of accounts.

Uses of Savings Deposits\n\nIt is virtually impossible to determine accurately the reasons for savings-\nbank withdrawals. This is so because deposits usually are withdrawn in\ncash, which cannot be traced. Sometimes, however, withdrawals take the\nform of checks drawn by the savings banks on depository commercial banks,\nespecially when the amounts are large, and the endorsements on these\nchecks provide clues to the uses of the money. Several individual banks\nmade studies of these endorsements covering short periods of the late\n1920's in order to discover to what extent deposits were being used for\nstock purchases. These studies showed quite conclusively that savings de-\nposits were attracted in large amounts to the stock market or to invest-\nment in mortgage certificates and other securities.\n\nOne bank, for example, discovered that in January, 1929, 24 per cent of\nthe withdrawals by check were used to purchase stocks and bonds, while\n40 per cent went into real estate or mortgages.

(b) The general\neconomic theory formulated at that time concentrated on the problem of production in ac-\ncordance with the concrete major problem of its time. (c) The \"received doctrine\" con-\ncerning money had been formulated under mercantile conditions based on a manufactural\nand not an industrial mode of production. (d) The general circumstances occasioned by\nthe jerkingly proceeding industrial expansion, enhanced by the specific conditions of the\nAnglo-French wars, resulted in an apparently general rise of prices.\n\nAs to the functional value of a theory developed on this basis and proposed to be ap-\nplied to the solution of modern monetary problems, we have to recognize that: (a) The\nanalysis of this rise of prices was carried on with the help of a scientific method which did\nnot and could not include a concept of qualitative change. Quite the contrary, \"received\ndoctrine\" as well as the outward appearance of the economic process seemed to suggest a\nmerely quantitative expansion without any fundamental qualitative change in the structure\nof production. (b) The result of such an attitude toward the phenomenon of rising prices\nwas to conceive of them as deviations from an otherwise static condition. (c) Such theoretical\nposition did not prove fatal for 1bat time for the reason that the actual though temporary\neconomic conditions tended to obscure the imminent structural change indicated in the rise of\nprices.\n\n\"The classical theory of inflation expressed thus the phenomenal coincidence of a specific\nhistorical period. It has to be understood as a \"special case\" in doctrine formation created\nby and applicable to a special historical situation only.\n\nBy the end of the eighteenth century the industrial type of producing\ncommodities had become prevalent, bringing in its wake a development of\nregular interrelationships between the various producers and consumers.\nAdam Smith, in his discussion of the division of labor, has given an\nadequate picture of that society.\n\n\"There is little doubt that the theory of money would have retained its\nposition of secondary importance in the general economic theory of that\nperiod if it had not been for the occurrence of particularly striking events\nwhich forced the political and economic strategists to concern themselves\nparticularly with disentangling the apparently highly important flux of\nmoney.

Nowhere are these\nchanges so clearly reflected as in the treaties of commerce which have been negotiated\nduring the past eight years. Since these treaties are the legal embodiment of one aspect of\neconomic foreign policy, they represent a complex structure of contractual obligations\nwherein various national interests in the sphere of economic life find expression. For an\naccurate analysis of recent commercial policy, an examination of the tendencies, established\npractices, and methods exhibited in the binding agreements entered into by nations is\nessential. Here the use of the most-favored-nation clause, quotas, exchange controls, barter\nagreements, tariffs, bilateralism, and other devices of trade policy, the frequency of their\nappearance, and their content and scope, can be studied with a view to determining more\nprecisely the nature of the above-mentioned changes.\n\nI\n\nThe subsequent data are based upon a study of over 510 bilateral con-\nventions, treaties, and exchanges of notes between states for the period\n1931-1939.

In his second dis-\ncussion appearing on another page of this issue he attempts to make the point\nthat we are using the concept \"velocity\" in an unusual manner. The authors feel\nthat a brief restatement of their analysis of the intra-account clearing process\nmay serve as the best answer to Mr. Villard.\n\nAnyone familiar with the activity that occurs in the bank account of a going\nbusiness concern is aware of the fact that a sizeable portion of the daily debits\ncharged to the account is matched at the time of bank posting by simultaneous\ncredit entries. In a recent investigation the authors sampled the accounts of\nbusiness firms in one of the leading banks in Ohio.? The daily debit and credit\ndata over a 27-month period in 15 commercial firms' accounts showed that 55\nper cent of the checks drawn during the period were offset at the times of bank\npostings by simultaneous credit entries. The percentage was 65 in a sample of\n14 industrial firms' accounts over the same period. The question then arose, \"Can\nthese offset checks be fairly regarded as representing transfers of deposit bal-\nances ?\"\n\nIf a deposit balance is defined as the net credit balance existing at any time\nin the account of a bank customer, it follows that credit entries to a bank account\nwhich are simultaneously matched by debit entries at the time of bank posting\nnever have the chance to appear as net credit balances and, therefore, cannot\nbe regarded as deposit balances. The fact remains, however, that the holder of\nthe account has drawn checks in payment of his obligations. Against what have\nthe checks been. drawn? Not against deposit balazces as defined above, but\n\nlarger \"offset checks\" will be relative to Dice and Schaffner velocity, other things equal.\nFor the economy as a whole \"offset checks\" equal all debits (or credits) and velocity is\nzero. See note 4 above.\n\n*If it were found that checks were completely \"offset\" in a given account, it could\nbe argued that this fact had demonstrated that the balance in question was not being held\nfor transaction purposes (although even this conclusion would not follow if banks were\nrequiring minimum balances). But complete \"offsetting\" of checks means simply that\nthe balance involved does not vary from posting to posting, and the mere existence of a\nbalance which does not fluctuate raises the question of why such a balance is being held,\nquite apart from elaborate computations regarding \"offset checks.\"\n\n* H.

S.\n388 (1938). The interpretation is found in an article in the December, 1939,\nissue of the Review.\n\nProfessor Mayer's comment indicates on its face misunderstanding of the\ninterpretation he challenges. After quoting from the article to the effect\nthat \"if the reasoning in this case (Pacific Gas and Electric) is consistently fol-\nlowed, there will be few, if any, occasions on which a rate order based upon\nhistorical cost will be distributed by the Supreme Court,\" Mr. Mayer proceeds to\nstate that \"if, in the future, complaining public utilities plead the confiscation\nissue directly, the cozrts will find nothing in the Pacific Gas and Electric decision\nto preclude their accepting and weighing reproduction cost evidence although\nthat evidence may have been rejected by the Commission. Consequently, it is\nentirely possible that many rate orders based on historical cost may be disturbed\nby the cozrts without doing violence to this decision.\"\n\nIt is quite apparent that the sentences quoted from our article deal exclusively\nwith the attitude of the Supreme Court toward historical cost. There is no sug-\ngestion in this quotation or in the whole article that the decision of the Supreme\nCourt precludes trial courts from \"accepting and weighing reproduction cost,\"\nwhen confiscation is the issue.\n\nIf the decision precluded the consideration of reproduction cost by trial courts\nthe statement that \"there will be few, if any, occasions on which a rate order\nbased upon historical cost will be disturbed by the Supreme Court\" would be\nmeaningless. If such courts were compelled by the Supreme Court to follow\nhistorical cost alone, then the Supreme Court would never disturb a rate order\nbecause it was based on such cost.\n\nThe interpretation suggested in our article can perhaps be best illustrated by\nsupposing that a trial court in a case where confiscation is the issue sustains a\nCommission order made on the basis of historical cost such as the order involved\nin the Pacific Gas and Electric case, and further that the court refuses to give\n", "Obio State University\n", "options and hedges than to analyze them merely as adjuncts to different types of\nmoney outlays.\n\nClearing is the appropriate means of settling debts to the extent that economic\nactivity within firms is continuous and that such activity among firms is simul-\ntaneous.

Sufrin examines the possibility of an increase\nin output and employment for a monopolistic firm resulting from a rise in wage\nrates, assuming no change in the demand curve for the product. Mr. Sufrin's\nconclusions are based upon the examination of a hypothetical case but it is neces-\nsary to determine the exact conditions under which the above situation is possible\nbefore valid conclusions of sufficient generality can be drawn. The possibility of\na positively sloped short-run demand curve for labor in periods of deep depression\nhas also been suggested by Mr. R. F. Harrod.? But as will be shown, the case\nof a positively sloped demand curve for labor need not be limited to those situa-\ntions where plants are operating in a stage of decreasing cost.\n\nAssuming the demand curve for labor to a firm selling in an imperfect market\nto be given by the product of marginal physical productivity and marginal\nrevenue, corresponding to each number of laborers employed, there are three\nconceivable situations for which this curve may be positively sloped. The most\nobvious case would be one in which both the marginal physica productivity\ncurve and the marginal revenue curve were positively sloped. Such a situation is\nprobably not likely, however. A second possibility would be one in which the mar-\nginal physical productivity curve is positively sloped and the marginal curve is\nnegatively sloped, provided of course that the demand for the product is not inelas-\ntic. This case will hold true within certain limits defined below. A rising marginal\nphysical productivity curve might occur when a plant is operating far below\noptimum capacity so that each additional worker employed together with the\nappropriate amounts of raw materials would yield increasingly larger increments\nto the total product. An example of this situation might be a case where the\nemployment of additional laborers would permit the use of machines which had\npreviously stood idle in the plant, and make possible economies of greater division\nof labor and technical efficiency to the extent that larger increments would be\nadded to the total product with each additional man employed. Production in a\nregion of increasing marginal physical productivity could occur only when firms\nare selling in imperfect markets, however. But in periods of low demand,\n\n* \"Monopolies and Labor Regulation,\" 744m. Ecoz. Rev., XXIX, Sept., 1939, pp. 551-552.\n\n*R. F. Harrod, \"Pigou's Theory of Unemployment,\" Ecoz. Jour., March, 1934, p. 27.\n\n*Increasing marginal physical returns would in general be accompanied by falling\nmarginal costs. If firms selling in a purely competitive market were operating in a stage\nof decreasing marginal costs, any firm could profitably expand its output at the prevailing\nprice since the demand for the product is perfectly elastic to the individual firm. Equilibrium\nfor the short-run will only be reached when the firms are all producing at a stage of rising\nmarginal cost and when marginal cost is equated to price for each firm. Hence a rising\nmarginal physical productivity curve for a firm selling in a purely competitive market is\nimpossible.\n", "University of Pennsylvania\n", "G. LLovp WiLsoN\nJosePH R.

By analyzing the former we may explain the\nweaknesses of the latter.\n\nThe law makes certain rather obvious \"economic\" assumptions which are inapplicable to\nthe modern economy. But the most important\u2014and most fallacious\u2014assumption is its in-\ndividualistic conception of the process of invention. In fact, invention is a group process, the\nindividual contributions being relatively minor. In modern industrial research this is par-\nticularly so.\n\nA grant of separate proprietary rights over each inventive contribution thus imposes bar-\nriers to further innovation and reduction to practice of the whole. The economic system has\nhad to remove these barriers. But this has involved the creation of large patent pools, with\nconsequent dangers of injustice, and monopoly.\n\nIn addition, the confusion entailed by the application of the single patent to modern tech-\nnology has offered to the powerful legal methods of unfair competition. The result is often\ninjustice, perpetual legal monopoly over whole industries, and the danger, at least, of tech-\nnological retardation.\n\nThe patent law is not the same thing as the patent system. Our legal\nmethod of fostering technological advance is an ancient structure, almost\nthe same, basically and in detail, as it was three hundred years ago. But\nthe economic institutions which have grown up around this venerable\nlegal framework have so radically changed that it is difficult to believe\nthat the same law could possibly apply in the manner originally intended to\nthe new situation. In fact it does not. Economic change, motivated by the\ndynamic quest for profit, can use law, modify it, or ignore it. The resultant\nsystem may be more or less socially beneficent, more or less effective in ac-\ncomplishing its original purpose; in any event it will be different from that\noriginally contemplated by the unchanged legal prescriptions.\n\nThis paper does not attempt thoroughly to describe or evaluate the op-\neration of the patent 5j5/em. Its major interest is rather in the theory of the\npatent /aw. Law is society's means of conscious control. Because it is basic\nin the sense that economic institutions must develop within or about it, we\nmust understand the law before we can understand and evaluate the eco-\nnomic adaptations and the resultant synthesis. Insight into the problems\nof our present patent system may therefore be gained through analysis and\nevaluation of the preconceptions and rationale of the patent law, particu-\nlarly in the light of the major economic changes which have occurred since\nits conception.\n", "This content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Wed, 19 Jan 2022 03:38:38 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Alfred E.

It might, however, affect some\ninstitutions adversely. Such a reduction was impossible so long as banks acted competitively.\nNow, however, that they can act in concert, it would be profitable to reduce the rate.\n\nShould the banks in any state reduce the rate to zero before similar action is taken by\nothers, there would be a net gain in income to the community taking action first. Under\nmonopolistic conditions the term interest applied to the deposit rate is really a misnomer.\nThe function of this payment is to place a restraint upon competition for investment.\nThough the banks pay the entire cost of this restraint, all other investors receive the\nbenefit in higher yields. In continuing to pay interest on deposits, the banks are, therefore,\nnot acting to maximize profits. The deposit rate could also be used as an instrument of\nmonetary policy to affect interest rates, investment, prices and output.\n\nWhy do banks pay interest on deposits?* What determines the rate; and\nwhat would happen if interest payments were reduced to zero? These three\nquestions have both practical and theoretical significance. During the last\nfew years the deposit rate has been continually revised downward, and it\nis now suggested that it can be reduced to zero.

In a competitive banking system, interest must be paid by individual banks\nto attract reserves. The rate is a function of the loss-ratio and the loan\nrate of interest.

On recent\nlegislation, see Watkins, chapter 6. State action is dependent upon statute. In Wisconsin,\nSection 220.04(6) of the statutes empowers the Banking Commission to issue orders with\nrespect to the deposit rate. No law, however, is necessary to permit county associations to\nmake voluntary agreements. These agreements have in fact been made in several counties\nfixing a deposit rate less than the maximum prescribed by either the state or federal au-\nthorities, and so far their legality has not been questioned, These agreements may not be\nenforceable at law as between the banks but such enforceability does not appear to be\nnecessary.\n"}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Walter A.

This may be true for net investment but it is not obvious for reinvestment. Unless\nit is true for both net investment and reinvestment, there does not exist an unequivocal\nguide for policy. \u00c0 change in the rate of interest operates on reinvestment by bringing\nnearer or postponing the abandonment and premature abandonment of existing capital.\nAn increase in the interest rate tends to increase in general the abandonment of existing\ncapital and also the premature abandonment of those capital goods which are to be re-\nplaced by goods of intermediate durability. But though the decision to abandon is hastened\nby the increase in the interest rate, this does not automatically swell the flow of reinvest-\nment. It may or may not. This, however, introduces a range of indeterminacy in the effect\nof a change in the interest rate on the flow of total investment which calls for further\nstudy.\n\n1l. It is the purpose of this paper to examine briefly the problem of the\nrelationship between the flow of reinvestment and the rate of interest.\nApparently it is tacitly assumed that reinvestment responds to a change in\nthe rate of interest in the same way as net investment, or at least does not\nbehave in such a way as to offset the effect of such a change on net invest-\nment.! Now, the classical position on the relationship between the rate of\ninvestment and the rate of interest may be expressed in the words\nof Keynes: \". . . if there is an increased investment in any given type of\ncapital during any period of time, the marginal efficiency of that type of capi-\ntal will diminish as the investment in it is increased . . . the rate of invest-\nment will be pushed to the point on the investment demand-schedule\nwhere the marginal efficiency of capital in general is equal to the market\nrate of interest.\"? This implies that a rise (or fall) in the rate of interest,\ncel. par., will decrease (or increase) the rate of investment; and in an\neconomy which is consuming its capital, this change in the interest rate will\nincrease (or decrease) the rate of capital consumption. But the rate of\ninvestment may be taken either gros; or nel, 7.e., with or without the rate\nof reinvestment.?

Mexico's share in our imports, since\nthe expropriations of March, 1938, has fallen drastically as a result of the boycott of\nMexican oil by American companies. The selection in this manner of a base period during\nwhich special conditions were unfavorable to imports from Mexico is contrary to the\nprinciple insisted upon by the United States in the negotiation of trade agreements with\nforeign countries. This action weakens the bargaining position of the United States and\njeopardizes the principle of equal treatment embodied in the trade agreements program.\n\nBilateralism in international trade has put a severe strain on the \"most-\nfavored-nation\" policy, once accepted in principle by all great trading na-\ntions. Today the United States is almost alone in its practice of a commercial\npolicy aimed at extending the application of the principle to all phases of\ntrade regulation. Other countries hold that the most-favored-nation prin-\nciple is limited to tariff treatment, and does not apply to the newer direct\ncontrols. But we insist that equality of treatment must be extended to quotas\nand exchange controls also, otherwise the new devices will nullify equal\ntreatment in tariff rates. Consequently we have insisted that our exporters\nreceive a share in all foreign import quotas proportional to tbeir sbare in\ntbe imports for a previous \"representative period.\" 'This formula as incor-\nporated in the Hull trade agreements refers to customs quotas, which limit\nimports at special tariff rates, as well as to quotas which establish an abso-\nlute limit to imports.\n\nUsually it is the United States which insists upon the principle in order\nto get a \"fair\" share in someone else's quota, but there are several instances\nin which we ourselves have established customs quotas in connection with\ntariff reductions niade in trade agreements. The most recent case is the\ncustoms quota on fuel oil and crude petroleum established in the Vene-\nzuelan agreement. The import tax on these products has been halved for\nan amount not exceeding 5 per cent of the total crude petroleum processed\nin United States refineries during the previous year.\n\nImports in excess of this customs quota will have to pay the original tax.\nA subsequent proclamation by the President has assigned shares in the\nquota to our principal suppliers. Mexico, up to the time of the oil expro-\npriations the source of from 10 to 15 per cent of our oi] imports, has\nreceived a very small share, and the question arises, have we allocated the\noil quotas according to the formula we have demanded of others, or are\nwe scrapping our principle in order to discipline Mexico? The answer is\nimportant for the future of a commercial policy based on the most-favored-\nnation clause.\n\nSpecifically, have we discriminated against Mexico by the choice of a\nbase period which can in no way be said to be normal or representative?\nOn the basis of imports for the first ten months of 1939, Venezuela was\n", "This content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Wed, 19 Jan 2022 03:41:37 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["William Diebold", " Jr."], "stable_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1807583"}, "1807584": {"affiliations": {"found": "A Note on the Effects of Minimum Wages on the\nPropensity to Consume\n\nIn his article on \"Some Effects of a Minimum Wage upon the Economy as a\nWhole?

My attention was directed toward the results of minimum wage\nlegislation on the entire system, but Mr. Mikesell deals with product price, the\nproduction function, and other aspects of firm equilibrium. The best interpreta-\ntion which can be given is that\u2014if his argument 7; intended to explain general\neffects\u2014he refers to some symbolic or summary firm, a sort of weighted average\nfirm. Yet if this firm is to represent the whole economy, surely its appropriateness\nis vitiated by the other conditions he has posited. The first of these is that\nall prime costs are labor costs. This is a difficult premise for a macro-economic\nanalysis; it ignores, for example, user costs in the short period. But he further\nassumes, apparently, that there is but one wage-rate: that all units of the factor\nlabor get the same remuneration. Here lies an inexorable dilemma. If he does\n10t make this assumption, then an increase in the low wage-rate will not bring\nabout an equi-proportionate rise in prime costs (even if all prime costs are \"labor\"\nCosts) , and his argument collapses.

Long-run curves of individual demand\nand cost are flatter than commonly represented, and the imperfections of competition corre-\nspondingly less. Industry subject to fluctuating demand requires prices in excess of short-\nrun marginal cost. Favorable conditions appear to include a sloping individual demand\ncurve, and some uncertainty whether a reduction of price will be promptly met.\n\nWith standardized products, a chaotic market tends toward ruinous competition. Pure\noligopoly is seldom found; the important case being that of openly-quoted prices with\nvarying amounts of deviations on actual sales. Standard products with sloping individual\ndemand curves are also possible.\n\nWhile extreme quality differentials approach monopoly, more moderate ones may be\nworkably competitive, especially with further growth of closer substitutes and better\nknowledge of qualities on the part of buyers.\n\nIL. Introduction\n\nTheories of imperfect and \"monopolistic\" competition have for some\ntime been current, in an unformulated state, in the field of economic policy;\nand important beginnings have been made at formulation by economic theo-\nrists. \u00c1s a necessary step in this last development, the conception of \"perfect\ncompetition\" has itself for the first time received really specific definition\nand elaboration. With this has come the realization that \"perfect competi-\ntion\" does not and cannot exist and has presumably never existed, for\nreasons quite apart from any inescapable tendency toward collusion, such\nas Adam Smith noted in his familiar remark on the gettings-together of\nmembers of a trade. What we have left is an unreal or ideal standard\nwhich may serve as a starting point of analysis and a norm with which to\ncompare actual competitive conditions.

The introductory chapter discusses busi-\nness situations as they are apprehended by the business-man; distinguishes\ngroups of external factors that affect economic change; lists the statistical\nseries that may be used advantageously in continuous observation of the busi-\nness conjuncture; and ends with the expected conclusion that empirical link-\ning of factors and symptoms, as reflected in time series and other data, is\ninsufficient for the understanding of economic change, since observation of\nactual economic processes cannot distinguish between interwoven causes and\neffects. To make causal analyses a theoretical apparatus is indispensable.\n\n'This theoretical apparatus is presented in chapters 2 through 4. Chap-\nter 2 deals with equilibrium and the theoretical norm, 7.e., with the sta-\ntionary economy. Chapter 3 presents the entrepreneur, the innovation, and\nthe banking system\u2014the triple alliance that contributes a strategic impetus\nto economic evolution. Chapter 4 comprises the crux of Professor Schumpe-\nter's theory of business cycles, indicating how the behavior of entrepreneurs\nprovides the primary model for use in the study of business cycles; how this\nprimary model is complicated by consideration of secondary factors (errors,\npropagation through the credit system, etc.), and of the various types of\ncycles to which the primary and secondary factors give rise. These three\nchapters are to a large extent a summary of Professor Schumpeter's earlier\nwritings on the nature of a stationary economy and the theory of economic\nchange. But in chapter 2 comments on imperfect competition take account\nof recent developments in the field; and in chapter 4 business-cycle theory\nis expanded and extended materially beyond the somewhat bare statement\nof it in Professor Schumpeter's earlier writings.\n\nChapter 5 in Volume I discusses the bearing of the theoretical model\nupon the measurement of cycles in time series.

The\nrepercussions were national in scope and set into action various measures of reform to\ngive relief to home owners. This paper presents a summary of the activities of the Federal\nHome Loan Bank System, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, the Federal Savings and\nLoan System, and the Federal Housing Administration. The influence of these agencies on\ninterest rates is discussed, followed by an analysis of the justification of the existing rate\nlevel.

It is\ncommonly assumed that, with the correction of the existing abnormalities,\ninterest rates will inevitably be adjusted. However, the uncertainties of the\nassumption cast doubt upon any early realization of the deduction made.\nNot only is this true because of the unknown duration of these so-called\nabnormalities, but, in addition, various controls which have been developed\nwill likely continue to function over a much longer period.\n\nThe prevailing level of interest rates may also be questioned when related\nto the underlying forces of the demand for, and the supply of, capital. Many\ninfluences affecting these primary determinants of the cost of money en-\ncourage the conclusion that the present low level of interest rates is not\njustified in the light of economic conditions. Risks which are so comprehen-\nsive as to cause concern for the safety of the entire economy would seem\nto point in the direction of a rate sufficiently high to afford compensating\nprotection for those who supply the capital.

(See Supplement, March, 1940, p. 227.)\n\nIn manufacturing industries and in bituminous coal mining, wage rates since 1933\nhave been greatly increased and hours of work have been substantially reduced. Proponents\nof these changes have insisted that such wage and hour policies would increase total pur-\nchasing power and increase employment. The evidence presented below does not sub-\nstantiate these claims. In fact, employment in bituminous coal mining was lower in 1937\nthan in 1929 when production was not so great, and employment in 87 manufacturing\nindustries was slightly lower in 1939 than in 1929 when production was about the same.\nIn bituminous coal mining and in manufacturing industries money payrolls were about\n10 per cent below those of 1929, although, owing to a decline in the cost of living, real\npayrolls were higher than in 1929.\n\nA more detailed study of bituminous coal mining shows the changes in per capita in-\ncome, employee productivity, mechanization, costs, and sales income that were associated\nwith increases in wage rates and decreases in hours that were introduced beginning in 1934.\n\nThere is no one wage and hour policy to which all unions subscribe.\nGenerally speaking, unions like most employers sell their product at the\nbest price and under the best conditions that they can obtain. What price\nthey can command depends on many factors. In the short run if the in-\ndustry is a profitable one, as for example petroleum refining and automobile\nmanufacturing, and if the union has substantial bargaining power and its\nleadership is able and aggressive, relatively high wages and short hours\nof work may be attained. On the other hand, if the industry is faced with\nruinous competition and overdevelopment, as for example in cotton and\ncertain other textile industries, particularly if the scope of union organization\nis not industry-wide, the workers will have to content themselves with\nrelatively ow annual earnings and with relatively long hours.\n\nOther factors which affect wage and hour levels are (1) the character\nof the demand for the product, that is, whether the demand is elastic or\ninelastic, (2) the proportion that labor costs constitute of the total cost\nof production, (3) the economic organization and financial structure of\nthe industry, (4) competition from substitute products, (5) general busi-\nness conditions, and (6) the relation of capacity to demand. Because of the\noperation of these factors, wage and hour levels and policies vary by regions,\nmarkets, industries, and often establishments.\n\nIn a number of industries, unions, like employers in numerous instances,\nhave successfully maintained the price of their product during periods of\ndrastic deflation. In the anthracite industry, for example, the union has not\ntaken a single wage reduction since the Award of the Anthracite Strike\nCommission of 1903 and in the building and construction industry it is not\nuncommon for organized crafts to retain their nominal wage rates during\nperiods of depression.

In case of bank\ncredit, the real lenders are the depositors including, notably, the recipients of checks.\nIt is these whose convenience waiting is combined and co\u00f3rdinated by the banks and made\navailable to borrowers who pay for free banking service to depositors. The 100 per cent\nreserve scheme would make this free service impossible unless subsidized and might con-\nceivably bring disappearance of deposit banking. Subsidization objected to; perpetual\ngovernment debt as means to idea of 100 per cent objected to. Why precisely 100 per cent?\nA sacred number? Possible resulting growth of new type of financial institution through\nwhich we could still get deflation. Why henceforth deprive depositors of possibility of\nfree banking service?\n\nA number of economists who favor a managed currency, with the idea of\npromoting stabilization of the general level of prices, have accepted\u2014a little\ntoo uncritically, I think\u2014the idea of 100 per cent reserves. Objections\nwhich I cannot but believe have some importance, seem to have been gen-\nerally overlooked.\n\nOne of the principal features of commercial banking, as we know it\ntoday, is free service to depositors, whereby business can be carried on by\ncheck and the clerical work of transferring credits from the makers of\nchecks to the depositors of checks is done without fee\u2014though the depres-\nsion has brought in, to some extent, the service charge. It is because the\nbanks have been able to \"lend more than they have,\" because, in short,\nthey have not been compelled to maintain a 100 per cent reserve, that they\nhave been able to render this service to depositors without charge.\n\nOf course the banks do not really lend more than they have, except as\nintermediaries or agents for the real lenders. What the banks do is to\nbring borrowers and lenders together. And the lenders are the bank de-\npositors. Let us suppose the banks to lend, in the aggregate, several times\nas much money as they have on hand. The borrowing accomplishes nothing\nfor those who receive the deposits until they use their newly acquired credit\nfor the purchase of goods, by writing checks on this credit. When they\nhave done this, they no longer have claims on the lending banks. But the\nrecipients of their checks have these claims. Clearly, the banks could not\nthus lend more than they have on hand and have the lending mean any-\nthing, if the recipients of the checks drawn on this credit were, every one\nof them, to insist at once upon taking the money out of the banks. I/ ir\nIhe recipients of tbe checks, therefore, wbo are really the lenders. They\nhave given up tangible goods or services and are waiting for payment.

This is true particularly with\nrespect to the relative variability of the several items of cost. When the four main divisions\nof expense for the Class I railroads are compared with the variations in traffic volume\nover the period from 1922 to 1938, it is found that the items which vary most closely\nwith traffic are actually those which have commonly been presented as comprising the\nlargest \"constant\" components (and conversely).\n\nThis failure of the facts to support the common pronouncements results from the im-\nplicit assumption of standards which are essentially rigid. This assumption, and the pro-\nnouncements based upon it, do not hold for periods longer than approximately a month.\nWhen considered over a longer period the variable element in all operating costs stands\nout as the dominant characteristic. This has some significance in connection with the\ndoctrine of increasing returns; for the extent to which costs are variable directly affects\nthe increase in returns, as the volume of traffic increases.\n\nThe point has been made frequently that fixed or constant costs absorb\nan abnormally large portion of the income of a railroad. The term \"con-\nstant costs,\" as used here, refers to those elements in the expenses of a\nrailroad which are essentially independent of, or not functionally related\nto, the volume of business handled. This constant characteristic has been\npointed out particularly with respect to maintenance expenditures, and\ngeneral expenses. Ripley has said \". . . only about two-thirds of the total\nexpenditures of a railroad are applied to operation, the remaining third\nbeing devoted to capital account. Moreover, of these two-thirds of the\ntotal applied to operating outlay, only about one-half responds to azy\nchange in the tonnage, the other half being constant up to a certain\npoint.\"* What this point is Ripley does not say. He admits that the state-\nment implies a given standard of service, and maintenance, as well as a\ngiven stage of technological development, but apparently does not consider\nit necessary to develop the point. That the \"constant costs\" grow with\nthe growth of traffic over a period of years, however, is implicit in his con-\ntention that they remain about two-thirds of the total.\n\nThe use of the term \"constant\" in referring to any costs is dangerous\nbecause it suggests an invariability which does not exist, even for relatively\nshort periods. Moreover, no costs are altogether independent of the volume\nof business. Given a certain volume of business, on the average, for a\nperiod of time, then certain expenditures will be made whether that volume\nof business is moving at the moment or not. But in any business the cost\nof production is affected by variations in the volume of product; and this\nis true for a// costs when the variations are large, or extended over a con-\nsiderable period of time. Railroads are not essentially different from other\nenterprises in this respect.\n\nThe difference in variability among the several elements of cost is\nessentially relative. The relation of costs to the volume of traffic may be\neither direct or indirect. This more accurately states the difference between\n\n!W. Z. Ripley, Railroads, Rates and.

Such questions are not isolated, but fit into a pattern\nof development which will be different for different teachers. The teacher is not so much\nan advocate of views as he is a reporter on observations. The honest teacher makes himself\nthe ally of history as he understands it; believing that after all economics is an art rather\nthan a science, he necessarily makes room for deliberate social purpose.

Consider the\ndissent from classical doctrine inspired by American geographical and eco-\nnomic conditions at the beginning of the last century. Here was a country\nnot of decreasing but of increasing returns, in which accessions to popula-\ntion meant not resort to poorer natural resources but to richer, with the con-\nsequence of a larger product for each worker. Instead of growing economic\nstringency, as in old countries, there was progressive liberation. In place of\nattention to the division of labor, association of labor was the need.

The issue of confisca-\ntion was not involved.? If, in the future, complaining public utilities plead the\n", "procedural point of view, evidence of cost of reproduction may be considered\nas having received adequate weight if it is carefully examined, even though\nthe evidence is found to be without force. But it does not follow that evidence\nof cost of reproduction would be given sufficient weight in a confiscation case if\nit were merely carefully examined. Here the courts look to the actual results in\ndollars and cents, and it might very well be that a commission's refusal to give\nactual weight to cost of reproduction would result in rates unfairly low in the\neyes of the court. The force of the O'Fallon decision, in fact, is that the cost\nof reproduction must receive weight in the final result, provided, of course, that\nthe evidence is substantial.*\n\nHad the issue in the Pacific Gas and Electric case been one of adequacy of\nrates, the decision of the Court might have been different. So much seems to\nbe implied by the following words: \"Respondent was entitled to contest the\nvalue thus placed upon its properties, or any part of them, to insist that the\nvalue taken as the rate base was too low, and that in consequence the prescribed\nrates were confiscatory. That was the issue upon which the court below should\nhave passed.\"\n\nWhile it may be true that a majority of the Supreme Court does favor historical\ncost, it can hardly be said that the Pacific Gas and Electric case establishes this\nfact. There is yet no reason to conclude that the Court has necessarily departed\nfrom its position in the Los Angeles Gas case, where it said: \"And mindful of\nits distinctive function in the enforcement of constitutional rights, the Court\nhas refused to be bound by any artificial rule or formula which changed condi-\ntions might upset.\"5 It appears that \"fair value\" is still a matter of judgment\nsubject to judicial review.\n\n\"P .

BIGHAM\nUniversity of Florida\n", "352\n", "[June\n", "Communications\n"], "1": ["Comment on the Pacific Gas and Electric Case'\n\nIn the December, 1939, issue of the Review there appeared an article which\nconsidered, along with other matters, the significance of the recent decision of the\nSupreme Court of the United States in the Pacific Gas and Electric case? The\nauthors summarize their conclusion in the following words: \"It may be inferred\nthat a majority of the Supreme Court now looks with favor upon the use of\nhistorical cost as the rate-base. No other conclusion is possible in view of the\nfact that the California Commission in this latest case expressly declared its\nadherence to historical cost and that it flatly refused to give any consideration to\nreproduction cost. . . . It seems rather clear that if the reasoning in this case is\nconsistently followed, there will be few, if any, occasions on which a rate order\nbased upon historical cost will be disturbed by the Supreme Court.\"? Since this\ncondusion might be taken to mean that the Supreme Court is at last ready to\nplace its stamp of approval upon the use of historical or original cost in confisca-\ntion cases, the discussion of this important decision should be carried a step\nfurther.\n\nThe question before the Court was not one of confiscation, but of procedure.\n\"As the District Court did not deal with the issue of confiscation and the\nevidence is not before us, we are concerned only with the question of procedural\ndue process, that is, whether the Commission in its procedure, as distinguished\nfrom the effect of its order upon respondent's property rights, failed to satisfy the\nrequirements of the Federal Constitution.\" And the particular procedural point\nin dispute related to the method by which the California Commission arrived at\nits result. The Commission had considered evidence as to cost of reproduction,\nbut in fixing the rate base it had given weight and effect solely to historical cost.\nThe precise issue was whether the refusal of the Commission to give weight to the\ncost of reproduction constituted a denial of procedural due process of law.\n\nThe Court held that the procedure of the Commission did not deny the com-\npany due process. It found that the Commission had duly weighed the evidence\nas to reproduction cost, and had cast it aside as unsatisfactory; but that it had\nnevertheless based its valuation upon ample evidence. \"The Commission was\nentitled to weigh the evidence introduced, whether relating to reproduction cost\nor to other matters. The Commission was entitled to determine the probative\nforce of respondent's estimate. That the Commission did so is apparent from\nboth its statement to that effect and the reasons it gives for considering these\nestimates to be without positive value. . . . Nor did the ruling with respect to the\nweight of evidence as to reproduction cost leave the Commission without\nevidence of the value of respondent's property. We have frequently held that\nhistorical cost is admissible evidence of value. . . . In the instant case we cannot\nsay that the Commission in taking historical cost as the rate base was making a\nfinding without evidence and therefore arbitrary.\"\n\nIn other words, this decision only reiterates a well established principle of pro-\ncedure\u2014namely, that it is essential to examine and give appropriate weight to all\npertinent evidence of value, so that a decision will not be arbitrary.

What I plan to tell you\ntonight reflects largely, though not I hope too explicitly, what the process\nof policy-formulation did to his academic theorizing, and what his theoriz-\ning failed to do to the process of policy-formulation.\n\nAs an active participant in the policy-making process, the academic\ntheorist suffers from a number of handicaps more or less peculiar to him-\nself. For purposes of teaching, or of acceptable writing for his restricted\naudience of fellow-theorists, his conclusions are of little importance; and\nwhat matters above all is the rigor and elegance of his manner of reaching\nthem. For policy, on the other hand, conclusions are vital, and often are\nall that is vital. For the purposes of academic theorizing, the premises\nthe theorist starts from may without serious penalty be arbitrarily selected,\nnarrowly restricted in range, and purely hypothetical in nature. But the\nselection of premises controls the conclusions reached, and for policy-\ndetermination it is therefore vital that all the important variables be\ncovered by the analysis, and that the conclusions be not affected by the use\nof premises which are irrevelant for their purposes or less realistic than\nit is possible with the aid of available information to make them. To vio-\nlate these rules in policy-making is to be guilty of the grossest irresponsi-\nbility.

The attempt to maintain a fixed price for any com-\nmodity which may rise, but not fall, in money value, is, in the long run, all but hopeless.\nImportant paper currencies were stronger than the gold currencies so long as they were\nkept flexible in gold value but they became at least as vulnerable as any gold currency\nwhen a relative fixity of exchange rates was sought and, still more, when a rise in their\ngold value was precluded and a fall regarded with equanimity or deliberately designed. A\nflexible exchange value of a currency, within a not very narrow zone around the \"point of\nequilibrium,\" is essential to forestal] the success of bear speculators and defeat of the\nexchange policy. The vulnerability of a currency to speculative attacks is coeval with other\nweaknesses in any currencies yet adopted. A money with a goods, rather than a gold, reserve\noffers the greatest promise not only of invulnerability but also benefaction.\n\nThe international gold standard has now, for some years, been moribund,\nif not dead. It is true that the United States, in somewhat unconvincing\nfashion, still proclaims its adhesion and allegiance to the royal metal. So\nfar, however, as money is concerned, it is in no better state than China used\nto be when it had a metallic monetary standard (silver), of equal virtue\nwith gold, maintained in isolation from the rest of the world.\n\nFor many decades the allegedly outstanding advantage of the gold stand-\nard was its international character. One or the other (or both) of the great\ninternational currencies, the pound sterling and the dollar, was always\nsynonymous with gold, and adherence to gold therefore meant stable ex-\nchange rates against at least one of these important currencies. With the\ngeneral abandonment of gold standards, the advantage of automatically\nstable exchange rates is now lost except, possibly, for the dollar as against\nthe Belgian franc.' In purchasing power, gold has not, over a lengthy pe-\nriod, been more stable than silver, and it has not been as stable as a well-\nmanaged paper currency. The maintenance of a gold standard which is no\nlonger used in the bulk of international transactions therefore involves\ngold-standard countries, in equa] degree with silver or paper-using nations,\nin the uncertainties of exchange, and, in possibly greater degree, in the un-\ncertainties of price levels. No authentic gold currency, nor any potential\nbloc of such currencies, is likely to take the former or present place of\neither the pound or the dollar in international transactions, so that, while\npresent conditions continue, the dollar or any similar near-gold currency is\nsubject to all the exchange vicissitudes which affect its neighbors. Gold has,\nmoreover, rather less potential stability in real value than of yore. There\nnow seems little reason, therefore, for giving gold a place, of rig^t, in our\nmonetary system.\n\nThe international gold standard fell in an epidemic of Midas' disease\n\n! Exchange rates are, of course, a two-sided matter and no stability of any one cur-\nrency, in gold value or anything similar, will now, of itself, provide stability in the rate\nof exchange against other currencies. The Belgian currency, however, is, rather uncertainly,\ntied to gold; and the dollar-belga rate is substantially stable.\n", "This content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Wed, 19 Jan 2022 01:25:43 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Frank D.

This theory, based on a\nconfusion of the markets for re/a/] goods and agricultural products, on the one hand,\nand the markets for retail sites and farm lands, on the other, seems definitely invalid.\nThe markets for both retail sites and farm lands are imperfectly competitive; and the\nrent, in both cases, is an imperfectly competitive return.\n\nLand ownership has often been referred to as a monopoly. Adam Smith's\nwell known dictum that \"the rent of land . . . is naturally a monopoly\nprice\" was followed, in some cases with modifications, by Malthus, Senior,\nJ. S. Mill, Henry George, and by a few recent economists. This doctrine\nhas not hitherto met general acceptance, but Professor Chamberlin has\nrecently given it new prestige in his TPeory of Monopolistic Competition\nin which he has formulated the novel theory, that while agricultural rent\nis a purely competitive return, urban rent is a \"pure monopoly return.\"\n\nProfessor Chamberlin finds many differences between agricultural land\nand urban land, and between agricultural rent and urban rent. He contends\nthat a business site confers no advantages analogous to superior fertility in\nagricultural rent; that one site \"is capable of Producing as large a quantity\nof retailing services as another\u2014there are no differences in fertility and no\nscarcity whatever of the best land in this respect\"; that marginal and sub-\nmarginal land anywhere\u2014 practically free land\u2014is as \"fertile for selling\nputposes\" as the best shopping site in New York City. Urban rent, which\nis entirely location rent, is quite different even from location rent of farm\nland; for the location rent of farm land is due to differences in the cost of\ntransportation to the market, but the urban land \"carries its market with it.\"\nThe market for agricultural products is purely competitive, allowance being\nmade for differences in transportation costs; there are many buyers and\nsellers, as required for pure competition, and any seller can dispose of an\nindefinitely large amount of product at the prevailing price. \"The retail\nmarket, on the other hand, contains monopoly elements, for the factor of\nconvenience differentiates the product spatially.\" Since buyers do not move\nabout with entire freedom, the owner of any particularly convenient site,\naccording to Professor Chamberlin, has a monopoly of the use of the site,\nand receives a monopoly rent. His site affords a market which is, to a degree,\ndistinct from the whole; and the amount of product he can dispose of at\nthe prevailing price is not indefinitely large\u2014as in pure competition.\n\nIt is not difficult to agree with much of Professor Chamberlin's argument.\nIt is quite true that the advantages afforded by good business sites are dif-\nferent in some respects from those afforded by good land; that low-rent sites\n\n\"Third ed., pp. 112, 113, and Appendix D.

The Report of the Committee on National Debt and\nTaxation (1927), the Economics of Taxation. (1924) by Harry Gunnison Brown, and\nFirst Principles of Public Finance (1936) translation, by de Viti de Marco, are among the\nnoteworthy exceptions. \u00c0merican writers in public finance generally have emphasized the\ndescriptive aspects of particular death duties.\n\nNo less than four different conclusions of death duty incidence may be distinguished.\nThese vary from the view that death duties are without burden, provided that substantially\nthe whole of the estate is taken by such taxation, to conclusions that the incidence of death\ntaxes is on the predecessor, the successor, or jointly, and in indeterminate proportions upon\nboth the predecessor and the successor.\n\nThe view of incidence which it is believed may be most strongly supported is that the\nburden of death duties, including taxes directed to the estate as a whole as well as the\ndistributive shares, is upon the predecessors. Incidence from this point of view is inter-\npreted with reference to the immediate burden of such taxation, and is distinguished from\nthe subsequent economic and other effects which result therefrom.\n\nAlthough of ancient origin! and of major fiscal importance in the\nmodern economy, there has been rather limited consideration, on the\nwhole, of the problems of death-duty incidence and economic effects.?\nAn important exception is found, however, in the investigation of the\nCommittee on National Debt and Taxation, which directed no small part\nof its attention toward these aspects of the British estate, legacy, and suc-\ncession taxes.

Allowance must be made for\nvarious possibilities in the shifting of indirect taxes and for differences in the tax systems of\ndifferent states. That fortunate few (1.4 per cent) whose incomes exceeded $7,500 paid\none-third of the nation's taxes. An analysis by taxing divisions shows the median income for\ndividing the tax burden equally above and below was $2,600 for the nation as a whole,\n$2,000 for state and local taxes (Illinois), and $15,000 for federal taxes. The lower income\ngroups paid a higher percentage of the tax burden than the percentage of the national\nincome which they received,\n\nThe questions of who pays our taxes and who should pay them are peren-\nnial. Economists have long discussed the question of tax shifting to explain\nwhy certain taxes are or are not a burden upon the immediate payers thereof.\nThe reasoning has been largely a priori and only in the past few years have\nstatistical investigations been made. To correlate one of those studies with\nrecent findings on income distribution and draw further conclusions is the\npurpose of this paper.\n\nIn Facing tbe Tax Problem and Studies in Current Tax Problems the\nTwentieth Century Fund (hereafter: TCF) has published the results of an\nextensive investigation into the tax burden of ten \"typical\" representative\nfamilies of different income classes.* Separate calculations were made under\nfive different shifting hypotheses. Federal, state, and local taxes as of 1936\nwere analyzed to determine their probable incidence on the families selected.\nAs a result of extensive computations, Professor Newcomer and her asso-\nciates under the Fund derived conclusions regarding the total tax burden\nper family. The findings were expressed both in terms of dollars and as\npercentages of total incomes that would have been received had no taxes\nbeen shifted.\n\nValuable as this study is, it does not afford an answer to the question,\n\"What percentage of the total tax burden of the country is borne by the\npeople of different income classes considered as groups?\" Wealthy people\noften allege that they are paying most of the cost of government. Occasion-\nally they change their tune and try to arouse popular disapproval of gov-\nernment spending by claiming that all taxes are shifted to ultimate con-\nsumers and that therefore the poor, being the most numerous, shoulder\nthe tax burden of the country.\n\nLegislators are also interested in this question. It is not enough for them\nto know the TCF estimate that the man with a $1,000 income pays ap-\nproximately 10 per cent of his income in direct and hidden taxes and that\nthe $5,000 man pays 20 per cent.

More significant\nis a marked concentration of corporate wealth. In 1922 the 100 largest non-financial\ncorporations owned less than a third of all non-financial corporate assets; by 1936 the\n100 largest firms owned almost half of such assets. The trend toward concentration has\nbeen even more pronounced in the field of banking. It is to be noted, however, that\npolitica] centralization of economic controls in recent years has come to overshadow the\nsignificance of authority resting on formal ownership.\n\nIn one of his leading speeches on the Fascist Corporate State, Premier\nBenito Mussolini undertook to give his listeners \"a broad outline of the\nhistory of capitalism during the past century.\"* This required a definition:\nCapitalism . .. is a specific mode of production, a system of industrial produc-\ntion. Capitalism in its most highly developed form is a mode of mass\n\nproduction for mass consumption, financed in mass through the national and\ninternational issue of joint-stock capital.\n\n\"The touchstone of \"advanced capitalism,\" then, is large-scale industrial\nand financial joint-stock enterprise. In the course of his address, the Duce\nasked: \"Is Italy a capitalistic country?\" and replied:\n\nIf by capitalism is meant that complex of usages, customs, technical progress\nnow common to all countries, we can say that Italy too is a capitalistic country.\nBut if we go more deeply into the matter and examine the situation from a\nstatistical standpoint . . . we then secure data that enable us to say that Italy is\nnot a capitalistic nation in the current sense of the word.\n\nHe cited statistics on the economic structure of the Italian population, in-\ndicating a zmerical predominance of agricultural and small industrial\nenterprises. \"You see at once from this survey how varied and complex is\nthe Italian economy, and why it cannot be identified with any one type;\nespecially so as the 523,000 manufacturers are almost all at the head of\nsmall or medium-sized concerns.\" That is, in Mussolini's opinion Italy is\nnot \"capitalistic\" because small-scale (and presumably non-corporate)\nenterprise is numerically outstanding in its business-industrial system.\n\nUnfortunately, the paucity of data on national wealth and income\u2014\nand, furthermore, on the employment and production of corporate and\nnon-corporate enterprises\u2014makes it difficult to throw a direct and com-\npletely revealing light on the significance of joint-stock companies in the\nItalian economy.?

American foreign-trade policy to New\nDeal domestic policy must be based upon a clear understanding of the\nnature of the two policies which are in comparison.\n\nThere is little difficulty in a statement of our present foreign-trade\npolicy.' Essentially it is designed to broaden trade by a process of negotia-\ntion of trade agreements with other countries to reduce trade barriers. The\nobjectives are both economic and political. No discussion of the economic\nobjectives is required before an audience of professional economists\u2014there\nis no proposal in the field of economic policy for which so nearly unani-\nmous support can be found in the profession. The political objective\u2014\nthe development of an atmosphere in international relations in which\npeaceful intercourse between nations becomes somewhat more probable\nor possible\u2014is open to more serious doubt. Few will question the objective\nitself; but qualified students of international relations might well wonder\nwhether an expansion of international economic intercourse which was not\naccompanied by a strengthening of the international political and juridical\nframework in which the trade relations will develop, might not rather\neasily promote a variety of international contact that might lead to inter-\nnational conflict, if no provisions were made at the same time for mech-\nanisms and institutions of adjustment which would render such conflict\nharmless from the standpoint of the preservation of peace.

The system under consideration is a closed economy\noperating at less than full employment and with imperfections both in the factor markets\nand in the commodity markets. Under these conditions, a minimum wage is likely to in-\ncrease the economy's propensity to consume. Whether the total volume of employment will,\non balance, be maintained, diminished, or increased depends upon whether the increase in\neffective demand flowing from the heightened propensity to consume equals the decrease in\neffective demand caused by factors whose influence is adverse. It seems probable that the\nestablishment of a moderate minimum wage would create more consequences favorable to\nthe maintenance of the level of employment than unfavorable. Though price advances may\nresult, the real income of the persons covered by the legislation will be raised. Whether\nthe real incomes of other members of society will be altered is difficult to foretell, the result\ndepending upon the extent of the price changes and upon whether or not the level of\nemployment is maintained.\n\nMost books and articles dealing with the subject of minimum wages are\ndescriptive or argumentative works concerned chiefly with some specific\nlegislative act. In addition to works of these types there are several in\nwhich some attempt is made to give a theoretical explanation, of more or\nless general applicability, of the economic effects of minimum wages.\n\"There is neither space nor necessity for detailed criticism of this literature,\nand it will suffice to indicate the reasons for believing that further study\nof the subject is necessary:\n\n(1) Until very recent years, almost all theoretical discussions of wages\nand employment have been founded, consciously or otherwise, upon as-\nsumed conditions of perfect competition and full employment. The use of\nthis hypothesis is entirely valid, provided its implications are thoroughly\nunderstood and the limitations they impose squarely faced. But failure to\ndistinguish clearly between this analytical model and the real world has\ntoo often led writers to content themselves with making casual statements\nabout the effect of minimum wages upon \"cost\" and equally uncompre-\nhensive declarations about the consequences of changes in cost.?

Although the wages fund\nis mainly of historical interest in economic theory, it has generally been supposed that it\nrepresented a subject on which professional economists made a contribution to public\nopinion of mid-nineteenth century England. Study of the views of a great variety of\nindividuals as presented in reports of a British Royal Commission in 1867-68 indicates\nthat the discouraging conclusions of economists on the success or justice of trade-union\naction to raise wages were not widely known. Individuals and groups to whose interest\nsuch professional opinion would have been favorable were not familiar with it. John\nStuart Mill, a prominent public figure at the time and a wages-fund theorist, has been\nthought to have relaxed the severity of his conclusions in later years, but examination\nshows that he did not give up the basic concept of the theory.\n\nIt is tradition that during the middle years of the nineteenth century the\ntheoretical views of economists were popularly applied by the British\npublic to the efforts of trade unions to raise wages. The generally ac-\ncepted wage theory at the time was that known today as the \"wages fund.\"\nWages were supposed to have been paid from a fund of capital in the\nhands of the capitalist-employer. For a given period of time, a year for\nexample, the size of this fund was fixed. It was a corollary of this proposi-\ntion which was applied to oppose trade-union action dealing with wages.\nIf one group of workers increased its share by pressure of a strike, some\nother group of workers somewhere would have to take less; only a certain\ntotal amount was available for wage-carners. In the history of the de-\nvelopment of economic theory it has been represented that this theoretical\nargument of the ranking economists was used by the general public or\n\"informed middle-class opinion\"! to demonstrate the futility or inequity of\nstrike action over wages. The theoretical views of economists were sup-\nposed to have given this lead to popular thought. Examination of evidence\navailable shows that these theoretical arguments of economists were not\nwidely known to the general public, and were practically unknown to\ngroups with an immediate interest in a wages economy.\n\nRicardian economics is the basis for the wages-fund theory, but John\nStuart Mill is considered to have given it the most concise and generally\naccepted expression in his Principles of Political Economy, first published\nin 1848. His much-heralded \"recantation\" of the theory in 1869 is con-\nsidered to mark its d\u00e9nouement. Cairnes's reassertion of the doctrine and\nits implications for trade-union activities in 1874 is looked upon as a dying\ngasp. It was during the middle years of the century, corresponding to the\nperiod of Mill's pre\u00e9minence as an economist, that the general public is\nsupposed to have been most interested in the economists' theoretical views\non wages.
