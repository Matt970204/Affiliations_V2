By \"foreigners,\" Mill does not\nmean foreign producers of products subject to duties when sold abroad.\nA case might be made for the view that duties are sometimes shifted\n\"backward\" to the producers of taxed items. It might be argued where\nduties are imposed upon sugar imports, for example, that the price of\nsugar received by foreign sellers would decline relatively to the price in\nthe absence of the tax and that, therefore, they are bearing at least part\nof the burden. Discussions of the burden of import duties have some-\ntimes been conducted along these lines? But Mill's views are quite\ndifferent from these. He would deny that foreign producers might be\nforced to bear even a part of the burden of import duties of sugar-using\ncountries and states positively: *It is the foreign consumer of our ex-\nported commodities who is obliged to pay a higher price for them be-\ncause we maintain duties on foreign goods.\"?

Compulsory Licensing Legislation\n\n\"The base of the patent systems throughout the world is the principle\nof conferring on the inventor the absolute right of excluding others,\nduring the lifetime of the patent, from in any way practicing the\npatented invention. This right of exclusive exploitation of the invention\nis granted to the inventors for the purpose of encouraging inventive\nactivity and of furthering the development of the inventions, tending,\nhowever, by all means toward the ultimate end of promoting the general\nwelfare; the reward to the inventor is no more than a fair and agreeable\nmethod to attain that final result.\n\nIn industrial countries another dominant consideration is to assure\nthe early disclosure of the invention to the public. Especially the patent\nsystems of the United States and Great Britain are based on the theory\nof getting information, for in order to obtain a valid patent, the inventor\nmust fully disclose the secret. This is a crucial requisite for the benefit\nof society as a whole, since all knowledge divulged by the patent is\nopen to public use when once the patent has expired. (Authoritative\nGerman experts admit that, in order to understand the essence, the\n\"real meat,\" of the invention described in a German patent specifica-\ntion, it is often necessary to consult with the corresponding United\nStates or British specifications.) Moreover, conferring the exclusive\nright on the patentee fulfills still another purpose that exclusively serves\nto the interest of the public, in forcing the industry to carry on research\nwork tirelessly, for fear of being anticipated by another inventor which\nwould exclude competitors for seventeen years from the newly opened\ndomain. This function of the patent system is recognized as its pri-\nmary justification from the viewpoint of public policy because of pro-\nmoting industrial progress more than anything else.\n\nSuch personal monopolies vested in owners of patents are bound to\n\n* Theauthor, onetime member of the Austrian patent office and practicing patent attorney,\nis co-author of a widely used Code annotated on Austrian patent law, Vienna, 1926, and has\npublished a series of treatises on fundamental questions of Austrian and German patent laws.\nHe came to this country in 1941.\n"}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Richard Reik"], "stable_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1801800"}, "1801801": {"affiliations": {"found": "A consequence of the methods used in financing the war has been the\nacquisition of a tremendous amount of government securities by the\nbanking system of the country.

The Consequences of Large Bank Holdings of Government Securities\n\nProfessor Leland's main argument rests upon the contention that the\nindependence of bank action resulting from large bank holdings of\ngovernment securities weakens the effectiveness of measures for con-\ntrolling inflation and arresting the development of deflation. Whenever\nthey want to expand loans, banks have only to sell government securities\nor to allow some of their holdings to run off; to increase excess reserves\nin critical times, they need only to follow a similar course. To the\nTreasury such independence is dangerous because of the size of the\nfloating part of the debt and because of the prospective continuation of\ndeficit financing in view of the \"aftermath\" of war and the possibility of\ndepressions in the future.

Pre-War Trends in Economic Thought\n\nEconomics is sometimes regarded with some show of envy by other\nsocial scientists because of its reputation for having a more precise\nanalytical discipline than they have ready to their hands. This is no\ndoubt in a degree true, but the advantage is not at all times very clear\nto economists who are struggling against the weaknesses and imper-\nfections of their discipline and trying out exploratory innovations. So\nfar has the experimental spirit carried during the past three decades\nthat it is hardly correct to say that there exists an agreed discipline of\neconomic analysis. Rather there is a series of more or less inter-related\ndisciplines in a degree complementary, in a degree competitive, with\nsome difference of opinion concerning what is complementary and what\ncompetitive.\n\nSince all sciences except mathematics are compounded of a body of\nobjective phenomena, a body of analytical method wherewith to estab-\nlish or state the relations between phenomena and a statement of estab-\nlished relations, an essential preliminary to analysis is to delimit the\nphenomena or aspects of phenomena which are the subject of analysis.\nIt is perhaps in the supposed existence of an economic criterion or\nbenchmark, even more than for its analytical technique, that economics\nhas been the object of envy. This criterion was historically the principle\nof value\" based upon rational self-interest. Since, however, the curios-\nity of economists has not been limited to aspects of phenomena falling\nwithin that principle, the boundaries of the science remain vague, in\nparticular as they encompass the non-rational areas of behavior and the\nareas of collective action, or as they comprehend relations which are\nnot to be approached through a psychological principle.\n\nA great deal of what is included within the scope of economic litera-\nture does not, in fact, involve very much in the way of theoretical anal-\n\n* This paper was written by request for inclusion in a forthcoming volume dealing with\nsocial and humanistic disciplines, 19391945, soon to be published by the American Council of\nLearned Societies.

Federal taxes should be reduced from wartime levels, but should be\nhigh enough to meet all post-war government expenditures.\n\n2. Taxes on corporations and the income derived from them should be\ndrastically revised: (a) so that each shareholder is taxed once but only\nonce on the earnings belonging to his shares; (b) so that income derived\nfrom business corporations is taxed the same as income derived from other\ntypes of business or from other sources; and (c) so that distribution of ea1n-\nings to shareholders is encouraged rather than inhibited but making it pos-\nsible for corporation managements to retain a reasonable proportion of\nearnings when funds are needed for capital expansion.\n\n3. Since the taxes supporting social security benefits are no longer closely\nrelated to those benefits, those taxes should be combined with the regular\ntax system, with extension of social security benefits if this change in taxa-\ntion results in inequitable burdens on some classes in the population.\n\n4. Taxes on capital gains ought to exempt income previously taxed which\nhas never been distributed to the owner, but to tax like other income those\ngains which represent income not previously taxed.\n\n5. Taxes on estates, gifts, and income derived from trusts need revision,\nbetter integration with each other, and better integration with the indi-\nvidual income tax.\n\n6. Most of the numerous excise or sales taxes should be abolished.\n\n7. Some method is needed of averaging personal income taxes over a\nperiod of years, in order that persons with highly irregular incomes from\nyear to year, or receiving in certain years income representing the results of\nwork done over a period of years, will not be taxed un\u00edfairly.\n\n8.

On the basis of this\nhuge backlog of liquid assets (bonds, deposits, currency) some economists\nand business analysts have predicated markets for consumer goods. Notable\namong this group is Professor Sumner H. Slichter, who prognosticated post-\nwar markets under the assumptions of whether savings would be ''hot\" or\n\"warm,\" assuming different degrees of price and wage controls.! Despite the\nattention devoted to the holdings of liquid assets by individuals, which will\nobviously influence the national consumption function, insufficient con-\nsideration has been given to the distribution of accumulated savings among\nthe various income groups or to the attitudes of holders of these savings.\nBefore a sound quantitative appraisal can be made of the translation of this\npotential purchasing power into effective demand, information of this charac-\nter is needed. Such factors as liquidity preferences of individuals and the\nmarginal propensity to consume suggest questions which must be con-\nsidered before an hypothesis of post-war markets can be made on the basis\nof the accumulated aggregate savings of individuals.\n\nIt is the purpose of this paper to depict the wartime pattern of expendi-\ntures and savings by income classes, and to examine the significance of this\nempirical evidence as these factors relate to the forecasting of new markets.\n\nIL.

This committee not only estab-\nlished ten subcommittees on the varied phases of the subject with a total\nof seventy-eight members and consultants but also sponsored a lively dis-\ncussion of undergraduate teaching at the 58th annual meeting?\n\nThe most recent attempt to raise the level of teaching took the form of\n2 Conference on the Teaching of Economics at The American University,\nAugust 19-31, 1946. At this conference, fourteen distinguished professors\nof economics discussed objectives and effective methods of teaching for\ntwo weeks with eighteen instructors from all sections of the country and\nfrom Canada. Special features of the meetings included a demonstration of\nvisual methods of presentation, lectures on government sources of informa-\ntion, a book exhibit and several social affairs. The entire fifty-five hours of\nthe discussion was recorded. The conference was organized by the Teaching\nInstitute of Economics at The American University, which is operated\nunder a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. At the same time it\nrepresented an experiment by thesubcommittee of the Association on The\nTraining of Teachers of Economics.\"\n\nEven for the group of leading college teachers, the conference had con-\nsiderable value. Separated as they are, they would not ordinarily consult\nwith each other on teaching problems for more than a few minutes a year\nduring the annual meeting. For the younger teachers, the experience was\nunique. Seldom does an economist have a chance to review the currents of\neconomic thought as they affect teaching with a group of experienced\nteachers who are paying attention to his problems.\n\nNo attempt was made to formulate the wide range of thoughts and sug-\ngestions expressed at the conference into any series of resolutions or findings.\nMajor attention was given to the introductory course, not only because that\ncourse is crucial but also because, illogically, most colleges assign this most\ndifficult job of teaching to their least experienced teachers. A good deal of\nattention was devoted to the sequence of undergraduate work, to the teach-\ning of economic history and to the special needs of business, government\nand agriculture. At every point the questions of teaching technique were\ndiscussed in close relationship to the broad aims and philosophy of the\nsocial sciences and to the real needs of students.\n\n1 The college curriculum in economics has received some recent attention, for example,\nby Horst Mendershausen, R.

This shift reflects contradictory impressions\nderived from a first reading of the book, impressions that paralleled\nand reinforced those derived from reading other work of the same kind.\nHere is an obviously first class intellect at work; yet the analysis seems\nunreal and artificial. Here is a brilliant display of formal logic, abstract\nthinking, complicated chains of deduction; yet the analysis seems more\nnearly a rationalization of policy conclusions previously reached than\na basis for them. What is there about the type of theorizing employed\nthat makes it sterile even in the hands of so competent a practitioner\nas Lange?\n\nLange's book is an excellent example to use in examining this ques-\ntion, precisely because it is, within its own frame of reference, so good.\nThere is no magic formula for wringing knowledge about complicated\nproblems from stubborn facts. No method is proof against incompetent\napplication. The merits of a method of analysis can be judged only when\nit is carefully used by a master of it. Lange is clearly a master of what\nwe shall later term taxonomic theorizing, and he has used it in this book\nto examine carefully an important problem. The book is, therefore, a\ngood text for a methodological sermon.\n\nI. Summary of Lange's Analysis\n\nLange seeks to answer the following question: Granted that the\ndirect effect of a fall in the price of an underemployed factor of pro-\nduction is to increase the employment of that factor, what indirect\neffects may frustrate or reinforce this direct effect? There are, of course,\nan indefinitely large number of possible sources of indirect effects.\nLange analyzes five: (1) changes in the demand for and supply of\nmoney (Chap. IV), (2) changes in expected future prices (Chap. V),\n(3) uncertainty (Chap. VI), (4) imperfect competition (Chap. VII),\n(5) international trade (Chap. VIII).

But it seems unlikely that all these factors would enable the\nUnited States to maintain full employment after the transition period\nwithout a substantial budget deficit. . . . \"\n\nThis is the gist of Mr. Kalecki's article on \"The Maintenance of Full\nEmployment after the Transition Period,\" which appeared recently in the\nofficial organ of the International Labour Office.! More specifically, the\narticle suggests that full employment in the United States in 1950 presumes\na budget deficit of 13 billion dollars and an export surplus of 2 billion dollars?\nor some other combination of deficit spending and export surplus totaling\n15 billion dollars. Although the arguments of the article are not more\noriginal than its conclusions, it deserves attention for three reasons: first,\nbecause it appears under the sponsorship of an influential international\norganization; second, because it is typical of an economic school that was\nfairly influential in Washington until its forecasts were exposed to the test\nof checking with facts; third, because it appeared after this embarrassing\ntest had been completed.\n\nThe reasoning of the article rests on the well-known observation that the\nnet national income may be represented in two ways: either as a sum of\npersonal consumption, public expenditure for goods and services, net private\ninvestment, and export surplus; or as a sum of personal consumption, taxes\navailable for public expenditure for goods and services, and savings. Sub-\ntracting private consumption and taxes from both aggregates, one finds\nthat, apart from minor adjustment factors, savings (S) must equal the sum\nof net private investment (7), export surplus (E), and budget deficit(D).\n\nFrom the tautological formula (S \u20141IJ-E--D) other equations showing\nthe relationship between the same four items may be deduced, all equally\ntautological and none providing any insight into the mysteries of the\nmodern economy.

Much of\nthis work has been done by personnel of Gosplan (the State Planning Com-\nmission) and the Institut Ekonomiki (Institute of Economics of the Acad-\nemy of Science of the U.S.S.R.), as well as by economists attached to various\nother governmental organs.

The Cohen committee rejected these alternatives, recom-\nmending that shareholders be required to state, on signing a transfer or\ndirection to the company, whether they are beneficial owners or not; that\nif any person is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of one per cent\nor more of the issued capital, he must make a full declaration to the com-\npany. In addition, the Board of Trade would be provided with drastic\npowers to investigate the ownership of shareholders whenever it is con-\nsidered desirable in the public interest.\n\nIn relation to other matters, the committee's proposals are drastic, es-\npecially as to the secretiveness of company accounts and the responsibility\nof directors. It was not generally known, before the inquiry, that the propor-\ntion of private to public companies had been steadily increasing in recent\nyears. The great advantage of the private company, the fact that it need not\nfile its accounts with the Registrar of Companies, has led many public\ncompanies to convert their subsidiaries into private companies. The\nAmendment Committee has suggested that no private company can claim\nexemption from filing accounts if its membership includes a body corporate\n(other than a corporation sole), or if a body corporate is benefcially in-\nterested in its shares. Although this recommendation permits the private\nfamily company to go unhampered, it stops abuses on the part of public\nfirms. In addition, holding companies are to disclose full information about\ntheir subsidiaries by publishing consolidated accounts. On the presentation\nof accounts generally the committee follows the suggestions of the Institute\nof Chartered Accountants, coming out strongly against hidden reserves and\nfor greatly enlarged financial statement data.\n\nOne major weakness of the Companies Act, 1929, was that directors were\nonly liable for untrue statements in a prospectus. The Amendment Com-\nmittee recommends that they should be liable at civil law also for misleading\nstatements and for the omission of material information which may be mis-\nleading. It will also make the expert liable for any untrue or misleading\nreport which he formally allows the directors to include in a prospectus.\nAdvertisements for \"*placings\" are to be put on the same footing as pro-\nspectuses.\n\nIn framing its report, the Company Law Amendment Committee has\navoided making any proposal which would restrict honest business manage-\nment, and it has endeavored to provide every possible impetus to increased\npublicity of financial facts. The balancing of these objectives, each with its\nproper emphasis and with relation to the nation's expanding peacetime\neconomy, transforms what might otherwise have been a dry state paper into\n\u00e0 well-conceived approach to the reform of major deficiencies in prevailing\nCompany Law. The incorporation of the Cohen committee's recommenda-\ntions in British statutory law should be facilitated both by their moderate\ntone and by the gravity of the business, accounting, financial and managerial\nweaknesses they seek to correct.\n"], "1": ["1946] COMMUNICATIONS 659\n\nRevision of British Company Law\n\nThe English Company Acts, revised at periodic intervals to place limited\nliability enterprise under state scrutiny, have been subjected to recent de-\ntailed criticism by a committee of inquiry under Mr. Justice Cohen, a judge\nof the King's Bench Division of the Supreme Court of Judicature. This\ncommittee, composed of distinguished members of the bar, economists, ac-\ncountants and business men, was appointed by the Board of Trade to con-\nsider and report what major amendments were desirable in the Companies\nAct, 1929, and in particular to review the requirements prescribed in regard\nto the formation and affairs of companies and the safeguards afforded in-\nvestors and the public. Its report, published in June, 1945, has elicited wide\ncomment in both Britain and America as it provides one of the best reviews\nof traditional and contemporary accounting and corporate practice in the\nformer country. In addition, the committee proposes reforms, some con-\nservative, others drastic, for blatantly outmoded or illegitimate business\nprocedures, but it has skillfully avoided \"placing unreasonable fetters upon\nbusiness which is conducted in an efficient and honest manner,\" while\nmaking sure that \"as much information as is reasonably required shall be\navailable to shareholders and the public.'?\n\nThe Labor Government has accepted the recommendations of the Cohen\ncommittee in full and is preparing a bill to give effect to them. Before this\nmeasure is introduced in Parliament, however, companies are urged to\nbring their practices in line with the committee's proposals, a suggestion\nwhich has been followed by a number of prominent firms.\n\nThe Cohen committee expresses satisfaction that the great majority of\nof public and private limited liability companies are managed honestly and\nare of marked benefit to British trade and industry. The fullest practicable\ndisclosure of information concerning the activities of companies, in its\nopinion, will lessen the opportunity for abuse and coincide with an aroused\nSocial consciousness. The suggestions of the Amendment Committee have\nbeen aimed at aiding shareholders to exercise a more effective general con-\ntrol over the management of their companies, although they indicate that\nthis aim will be attained **more by selection of the proper governing body\nof each company than by the provisions of any statute.\"\n\nWhen viewed in its entirety, the Company Law Amendment Report is\nseen to stress that the future system of private enterprise must operate with\ncomplete honesty and with full publicity. When considering all aspects of\nbusiness and accounting practice, including company managements, the\ncommittee has attacked each subject with equal intensity except, perhaps,\nthat of the increasing use of nominees for shareholdings. So widespread, in\nfact, has this procedure become that in 1943 over 600,000 individual hold-\nings of stocks and shares were registered in the name of nominees of joint\nstock banks alone.

The case for non-price rationing in Russia\nis much the same as the case for rationing in wartime in capitalistic coun-\ntries. In both types, the pattern of income is unequal and the rich would,\nin either case, consume unduly at the expense of the poor.\n\nUnder socialism, it is doubtful whether consumers can be taxed by a\nturnover tax levied by the state upon its own agencies. Taxation implies\nthat someone is forced to give up something to the state which he would\nhave retained if the state had not exercised its taxing power. The \"turnover\ntax\" does not do this. A state sales tax upon products sold by state agencies\nisan insistence by the central administration that the accounting practice of\nthe trusts label part of the profits \"tax receipts\" instead of simply \"profits,\"\nand the tax may act as an administrative instruction to change prices of\nproducts. Only the price change can be significant, and it has significance\nas a decision to ration more or less by price and less or more by direct\nmeans. Given the price policy of the government, the \"tax\" is purely\nnominal in character and can scarcely be regarded as being a burden to any-\none.\n\nIf this point of view is correct, the tax should not be regarded as a weapon\nto \"force mobilization of the community's savings.\" If, with increases in tax\nrates, state agencies charge higher prices, the action has the effect of ration-\ning relatively more by price and, in addition, it takes more money out of the\nhands of the public. With less money, people may spend less in the future\nand thereby reduce the work-load of non-monetary rationing devices and\nincrease the relevance of price as a rationing device. Thus, it seems to me\nthat the turnover tax should not be considered as one of the more important\n\naspects of the Soviet financial system.\nTian. Dornenk\n"], "1": ["1946] COMMUNICATIONS 661\n\nMr. Sumberg's Interpretation of the Soviet Turnover Tax\n\nIn the March, 1946, issue of this Review, Mr. T. A. Sumberg in his article,\n\"Soviet Union's War Budgets\" provides a valuable summary and analysis\nof Russian wartime finance. In speaking of the \"turnover tax,\" Mr. Sum-\nberg states: \"The tax is the main financial instrument by which the Russian\nstate curtails consumption in order to promote capital construction and\nnational defense. Offering no possibility of evasion by the taxpayer-\nconsumer, it is also an efficient weapon for the forced mobilization of the\ncommunity's savings in the interest of rapid industrialization and urbaniza-\ntion.\"! This statement suggests a point of view which, it seems to me, should\nnot be left unchallenged. It is dif\u00fccult to understand how the tax can\noperate to curtail consumption. The allocation of resources in Russia as\nbetween production for war and for civilian purposes has been determined\nby direct rather than by financial means. The over-all plan predetermined\nwhat resources were to be devoted to war needs and what to civilian uses.\nIf by \"consumption,\" is meant \"real\" consumption, it is not clear how the\nturnover tax made any difference in the quantities of civilian goods made\navailable to the general public. Soviet civilians would not have had more\nfood if the tax had not been imposed.\n\nOne may also question whether the tax should be regarded as borne by\nconsumers. In a socialistic state, the price of products sold by the trusts are\nestablished by administrative rule. Whether the tax raises prices depends\nnot upon the tax itself but, rather, upon the accompanying instructions, if\nany, to trust price-fixers as to what price changes are to be made. If no price\nchange is made with the imposition of the tax, the taxis without significance.\nA change would be made in accounting terminology only. Instead of all of\nthe net return of the trusts being called \"profits,\" a part would be called\n\"turnover tax yield\" and the remainder, if any, \"profits.\" Such a procedure\nwould alter labels, not substance.\n\nThe Soviet practice appears to adjust prices in accordance with changes\nin the rates of the turnover tax. Even in this event, the tax itself is also of\nlittle significance; what is important is the decision to charge the public\ndifferent prices. In a setting of diminishing supplies of real things, Soviet\nofficials were forced to decide to what extent to employ price and to what\nextent to employ direct controls to ration the limited supplies among the\nmembers of the public. A decision to ration by price alone would call for\nraising prices under such conditions. The price policy of the government is\nimportant because it determines to what extent monetary mechanics\n(money expenditures and prices) are to be used to ration available supplies to\nthe public. Whatever its price policy, it seems untenable to hold that the\ncivilian population as a whole would be worse off, even if prices were set so\nhigh as to make all non-monetary rationing devices, such as rationing cards,\nselected admittance to special stores, standing-in-line, unnecessary. The\npopulation as a whole would get the same quantities, but a decision to use\nprice alone to ration might, and probably would, have given some people\n\n1 Am. Econ.

CaRL POINDEXTER*\n", "Recent preoccupation with the issues of fiscal policy and the na-\ntional debt has engendered widespread interest in the collateral prob-\nlem of possible fiscal techniques for minimizing the debt and tax\nburdens associated with prevailing financial practices.\n\nAs is well known, the process of bank-credit creation has long pro-\nvided the basis for an irrepressible philosophy of monetary reform\nwhich would eliminate interest payments on government debt arising\nout of government borrowing from commercial banks. The arguments\nof its adherents run as follows: The coinage and regulation of money\nis an exclusive and sovereign prerogative of government; government\nborrowing from commercial banks is not \"genuine borrowing\"; the\ngovernment should not be obliged to pay, in perpetuity, hundreds of\nmillions a year to the banks for the deposit currency which the banks\nsimply manufacture and turn over to the government in exchange for\nits bonds; if a fiscal policy which involves the creation of new money\nis to be pursued, the government, rather than private issuing agencies\n(banks), should enjoy the seigniorage on the new money issues. In\nother words, most exponents of these views relating to present fiscal\npolicy regard government interest payments to the banks as wholly or\npartly unearned and, at least, a partially unnecessary burden on the\ngovernment and the taxpayer. They insist, therefore, that if the banks\nare to be permitted to create the funds which they advance to the gov-\nernment, a new, fiscally less burdensome method of compensating\nthem for manufacturing credit for the government should be instituted.\n\nOne possible and representative method calls for the issuance to the\nbanks of special, non-marketable, non-interest-bearing securities. This\nmethod contemplates that, in return for the monetization of each se-\ncurity of a given denomination, the banks be paid a \"reasonable\"\nservice charge at the time of issuance, but nothing in the way of interest\nthereafter. The criterion of repayment of even the principal of such\nsecurities would be inflation control, not contractual obligation.\n\nAs safeguards against possible inflation, the more subtle proponents\nof this sort of fiscal innovation propose that the monetary authority be\ninvested with plenary powers over reserve requirements, open market\noperations and, in addition, the power to impose special taxes to re-\ntrieve inflationary excesses in the money supply.\n\n'\n* The author is professor of economics at Roanoke College.\n", "This content downloaded from 128.235.251.160 on Thu, 1 Jan 2015 05:16:10 AM\nAII use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["J.

The\nallocation of these resources among the various spheres of enterprise,\nthe combination of varieties of one resource with varieties of another\nresource, the substitution of one resource for another, and the division\nof income between consumption and saving, are central in achieving\nmaximum satisfaction with the resources at hand.\n\nUnder capitalism the guide to the distribution of resources among\nthe channels of economic activity is price, the price of consumer goods\nand the price of the resources, labor, land and capital, in a setting\nof free enterprise and competition. We balance utilities against costs.\nTo use a few simple examples, in competitive equilibrium the fact\nthat price equals minimum average cost implies that the least expendi-\nture of resources is incurred to obtain a utility; the assertion that\nthe inefficient producer drops out of competition means that the\nproducer who uses up more resources than other producers in order\nto get the same result is eliminated; and when a high cost and high\nprice are associated with small purchases of a given commodity, the\nidea is that, because a given utility necessitates a large use of.re-\nSources, it is enjoyed sparingly.\n\nIt is doubtful whether Adam Smith, Ricardo and their early fol-\nlowers, from whom Marx learned much of his economics, put this\nprinciple at the heart of economic analysis. To Smith the central prob-\nlem of political economy was efficient production, to Ricardo the\nexploration of the principles of the distribution of income. The place\nof utility. was not prominent in their minds. Smith goes no farther\nthan to mention that all production is evidently for purposes of con-\nsumption;* Ricardo goes no farther than to state that if goods are to\nbe produced at all they must be useful. To Marx economics is pre-\n&minently a study of class exploitation in a given society in its evolution\nto the next, higher, social order, and the object of the economics of\ncapitalism specifically is the investigation of the principles governing\nthe exploitation of the proletariat, the fatal maladies of the system,\nand its dialectic disintegration into socialism and communism.

While actual labor markets are obviously far from perfect, one\nis still inclined to believe that some such tendency toward wage equalization\nis operative. |\n\nIt is always somewhat disturbing, therefore, to observe the great variety\nof rates for apparently comparable jobs which prevails in actual labor\nmarkets. The National War Labor Board has during the past several years\ncollected the rates paid by different firms for certain \"key occupations\" in a\nlarge number of industrial areas. Inspection of these data indicates that\nthe highest rate in an area is usually at least 50 per cent and frequently\n100 per cent above the lowest rate for workers classified under the same job\ntitle.\n\n\"These differences in rates are of course not necessarily significant for wage\ntheory. Their significance could be determined only by correcting for all the\nconditions assumed equal in the theoretical problem. First, the workers\nwhose earnings are being compared may not be of equal ability or may not\nbe working equally hard. This could readily account for differences in piece-\nrate earnings, and even under time rates, inter-firm wage differences might\nbe offset by differences in the level of ability or effort required by various\nfirms. Second, jobs called by the same name may not be the same jobs and\nthe workers doing them may not be interchangeable.

The Need for a National Full-Employment and\nFull-Production Policy\n\nA number of economic models relating to the national budget\nrecently developed on the basis of pre-war income and expenditure\npatterns have demonstrated that severe depression in the years\nimmediately following the transition period is highly probable in the\nabsence of a national policy to assure full employment. From these\nmodels the economists have concluded that in the post-war period (1)\nnational policy must be directed toward changing the income and\nexpenditure patterns so as to increase private expenditures for con-\nsumption and tangible investment, and (2) the federal government\nmust assume the responsibility of adjusting its own outlays and\nrevenues so as to maintain aggregate expenditures on goods and services\nby both government and the private economy at the level required for\nfull-employment production.\n\nThe logic underlying these models will be indicated in a later section.\nThe conclusions derived from the models may, however, be arrived at\nin a very simple manner. In 1944 and the first half of 1945, the\nAmerican economy produced at an annual rate of about 200 billion\ndollars of finished goods and services for consumption, business invest-\nment and government use. Both the labor force and the output per\nmanhour have been subject to conflicting influences during the war,\nsome of which have tended to raise and others of which have tended\nto lower the gross national product. There is widespread agreement,\nhowever, that when these wartime influences are eliminated, the\nAmerican economy, in the years immediately following the transition\nperiod, will be able to produce the same total volume of goods and\nservices as it did at the peak of the war effort. Our capacity to produce\nin 1950, in other words, will be about 200 billion dollars gross national\nproduct in 1944 prices, and it will steadily increase thereafter as a\nresult of population growth and increases in productivity.^\n\n* The views expressed by Mr. Mosak are his own personal opinion and do not necessarily\nreflect in any way those of the Office of Price Administration.\n\nThe author is indebted to the following persons for their very careful reading of the\nmanuscript and their many helpful suggestions: Henry S.

This volume is in turn determined by\nvarious factors, among which two are by far the most important. One\nis the number of consumer units (single persons or families); the other\nis the amount of income which each consumer unit is able and willing\nto spend for these goods.

In this sense, some part of the tax tends to be shifted, in the\nlong run, to workers and landowners. This shifting, moreover, is not dependent\non any change in the general level of prices.?\n\nAs Mr. Goode suggests (p. 50), this conclusion is subject to qualification.\n\"The tax, through its effects on both investment and saving, may influence the\nlevel of national income. The level of national income, in turn, may affect\nthe return to the factors. Thus, the ultimate effects of the tax may differ\nfrom its immediate effects. Any conclusion as to whether the tax, on balance,\ninfluences income in the direction of expansion or contraction depends upon\nthe character of the fiscal policy which it is assumed would be adopted in the\nabsence of the tax.\n\nThe income effects of the tax, however, do not necessarily alter the conclu-\nsions regarding its effect on the return to capital. Because of the fact that the\ntax results in a relative scarcity of capital, the rate of return to capital would\nbe higher, at any level of income, than would otherwise be expected a\u00a3 zat\nlevel of income. In this formal sense, the tax would be shifted regardless of\nits effect on national income.\n\nIt is true that if the tax were expansionary, the increase in return to capital\nresulting from the increased income would offset, wholly or in part, the direct\neffect of the tax on the return to capital, On the other hand, if the tax were\ndeflationary, as seems more likely, the income effect would accentuate the di-\nrect effect of the tax on the return to capital. Or, if the deflationary effects of\nthe tax were offset by other elements of fiscal policy designed to stabilize\nthe economy, the tax could be said to have no net influence on national income.\nIn that case, its influence on the return to capital would be confined to its\ndirect effects, and at least some degree of shifting would result.\n\nMr. Goode touches on this argument when he states (p. 50) that the cor-\nporate tax would \"limit the capital available to corporations.\" But he passes\nover the point with the conclusion that a restriction in supply of capital would\nnot necessarily produce an increase in the general price level. He ignores any\npossible relation between a reduction in supply of capital and the shifting of\nthe tax via changes in the marginal productivity of capital.\n\nHowanp R. BowEN*\n\n?

On the basis of this conclusion, it is suggested that the tax is not shifted.\nWith certain reservations, it may be agreed that the corporate income tax\ndoes not produce higher prices. It does not necessarily follow from this, how-\never, that the tax is not shifted.\n\nThe federal corporate tax, in its present form, imposes a substantial levy\non all corporate income, but provides only partial recognition of losses\u2014\neither of operating losses or of capital losses, Thus, the effect of the tax is to\nincrease the risk of all investments where the offsetting of losses is uncertain.\nAs a result, the flow of investment tends to be impeded and the supply of capi-\n\n''\"Phe Corporate Income Tax and the Price Level?\" Am.
