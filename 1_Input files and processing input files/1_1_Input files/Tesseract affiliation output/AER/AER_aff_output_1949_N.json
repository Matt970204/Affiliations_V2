After a preliminary discussion of terminology,\nthe theory of uniform delivered prices will be sketched, tests of the\ntheory will then be examined, and finally the major implications of the\ntheory for economic policy will be drawn.\n\nI. Types of Geographical Price Systems\n\nThe price a buyer pays for a delivered commodity may vary con-\ntinuously with the distance of the point of delivery from the point of\nproduction, or it may vary discretely or not at all (zone price systems).\nThe chief forms of price quotation that lead to continuously variable\ndelivered prices are:\n\na. F.o.b. mill prices. The delivered price at any point equals the\nprice at the production center at which the purchase is made plus\nthe actual transportation charge to the point of delivery.\n\nb. Freight equalization. The delivered price at any point equals\nthe lowest sum of factory price plus transportation charges from any\nproduction center, even though the purchase is made at another\nproduction center.\n\nc. Basing point. This system differs from freight equalization in\nthat not all production centers quote mill prices.?\n\n\"These distinctions are quantitative, and not generic. If transportation\ncosts are a trifling fraction of delivered prices, all systems of variable\ndelivered and zone prices merge.* If there are mill price quotations\n\n?Professor A. Smithies, who falls in neither group, concluded that the basing point\nprice system did not in general maximize profits and, indeed, that it was comprehensible\nonly under special assumptions whose relevance to the basing point industries was not\ndemonstrated and is not obvious. See \"Aspects of the Basing Point Price System,\"\nAm. Econ. Rev., Vol. XXXII, No. 4 (Dec., 1942), pp. 705-26.\n\n*]f one does not wish to treat importation points as production centers, a second\ngeneral difference is that not all points of mill price quotation are production centers.\n\n*Zone prices will also emerge in a continuously variable delivered price system if\ntransportation costs do not vary continuously with distance: for example, in the late\n'thirties Douglas fir had the same transportation cost from the Pacific Northwest to all\npoints north of the Ohio River and east of Chicago, so equality of price in this region\nwas consistent with f.o.b. mill pricing. Such exceptions are eliminated if we define distance\nas economic distance.\n"

A number of books have\nbeen published (particularly by the former Institute of World Economy and World\nPolitics), and hardly a journal issue comes out without at least one article devoted\nto economic conditions and economic thinking in the United States. A study of these\nwritings offers the American economist the unique pleasure of seeing himself\nand his environment in a peculiar mirror, thouch the images, to put it mildly, may\noften cause surprise; it also gives him valuable information both for the under-\nstanding of the Soviet Union and for the understanding of himself.\n\n\"The article translated here appeared in the Tuly-August (No. 4) 1947 issue of the\nSoviet journal Planned Economy (Planovoye Khozyaystvo), which is published\nbi-monthly by the State Planning Commission (Gosplan). It was selected for trans-\nlation because of its interest: in a rather short space, the author covers some of\nthe most important ideas discussed in Western economic literature in the works of\nSchumpeter, Hansen, Keynes, Ezekiel and others. The interpretation of these\nideas by a Soviet economist is most instructive. But I hope the reader will avoid\nthe error so often made by Soviet economists in regard to our own literature, that\nis, of treating this article as \u00a3Ae official pronouncement on the subjects covered.\nThough the range of economic opinion in the Soviet Union is much more narrow\nthan in the United States, differences as witnessed by sharp debates (such as the\nVarga discussion) do exist. Mr. Ayzenshtadt's essay is not unrepresentative, though\npossibly it is more imaginative than the average. Vet I earnestly hope that the\nreader will abstain from generalizing too readily about Soviet economic literature\non the basis of this one paper. Translations of Soviet economic works are beginning\nto appear; perhaps this article will be followed by others. There will be plenty of\ntime for generalizations.\n\nA few remarks about Soviet economic periodicals may help to set this paper in its\nproper perspective. The so-called professional journals in this country are essen-\ntially written by economists for economists. The Soviet economic periodicals, on the\nother hand, concentrate not so much on the development of economic science as\nsuch, but rather on the interpretation, with a definite political objective, of eco-\nnomic and statistical information for a more general audience. In his interpretation\nof economic facts and ideas, the Soviet economist is not supposed to treat his ma-\nterial with impartiality and objectivity; the latter word has acquired an invective\nmeaning in the Soviet Union. His r\u00f3le is that of an intellectual crusader, actively\nengaged in the building of socialism at home and in combating its opponents (\"un-\nveiling\" is the favorite term) abroad. Yet an economist cannot help being a scientist,\n\n* Tran:lated by Evsey D. Domar, associate professor of economics, The Johns Hopkins\nUniversity.\n"

                    "Rejoinder\n\nThe central feature of the monetary and fiscal framework for economic\nstability outlined in the article criticized by Dr. Neff is that it dispenses as\nmuch as possible with discretionary action and relies almost entirely on auto-\nmatic reactions. While Neff does not discuss explicitly the relative merits of auto-\nmatic and discretionary action\u2014of *rules\" vs. *authorities\"'\u2014it is clear that\nthis is the basic issue between us. To Neff, *even in a flexible price world . . .\ndiscretionary counter-cyclical policy is necessary. In a world of rigidities and\nfrictions such policy is even more essential.\"\n\nI shall first comment on this basic issue and then turn to Neff's explicit\ncriticisms: (1) that *admittedly price and wage rigidities destroy the virtue\nof the proposal\"; (2) that my analysis of the proposal \"assuming flexible\nprices and minor lags contains errors so important that the virtue of [the]\nanalysis is lost.\"\n\n1.

                    "Final Comment\n\nMy difference with Professor Friedman is not based upon the belief that\nall fiscal and monetary policy should be discretionary, that \"authority\" is to\nbe preferred over \"rule\" in every instance. Indeed it would be as impossible\nto establish a monetary and fiscal system completely devoid of \"rules\" as to\nprovide ironclad guarantees against any future discretionary action. I feel\nrather that some discretionary action will be required, particularly in view of\nprice rigidities and volatile expectations. Friedman, in his rejoinder, considers\nthe central feature of his proposal to be the fact that *it dispenses as much as\npossible with discretionary action and relies almost (my italics) solely on\nautomatic reactions.\" Thus both of us apparently believe that discretionary\naction will have a significant r\u00f3le to play, in spite of the virtues of a logical\nfiscal and monetary system. .\n\nThe supplementary discretionary policies called for by the failure of the\neconomy automatically to right itself are several. Friedman himself (pp.\n253-54) describes deflationary conditions which monetary inflation would\ncorrect, while the contribution which may be expected from a discretionary\ngovernment investment program has been the subject of extensive literature\nover the last decade and a half. It is possible that Friedman and I would dis-\nagree on what particular action would be appropriate to given circumstances\nbut his suggestion in the rejoinder, *that to be successful the authority must\ntake action largely counter to that being taken by the rest of the community,\"\nleads me to believe that even on this we would not be far apart.\n\nFriedman and I agree that price rigidities and lags complicate counter\ncycle policies, but disagree with respect to their significance. I hold that\nwhenever price rigidities defeat automatic adjustments, whether these adjust-\nments be those resulting from Friedman's proposal or those that are now\ninherent in the system, discretionary action can provide some contribution to\nfuller employment. That lags will reduce the effciency of either automatic\nor discretionary action is quite clear, but Friedman's belief that his proposal\nminimizes lags is not convincing. Surely the change in variables that brings his\n\"'correctives\" into operation could be relied upon as a guide for policy.\n\nIn my earlier reply to Friedman's article I failed to comment on his cor-\nrectives (1) and (3) because they already operate in our system, and al-\nthough I appraise their strength somewhat less than some economists, I wel-\n",

According to him \"The\ntax-peng\u00d3's creation was quite empirical; it did not follow from any pre-\nconceived ideas. Its purpose was to guarantee tax revenues\" (p. 539).\n\nThis is not the whole truth. The reason for introducing the tax-peng\u00f3 as\nmoney of account was to enable the National Bank through the valorization\nof credits to grant credits justified both on general grounds and in the par-\nticular case and, at the same time, to prevent the firms from making profits out\nof the depreciation of the currency brought about by the inflation which at\nthat stage was considered to be unavoidable. The war destroyed the real\nworking capital of the firms while the inflation destroyed their monetary\ncapital. Restarting production was impossible without providing credits, for\nwages had to be paid. The reparation deliveries require special consideration.\nA large part of the reparation goods consisted of machinery requiring long\nproduction periods. To finance their production, credits or advances were\nnecessary. Accounts could be settled, of course, only after the delivery of\nthe goods and it seemed just that the credits and advances granted should\nbe valorized in one way or another lest the firms should make inordinate\nprofits.

Dr. Ackley seems to feel that\nunder azy circumstances raising the market rate of interest will \"reduce\ninvestment.\" This is a widespread misconception of Keynesian theory. In-\nflationary \"forced saving\" is, of course, one way\u2014possibly the characteristi-\ncally socialist way (vide Russia)\u2014of getting capital formation.

Raising the rate to an equilibrium figure,\nunder such circumstances, will not reduce the amount of realized noninfla-\ntionary investment. It will only cut off the margin of attempted investment\n\"causing\" the inflation! If we want more investment, without more inflation,\nthen we want to increase the rate of ex ante saving\u2014which is the point I\nstarted off with. The appropriate interest rate then would be the one rationing\nthe increased flow without inflation.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to remind my readers that my communica-\ntion referred to the secular problem.

This, however, does not a\u00edfect secular policy.\nIf private saving-investment would be needed again soon (and they will\nbe if we adopt intelligent policy), we would be very foolish to liquidate the\ninducement to save for the sake of a short-run crisis.\n\nDavr\u00bb McConp WnicHT\n",

                    "Inflation and Equality: Rejoinder\n\nProfessor Ackley impliedly concedes the basic factual assumption of my\npaper: the marginal propensity to save of the well-to-do is greater than that\nof the lower-income groups. He also (end of his sixth paragraph) spells out\ncorrectly my fundamental contention and concedes its logical validity. I did\nmean that the flow of net private investment ought to be (secularly) higher,\nand I do feel that the present aggregate net private (secular) inducement\nto invest, still more particularly that for risk-taking new ventures, under our\npresent tax-wage-price control outlook, is only adequate where the (propor-\ntional) secular level of consumption is very high\u2014too high.\n\nBlaming the inflation on \"excessive investment\" alone seems to me true,\neven formally, only as tautology. The real stimulus can come from the\nconsumption side. We might put the matter as follows: the people have\nbecome accustomed to demanding a certain rate of increase of real income.\nPrice control and restriction of investment might, for a time, halt inflationary\nprice rise. But real income might not be rising sufficiently. Therefore, there\nmight be demands for \"fourth-Cround\" money wages increases, etc., which\ncould start the inflation going again. Sometimes eliminating all saving-invest-\nment might not suffice to meet the demand for present consumption.\n\nSince Dr. Ackley concedes my basic point, the real question becomes, as\nhe says, one of values.! For brevity's sake I must discuss his main point only.\nDo not Dr. Ackley's doubts as to whether there is a \"welfare case\" for a\nhigher rate of investment imply a sort of \"iron law of consumer satisfaction\"?\nOf course he does not commit himself to such a position, but would not the\nlogic lead to some such statement as \"all income levels are about equally\nsatisfying (or unsatisfying). Progress is a delusion.\"\n\nNow, if the public agreed, there would be no more to be said. But I believe\nin (1) democracy and (2) our duty as economists to help the people toward\nan informed choice. I say to the lower-income groups, *Vou want a rapidly\nrising standard of living. To get it more capital is needed, to get more\ncapital we need more investment.

On the aggregate level saving, defined as\nthe difference between personal income and consumer expenditures,\nwas usually expressed by one magnitude, either in billion dollars or in\nper cents of income. It was assumed that the most important variable\ndetermining both the amounts saved and the proportions of income\nsaved is the given income level. Numerous investigations confirmed\nthat years of high personal income were characterized by high saving\nand years of low income by low saving, occasionally even by net dis-\nsaving. According to the most recent estimates of the Commerce De-\npartment, consumer expenditures exceeded disposable personal income\nonly during the deepest depression, namely in 1932, 1933, and 1934.\n\nSimilar considerations were applied when the analysis was made on\nthe level of individual families. The results of expenditure surveys were\npresented in one continuum. Amounts saved were ranked from the\nlargest saver to the smallest saver, then to the \"zero saver\" (whose\nexpenditures equalled his income), then to the smallest dissaver, and\nfinally to the largest dissaver. It was sometimes assumed that the large\nsavers were, on the whole, the high-income people, and the dissavers,\nthe low-income people. The dissavers were considered the unfortunate\npeople who were unable to make ends meet and therefore were com-\npelled to reduce their assets (to consume part of their wealth) or to\nmortgage their future by borrowing. Not only aggregate and average\nsavings were assumed to increase with income, but it was also thought\nthat the higher the income, the larger will be the proportion of the\nsavers and the smaller the proportion of the dissavers.\n\nAre these assumptions generally valid or do we know of any excep-\ntions?

                    "Price Flexibility and Full Employment: Reply\n\n1. Both of Mr. Herbert Stein's corrections are well taken, and I am\nglad to have them on record. There are just a few comments I would like\nto make.\n\nMr. Stein seems to be hesitant about evaluating at market prices those\nbonds remaining unsold. I think this should definitely be done; so, in the\nexample he offers, M, should be considered as increasing from $110 to $119\nbillions. Once we adopt this approach, the possible effects of open-market\npurchases become still greater; for, through its effect on the interest rate,\nthe government will also change the value of assets other than government\nsecurities.\n\nEven apart from this last point, it should be recognized that the changes\nin M, and M, will not in general be equal. In the case of open-market pur-\nchases, the increase in M, equals the total amount of money expended for\nthe purchase of the bonds; the increase in M, equals the increased value\nof assets (both of those bought and those not bought by the government)\ncaused by the open-market operations. Corresponding statements can be\nmade for open-market sales.\n",
                    "faling prices and government deficits. This third method has important\nmechanical and political advantages that make it a valuable ingredient\nof stabilization policy.\n\n2. Mr. Patinkin defines M, as \"the sum of interest- and noninterest-\nbearing government debt held outside the treasury and central bank\" (p. 551).\nThis definition is used in the measurement of M, on page 559. The definition\nis defective in its treatment of gold and federal debt held by the Federal\nReserve Banks. Under this definition an inflow of gold, increasing the public's\ndeposits and member bank reserves would not increase M,. Neither would\nM, be increased if the Treasury sold securities to the Federal Reserve using\nthe proceeds to pay individuals who hold deposits. If the Federal Reserve\nis to be treated as part of the government, the Federal Reserve's liabilities,\nincluding member bank reserve balances, should be treated as government\nliabilities. If the Federal Reserve is not to be treated as part of the govern-\nment, the government's liabilities should include its liabilities to the Federal\nReserve.\n\nM, would be better defined as gold stock plus federal debt (interest-bearing\nand Treasury currency) held outside Treasury, minus Treasury deposits\nat Federal Reserve and other banks.

With this\ndebt amounting to more than $250 billion and comprising about 60\nper cent of all outstanding debt in the country, the foremost objective\nof our monetary policy has come to be *the maintenance of an orderly\nmarket in government securities\" and the prevention, or at least a\nlimitation, of the rise of yields on these securities, especially on the\nlong-term issues. Though the rise of this new objective has been the\nsubject of widespread discussion, the writer believes that its full im-\nplications are not generally appreciated. The purpose of this article,\ntherefore, is to trace the rise of this policy objective and to raise some\nquestions concerning its consequences.\n\nThe Evolution of the Policy before Pearl Harbor\n\nPrior to 1937 Federal Reserve purchases and sales of government\nsecurities were primarily for the purpose of influencing the volume of\nmember bank reserves and of member bank borrowings at the Reserve\nBanks. These were, of course, designed to affect interest rates, includ-\ning yields on governments, but the effects were expected to result mainly\nfrom changes in the ability and willingness of banks to lend and pur-\nchase securities. But in 1937, apparently for the first time as a major\npolicy objective, the Federal Reserve bought long-term governments\nfor the purpose of limiting their price decline. After reaching high\nlevels in late 1936, the prices of long-term governments and high-grade\ncorporate bonds began to fall early in 1937. This decline did not extend\nto Treasury bills and notes. The Reserve System thereupon initiated\nwhat it called its \"flexible portfolio policy,\" purchasing more than\n$200 million of the longer-term bonds and reducing its holdings of the\nshorter-term notes and bills by about $150 millions. The decline of\ngovernment bond prices was stopped and reversed.' By such operations\nthe System influenced directly\u2014not merely through its effects on bank\n\n* This material will become part of a broader study of the process of inflation in the\nUnited States since 1939, a study which the writer could not have undertaken without\ngenerous financial assistance from the Merrill Foundation For Advancement of Financial\nKnowledge, Inc.

The glucose cases\ndealt with the first issue and explicitly reserved the second. The cement\ncase was argued mainly on the second issue.\n\nIn the issue of the non-base mill, the writer has reservations as to the\nlegal reasoning used to deal with it in the glucose cases, but agrees\nwith the probable economic result, assuming that reasonable latitude\nis afforded for differences between different mill or base prices, and\nfor competitive freight absorption. As to freight absorption, he dissents\n(as will appear) from the legal reasoning on which Mr. Justice Black\nchose to rest his interpretation of the Robinson-Patman Act in the\ncement case, and sees objections to the resulting situation. These in-\nclude not only serious uncertainty as to what the law requires, but\ninherent dif\u00fcculty of clarifying it in a way that would avoid dangers\nof unduly rigid interpretation and enforcement, bringing unforeseen\nconsequences, and likely to entail costs out of proportion to probable\nbenefits. Objections apply also to law-making power exercised by the\nFederal Trade Commission, without proper accountability for the\nrisky legal and economic doctrines it is free to employ.\n\n* The author's past connections with the basing point question (now all terminated)\ninclude participation in the NRA study of iron and steel basing point pricing. Subse-\nquently, he was engaged with Professor A. R. Burns to make an impartial report on the\npricing system in cement, final completion of which was forestalled by the Federal\nTrade Commission's complaint against the cement industry, after which he consulted\n\nwith counsel for the Cement Institute. He is aware of no present obstacles to his speak-\ning with complete freedom, as an unattached individual.\n\n'The reader should note that I speak of \"phantom freight\" only with reference to\nthat charged by a non-base mill at points that are nearer to it, freightwise, than they\nare to the base that governs the delivered price. \"Freight absorption,\" as here used,\nrefers to a base mill, reaching out to sell in areas where the delivered price is governed\nby another base; and the first mill must accept a mill net less than its own base\nprice in order to sell there. So used, the terms have unambiguous meaning. As some-\ntimes used, the distinction becomes clouded, because base prices at different bases may\nor may not be equal, and a non-base mill may or may not be regarded as the limiting\ncase of a base mill with a base price so high as to be inoperative.\n"

This balance should pre-\nsumably be struck over any long period between long-run marginal\ncost and the marginal revenue from the long-run industry demand, and\nin any short period between short-run marginal cost and the marginal\nrevenue \u00edrom the saort-run industry demand.

Empirical studies of price\npolicy by monopolists or by oligopolists with apparently effective col-\nlusion on price, however, frequently fail to sustain these predictions.\nIn many such industries, short-run outputs at which short-run marginal\ncosts plainly exceed short-run industry marginal revenue are apparently\ncommon. But more striking is the evidence in some of these industries\nof prices lield persistently over many years within a range where the\nindustry demand curve is evidently inelastic, the corresponding margi-\nnalrevenue thus being negative and necessarily below long-run marginal\ncost.\" This indicates a prolonged tendency (potentially for a theoretical\n*]ong-run\") to hold price well below the level which would maximize\nthe difference between aggregate revenue from the sale of the industry's\ncommodity and the aggregate cost of producing it,* and apparently con-\ntradicts the basic a ?riori predictions of a theory of collusive pricing.\n\nThis apparent impasse has been variously resolved by students of\nindustry with suggestions: (a) that sellers do not try to maximize\nmonetary profit; (b) that they err in their attempt to maximize profits;\n\n* The author is associate professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley.\nHe is indebted to Professors H.

The subtitle of the volume to\nbe reviewed correctly stresses Keynes' izfluence, and the main title the novelty\nof his positions. The only misleading feature may be the juxtaposition of\nthe subtitle with the phrase **\u00a3he new economics.\" For it is amply evident, if\none compares certain appraisals of the General Theory, written ten or twelve\nyears ago and reproduced here, with the essays written for the present collec-\ntion,? that the former proclaimed the new doctrines confidently and without\nqualification, but that the latter\u2014as we shall see\u2014generally present more\nqualification and addition than original substance. How much Keynes con-\ntributed in his last major book depends on whether one stresses the impulse\ntoward new ideas and new lines of investigation, or, on the other hand, what\nhe actually Zeld in the General Theory. Thus Professor Hansen says:\n\"Keynes, however, contributed greatly to the theory of the rate of interest.\nAs a result of his analysis we now place less emphasis than formerly on the\nrate of interest as a means of increasing the volume of investment\" (p. 138).\nIn other words, although Keynes put interest at the very center of his theory,\nhe \"contributed greatly\" because we now recognize the limited efficacy of\ninterest rates. On the other hand, Leontief rather more candidly writes in\ngeneral appraisal of Keynes: 'He seemed to press, however, for reconstruction\nof the whole foundation in order to mend a leaky roof\" (p. 242).\n\nFurthermore, even so far as concerns the impulse to new ideas, one has to\nconsider the contributions made by Keynes! contemporaries, pre-eminently\nD. H. Robertson\u2014contributions too frequently attributed in the current\nliterature simply to Keynes alone. A re-reading of the Macmillan report, for\nexample, reveals the extent to which Keynes' ideas were anticipated by\nRobertson.\n\nThe New Economics is set together from ten chapters and a Keynes bibliog-\nraphy contributed by the editor, seventeen items available from earlier\nsources, and nineteen essays (beside the editor's) written for the occasion.\nFor one not conversant with the literature it would be dif\u00fccult to identity\nnew and old, since no indication of old sources is given in the main text;\n\n* The author is professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n!The New Economics\u2014Keynes Influence on.

It is the first British statute since the Statute of Monopolies\nin 1624 for the regulation of monopoly in general (as distinct from the con-\ntrol of the *natural\" public utility monopolies). Previously, monopolies were\nonly subject to such control as was provided by the common law.

It applies also if, by agreement\nor arrangement, goods of a particular description are not supplied at all in\nthe country or a substanial part of it (Clauses 3 and 4).
