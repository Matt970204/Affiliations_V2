Essentially the problem is\nwhether and by what means changes in relative prices of different kinds\nof consumer goods may influence aggregate demand for consumer goods\nand hence (with less than full employment) real income and employ-\nment, or (with full employment) the degree of inflation. Briefly, our\nanswer to the question is that such influence is indeed possible: that\nthere is no a. Priori basis in our ordinary theory of consumer behavior\nto exclude the possibility. We further briefly attempt to apply this\nanalysis to the questions, long discussed in theoretical literature, of the\neffects on income and employment of technological change and harvest\nvariations, and suggest its relevance to the current discussion as to the\nnature and stability of the consumption function.!\n\nThroughout the first three sections only verbal argument and (large-\nly in the footnotes) simple algebra are used.

Professor William Fellner, in his *Employment Theory and Business\nCycles,\" Chapter 2 of A Survey of Contemporary Economics (H. S. Ellis, Ed., Blakiston, 1948)\nconsiders essentially the same problem (pp. 84-86), but his solution runs in terms of elasticities,\na device which we feel substantially less well adapted to clear exposition of the problem.\n"

The five experts (John\nMaurice Clark and Arthur Smithies of the United States, Nicholas Kaldor\nof England, Pierre Uri of France, and E. Ronald Walker of Australia) have\ndeserved well of the economic profession in putting forth proposals that effec-\ntively refute familiar allegations regarding the ability of its members to reach\nagreement.

The fact that the\neconomic weather has once more turned about does not detract from the\nscientific merits of the report.\n\nThe resolute procedure of the authors naturally has imposed limitations\nand simplifications, all the more so because they were working under great\npressure of time. The report does not pretend to be a systematic study of the\ncauses of business fluctuations. Nor does it claim to offer a solution to all\ntypes of unemployment under all circumstances. For five authors whose pub-\nlished work reveals marked differences in approach to reach a common de-\nnominator, compromises in analysis and recommendations have been neces-\nsary. As far as the analysis is concerned, the search for common ground seems\nto have led to an emphasis upon aggregative methods and de-emphasis of\nqualitative elements.

These two themes recur throughout the analytical and\nthe \"action\" parts of the report.\n\nAt the outset, the authors define three main categories of unemployment.\nThe first is that which results from a lack of complementary resources\u2014ma-\nchinery or raw materials. The second is the unemployment arising from\nnormal labor turnover, seasonal conditions, declines in particular industries,\nand technological changes, in so far as such unemployment cannot be reduced\nby a high level of effective demand.

                    "Secretary Acheson and Economic Cooperation Administrator Hoffman have\nsuggested that producers who may suffer from increased imports, caused by\nfurther reductions in the American tariff, might be compensated in some way\nby the government. The suggestion was incidental to their effective presenta-\ntion of the case for larger imports. But, in itself, it raises questions\u2014eco-\nnomic, ethical, political, and administrative\u2014that merit critical examination.\n\nAs a matter of economics, the proposal has much to commend it. If assur-\nance of compensation for possible losses would serve, in fact, to quiet opposi-\ntion to economic reform, it should justify itself by facilitating adaptation to\nchanges in the conditions of supply and demand, improving the allocation of\nresources, and raising planes of living. The cost of such a program should\nbe far less than that of protecting investors and workers by freezing the pat-\ntern of production and checking the shift of resources into occupations where\nthey could be more effectively employed.\n\nThe principle of compensating those who may incidentally be harmed by\naction taken in the general interest appeals, likewise, to the sense of justice.\nBut it should be noted that this principle has rarely been applied in practice.\nVarious payments have been made to veterans on the ground that time spent\nin military service has impaired their relative position in civilian life. But\nthis would appear to be the only case that is analogous. The government did\nnot compensate the slave owners when it abolished slavery or the owners of\nbreweries and distilleries when it imposed prohibition. Nor has it undertaken\nto indemnify the owners of previously unregulated enterprises when it has\ninstituted new controls.\n\nWorkers and investors in a free economy are constantly suffering losses of\nemployment and income as a result of economic change. The textile industry\nmigrates from New England to the south; coal loses its market to fuel oil,\nand ice to the mechanical refrigerator; railroads lose business to trucks,\nnatural fibers to synthetics, lumber to metals, and metals to plastics; real in-\ncome is shifted, in wholesale quantities, between debtors and creditors when-\never the general level of prices rises or falls. In none of these cases is com-\npensation offered or proposed.\n\nCompared with the adjustments that are continually being necessitated\nby public policy and by economic change, those that would be involved in any\nlikely reduction of the American tariff should be relatively insignificant. It\nmay be asked, therefore, why this one case of adjustment should be singled\nout for preferred treatment, particularly since it has never been suggested\nthat consumers of imported goods or producers of goods for export should be\nindemnified when the tariff is raised.\n",

                    "The Varga Controversy: A Reply to Professor Domar\n\nProfessor Domar first asserted that Marx's reproduction scheme confuses\nstocks and flows and is a \"logical monstrosity.\"' In reply to my statement\nthat this is not so, he says that it is true that the scheme as such consists\nof flows, provided one bears in mind, in spite of Marx's very sloppy usage,\nthat 'constant capital' means capital consumption, i.e., depreciation plus\nused-up materials, and 'variable capital\" indicates the total wage bill.\"? What\nthe underscored *as such\" is supposed to mean I do not know, but I do know\nthat, even assuming Marx was sloppy in his usage, anyone who cannot bear in\nmind the definitions involved in his model should at least refrain from discuss-\ning it in print.\n\nDomar goes on to assert that Marx's scheme implies \"that fixed capital does\nnot exist.\" Again, I must dissent. Fixed capital does not enter into the re-\nproduction scheme, but it exists and Marx specifically discussed it in con-\nnection with his presentation of the scheme.? It is true that for purposes of\nsimplifying the exposition, I assumed no fixed capital in my book T7e\nTheory of Capitalist Development; and it is also true that I did not\ngo into the problem of varying turnover times. There would be no point in\ndiscussing here whether, for the purposes I had in mind in writing the book,\nI was justified in doing so; but there is point in emphasizing that Marx can-\n\n! American.

If 1 \u2014 e;8. \u00ab 0,\nk must be positive (see equation [8]), and unemployment continually grows\nworse after a wage cut (see equation [9]).\n\nThis is a more rigorous presentation of the problem, and now I shall point\nout why I think that Schelling's point (Case I) is pathological and has only\na grain of truth rather than the whole truth. The minimum level to which\nthe wage rate can fall under Case I is\n\n(10) \u2014 \u00e0 \u2014 99s\nap.\nwhich is dominated by the very large absolute value of Q, (infinite in the\nnonlinear case of the Cobb-Douglas function).5 For case I to hold, the wage\nrate must be exceedingly high and fall to a level not less than the positive\nquantity (10). I consider this event unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, under Case II, the wage rate is bounded above by (10)\nand may fall from this high level downwards without alleviating unemploy-\nment in case adverse expectations are present. I consider this case to be\nthe one worth consideration.\n\nI have granted Schelling his grain of truth, but his entire method of analy-\nsis must be rejected. If he wants to work with two-variable, first-order di\u00ed-\nferential equations, he must use a partial theory of the sort I have developed\nand his curves will not have the properties that he ascribes to them. If he\nwants to work with a complete dynamic system, he will be very hard put\nto end up with two equations in two variables and still be able to relate the\nparameters of these two equations to known behavior characteristics with\ndefinite properties. Any complete dynamic system which involves the price\nlevel, the wage rate, employment, unemployment, excess supply of goods,\ndemand for goods, the stock of capital and possibly variables from the money\nmarket will of necessity be of high order and analyzable only in terms that\nare vastly more complicated than anything Schelling has considered.\n\nLAWRENCE R.

Bach's recent article on monetary policy formation'*\nconveys a strong implication that the individual Federal Reserve Banks\ncannot, by their very nature, represent the broad public interest in consider-\ning the policy questions that confront the monetary authorities. As illustra-\ntive evidence, Professor Bach draws upon certain disagreements that have\narisen between the Board of Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents\n(particularly the president of the New York Bank) over the past decade.\nAlthough his analysis has no doubt benefited from his experience as a member\nof the staff of the Board of Governors from 1941 to 1944, Professor Bach\nhas based his discussion on the public statements of the Board and the Bank\npresidents. The record he cites does not support his conclusions nor provide\na basis for his recommendation that the Reserve Banks should be denied\nvoting participation in future Federal Reserve policy formation.?\n\n* The Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy Formation,\" Am. Econ. Rev., Vol. XXXIX,\nNo. 6 (Dec., 1949), pp. 1173-91. Professor Bach indicates that his paper represents primarily\na brief summary of one part of a larger study which he prepared in 1948 for the Hoover Com-\nmission.\n\nProfessor Bach recommends (p. 1190) that the Federal Open Market Committee be\nabolished and that responsibility for all policy formation be vested in the Board of Governors,\nlargely because Monetary policy must be national and public in character; it has no room\nfor regionalism or for special interests.\"\n",

                    "hypotheses, as Mr. Klein carefully indicates. His reference to a Cobb-Douglas\nproduction function suggests that he is referring to wage variability with\nconstant prices, as does his formulation of the labor supply equation (4).\nMy formulation considered variation in all prices, including wage rates, and\nconsidered only the implications of the assumed correlation between con-\nsumption and the real value of money assets at any level of income, and\nthe anticipation effect on investment (and consumption, too, unless we\nclassify postponable consumption as investment for this purpose) of the\nrate of change of prices. Whether wage rates would be in fixed proportion\nto other prices throughout the process, or might vary in relation to other\nprices with variation in the level of employment, is a question which was\nomitted in my paper and which would, of course, have to be considered in a\nfuller treatment.\n\nMr. Klein raises several questions about the origin of my unemployment\nfunction; the crucial one is the question of how the height of the savings\nfunction may depend on the absolute price level. This relationship is rather\nextensively explored by Mr. Patinkin in his original article.?\n\nTurning to Mr. Patinkin's paper, I find myself in agreement with his main\npoint; new variables or higher order derivatives can lead to instability. What\nI find interesting is that they can lead either to instability or to stability.\n\nI did not mean, on page 913, to assume that the price level effect would\nultimately dominate the anticipation effect, as Mr. Patinkin suggests in his\nfootnote 1, but only to suggest what would be found crucial in the analysis\nto follow. As remarked above, both possibilities\u2014of stability and of in-\nstability\u2014 were indicated in my paper; my diagrams corresponded to the\nstable case in order that they might illustrate the possibility I had found\ninteresting and in order that the result might be determinate.\n\n'fhe interesting possibility described in Mr. Patinkin's final paragraph, I\nfind perfectly valid. Although he has injected a large enough anticipation\neffect to make the functions unstable in the neighborhood of the north-east\nintersection, he has started off the process from a situation in which there\nis initially a large /evel effect; alternatively, we may say that he has given\nthe large anticipation effect a relatively small initial rate of price decline\nto work on. As long as he pivots his U line about the point of intersection,\nthe flatter he makes the line the farther to the left of zero does it intersect\nthe horizontal axis. Dividing the initial rate of price decline by the slope of\nthe U function gives us the effect of anticipation, and by his construction he\nhas made this value less than the distance from X; to the value of U(P1,0).\nHe has thus rigged the curves and starting points so that the expansionary\neffect of the low price level outweighs the depressing effect obtained by com-\npounding a large anticipation coefficient with a relatively small initial rate\nof price decline. If he begins to the right of the intersection he describes, he\nis on the opposite side of an unstable intersection and U rises (outward, to\nthe right) instead. Thus his result is only one of those things that may happen\nwhen initial values are far away from a stable intersection, or when there is\n\n*Don Patinkin, *Price Flexibility and Full Employment,\" 4m.

The reason for his system's failure to show the aggravation is, of course,\nthat his system of analysis only picks up the process a\u00edter the aggravation\nhas occurred; the aggravation occurs while the unemployment function is\nunsatisied, and Mr. Klein's system only shows what happens when it is\nsatisfied.\n\nRegarding the nature of the two functions, Mr. Klein's equation (5) and\nmy U -\u2014 U(P,P/) function, they seem to be derived from totally different\n",

The same administrative impracticability which marred the\nScheme in 1940 as a device for reducing excess reserves to manageable\nproportions still ruled it out, in the minds of many, when it was later offered\nby the Board of Governors as a method of restraining inflation.\n\nYet Professor Bach attributes President Sproul's opposition to concern\nover private bank earnings and maintenance of \"normal money market pro-\ncedures,\" while at the same time awarding to Chairman Eccles and other\nproponents of the measure an accolade for a higher evaluation of the public\nadvantage. Professor Bach states that the Board sought additional reserve\nrequirement powers in order to take \"active steps\" against inflation, while\nPresident Sproul *doubted the need for further action in the credit field.\"\n\"This is a misstatement. The doubts which President Sproul expressed con-\ncerned, not the need for further action, but the need for legislation conferring\nadditional credit control powers on the Federal Reserve System beyond those\nalready possessed.\" There is no evidence that concern for the maintenance\nof private bank earnings was an important factor in the determination of\nPresident Sproul's views on legislation concerning either primary or secondary\nreserve requirements. Nor was he influenced merely by a fear of disrupting\n\"normal money market procedures\"? His opposition to special reserve\nrequirements, and his argument that *. . . constantly seeking their imposition\ndoes run a risk of seriously interfering with our present program,\"'? were\nclearly based on the belief that increases in reserve requirements were not\nthen, and by their very nature could not be, a satisfactory substitute for a\npositive open market policy in controlling the availability of credit.'*\n\n\"The Federal Reserve Bank of New Vork, however, did not publicly endorse these\nstudies. They were directed by Dr. Lawrence H. Seltzer. See his articles, \"The Problem of Our\nExcessive Banking Reserves,\" Jour. Am. Statistical Assoc., Vol. 35 (1940), pp. 24-36; and\n\"The Changed Environment of Monetary-Banking Policy,\" Am. Econ. Rev., Vol. XXXVI,\nNo. 2 (May, 1946), pp. 65-79.\n\n\"The reasons for President Sproul's doubts are clearly evident in his testimony before the\nJoint Congressional Committee on the Economic Report in 1948. They were in essence (a) a\nstrong conviction that the System had not yet utilized its existing powers (i.e., for restrain-\ning credit availability through open market operations and rising rates of interest) to control\ninflation with maximum effectiveness, and should do so before seeking additional powers\n(Credit Policies, Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Economic Report, 80th Con-\ngress, 2nd Sess. [Washingtcn, U. S. Government Printing Office, 1948], p. 93) ; and (b) a\nconclusion that the additional powers sought could not achieve an effective control over the\nmonetary factors contributing to inflation, but would in fact merely divert attention from\nthe fundamental need for a general tightening of credit availabilities (ibid., pp. 96-97).\n\n\" President Sproul did state that imposition of large additional reserve requirements\u2014\neither primary or special\u2014could not help but be upsetting to the securities market, as\ndeficient banks adjusted their position to meet the new requirements\" (idem.). But will\nProfessor Bach deny that this is true, or that it should quite properly have been considered\nin reaching a conclusion on the wisdom of the proposed action?\n\n\" Credit Policies, p. 96.\n\n\"This is a view which President Sproul has often expressed.

If we follow Professor Bach in taking the views of President\nSproul of the New York Bank as representative of the Reserve Bank presi-\ndents, and use the views of Chairman Eccles to represent those of the Board,\nthen the positions seem to be just the reverse of those described by Professor\nBach. As late as October 24, 1946, Chairman Eccles was opposing *an in-\ncrease in interest rates at this time,\"? while on December 6, 1946, Mr. Sproul\nbroke a long silence to make his first controversial public address of the\npostwar period, declaring that **. . . we should look forward to restoring some\nflexibility to the interest rate structure.\" Furthermore, at the peak of the\npostwar inflation, on August 3, 1948, Governor Eccles was still stating that\na rise in the short-term rate was minor in so far as its monetary effect was\nconcerned.' On the same day, however, President Sproul asserted that an\nincrease in short rates would be desirable because, by narrowing the spread\nbetween short- and long-term rates, it would induce the banks to stay in\nshort-term government securities and would introduce and maintain a\nsalutary element of doubt and uncertainty as to the future course of rates.*\nIt appears, therefore, that, contrary to Professor Bach's statement, 0 one\nproposed to raise rates siarply, and that the idea of pursuing an effective\npolicy of restraint involving moderate increases in short rates originated with\nReserve Bank presidents, and was originally advocated by them (notably by\nPresident Sproul) in the face of outright Board opposition.?\n\nProfessor Bach's third \"example\" relates to the postwar special reserve\n\n'!

                    "Specifically, with respect to the controversy over the kind of credit policy\nappropriate to restrain war and postwar inflation, Professor Bach states:\n\n'The presidents, often led by the president of the New York Bank, have often\nbeen more inclined to favor cautious, mild policies that would be less disruptive\nto the normal courses of banking and the money markets than have the Board\nmembers.\n\n. it is only natural that the Reserve Bank presidents, whose daily work\nthrows them in intimate contact with the commercial banks of their districts,\nshould sense and appreciate fully the problems faced by the bankers. The Board\nmembers, on the other hand, are further removed from the private banking\ncommunity and are apt to evaluate higher the possible \"public\" advantage\n(for instance, checking inflation) even at the cost of reducing private bank\nearnings or disrupting normal money market procedures (pp. 1176-77).\n\nIn support of his argument, Professor Bach adduces three instances when\nReserve Bank presidents lost sight of the public interest because of a\n*natural\" concern over the local impact of the measures under consideration:\n\n. at various points during the war when the possibility of raising reserve\nrequirements was considered; following the war when Board proposals to\ntighten up sharply on interest rates were under discussion; and when the\nBoard recently proposed that additional special statutory reserve requirements\n.. . be imposed on member banks to check loan expansion . . . (p. 1177).\n\nHe amplifies the third of these examples (the special reserve plan) by\ncontrasting the testimony of President Sproul, of the New York Reserve\nBank, and Board Chairman Eccles, before the Joint Congressional Committee\non the Economic Report in 1947-48. On that occasion, according to Professor\nBach:\n\nThe Board sought added reserve requirement powers to take active steps\nagainst inflation through checking bank credit expansion, while Mr. Sproul\ndoubted the need for further action in the credit field and specifically opposed\nthe vigorous, \"clumsy\" method of raising bank reserve requirements if any\naction were to be taken, favoring instead a more tentative, less \"disruptive\"\napproach (p. 1177).\n\nExamination of these three *examples\" yields no support for the inference\nwhich Professor Bach has drawn from them. As to the first, there is no pub-\nlished indication that increases in customary reserve requirements were con-\nsidered at any time while this country was at war.? There are, moreover, no\napparent reasons why primary reserve requirements should have been in-\ncreased during that period. Perhaps Professor Bach meant to suggest some-\nthing different, such as an impounding of bank-held government securities\ninto a new type of \"reserve\" with the object of limiting the banks' earnings\non their government portfolios. If so, that type of device had already been\nworked out in exploratory studies at the New York Bank in 1940, in con-\nnection with the problem of absorbing excess reserves. It had been generally\n\n\"The Board of Governors decreased reserve requirements for central reserve city banks\nin 1942, and made reference in its 1942, 1943, and 1944 Annual Reports to the expansion\nof Reserve Bank credit necessary to keep member banks adequately supplied with reserves.\n",

Bach's recent article on monetary policy formation'*\nconveys a strong implication that the individual Federal Reserve Banks\ncannot, by their very nature, represent the broad public interest in consider-\ning the policy questions that confront the monetary authorities. As illustra-\ntive evidence, Professor Bach draws upon certain disagreements that have\narisen between the Board of Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents\n(particularly the president of the New York Bank) over the past decade.\nAlthough his analysis has no doubt benefited from his experience as a member\nof the staff of the Board of Governors from 1941 to 1944, Professor Bach\nhas based his discussion on the public statements of the Board and the Bank\npresidents. The record he cites does not support his conclusions nor provide\na basis for his recommendation that the Reserve Banks should be denied\nvoting participation in future Federal Reserve policy formation.?\n\n* The Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy Formation,\" Am.

It suggests that the dis-\nequilibrium could be remedied through increased purchases by the\nUnited States without any, cr any substantial, action by foreign coun-\ntries.\n\nBut no matter how one feels about the particular appellation, the\nfact remains that at present incomes and exchange rates, and with\npresent tastes and technologies, the demand by foreigners for U.S.\ndollars exceeds the supply. Current discussions of this *'excess\" seem\nto imply two interpretations: it may be that foreign countries, particu-\nlarly those who have suffered greatly from the war, wish to reach their\nprewar standard of living. Or it may be that foreign countries wish\n(subconsciously or consciously) to maintain about the same ratio in\ntheir standard of living to that of the United States as existed before\nthe war. The first goal has probably been achieved, with the major\nexceptions of Germany and Italy, in the nations of Northern and West-\nern Europe. The second seems implicit in much of the discussion which\nstresses the enormous increase in the productivity of the American\neconomy compared to European achievements.\n\nThese two \"definitions\" of the dollar shortage may sound cynical,\nbut they are not meant as such. They may account for the persistence\nwith which European nations attempt to live and invest beyond their\nmeans\u2014for this is what the dollar shortage amounts to\u2014as well as the\nsympathy with which their desire to do so has met in the United States.'\n\n* The author, associate professor of economics at the University of Michigan, expresses\nthanks for suggestions from Professors R. A. Musgrave and P. A. Samuelson, who read an\nearlier draft of this paper.\n\n!

Capital and labor being mobile, there is a tendency for the\nreturns to the factors of production to be the same in all segments of\nthe economy, and this means that when the demand for various com-\nmodities is altered, the supply of each product is adjusted to the state\nof demand, with only moderate changes in relative prices. In short,\ncost of production governs relative prices while demand governs the\nallocation of labor and capital in the production of different commodi-\nties. With respect to trade between countries, Ricardo argued that his\nsimple cost-of-production theory of relative prices was not applicable.\nSince labor and capital do not move freely from one country to another,\nthere is no necessary tendency for the profits on capital to be the same\nin all countries. In other words, substantial differences can exist between\nwages and profits in one country and wages and profits elsewhere with-\nout bringing about a migration of labor and capital between countries.\nFor this reason it is not meaningful, according to Ricardo, to say that\nrelative prices in international trade are governed, as in domestic trade,\nby relative costs of production.\"\n\nAlthough Ricardo was aware that a cost-of-production theory was\ninadequate to explain prices in international trade, he was always\nsomewhat vague as to how international prices or the terms of trade\n\n* The author is professor of economics at the University of Chicago.\n* Everyman's ed., p. 81.\n* David Ricardo, of. cit., pp. 82-83.\n"

                    "Publication in January, 1950 of a report by the Subcommittee on Mone-\ntary, Credit, and Fiscal Policies of the Joint Committee on the Economic\nReport was an event of major importance in the development of monetary\npolicy. The work of the so-called Douglas Committee is an outstanding\nachievement. It made a rapid and yet thorough survey of the facts and\nopinions on the subject and an extremely intelligent appraisal of them, and\noffered clear-cut, unambiguous recommendations. This report may be con-\nsidered as a public judgment rendered on the controversy between the fiscal\nand the monetary authorities. Whether the full Committee accepts the re-\nport or not and whether Congress takes any action to carry out the Sub-\ncommittee's recommendations, the fact that such a report has been made may\nexert a useful influence on the attitudes of the Treasury and the Federal\nReserve authorities on matters in which their major responsibilities appear\nto conflict.\n\nAn element that adds strength to the report is that its membership included\nrepresentatives both of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, Re-\npublicans as well as Democrats. The Senate members were Paul H. Douglas\n(D., IIl.) chairman, distinguished economist and former president of the Amer-\nican Economic Association, and Ralph E. Flanders (R., Vt.); the House\nmembers were Wright Patman (D., Texas), Jesse P. Wolcott (R., Mich.),\nand Frank Buchanan (D., Pa.).\n\n\"The first sentence of the report shows the Subcommittee's general view of\nthe channels through which the government can best exert its influence for\neconomic stability. The sentence reads: *We recommend not only that ap-\npropriate, vigorous, and coordinated monetary, credit, and fiscal policies be\nemployed to promote the purposes of the Employment Act, but also that such\npolicies constitute the Government's primary and principal method of pro-\nmoting those purposes.\" \"This sentence indicates that the Committee believes\nthat the government's part in moderating the business cycle should be princi-\npally through its influence on national income and the volume of money rather\nthan through the use of direct controls over prices, wages, materials, and\nother phases of economic life. The Committee favors the more impersonal\nand democratic approach through the money flow over more dictatorial ap-\nproaches through direct intervention in the economic behavior of individuals.\n\nMore specifically, the Committee takes the stand on fiscal policy that it\nshould contribute to economic stability and should not be dominated by\nfaith in the curative effects of an annually balanced budget. However, it\nqualifies this by stating \"that there are limits to the effectiveness of fiscal\n",

                    "Rejoinder\n\nIt is true that Marx's reproduction scheme as suc/t consists of flows, pro-\nvided one bears in mind, in spite of Marx's very sloppy usage, that \"constant\ncapital\" means capital consumption, i.e., depreciation plus used-up materials,\nand *'variable capital\" indicates the total wage bill. The output (in the Marx-\nian sense) of the producer and consumer goods industries is divided into\ncapital consumption, wages and surplus value, and equality between the\ndemand for and supply of consumer and producer goods, respectively, is either\ntaken for granted or made the condition of static equilibrium. AIl this may\nhave been a great achievement ninety years ago, but hardly so today.\n\nAs soon as this apparatus is applied to the theory of value and profit, so\nbasic in Marxian doctrine, difficulties appear. Surplus value remains a flow,\nbut constant and variable capital are transformed into stocks. This implies\nnot only that the production period is equal to the period of the turnover\nof these stocks, but that the rates of turnover of constant and of variable\ncapital are identical as well, i.e., that fixed capital does not exist. As Tsuru\nputs it in Dr. Sweezy's own book, Marx's reproduction scheme implies *. . . for\none thing, that no fixed capital exists; and, for another, that what is not\nconsumed is immediately invested; and thirdly, that capitalists in the first\nbranch [producer goods] do not invest in the second branch [consumer goods]\nand vice versa.\" Marx's attempt to solve the turnover problem (see, for in-\nstance, Capital, Vol. III, Chap. 4) was hardly satisfactory, but Sweezy did\nnot even try (pp. 67-68). The assumed absence of fixed capital in a capitalist\nSociety is rather queer; it may or may not be analytically harmless. But how\ndoes Sweezy know without a proof?\n\nTo oppose Sweezy's character witnesses, we could bring in Lange, Lerner\nand others, but what would we achieve? The best, simplest and only proof\n",

I have in mind the famous\nMarxian schemes of capital reproduction.?\n",
                    "Domar is simply wrong about the stocks and flows. No stocks enter into\nthe Marxian reproduction schemes; all the items are flows. Of course, it is\nsometimes assumed that stocks on hand at the beginning of a production\nperiod are exactly used up and replenished during the period, so that there\nis a numerical equivalence between stocks and flows. But such an assumption\nis in no way necessary and has nothing to do with the logic of the schemes.\nIt is true that each item in the schemes has a multiple meaning: variable\ncapital is at once capitalists' payrolls, workers incomes and a part of the\noutput of Department II (producing consumer goods); constant capital is\ncapitalists' outlay on materials and equipment, part of capitalists' gross re-\nceipts, and the total output of Department I (producing means of produc-\ntion). But in each case, we are dealing with flows; no logical monstrosities\nare involved.\n\nQuite apart from Domar's misunderstanding of the Marxian reproduction\nschemes, the above-quoted statement struck me as surprising, to say the\nleast. I thought that non-Marxian economists were pretty well agreed that,\nregardless of their opinion of the Marxian system as a whole, the reproduc-\ntion schemes at any rate are extremely useful theoretical instruments. Thus\nthe late Professor Schumpeter wrote of Marx's contributions that improved\nour theory of the structure of physical capital\" and added, \"The schemata\nwhich he devised in that field, though not irreproachable, have again proved\nserviceable in recent work that looks quite Marxian in places.\"?

This\ninstrument, in which variable capital (a stock) equals payrolls (a flow), and\nconstant capital (a stock) is supposed to represent both depreciation and gross\ninvestment (both flows), is a logical monstrosity, to put it mildly. At best it\ncan be applied to only the simplest problems, which can be solved just as well\nwithout it. Still, if. Varga, like other Marxists, insists on using this stone ax,\nit is his business . . . (p. 140).\n",

One of the\nmost recent attempts has come from Professor Papandreou.' Three aims con-\nstitute the purpose of this comment: (1) to offer some minor revisions of\nPapandreou's presentation, (2) to supplement Papandreou's paper by filling\nin the omissions with respect to the relations between the individual firm and\nthe industry, or between two individual firms, as the case may be, and (3) to\nargue that the method typical of many theorists and exemplified by Papan-\ndreou is of limited use, the limit having been passed in (for example) Papan-\ndreou's paper.\n\nProfessor Papandreou's objective **. . . consists in developing a comprehen-\nsive set of concepts dealing with monopoly power in terms of competitive re-\nlationships, and further, in associating types of market structure with types\nof monopoly power . . . the concepts developed in this paper in no way displace\nconcepts already in use . . .\" (p. 885). Dr. Papandreou elects to discuss five\nsymmetrical limiting cases. These five are not named \"pure competition,\"\n*monopolistic competition,\" *homogeneous oligopoly,\" *^heterogeneous oligop-\noly,\" and *pure monopoly\" (the old classification based on numbers and\nproduct differentiation), but follow the Triffin arrangement of *atomistic ho-\nmeopoly,\" *atomistic heteropoly,\" \"circular homeopoly,\" \"circular heterop-\noly,\" and \"pure monopoly,\" with the usual criticism of the uncertain distinc-\n\n'* 4.

However, the coefficient of pene-\ntration is presented as the coefficient of the ability of firm j to penetrate the\nmarket of firm i (and vice versa since asymmetry is shunned), so it would\nseem more realistic to treat the coefficient of penetration in these circum-\nstances as finite (and small).\n\nWith respect to pure monopoly, this category *.. . may be defined as the\nmarket structure of an industry in which competition is totally absent. Firm\nj is a pure monopolist if the cross-elasticity of demand for its product . . .\nbecomes zero\" (p. 892, italics supplied). If competition is \"totally absent,\"\nthen there will be zo opportunity to match supply units with shifting demand\nunits. While we may write the coefficient of penetration equal to zero (as Pa-\npandreou does), it seems better to treat it as nonexistent. When we conceive a\none firm industry, the coefficient of insulation becomes the reciprocal of the\ncoefficient of penetration, and if the latter is zero, the former is, of course,\ninfinite. That is, the ability of the pure monopolist to resist penetration into\nhis market is infinitely great. This we must grant, but it is infinitely great be-\ncause \u00a3/ere is no one to possess the ability to penetrate. It is more congruous\nto the concept \"social science\" to view the coefficient of insulation as nonexist-\nent rather than infinity.\n\n2. Some supplementary material may round out the exposition. The cross-\nelasticity of demand can be stated in terms of the price-quantity relationships\nbetween two firms, or between a firm and the balance of the industry. Papan-\ndreou chooses the former for the five limiting cases, and this is given in\ncolumn 2 of Table I. The cross-elasticity of demand with reference to a firm\nand the balance of the industry is given in column 3. There is another measure\nnot mentioned in the paper (this is not stated in criticism), namely, the elas-\nticity of substitution which compares a relative change in the ratio of products\nheld to a relative change in the marginal rate of substitution, being infinite\nwhen the products in question are perfect substitutes, finite if substitution is\nimperfect, and zero if no substitution is feasible. This is shown in column 4.\nFinally, in columns 5 and 6 we have the new coefficients of penetration and\ninsulation; the only significant change that appears from the original is that\nthe coefficient of penetration for atomistic heteropoly is presented as finite\nrather than zero.\n\nIn Table I an attempt has been made to increase the significance of the\nterm \"finite\" by indicating the ordinal relationships. The exception is E,\nwhere no flat statement is possible, although we may hazard the guess that the\ncoefficient is more likely to be larger in the case of atomistic heteropoly as\ncompared to circular heteropoly.?\n\n* Columns 2 and 5 show the relationship between two firms; columns 3 and 6 show the\nrelationship between a firm and all the other firms of the industry. It would be possible\nto add two more columns: one to show the penetration relationship between a firm and\nall other firms of the industry, the other to show the insulation relationship when \u00f3ne\nfirm lowers its price. No matter how difficult it might be to discover the general expres-\n\nsion for these two additional columns, we could still give the answer of zero or finite or\ninfinite, which is all that is necessary for Table I.\n",

The\ncross-elasticity coefficient depicts the readiness of demand units to shift from\none seller to another; the new coefficient (the coefficient of penetration) takes\ninto account the capacity of the firm to match these demand units with sup-\nply units.\n\nSymbolically, the cross-elasticity of demand for the product of firm i in\nterms of the price of the product of firm j is:\n\nbj $\nNop; \u2014 \"X fibi bj, Py\")\nQi op;\nwhere q; \u2014 fi (i, Dj, Py\u00bb) is the demand function for the product of firm\ni, b; and qi stand for the price and volume demanded of the product of firm\ni, p; for the price of the product of firm, j, and Py for the price of all the\nother firms in the industry.\n\nThe coefficient of penetration of firm j into the market of firm i is a func-\ntion of the cross-elasticity of demand and symbolically is written:\n\nRap; -\u2014 KjNqp;\nthe conclusions being skillfully and soundly developed that K is an increasing\nfunction of the elasticity of the output-outlay function and a decreasing func-\ntion of the price elasticity of demand.\n\nFinally, the coefficient of insulation is derived to measure the degree of non-\nresponsiveness of the actual volume of sales of firm j to price cuts initiated by\nits competitors. It is formulated by summing the penetration coefficients of JV'\nfirms in order to obtain the over-all coefficient of penetration and then taking\nthe reciprocal, for obviously, the ability of any firm to resist penetration is the\nreciprocal of its competitors' ability to penetrate.

That trade unions in the postwar period have pursued policies\nthat made the rise in prices much greater than it would have been with\nindividual bargaining and competition in the labor market, and that\nthis policy was made possible by the fact that unionism is a form of\nmonopoly power which is inherently inflationary.' This view implicitly\nassumes that except for unionism, prices would have risen much less\nand that the wage-price spiral would not have existed under the assumed\nconditions of perfect competition in the labor market. Wage policies\nare looked upon as the instigator and principal cause rather than the\ninstrument of the wage-price spiral.\n\n2. That if unions had pursued a policy of money wage stabilization\ninstead of trying to keep wages abreast of prices, the degree of infla-\ntion would have been less. This view does not contrast actual policies\nwith the assumed results of perfect competition but rather with a\nsacrificia wage policy in which the leadership deliberately sacrificed\npossible wage gains in order to keep prices down. It assumes such\npolicies were possible for the leadership and would have been more\nbeneficial to the community.\n\n* The author is professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin.\n\n* See \"Postwar Political Economy: The President's Reports,\" M.

Introduction\n\nRecent discussions in connection with President Truman's Point IV\nprogram have made it abundantly clear that the general attitude of the\nUnited States towards the utilization of American capital in furthering\nthe economic development of under-developed countries, apart from the\nquestion of technical assistance in the narrower sense, is based on the\nfollowing convictions; namely, (1) that private enterprise and private\nfunds should play the major r\u00f3le in foreign investment, (2) that public\nfunds controlled by the government, outside the sphere of emergency\nmeasures for a transitional period only, should not enter into \"direct and\nwasteful competition with private funds,\" and (3) that government\nguarantees should be given to private investors in order to eliminate the\nrisks peculiar to investment activities overseas.* Since the views of the\nUnited States in this field are of vital importance both to the investors\nand to the under-developed countries, an examination of some of the\nimplications of these conceptions would appear to be timely, as well as\nadvantageous.

One important\nanalytic question that always intrudes itself into such discussions is\nthe deflationary effect of a particular tax structure as compared with\nits alternatives. Many taxes have been reappraised in the light of the\nmodern theory of income determination, but there remain certain gaps\nin the analysis of consumption taxes.* At least partly, they result from\nthe failure to take fully into account the effects on consumer spending\nof the higher price level induced by the tax. This paper attempts to\nremedy these defects in the present analysis.\n\n'The accepted doctrine is that a given volume of revenue raised by\nconsumption taxes will reduce the level of aggregate real consumer\nexpenditures more than will an equal revenue raised through income\ntaxes.\n\nUnderlying this view are four simplifying propositions. (1) The con-\nsumption tax is fully shifted in higher prices to consumers, whereas\nthe burden of the income tax remains on the income recipient. (2) A\ngiven volume of tax dollars taken from a household with a givez pretax\nincome will reduce real consumer spending (.e., consumption expendi-\ntures net of the consumption tax) by some specified amount, regardless\nof whether the dollars are raised by income or consumption taxes.

Yet until quite recently we have neglected to explore his\nprovocative suggestions.' There are encouraging signs that this is chang-\ning. For example, Dr. Arthur Cole at Harvard has dedicated himself to\nunravel the r\u00f3le of the entrepreneur in economic history. Under his\nstimulus there is now a considerable group of people actively interested\nin entrepreneurship.\n\nI want to attempt here to add to the small but growing body of pub-\nlished material on innovation and entrepreneurship by discussing the\nprocess of innovation in the launching of a modern industry\u2014radio.*\n\nThe economist, making empirical studies of industrial change, is faced\nat the outset with the difficult problem of whether to confine his analy-\nsis to measurable data. There is much that the statistician can do to\nexplain the characteristics of economic development in modern industry.\nBut there are many important questions that he cannot tackle at all. I\nhave gained courage from my distinguished mathematics colleague, Dr.\nNorbert Wiener, who feels strongly that social scientists should ask\nthe questions they think of most significance\u2014not be too much worried\n\n* This article was originally presented as a paper before the Research Center in Entre-\npreneurial History at Harvard under Dr. Arthur Cole and Professor Joseph Schumpeter.\nSome of the historical material has since been published in a book entitled Invention and\nInnovation in the Radio Industry (Macmillan, 1949), designed for radio engineers and the\nradio trade, and reproduced here by permission.\n\nAs Professor Schumpeter has recently died, I should like to pay tribute to the encourage-\nment he gave to professional workers in very diverse fields. In my own case, since my days\nas a student at the Harvard Business School, he consistently pressed me to push forward with\nmy investigations of the process of innovation. And in the case of this paper he strongly\nurged me to make it available to economists generally. It was his hope, and mine, that it\nwould serve to stimulate the exploration of an area he believed of critical significance.\n\n** The author is professor of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n'See in particular The Theory of Economic Development (Cambridge, Harvard Uni-\nversity Press, 1934), Business Cycles (New York, McGraw-Hill, 1939), and Capitalism,\nSocialism and Democracy (New Vork, Harper, 1942).

At the conclusion of my testimony, the chairman of the Senate Committee\non Banking and Currency had this to say:\n\nI would like to say, now that you have come to the conclusion of your talk, and\n\nI sat all through it; that you have in a more comprehensive way than any witness\n\nthat has come before us in my memory met this situation that you came to\n\ntalk to us about.

                    "during a highly inflationary period adds to the general inflation unless other\ndemand is controlled and withdrawn elsewhere. But this still left the point,\nwhich my testimony treated of fully, that both economic and social considera-\ntions during 1948 required the expansion of certain types of resource use,\nand therefore made the restriction of other types even more imperative, through\na rounded and comprehensive program. Professor Ellis might quite legitimately\nhave disagreed with the particular reapportionment of resource use in accord\nwith economic or social priority which I proposed in 1948, or argued that the\nmethods which I advocated to bring it about were impractical or undesirable.\nBut this would provide no justification for a criticism which distorted my mean-\ning when it was so easily ascertainable.\n\n4. Further, my testimony with respect to housing was fully understandable\nonly in the framework of my general discussion of the economic situation per-\ntaining in August 1948. My argument was that the inflationary situation was\ndangerous because it was creating relationships within the pattern of produc-\ntion, prices and incomes which could not be sustained and which conse-\nquently threatened a substantial downturn in employment and production.\nConcentrating upon this problem of relationships, I concluded that stabilization\nat high levels could not be accomplished solely or safely through the traditional\nmeasures for curtailing the money supply, restricting credit, lifting taxes, or\nseeking to reduce the general rate or pressure of fundamental economic activity.\nI pointed out that these measures needed to be complemented by more dis-\ncriminating efforts to promote more workable relationships. This in turn re-\nquired, for example, that some incomes be maintained or even advanced, while\nothers were reduced; that some production be increased, while other produc-\ntion was restrained; that some programs of overwhelming importance to\ndomestic welfare or international security be maintained or even expanded,\nwhile other programs competing for the same resources be correspondingly\ncontracted, etc. I also went to great lengths to distinguish between short-range\nand long-range needs, while stressing that some proposals were of such vital\nlong-range significance that they should not be delayed even though they com-\nplicated the immediate situation. (See particularly pages 311, 339, 348-\n350 of my testimony.) There may be many economists who would disagree in\nsome respects with my not entirely traditional analysis of the 1948 type of\ninflation and how to deal with it. But there are too many eminent economists\nwho do agree basically with my analysis (some past presidents of the As-\nsociation wrote approvingly of it) for a few words of it to be torn out of context\nand then the whole of my economics\" dismissed as *befuddlement or dissimu-\nlation.\" Name calling and nothing more is not enough.\n\n5. Professor Ellis' assimilation of the foregoing views to the idea that in-\ncreased taxation of corporate profits in August 1948 would have been inflation-\nary is indeed befuddlement. My testimony, in fact, argued for very Itig/ taxes in\n1948 on the ground that they would be entirely consistent with a high enough\nlevel of business investment and would serve as a damper upon inflation.\nSubsidies or tax preferences to speed up the production of a critically needed\ncommodity in short supply might be justified even in a generally inflationary\nsituation, and in fact were resorted to during the war, when accompanied by\n",

However, the specific hous-\ning policy recommendations in my testimony, namely, that the long-range\nhousing program should have been enacted promptly in 1948 despite the then\ncurrent inflation, was precisely the same housing policy which the :wAole Coun-\ncil and the President repeatedly embodied in reports during the same infla-\ntionary period. (See reports issued in January 1948, July 1948, and January\n1949.) Presumably, therefore, Professor Ellis objects not to the 5olicy conclu-\nsions which I reached in my testimony, but rather to the line of analysis and.\nreasoning which I used to support these conclusions. For if his basic disagree-\nment was with the policy advanced by the whole Council and the President,\nthen his singling out of me for invidious criticism could rest only on personal\nbias.\n\n3. Turning now to this issue, Professor Ellis' criticism of my line of analysis\nand reasoning is based upon twenty-odd words which he quotes utterly out of\nthe context of my testimony. I said in part the following:\n\nThe point has been made that the Taft-Ellender-Wagner housing bill is incon-\nsistent with an anti-inflation program because it would add to demand.\n\nThis point is not well founded. If there is a shortage of housing, and if this is\ncontributing to excessive housing costs in the same way that a shortage of food\nwould contribute to excessive food casts, then the production of more housing\nis anti-inflationary in the same sense that the production of more food would\nbe anti-inflationary. It may well be that, for a time, we cannot divert much more\nlabor aid materials to the total production of housing in view of other competing\nnational needs. But let us make sure that they are competing national needs, and\nnot competing mon-essentials. And even then, there would still remain the\nquestion of the composition of the housing that is being produced. It would\nstill be sound and desirable to produce relatively more low-rent housing for\nveterans and others of modest means, and relatively less high-priced housing\nfor families who can get along very nicely for a while with what they already\nhave. The Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill is designed basically for this purpose, al-\nthough this is not true of the \"title VI\" provisions contained in the bill. Thus,\nunder present circumstances, talk about damping down the demand for housing\nis undiscriminating and mistaken until one breaks the demand down into various\ntypes. Some types of housing should be expanded, other types should be con-\ntracted. (p. 348. Italics supplied.)\n\nCertainly, the foregoing quotation leaves no room for Professor Ellis' state-\nment that I did not recognize, or did not honestly reveal, that when resources\nwere being strained by inflation we could not allocate more of our resources\nto one purpose without subtracting more from another. I said just this, not\nonly generally, but also with specific reference to housing, as is indicated by the\nlast sentence of the quotation. I am prepared to admit that the foregoing\nquotation in its compact form, while sufficient to show how misleading was\nProfessor Ellis! selection of one sentence from it, did not embrace all of the\nqualifications which anyone could obtain from hearing or reading my testi-\nmony in its entirety. Even a casual reading would reveal my clear recognition\nthat, while an increase of supply exerts a downward influence on prices in the\nlong run, additional drawing upon resources for housing (or anything else)\n",

                    "Housing and Inflation: Reply to Professor Ellis\n\nIn The Review of Economics and Statistics for August 1949, Professor\nHoward S. Ellis wrote an article about the January 1949 Economic Report of\nthe President and the January 1949 Annual Economic Review by the Council\nof Economic Advisers, in which he said at page 175:\n\nFurthermore, the present Report seems to be more honest than its predecessors.\nThus it candidly says that \"the fight against inflation prevents us from under-\ntaking these welfare and development programs with the speed and on a scale\nthat would otherwise be desirable\" (p. 8). Honesty of this sort is apt to be better\nlong-run policy than Keyserling's testimony, which can scarcely escape the\ncharge of either befuddlement or disssimulation, to the effect that the produc-\ntion of more housing is anti-inflationary in the same sense that the production\nof more food would be anti-inflationary.\" This casuistry is easily recognized as\nthe same argument as that by which the National Association of Manufacturers\nsought to prove that increased taxation of corporate profits would be inflationary:\ninvestment in plant would be reduced, production would be smaller, prices would\nbe higher. It is gratifying that the economics of Mr. Keyserling does not find its\nway into the 1949 Report. (Italics mine. Professor Ellis refers to my testimony\nof August 4, 1948 at pages 308-360 of the printed hearings of the Senate Com-\nmittee on Banking and Currency entitled *Control of Inflation,\" 80th Congress,\n2nd session.)1\n\nThere are several points about Professor Ellis! statement which call for com-\nment.\n\n1. Professor Ellis! appraisal uses the term \"report\" interchangeably to refer\nto the January 1949 Economic Report of the President and the January 1949\nAnnual Economic Review by the Council of Economic Advisers. Thus it is\nnot always clear as to which of the two documents he is talking about, although\nit is sometimes made clear by page references. In any event, I signed one\nof these documents along with my two colleagues on the Council and joined with\nthem in \"assisting and advising\" the President in the preparation of the other\nunder the terms of the Employment Act of 1946. Therefore, I cannot fairly be\ndisassociated from the report the honesty\" of which Professor Ellis so highly\napproves. I wholly subscribe to the passages which he picks out for special\ncommendation; and if they did not represent a job of *teamwork,\" I might even\nask Professor Ellis how he can know that I did not actually draft or initiate\n(as well as subscribe to) the parts which he most applauds. I submit that is a\n\"heads I win, tails you lose\" attitude for Professor Ellis to pick out portions\nof reports I signed or helped prepare which he likes and say that they are no\u00a3\nmy \"economics,\" but to pick out portions of testimony I have given which he\ndislikes and say that they are my \"economics.\" Further, conscientious study of\nmy testimony would reveal its basic accord with the reports which Professor\nEllis praises.\n\n2. Professor Ellis selects the subject of housing to support his alleged con-\n\n* A striking illustration of Professor Ellis' careless treatment of my views is that he\ndoes not even cite what testimony he is talking about (I also testified in February, 1949),\nand therefore the reader of his article could not refer to my testimony and judge whether\nit was correctly portrayed.\n",
