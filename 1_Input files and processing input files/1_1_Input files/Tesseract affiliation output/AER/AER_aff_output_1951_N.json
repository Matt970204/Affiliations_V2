These elements are\nprimarily the interaction of the accelerator and the propensity to con-\nsume, subject to lags, and a ceiling on the rate of increase of production\nat or near full employment. The accelerator expresses the tendency for\ninvestment, or possibly disinvestment, to be induced by changes in the\nlevel of income or production.

Similarly, if the exporter actually gets paid in dollars, these dollars\nmust have been provided out of a balance in the United States already owned\nby somebody in the importer's country or by dollars purchased against a\ncredit (probably to an American bank) in the importer's country. In either\ncase the exporter has been paid by a change in claims; either foreign claims\non the United States have been reduced or United States claims on the foreign\ncountry have been increased\u2014a debit entry in either case.\n\nMr. Enke is quite right in pointing out the difficulties in drawing inferences\nregarding exchange rate pressures from the balance of payments statistics\nalone; these can only mirror what has happened in the past, when it is\nalready too late to do anything about it. It is like trying to measure the\ninflationary or deflationary *gap\" in the internal economy by looking at last\nyear's product and income statistics. By the time the transactions have\noccurred, the gap has been closed, or the specific problem solved in one\nfashion or another. Reference might be had on this subject to the Interna-\ntional Monetary Fund's concept of compensatory official financing.?\n\nIn the last paragraph of his note Mr. Enke states that a nation's balance\nof payments is not analogous to any familiar accounting statement. It seems\nto us that there is a direct analogy between the balance of payments and a\nstatement of \"source and disposition of funds.\" The latter, like the balance\nof payments, may include transactions which were not actually settled in\ncash such as when net profit is shown as a source of funds and an increase\nin accounts receivable as a disposition of funds. The profit concept is, of\ncourse, foreign to balance of payments terminology; funds are \"provided\" to\na country through reductions in its assets or increases in its liabilities\n(credits) and are used, or disposed of, to increase its assets or to reduce its\nliabilities (debits).\n\nFinally, one \"pitfall? mentioned seems a little less than real.

As may be seen from an examination of our articles in the Survey of\nCurrent Business, we dropped the terms receipts and payments beginning with\nthe figures presented in the issue of June, 1950.\n\nThe terms receipts and payments may, however, not be so confusing as Mr.\nEnke seems to suggest. It is true that a credit entry is made for any trans-\naction which results, or would ordinarily be assumed to result, in a claim on\nforeign countries, or a reduction of foreign claims on the exporting country.\nHowever, except in the case of gifts in kind, an offsetting debit will appear,\nusually in one of the capital accounts, and this debit can be considered to\nrepresent the payment\" for the export. This Mr. Enke concedes in the para-\ngraph on the top of page 163. This being the case, where does the confusion\narise? True, it might be more accurate to label the items \"transactions giving\nrise to receipts\" instead of just \"receipts,\" as in ordinary bookkeeping sales\nare usually referred to as receipts. In both cases it might be argued that the\nreal receipt is the increase in an asset (e.g., cash), which, of course, is by\nitself a debit entry.\n\nThe foregoing notwithstanding, I too prefer the use of the terms debits\nand credits, although we customarily explain their use in terms of the rule\ngiven in an elementary accounting text. This rule is simply to debit increases\nin assets and decreases in liabilities and to credit decreases in assets and in-\ncreases in liabilities.\n\nWith the exception of the unilateral transfers (gifts) and, possibly, income\non investments, all of the entries in the balance of payments record the re-\nduction or increase of an asset or liability. Exports of merchandise and\nservices are credits because they represent a transfer of assets from the re-\nporting country to foreigners. Similarly, an increase in a United States invest-\nment abroad is represented by a debit entry because it is an increase in assets\nof this country. A reduction of foreign investments in the reporting country\nis a debit because it is a reduction of the country's international liabilities.\nOf course, it must be kept in mind that (except for the nonmonetary gold\nentry) only transactions with foreigners are to be recorded in the statement.\n\nFor example, if wheat is exported against payment from a foreign dollar\naccount in New York, the reduction in an asse\u00a3 (wheat) is recorded by a\ncredit entry and the offsetting reduction in a liability is a debit. If a foreign\ncurrency or bill of exchange had been accepted in payment, the second entry\nwould still be a debit, of course, but because it reflected an increase in an\nasset\u2014a claim on foreigners.\n\nIt seems to me that this is a much simpler explanation of the debits and\ncredits than the discussion of cla?ms by Mr. Enke. Actually, in these days\nall business transactions are settled in claims of one sort or another. If an\nAmerican exporter receives \"payment\" for his export either in the form of a\nbalance in a foreign bank or a bill of exchange on the foreign importer, he has,\n\n!

The necessity to be brief limits me to this footnote and only to one of the facts asserted\nby Mr. Balogh. No doubt he meant it purely rhetorically that *there can be no doubt that\nthe import of Cadillac cars, Coca-Cola, nylons and such-like products from the United\nStates which bulk large in Italian costs, has seriously aggravated the difficulties of a sensible\nemployment policy.\" I cannot see that this is a fact. Besides, if the issue really were be-\ntween Cadillacs on the one hand and vitally needed foodstuf\u00eds and raw materials on the\nother, there would be hardly any point worth fighting about. The facts are, of course, that\nexchange controls keep out vitally needed raw materials and that the imports of Cadillacs,\netc, are not worth talking about. Not only that: under bilateral agreements a certain\nnumber of Cadillacs or their equivalent usually have to be taken by each party to the\nagreement in order to receive the really wanted products. (For example, see United Na-\ntions, 4 Survey of the Economic Situation and Prospects of Europe [Geneva, 1948], p. 97\nand elsewhere.)\n\nI also wonder how the British people feel about bilateral agreements now that their meat\nration has been cut substantially because of Sefior Peron. Or whether the Danes are\nentirely happy about their inability to have their prices increased as much as they\noriginally liked. It is an interesting factual problem whether Britain gains more from\nexploiting Denmark than she loses from being exploited by Argentina.

The opposite case,\nwhere price control will not work well without rationing, is aptly\nillustrated by meat and by clothing. In the industrial field, price con-\ntrol was quite effective, even before the adoption of allocation, the\nterm used for rationing of industrial materials, in most primary metals,\nin chemicals, and in other commodities such as agricultural equipment.\nScrap metals and lumber present instances of the opposite sort in the\nindustrial field where price control cannot work well without rationing.\n\nThe examples just given point to important elements affecting the\nanswer to our question, the nature of the market structure and the\ndegree of control by sellers over the flow of the product and of its\ncomponent materials. It is not easy to establish a new cigarette manu-\nfacturing company or to divert substantial quantities of established\nbrands from the regular distribution channels through which the big\ncigarette producers want their products to go. On the other hand,\nlive animals may travel different routes to the mouths of meat-hungry\nconsumers, In World War II a host of country slaughterers sprang\nup and the flow of animals to the regular packers almost dried up at\ntimes.

One such examination has been conducted in the field of taxation in\nan effort to trace the welfare effects of indirect versus direct taxation.' The\nbasic neoclassical conclusion quite briefly was this: that the direct tax was\nless detrimental because it simply caused a loss of utility due to the reduction\nin disposable income at the margin, whereas the indirect tax not only did\nthis but also distorted the choice between commodities since relative prices\nwere no longer the same.

The first country\nis acquiring extra foreign exchange (which it may suddenly dump for its own\ncurrency) and/or it is regaining its own currency from foreigners (which les-\nsens their opportunity to dump it and also their ability to sell it in support of\ntheir own respective currencies). Shifts in international liquidity may instigate\nfears for the future, and it is in this indirect way that the state of a nation's\nmoney account may weaken or strengthen the foreign valuations of its money.*\n\nThe balance of payments of a country can be used to ascertain whether\nthat nation is saving and investing vis a vis the rest of the world. It is saving\ninternationally if its Current Account is positive and dissaving internationally\nif it is negative. However, international dissaving may be more than offset by\ndomestic saving\u2014e.g., Canada before 1914\u2014so that the aggregate saving-\ninvestment of a national economy cannot be inferred from the state of its\nCurrent Account alone.\n\nA nation's balance of payments is not analogous to any familiar account-\ning statement. It is not a balance sheet, if only because it does not refer to a\nmoment in time but to a period such as a year. It is not an income statement,\nif only because it does not consider the domestic cost of producing exports or\nthe probable cost of alternatively producing at home those goods which are\nactually imported. It is not a statement of money actually received and dis-\nbursed if only because all export sales are recorded whether sold for cash or on\ncredit. It is a list of claims and counter claims to payment\u2014conceivably in\nbank balances or legal tender of any currency\u2014established by residents of a\ngiven nation during a given accounting period. SrEPHEN ENKE*\n\n* Moreover, the existence of considerable exchange rate pressure may never be revealed\nby the balance of payments. Suppose there is a flight from the Swiss franc to the U.S.\ndollar which results in the Swiss acquiring dollar balances by selling Swiss francs to the\nUnited States at cut-rate prices. The U.S. Money Account is then zero but the dollar\nhas probably appreciated.\n\n\"These reactions have now of course been described by financial writers for over a\ncentury\n\n* The author is lecturer in business economics at the University of California, Los An-\ngeles.\n", "STEPHEP\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "164\n"], "3": ["lf a credit is a claim on foreign residents for *payment,\" one might not\nunnaturally wonder what constitutes *payment.\" The true answer is that the\nreceipt of anything that occasions a U.S. Debit can be considered an act of\npayment to American residents. Some people limit the concept of payment\nreceived to receipts of U.S. funds from foreign residents. However, if foreigners\nrelinquish foreign funds to American residents, this constitutes a disbursement\nby other countries, and consequently one would suppose a receipt of payment\nby the United States. Nowadays, a majority of economists probably suppose\nthat the acquisition of bank balances and legal tender, irrespective of their\nnational denomination, constitutes receipt of payment. On the other hand, in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the merchantilists of those days\nprobably looked upon exports as claims to gold. Actually, there is no reason\nwhy economists should not, and perhaps there are several reasons why they\nshould, assess all lending and borrowing, all bank balance shifts, and all gold\ntransfers, in terms of the claims and counter claims to merchandise imports\nand exports.*\n\nThe existence of different national currencies in the world is glossed over\nin the usual national balance of payments. For instance, some U.S. imports\nfrom the United Kingdom are bought and invoiced at a contracted dollar\nprice and some perhaps at an agreed-upon sterling price. However, ai] these\ntransactions will be represented as dollar debits in the U.S. balance and as\nsterling credits in the U.K. balance of payments.\n\nIn these days of exchange control the national currency in which different\ninternational transactions are denominated may be important. In certain cases\nit would be helpful, if the requisite data were available, to construct a balance\nof payments for a nation with multiple debit and credit columns, one for each\ncurrency. If this were done for the United States, it would still be true that\nall sterling debits should logically cancel all sterling credits, and that all\nFrench franc debits and credits should offset one another too; but, naturally,\none would not expect to find any particular account, such as the bank balances\naccount, to be in exact balance, either for individual currencies or for all cur-\nrencies collectively.\n\nThere is often an unwarranted temptation to draw inferences regarding\nexchange rate pressures from that part of the Short Term Capital account that\nconcerns American ownership of foreign bank balances and foreign ownership\nof American bank balances. We shall call this subsidiary account the Money\nAccount. If the Money Account shows that Americans are receiving payment\nfrom foreigners\u2014i.e., the account is negative on balance\u2014some people might\nconclude that the dollar was hardening. This would, however, not necessarily\nbe so. The negative Money Account might arise from the reliquishment of\ndollar balances by foreigners, or, alternatively, by the acquisition of foreign\nbalances by Americans without foreign exchange ever being sold for dollars.\nAdditional information regarding the debits and credits of specific currency\n\n*One means of payment in these days is through intergovernmental gifts. The goods\n\nexported under ECA give rise to merchandise credits for the U.S. economy. The offsetting\ndebit is the gift voted by Congress to the foreign nations concerned.\n", "163\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "2": ["chandise, settlements lag sales; export statistics usually refer to sales rather\nthan actual receipts, and these differ in magnitude, particularly for any short\naccounting period such as a quarter year.\n\nA minus entry of $y on U.S. short-term capital bank holdings must appear\nas a U.S. Payment because of its negative sign. However, this does not mean\nthat U.S. residents have paid out $y to foreign residents during the accounting\nperiod. On the contrary, it means that, because foreign residents have paid\nU.S. residents $y during this period, U.S. claims to receipts have been dimin-\nished by this amount. This revelation usually comes as something of a shock\nto students who previously imagined that the Department of Commerce uses\nthe term Receipts to mean money received and the term Payments to mean\nmoney paid out.\n\nThe Receipts and Payments terminology is only valid when it refers re-\nspectively to U.S. claims to money and foreign claims to money. Inasmuch as\nit is claims that are under consideration, one might better, it seems, use the\nordinary language of double entry bookkeeping and refer to plus items as\nCredits and minus items as Debits. There is less danger that people will inter-\npret Credits to mean actual receipts and Debits as actual disbursements.\n\nThe true nature of the U.S. Balance of Payments is more clearly revealed\nif one adopts the Credit and Debit terminology. It is then seen to be a list\nof the claims of U.S. residents against others for payment together with the\ncounter claims to payment of foreign residents. Thus American sales of mer-\nchandise, securities, gold, or bank balances all occasion U.S. credits and\nforeign debits. And any act that reduces U.S. claims to payment, such as\nwhen a foreign debtor settles in cash, occasions a U.S. Debit and a foreign\nCredit.?\n\nThe objection most frequently raised against the Credits and Debits termin-\nology is that many people are unfamiliar with it. In the writer's opinion this is\na merit. It requires people who do not understand their precise meaning to\nlearn them. On the other hand, because most people think they know the\nmeaning of Receipts and Payments, they may incorrectly assume that a nega-\ntive Money Account indicates the acquisition of American bank balances by\nforeigners.?\n\n* Students of international economics often think it strange that long-term investments\nshould occasion debits for the lender, who is now a long-term creditor, because they\noverlook the fact that it is claims to payments during the current accounting period\nwhich occasion credits. The prospect of bond redemption, years in the future perhaps, is\nignored by today's balance of payments. In the case of short-term lending, covering\nperhaps only 90 days, a majority of the loans made during a calendar year are repaid\nwithin the same year, and hence these transactions are not recorded in the international\nbalance of payments. However, if U.S. residents were to own more foreign bills at the\nend of a year than at its outset, this would mean, other things equal, that the United\nStates had on balance accepted these foreign bills in lieu of payment, thereby reducing its\nclaim to payment during the period in question, so that this increased bill holding would\nappear as a U.S. debit.\n\n*Actually the language of ordinary accounting is becoming ever more widespread\n\namong businessmen and economists\u2014the kind of people who read the Survey of Current\nBusiness, for example.\n", "162\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "1": ["Some Balance of Payments Pitfalls\n\nMost economists and many businessmen have become \u00edamiliar with the\nbalance of payments series published by various national governments. How-\never, what valid inferences can or cannot be drawn from these statistics are\nnot so generally understood, and the terminology is at times confusing. Most\npeople know that ** the balance of payments must always balance,\" at least in\nthe forms usually published, but not so many understand why or how. The\npurpose of this paper is to indicate a few balance of payments pit\u00edalls.\n\nThe international transactions of governments, firms, and residents (as\ndistinct from citizens) in the United States are recorded in the various ac-\ncounts of the U.S. Balance of Payments by either plus or minus entries. For\nexample, it has long been customary to record the sale of exports as a 'favora-\nble\" or plus action, and the purchase of foreign securities as an *unfavorable\"\nor minus action. The algebraic sum of all these recorded transactions should\nbe zero for any given accounting period, whether it be a week or a year, if all\nthe conventions are followed and the data are complete and accurate.*\n\nLogically, if export sales are positive and a zero balance is to be approxi-\nmated, any transfers of funds by foreign importers to American exporters\nmust be viewed as negative. International trade gives rise to two entries in\nthe U.S. Balance of Payments. The act of sale occasions a plus entry in the\nmerchandise trade account and the act of settlement occasions a minus\nentry in some other account. Whether the foreign buyer accepts a bill of\nexchange or settles in cash, there is a subtraction from one or other of the sub-\nsidiary Short Term Capital accounts of the United States.\n\nA difficulty arises over what to call these plus and minus entries. Some\npeople\u2014the writer included\u2014refer to plus items as Credits and minus items\nas Debits. However, the Department of Commerce, and hence an increasing\nnumber of people, uses the terms Receipts and Payments, respectively. How-\never, this latter terminology is often confusing because many people not un-\nnaturally suppose that Recepits of $x for exports means that U.S. exporters\nreceived $x in funds for their exports and that a minus entry of $y on short-\nterm bank holdings means that Americans have paid out $y to foreign resi-\ndents. Actually, each inference would be quite invalid.\n\nA Receipts entry of $x on account of exports really means that exporters\nhave established, through sales during the accounting period, claims to re-\nceive $x. Some of this they will have received and some of this they will still\nbe owed.

J. Schuller, in his review\nof Ludwig von Mises! Human Action, makes various criticisms of the book\nwhich deserve reply.\n\n1. Schuller claims that Mises asserts a *law of social development whereby\nthe majority in the long run . . . chooses the system which provides the\nhigher standards of living.\" Mises makes no such absurd claim. What he does\nsay is that the majority of a people choose that form of government which\nthey believe will provide them with highest standards of living. This is\nsimply saying that all exercise of power rests on the consent to obey by most\nof the inhabitants.\n\n2. Schuller maintains that Mises \"provides no clear test of incorrect versus\ncorrect praxeological reasoning. '\" The tests are, on the contrary, clear\nenough. Praxeology consists of two main elements: (1) the fundamental\naxioms, and (2) the propositions successively deduced from these axioms.\nNeither the axioms nor the deduced propositions can be \"tested\" or verified\nby appeal to historical fact. However, although the axioms are a Priori to\nhistory, they are a posteriori to the universal observations of the logical\nstructure of the human mind and human action. The axioms are therefore open\nto the test of observation in the sense that, once postulated, they are univer-\nsally recognized as true. Such recognition may be accused of being \"intro-\nspective,\" but it is nonetheless scientific, since it is an introspection that can\ncommand the agreement of all. The deductive propositions are tested accord-\ning to the universally accepted laws of logic. (Laws, incidentally, which are\nalso a priori to historical fact.) The fact that a proposition comes at the end\nof a \"long chain of deduction\" makes it no less valid than a proposition at\nthe end of a short chain.\n\n3. It is curious that an economist who is convinced of the truth of economics\nShould be accused of *uncompromising dogmatism.\" An attitude of frank\nconviction is a refreshing change from the timidity and apolegetics that are\nall too frequent among economists.

Whether or not this condition is given, only the unknown future\ncan reveal\" (p. 193). On the latter: *Human society. .. . is the outcome of a\npurposeful utilization of a universal law determining cosmic becoming, viz.,\nthe higher productivity of the division of labor\" (p. 145). \"The chiliastic\nempires of dictators are doomed to failure; they have never lasted longer than\na few years.

In my review I\nasked whether Mises would try to reconcile this dilemma by regarding his\nlaw of development as a praxeological law, effective only so long as its as-\nsumption of rational action obtains, while regarding the specific future out-\ncome as dependent also on historical accidents (perhaps including knowledge)\nwhich may abort the inner tendencies and therefore make apodictic predic-\ntion impossible.

This is no contradiction either. The\ncorporation director is completely at the mercy of the stockholders. The head\nof the state, however, exercises, to a greater or lesser degree, coercive powers\nover the people. To the extent he exercises coercive power he is a dictator\nrather than a mandatory. The \"electoral mandate\" is rather a choice between\ntwo sets of aspirants to such a dictatorship.\n\n7. Schuller reads into Mises the truly absurd statement that all intelligent\nchoice of means requires calculability. He then asks how Mises can intelli-\ngently choose between market economy and socialism. Mises never, explicitly\nor implicitly, claims that a// intelligent choice requires calculability. Obvious-\nly, the consumer does not have to calculate in order to decide whether he\nprefers to read Hamlet or a detective story the next evening. Calculability is\nonly a requisite in the choice of \u00bbeans of production in a complex economy.\nIt is not required for any other judgments of value or for Crusoe-type choice\nof means in a simple economy. Certainly, Mises offers no basis for Schuller's\ncharge. Indeed, in his essay, *Economic Calculation in the Socialist Common-\nwealth,\" Mises explicitly states the conditions under which calculation is\nrequired for intelligent choice.?\n\n8. When Mises presents us with the choice between the free market and\nsocialism, he is saying that in-between systems of a hampered market are not\ncoherent, consistent systems. He demonstrates that any measure of govern-\nment intervention in the market creates problems and consequences which\npresent the people with a further choice: repeal this measure, or effect another\nmeasure of governmental intervention. Thus, if we may use the term in this\nsphere, we may say that an interventionist society is always unstable and in\n*disequilibrium,\" while the only societies in *equilibrium\" are the free market\nor socialism, since interventionist measures logically lead to one or the other.\nSince a socialist system cannot exist, the only intelligent choice is the purely\nfree market.\n\n9. Since Mises demonstrates that every form of government intervention in\nthe market creates consequences that lead to an economy worse than that of\nthe free market, Schuller cannot distinguish between rational and irrational\nforms of government intervention, or designate market intervention as a\n\"technology.\" For Mises, all government intervention in the market is irra-\ntional and therefore contrary to economic law.\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "184\n"], "3": ["sider undesirable, then Mises as a citizen certainly has a right to agree that\nthey are undesirable.\n\n6. Schuller then cites various instances of what he calls arbitrary applica-\ntions of catallactic principles to historical reality. In most of the cases, how-\never, he cites not applications, but the principles themselves.\n\na. Mises is not being arbitrary in stressing monopoly and competitive\nprices rather than a special type of *monopolistic competitive\" price. This is\na result of trenchant criticisms of the monopolistic competition analysis.\nMises also discusses cases of incomplete monopoly, duopoly, oligopoly,\ncartels, price discrimination, and monopsony, and furnishes new insights on\nall of these problems.\n\nb. Schuller contends that Mises! theory of business cycles assumes full em-\nployment at the beginning of the interventionary credit expansion, and \"is not\nconcerned with the effectiveness of the same policy under large-scale unem-\nployment.\" This charge is completely false; Mises specifically deals with this\nproblem on pages 576-78. He there demonstrates that his business cycle\ntheory is fully applicable to conditions of large-scale unemployment of factors\nof production.\n\nc. Mises does not have to explain how systems other than the pure market\nhave managed to survive historically. Merely to survive, regardless of the\nlevel of existence, does not require more than the rudiments of the free market,\nmore than a little white in the gray picture. Whatever economic success other\nsystems have had was due to those elements of the market that were per-\nmitted to exist.\n\nd. It is difficult to understand what Schuller means here. Mises does not\noffer any \"stagnation\" thesis. If Schuller means empirical illustration of the\nunfortunate consequences of government intervention, such evidences abound.\nOne has only to point to the condition of present-day England, or observe the\nvarious \"dollar gaps\" to mention just some of the countless possible illus-\ntrations.\n\ne. Here is a point which especially seems to worry Schuller\u2014the contrast\nbetween man's economic rationality on the market, and his irrationality in\nthe political sphere. Mises is not contradicting himself here, but asserting an\nimportant truth about human behavior. It is a truth that is not difficult to\nexplain. When an individual chooses purchases on the market, either as con-\nsumer or as entrepreneur, he has certain definite guides for selection. The\nconsumer knows the prices of the various goods, and he can test the quality by\nselection. If he buys what is labelled *breakfast cereal\" and it turns out to be\na package of hay, he knows it soon enough, and that firm soon finds itself\nout of business. The consumer is in a position to arrange a set of preferences\naccording to his tastes, to evaluate the products open to him. But, in the\npolitical sphere, the reverse is true. The consequences of different sets of\npolitical measures can only be understood by the ability to grasp complex\nchains of abstract praxeological reasoning. The vast majority of the voting\npublic do not have this ability. There is no empirical test that will demon-\nstrate one type of governmental measure valid as opposed to another type.\nConsequently, the voter turns to whichever political leaders state their case\n", "183\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "2": ["edly criticize the logic of such eminent predecessors as Ricardo and Menger.\nHe forgets, as Mises does not, that Mises is building on a great structure of\neconomic thought to a large extent developed by these men. Coming later,\nhe is in a position to refine the structure as well as to add new developments\nof his own.\n\n4. There is no conflict between an historical and a praxeological statement\nwhen Mises says that the gold standard is an historical fact and that this\nstandard was responsible for increasing welfare, liberty, etc. ^Money\" is a\npraxeological category, arising when the market chooses a commodity to\nserve as a general medium of exchange. Such choice of a money leads to\nenormous economic benefits, as is demonstrated by praxeology. Furthermore,\ngovernmental interference with the functioning of this money leads to conse-\nquences, according to Mises, universally recognized as undesirable. This, too,\nis a praxeological statement. But that the commodity gold happened to be\nchosen by the market is in the category of an historical fact.\n\n5. Schuller's next criticism is a dual one, with one part contradicting the\nother. He asserts (1) that Mises fails *to bridge\" the dualism between\na priori praxeology and a fosteriori history, and (2) that Mises succeeds in\nso doing for the free market but not for other types of markets. Schuller\nmaintains that in order to forge this bridge, Mises would have to furnish\n*positive theorems covering all types of historical situations\" and \"instruc-\ntions for determining when the conditions of a particular situation coincide\nwith those assumed by a particular theorem.\" Such stipulations are absurd,\nand can never be fulfilled by any theorist. It is precisely the task of the\nhistorian to attempt to explain historical situations by the use of praxeological\ntheorems, to uncover their complex interactions in the actual historical situa-\ntion. But even at best, such historical work is tentative and inexact, relying\nto a large extent on judgments of relevance and emphasis by the historian.\nIt is vain to search for magic formulas to provide simple explanations for all\nhistorical events, and the knowledge that such attempts are vain accounts for\nMises' \"failure\" to provide the *bridge.\"\n\nSchuller's contention that Mises confines his praxeological theories to the\nfree market alone is clearly erroneous. Mises first develops the praxeological\nlaws of the free, or unhampered, market. He then analyzes the effects of each\ndifferent type of government intervention in the market. Part Six is wholly\ndevoted to this analysis. In Part Five he analyzes the consequences of a totally\nsocialist economy, where the free market in factors of production is abolished.\n\nSo Mises, far from giving us a \"single standard . . . the color white alone,\"\nanalyzes all the different types of situations, white, black and all shades of\ngray.\n\nWhen Mises, on page 854, implies, in Schuller's terminology, an unilinear\nrelationship between departures from the free market and departures in con-\nsequences, he is not simply making an offhand assumption. He is summarizing\nthe results of the analysis of Parts Five and Six, an analysis which Schuller\nseems to ignore completely. His standard does not become normative. As an\neconomist, Mises is value-free. But, if the demonstrated results of intervention\nand socialism are such as to lead to consequences which everyone will con-\n", "182\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "1": ["Mises \"Human Action\": Comment\n\nIn the June, 1950, issue of this Review, Mr. G. J. Schuller, in his review\nof Ludwig von Mises! Human Action, makes various criticisms of the book\nwhich deserve reply.\n\n1. Schuller claims that Mises asserts a *law of social development whereby\nthe majority in the long run . . . chooses the system which provides the\nhigher standards of living.\" Mises makes no such absurd claim. What he does\nsay is that the majority of a people choose that form of government which\nthey believe will provide them with highest standards of living. This is\nsimply saying that all exercise of power rests on the consent to obey by most\nof the inhabitants.\n\n2. Schuller maintains that Mises \"provides no clear test of incorrect versus\ncorrect praxeological reasoning. '\" The tests are, on the contrary, clear\nenough. Praxeology consists of two main elements: (1) the fundamental\naxioms, and (2) the propositions successively deduced from these axioms.\nNeither the axioms nor the deduced propositions can be \"tested\" or verified\nby appeal to historical fact. However, although the axioms are a Priori to\nhistory, they are a posteriori to the universal observations of the logical\nstructure of the human mind and human action. The axioms are therefore open\nto the test of observation in the sense that, once postulated, they are univer-\nsally recognized as true. Such recognition may be accused of being \"intro-\nspective,\" but it is nonetheless scientific, since it is an introspection that can\ncommand the agreement of all. The deductive propositions are tested accord-\ning to the universally accepted laws of logic. (Laws, incidentally, which are\nalso a priori to historical fact.) The fact that a proposition comes at the end\nof a \"long chain of deduction\" makes it no less valid than a proposition at\nthe end of a short chain.\n\n3. It is curious that an economist who is convinced of the truth of economics\nShould be accused of *uncompromising dogmatism.\" An attitude of frank\nconviction is a refreshing change from the timidity and apolegetics that are\nall too frequent among economists. Schuller wonders how Mises can unabash-\n\n! American Economic Review, Vol. XL, No. 3 (June, 1950), pp. 418-22.\n", "J.
