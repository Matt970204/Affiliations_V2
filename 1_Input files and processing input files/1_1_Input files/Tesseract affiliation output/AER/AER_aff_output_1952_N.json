It has been realized that the magnitude of de-\npreciation charges is a major determinant in the distribution of income.\nFundamentally, the larger are depreciation allowances the larger the\nproportion of the national product which will be absorbed by business\nenterprises before any '\"'distribution\" of income takes place. For one\nthing, the higher are depreciation charges, other things remaining un-\nchanged, the lower must be ''profits\"; hence the lower will be profits\ntaxes. And a corporation whose official profit figures are low may also\nbe better able to resist trade unions, stockholders and others who might\ncovet the corporate gain.\n\nA not uncommon defense against charges by labor and consumer\ngroups that corporate profits have been unconscionably high has been\nthe argument that depreciation allowances are too low and hence\nprofits are overstated. This argument, in perhaps unsophisticated\nfashion, declares that the cost of replacing expiring equipment in to-\nday's inflated market is actually much greater than current depreciation\ncharges, which are related to original cost of assets.\n\nThere are various levels at which those who are so inclined may care to\nmeet this argument. For one thing, they may raise the effect of tech-\nnological advance and increases in productive efficiency. It may be quite\npossible, in spite of inflated prices, to replace old assets with new ones\nwhose dollar cost per unit of productive capacity or output is less than\nthat of the cheaper but less efficient assets being replaced. Secondly,\nsome question may be posed as to the basic relevance of replacement\nrequirements to the consideration of depreciation allowances. Many\naccountants will insist that depreciation accounting is merely a device for\nallocating original cost and is entirely unrelated to replacement require-\nments.\n\nIt is not my purpose to do more than call attention to the challenge\nas to the relevance of replacement requirements to depreciation allow-\n\n* \"The author is assistant professor of economics at Northwestern University.

The Problem\n\nIt has been argued that, when manufacturing is conducted with\nfacilities designed by modern engineering techniques, the least cost\npoint of a plant is located either at or near capacity output. By capacity\nis meant the greatest physical output possible in some relatively short\nperiod of time, such as an hour or a normal work day. The argument\ncontinues that, when modern engineers are successful, the short-run\nmarginal cost curve for a product always lies below the average cost\ncurve at all levels of operation short of capacity. The result is that the\nmarginal cost curve cannot intersect the marginal revenue curve (1) if\nthe average revenue curve is horizontal, or (2) if the average revenue\ncurve is high and relatively elastic.! The foregoing thesis has been at-\ntacked from many quarters.?\n\nThe validity of much price analysis hinges upon the shape of the\naverage cost curve, to which are related both the location of the least\ncost point and the shape of the marginal cost curve. To discover the\nshape of the average cost curves for actual companies is an exceedingly\ndifficult task. Even if the shape of the curves could be ascertained, the\nexisting controversy would continue. The reasoning of marginal price\ntheory is valid if businessmen believe curves to be shaped as theorists\nassume, even though the curves are actually shaped as opponents con-\ntend; conversely, orthodox price theory is not valid if businessmen\nbelieve curves to be shaped so that their least cost points are at or near\ncapacity, even though the curves really have the shape which conven-\ntional theorists maintain. Hence, marginal price theory stands or falls\ndepending upon what businessmen think, because their short-run de-\ncisions to expand or to contract are based upon what they believe\nrather than upon what is actually true.\n\nThe easiest way to discover what businessmen think is to ask them.\n\n* Wilford J.

Under existing law there is\npressure on any corporation with excess profits tax liability to obtain\nadditional capital in order to increase its excess profits credit and\nthereby reduce or eliminate income subject to the 30 per cent excess\nprofits tax. Such additions may be made either through equity or debt\nfinancing; and depending upon the cost of obtaining additional capital\nas shown by the contractual interest rate or equity capital cost rate,\nnet tax saving is possible over a significant range of these rates even if\nno return is obtained by the use of these funds. Decisions to increase\ninvested capital thus may be made in part or entirely because of tax\nconsiderations. This bias introduced by our tax system extends farther\nto affect the form that such financing will take. Corporate income tax\nlaws have long encouraged debt as compared with equity financing, and\nthis unneutrality is continued under the additional impact of excess\nprofits taxation. This paper will consider the extent of the pressure for\ncapital additions which is induced by tax considerations as. well as the\nbasis for the use of borrowed funds rather than equity capital for such\nexpansion. Some of the technical aspects of the law affecting corporate\nborrowing are interpreted in order to determine the manner in which\ntax savings can arise and also the extent of such savings.\n\nThe most practical possibility of making an actual tax profit is in\nthose cases where capital additions result in a reduction of both the\ncorporate income tax and the excess profits tax. This is possible where\nborrowed funds qualify as invested capital additions, and this also ex-\nplains the advantage of debt over equity financing. The interest ex-\npense of borrowing is used to reduce income subject to both the cor-\nporate income and excess profits tax, while with equity financing the\ndividend payments which may be necessary to attract additional capi-\ntal are not allowed as a deduction. For this reason, allowances for bor-\nrowed capital and the derivation of tax saving under existing law are\ngiven special emphasis in this paper.\n\n* The author is economist, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

Introduction\n\nDr. Stuvel's recent book on Te Exchange Stability Problem! is an\nattempt to extend our knowledge of the conditions of stability in the\nforeign exchange market. The attempt is, by and large, a vain one. I\nwould be tempted to discharge my duties as a reviewer with that re-\nmark, if I did not feel that to do so would be unfair to both Stuvel and\nmy readers. Stuvel's errors are not the gross mistakes of an amateur,\nnor are they the ghosts of dragons long since buried. Rather, they are\nthe subtle pitfalls that await us at the frontier of economic theorizing\u2014\nin the great new domain of mathematical model-building. The lessons\nto be learned from studying them ramify far beyond the narrow con-\nfines of Stuvel's subject-matter, and should be of interest to model-\nbuilders generally, as well as to those who participate passively, but not\nuncritically, in model-building adventures.\n\nStuvel is to be applauded for the way in which he begins his study.\nThe reader is taken slowly and carefully through definitions of concepts,\na review of the literature, a justification of the mathematical treatment\nused, and finally through an equation-by-equation analysis of Stuvel's\ngeneral model. The model is disarmingly simple. The country in question\nis assumed to be small, so that changes in its demand cannot significantly\ninfluence either the foreign-currency price of its imports or the level of\nincome in the rest of the world. It is assumed to make only one final\nproduct (y), in the production of which imports and labor enter as the\nonly variable factors.

The supply of im-\nports is perfectly elastic, but the supply of labor is taken to depend on\nthe real wage and (if laborers are subject to a money illusion) on the\nabsolute level of the price of the final product. Real national income is\nthe total output of the final product less the \u00e0mount of that product\nwhich would be necessary, at current prices, to pay for the imports\nused up in its production.

The main feature of the\naccord, as soon became apparent, was that the Federal Reserve would permit\nsome rise in the yield of government securities, short-term and long-term, if\nnecessary, as part of a restrictive monetary policy to help prevent inflation.\nOn April 9, 1951 a Subcommittee of the Congressional Joint Committee on\nthe Economic Report was established, under the chairmanship of Congressman\nWright Patman, to investigate the government's monetary and debt-manage-\nment policy. A similar subcommittee, with Senator Douglas as chairman, had\ncovered much of the same ground under different circumstances in 1949.?\n\nThe volumes under review constitute the materials prepared for and by the\nPatman Subcommittee and consist of three parts:\n\n1. Replies to questionnaires addressed by the Subcommittee to the Secre-\ntary of the Treasury, the chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, the Council of Economic Advisers, the presidents of the\nFederal Reserve Banks, State bank supervisors, a number of other government\nagencies and selected economists, bankers, life insurance executives and gov-\nernment securities dealers (1900 pages, of which about one-third is from the\nTreasury and the Board of Governors).\n\n2.

Triangular clearance follows.\nIt should, however, be noted that there is nothing in this model which warrants\nthe inference that the clearance will be complete, 2.e., that the trade surplus\nand deficit of each country with its respective trading partners will balance\nout. Even in this simplest case, and given the complementary inequalities in\nfactor distribution among the economies concerned which the model assumes,\nbalance-of-payments difficulties may exist, and multilateral clearance may be\nimpaired. It is difficult to see how a theory of multilateral trade which ignores\nsuch questions as supply and demand elasticities, commercial and foreign ex-\nchange policies, and the important relationships between these considerations\nand the multilateral clearance of trade accounts can pretend to be \"general.\"\n\n3. Hansson's formulation also seems to assume technological stasis. Con-\nsider further the simple model referred to above, which Hansson subsequently\nmodifies (pp. 64, 65, 67) to admit into the system additional trading partners\nwith different relative supplies of the basic factors. What will happen if each\nof the economies comes to have the same or more nearly similar relative sup-\nplies of the basic factors? Hansson's reasoning would suggest that they will be\nless likely to trade because the \"pulling force\" in the system will be attenuated.\n\nI would suggest they may still trade, and they may still trade the same kinds\nof goods. What were originally labor-intensive goods (e.g., rubber) under the\ntechnological conditions prevailing when the system took the form referred to\nin (2) above, may\u2014assuming favorable climatic conditions\u2014be produced by\n,economy A under more advanced technological conditions with relatively\nmore capital and less labor. Similarly, what were land-intensive goods under\nthe original technological conditions, e.g., grains and wool, may under more\nadvanced technological conditions be produced by economy B using more\ncapital and less land. This would be the case, for example, where construction\nof large irrigation facilities (capital) permits the cultivation of several crops\nfrom the same land where formerly only one crop was raised, thereby *'econo-\nmizing\" land. With changing technology, the over-all pattern of factor distri-\nbution may become more nearly alike and yet specialized production and\ntrade may still continue and grow.\n\n4. An important element left out of Hansson's \"general\" theory is the in-\ncome aspect of trade determination. The possible dampening effects on trade\nfrom a more equal distribution of factors may be more than offset by the\nhigher income levels which accompany the attainment of the new pattern of\nfactor distribution. This would generally result in a net growth in trade even\nthough the relative scarcity or abundance of different factors were to become\nmore nearly alike in the developing and the more developed economies. It\nhas, for example, occasionally been suggested that the recent textile slump in\nLancashire has been partly due to reduced Indian imports because of in-\ncreased textile production arising from higher investment in textile equipment\nwithin India. But consider what a 1 per cent rise in Indian money income\nwould do to expand textile demand bot for Indian production and Lancashire\nimports.\n\nIf one accepts Hansson's thesis, then the inference would be warranted that\n",

                    "A General Theory of the System of Multilateral Trade: A Comment\n\nIn his interesting article, K. E. Hansson! presents a useful addition to trade\ntheory. Developing Ohlin's work further, Hansson's paper is helpful in relat-\ning conceptually the structure of production\u2014conceived in terms of the rela-\ntive abundance or scarcity of different factors of production\u2014in different\ngroups of economies, to the anticipated and actual pattern of trade between\nthese groups of economies over different periods in their development. The\npaper thus sheds light on the way in which complementary patterns of factor\ndistribution facilitate the multilateral clearance of international accounts.\n\nWhile recognizing the importance of his paper, I nevertheless believe Hans-\nson has erred on several significant points of omission and emphasis:\n\n1. Hansson begins his \"general theory\" with the broad statement that *in-\nternational trade takes place in response to the unequal distribution of the\nfactors of production\" (p.61). This is, obviously, a relevant generalization but,\nat least in its present form, misleading. Adam Smith attributed the flow of\ntrade to the gains from international specialization and division of labor. This\nneed not\u2014though it \u00bbay\u2014conflict with Hansson's generalization. Consider,\nfor example, the economic development of that group of underdeveloped\neconomies referred to by Hansson as \"The Tropics\" (p. 59). As their economic\ndevelopment proceeds, the structural relationship between the factors of pro-\nduction\u2014measured in terms of machinery per worker or per square kilometer,\nwhich are the indexes suggested by Hansson\u2014may be expected to move in\nthe direction prevailing in the more developed economies; in other words, the\nsupply of capital in the Tropics may be expected to increase relative to the\nsupply of land and labor. Does this mean that the stimulus to trade between\nthe Tropics and the more developed areas will diminish because capital in the\nTropics comes into relatively moderate\" or *ample\" supply, and hence there\nis less inequality in factor distribution? Hansson's initial generalization would\nappear to imply that a more equal distribution of factors of production will\nrestrict trade. Presumably an exactly equal relative distribution of factors of\nproduction would eliminate trade entirely among the economies concerned.\nThis conclusion would appear to be inescapable if trade is presumed to depend\nsolely on inequality of factor distribution. I submit that this is unacceptable.\nEven with a similar productive structure in terms of a similar relative abun-\ndance or scarcity of the same basic factors, it will still be profitable for the\nfactors to be concentrated on the production of some commodities in one\ncountry, others in a second country, and for surpluses to be traded. The classi-\ncal arguments on the gains from international division of labor are obvious\nand familiar and need not be elaborated. However, they represent a separate\nstimulus to trade which is lacking in Hansson's schema.\n\n2. In Hansson's simplest case (pp. 61 and 63), capital-intensive goods are\nbought by economy A, which is short of capital but rich in labor, from\neconomy C which is short of land and rich in capital; economy B, which is\nrich in land but short of labor, buys labor-intensive goods from A; and\n\n* K, E.

                    "And we cannot have a policy designed to prevent such winning of competition\nthat does not throttle the very thing the policy pretends to promote. This\ndilemma calls for a fresh approach to the antitrust problem. Two things may\nbe said in that connection. First, the failure of a dominant producer to use his\npower to destroy his competitors is not, as Adams seems to suggest, a meaning-\nless subterfuge designed to mollify the courts. Self-restraint is precisely what\nwe expect the antitrust laws, and indeed all laws, to elicit. It does not follow\nthat simply because an assailant is big and powerful his actions are therefore\nmalicious. Perhaps what is needed is not to bring the assailant to trial, but to\nredefine our concepts of assault and competition in a way more nearly con-\nsistent with the necessary and inevitable structure of modern industry and\nsociety.\n\nThe second point that may be made in connection with the dilemma we face\nin trying to prevent someone's winning competition without destroying that\nwhich is a precondition to competition and which makes competition desirable,\nis that the Sherman Act should be replaced by a system of laws that recog-\nnizes the technological inevitability of monopoly and oligopoly in modern in-\ndustry. It becomes increasingly more evident that the Sherman Act, with its\nimplied suggestion of dissolution, divorcement, and divestiture, rigorously\napplied can destroy what is most precious about the system it naively tries to\nsafeguard and preserve. The morality of the Sherman Act is anachronistic. We\nneed to make a fresh start in our thinking about big business, competition, and\nbusiness ethics and the kind of public policy we should have in connection with\nthem. A profitable beginning might explore the wisdom and possibility of\ntreating our */Big Three's\" and \"Big Four's\" as new forms of modified public\nutilities, inevitable, desirable, but regulatable in a manner that preserves their\ndynamism, encourages their innovational drive, and makes them socially re-\nsponsible. A public member or two sitting in on top-level strategy and policy\nmeetings of the big producers and distributors may be able to do more by way\nof preserving and promoting enterprise, honesty, and efficiency in big business,\nand do more to preserve the kind of economy we seem to want than all the\nVictorian proscriptions of our present antitrust laws.\n\nCDlenemnene TovevermprK\n",

This, Adams vigorously contends, is bad economics,\nbad public policy, and besides is not in keeping with the Sherman Act.\n\nAll this may be true, as far as the analysis goes. But it must go further.\nWhile business leaders may not do a good job of making the point, there is\nsomething to their charge that antitrust activities of the aluminum kind tend\nto punish efficiency, size, and success. As a matter of public policy we want\nbusiness to compete, but we do not want any one producer (or any three in\na given industry?) to win the competition. We want the kind of competition\nwhich does not lead to monopoly, and we behave as if there were a benevolent\nnatural law according to which it is not in the nature of things for someone to\nwin the competition. As if to give this law a helping hand, we devise public\npolicies to discourage anyone from winning the competition and to punish any-\none who does win it. Yet at the same time we do not wish to discourage the\nenterprise, dynamism, and even scheming that make for getting competitive\nadvantage\u2014in short, for winning competition and creating monopolistic or\ntight oligopolistic situations. In a word, we wish to preserve competition but\nface the anomolous situation of punishing its most successful practitioners and\nof destroying those ingredients of competition that make competition possible\nand desirable.\n\nOne need not approve of the many iron-fist-in-velvet-glove techniques of\nbig business in order to sympathize with its problems. Because of the increasing\nautomaticity of the modern technology, because of the fantastically increased\ncapital requirements, we should therefore not be surprised or alarmed at hav-\ning more numerous three-producer, two-producer, or even one-producer indus-\ntries, Electronics and atomic energy will hasten the necessity and inevitability\nof such industries, as the electrical revolution of the 1910's and 1920's so\ngreatly helped increase industrial concentration then. The Sherman Act (as\nwell as its patchwork progeny, the Clayton Act) was a reaction to the eco-\nnomic concentration that resulted from the leviathan of shady financial man-\nipulations, immoral intrigue, and primitive aggrandizement of power. But\ntoday's concentration is the more-or-less inevitable consequence of a new and\namoral leviathan\u2014monster technology. Yet we continue to invoke the ethics of\na horse and buggy antitrust law to the situation of a hot rod industrial society.\nThe result is legalistic confusion and uncertainty and the possible eventual de-\ngeneration of the economic system.\n\nPerhaps the *go-getting\" component of the American business culture will\nsurvive antitrust attacks and provide a continuous stream of highly motivated\nbusiness leaders, but it is not inconceivable that a series of successful prosecu-\ntions over a number of years of the type attempted in the aluminum case may\nthrottle the dynamism of American capitalism, reducing competition to a sort\nof verbalistic remains of the real thing, to torpid manipulation of the symbols\nof competition in a system that is devoid of really dynamic creative activity.\n\nWe cannot have \"old fashioned\" intra-industry competition (or what\nappears for many to pass for the same thing, namely *workable competition\")\nwithout reasonably expecting somebody to win or nearly win that competition.\n",

Some\nare concerned with alternative paths along which income may grow, the specific\npath taken being determined by the particular set of assumptions regarding the\nbehavior of consumption and investment.!

Instead they are reverting to an earlier and more funda-\nmental aspect of a maximum position: namely, that from the top of a\nhill, whether or not it is locally flat, all movements are downward.\n\"Therefore, the real import of marginalism is embodied in the following\ntype of statement: for any produced units of output, extra revenues ex-\nceed extra costs; but for any further producible units, extra revenue\nwould fall short of extra costs. These marginal inequalities\u2014which need\nnot apply to small local movements alone\u2014do, in well-behaved cases\nwith smooth slopes, imply the usual marginal equalities. But they are\nmore general, in that from them we can derive most of what is po-\ntentially useful in marginal analysis, a point which has been missed by\nboth the defenders and attackers of \"marginalism.\" And more than\nthat, the marginal inequalities can apply to cases (like simple compara-\ntive advantage) where the marginal equalities fail.\n\nIn recent years economists have begun to hear about a new type of\ntheory called linear programming. Developed by such mathematicians\nas G. B. Dantzig, J. v. Neumann, A. W. Tucker, and G. W. Brown, and\nby such economists as R. Dorfman, T. C. Koopmans, W.

A number of books and articles on\nthis subject are beginning to appear. It is the modest purpose of the\nfollowing discussion to present a classical economics problem which il-\nlustrates many of the characteristics of linear programming. However,\nthe problem is of economic interest for its own sake and because of its\nancient heritage.\n\n\"The first explicit statement that competitive market price is deter-\nmined by the intersection of supply and demand functions seems to\nhave been given by A.

Introduction\n\nRecent discussions of monetary policy and the national debt have\npointed to *the new opportunities for influencing credit availability\nwhich that debt has brought about.\" It is the purpose of this paper to\npresent one of these \"new opportunities\" and to investigate the nature\nof its operation. Specifically, this paper inquires into the policy implica-\ntions of the relationship between the Treasury bill market and the\ncustomer loan market, both of which deal with short-term credit.\nStudents of banking will recall that the Federal Reserve Banks engaged\nin open-market operations for many years before open-market opera-\ntions were deliberately used as an instrument of credit control.^ Open-\nmarket operations were not even contemplated as an instrument of\nmonetary policy by the framers of the Federal Reserve Act. In the\nearly period of the Federal Reserve System, major reliance for control-\nling the money supply was placed in changes in the central bank's\nrediscount rate. An increase in rediscount rates, by raising the cost of\nborrowing from the Federal Reserve, was expected to firm commercial\nloan rates and thus to restrain business borrowing, while the reverse\nreaction was expected from a lowering of the rediscount rates, For many\nyears, discount rate changes have not been effective credit control de-\nvices in the manner originally intended, because member bank borrow-\ning from the Federal Reserve is no longer significant. Such efficacy\nas rediscount rates may have today derives in large part from their\npsychological impact and not from a change in the cost of funds\nborrowed by banks.\n\nIf statements made before the Douglas Subcommittee on Monetary,\nCredit and Fiscal Policies by responsible officials can be taken at face\nvalue, it would appear that the huge expansion in the national debt has\n\n!See Robert V.

The reasons advanced in favor of such a policy are\neasy to understand. Under the pressure of a large-scale rearmament\neffort of considerable duration, the production of many marketable\ncommodities is bound to be reduced for a number of years whereas the\npurchasing power of considerable groups of the population is likely to\nbe increased perceptibly. Hence it is a tempting idea to lower or to\neliminate the duties on certain commodities until such time as expanded\nproduction could again catch up with the demand. Impending reduc-\ntions in standards of consumption could then be alleviated; a desirable\noutlet could be found for enhanced purchasing power and the size of\na dangerous \"inflationary gap\" could thus be reduced.\n\nThere are, of course, a number of questions which deserve careful\nconsideration in order to arrive at a reasonable appreciation of the\neffects which can be expected to result from the introduction of such a\nflexible tariff. Since an over-all tariff reduction can hardly be contem-\nplated, the questions arise as to how to proceed in selecting the com-\nmodities the importation of which could be promoted through tempo-\nrary relaxation of existing duties? And how to assess the effects of the\nreductions (a) upon the volume of imports; (b) upon the prices of the\ncommodities whose protection against foreign competition would be\nreduced? (c) upon the economic conditions of the countries which\nwould be the sources of increased exports? Any final judgments upon\nthe deflationary effects of tariff reductions would depend upon the an-\nswers to these questions.\n\nFrom the outset it appears advisable to emphasize the specific mean-\ning which attaches to the term \"flexible.\" A flexible tariff structure means\na system of import duties which can be adjusted to changing conditions.\nHence in order to give more or less precise answers to the questions\nraised, it is necessary to make certain assumptions as to the conditions\nwhich are likely to prevail during the execution of the Rearmament\nProgram.\n\n* When this paper was prepared, the author was on the staff of the Tariff Commission,\nWashington, D.C.

It would seem, furthermore,\nthat with certain modifications, the program could be so devised as to be even\nmore effective as a stabilizing device without making it any more cumber-\nsome administratively. In any event, if a similar program is to be adopted in\nthe United States, the time to begin planning and establishing the funds is\nduring periods of full employment such as the country is now experiencing,\n\nnot when the depression has already begun.5\nTr D Quen -mxck\n",

                    "past trend of increasing tax rates, businessmen would probably be pessimistic\nabout the wisdom of substituting future for present rates.\n\nOther factors that may discourage the use of this provision by Swedish firms\nwould seem to include the administrative red tape inevitably accompanying\na measure of this type, and the disinclination of businessmen to anticipate a\ndepression\u2014an attitude which may have been accentuated by many years of\nprolonged prosperity. On the other hand, they would seem to have much\nto gain and little or nothing to lose by taking advantage of it. Deviations from\ngovernment instructions with regard to use and/or timing of the funds are,\nin effect, not penalized. The tax liability incurred in case of violation is im-\nmediately offset by the possibility of writing off the asset created by the use\nof the funds if these are used to purchase inventory or equipment; in other\nwords, the cancellation of the pre-expenditure deduction is immediately offset\nby the creation of an equal post-expenditure deduction when the funds are\ninvested. In the meantime the firm has had the use of the larger funds at low\ninterest, as indicated above. It would therefore seem that firms have every\nincentive to utilize the provision but little or no compelling incentive to\ncomply with the government in the disposal of the funds.\n\nIt is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the above incentives and dis-\nincentives from data available concerning the size of Swedish investment funds,\nsince no comparable data on corporate profits are at hand. At the end of 1950\n(the latest year for which we have information), the funds totalled 214\nmillion kronor, of which 80 per cent was in the category to be spent on plant.\nOnly 33 million kronor were earmarked for equipment, 8 million for inventory,\nand 2 million for mining development. The emphasis on construction purposes\nis partly explained by the fact that other investments are subject to immediate\ndepreciation and therefore carry with them their own tax reduction possi-\nbilities without resort to the provisions for investment funds.\n\nIf there is no substantial increase of the funds in coming years, their impor-\ntance to cyclical policy would in all likelihood not be very great: compared\nto the value of the Swedish gross national product in 1950 they amounted to\napproximately 0.7 per cent. Today this would be comparable to a fund of\n$2-2.5 billion in the United States.\n\nThe question raised by this survey so far is whether incentives such as\nthose offered in the Swedish provisions are really sufficient to bring about the\ndesired change in the business spending pattern. Certainly if actual long-run\ntax deductions were offered, this would provide a stronger incentive for busi-\nness firms to use the provisions according to government plans. This could be\naccomplished by not eliminating depreciation privileges on the assets financed\nby the funds.\n\n2. Another question which comes to mind in considering the Swedish pro-\nvision is whether it is advisable to restrict the use of the funds to specific\npurposes such as here the financing of construction, equipment, inventory,\nor mining projects. In the first place, various other spending outlets of similar\npriming effect may be imagined; moreover, the usefulness of a separation be-\ntween the purposes mentioned is not immediately clear. An artificial rechan-\nneling of business intentions may result in uneconomic use of resources. True,\nsince no real penalty appears to attach to action taken without government\n",

                    "IL Comments\n\nThe Swedish provision for investment funds was only introduced on the eve\nof Warld War II; it has not yet been put to a test in a business downturn.\nBut even in the absence of such experience, the scheme gives rise to certain\nquestions concerning the general problem of stabilizing business investment\nthrough tax redemption measures.\n\n1. The first and most important question is whether this arrangement\nactually will change business investment patterns over the cycle. What incen-\ntives does the scheme offer to make businessmen stabilize their investments?\nIt should be noted that over the long run, from the profit and loss viewpoint,\nthere is no significant tax reduction offered under the Swedish provision, since\ninvestments financed from the funds are not subject to such subsequent depre-\nciation as would otherwise have been allowed. The investment funds simply\noffer the alternative of a pre-expenditure rather than a post-expenditure de-\nduction, with the difference, however, that the firm has somewhat greater\nfreedom in timing pre-expenditure than post-expenditure deductions, particu-\nlarly in the case of plant. The provision consequently serves, in some ways, the\nfunctions of the carry-forward and carry-back provisions of American tax\nlaws; such provisions do not exist in Sweden. The resemblance to carry-for-\nward and carry-back provisions is not complete, however, since the Swedish\nfunds set aside in prosperous and spent in depressed years are augmented by\nthe contributions from the firm in addition to the taxes which are shifted.\nFurthermore, under a carry-forward and carry-back provision there is no in-\ncentive for a firm receiving a tax rebate to use this money in ways which\nstimulate the economy, which is the essence of the Swedish provision.\n\nThere is an incentive in the form of an interest advantage, since the taxes\ntemporarily waived by the government and invested by the firms are in the\nnature of an interest-free loan if the funds are subsequently used with the\napproval.of the government. Even if they are not so used, the investment\nfunds may be profitable since it is likely that they can be invested at a higher\nrate of return than the rate imputed by the government when taxes are ulti-\nmately levied (2 or 3 per cent respectively).\n\nUnder the Swedish scheme, deferred taxes are levied at the current tax rate\nin the event the firm uses the funds without government approval or has no\nopportunity to use them with such approval within the ten (or fifteen)-year\ntime limit. This would appear to inject an element of uncertainty, the effects\nof which would most likely be discouraging. If tax rates are anticipated to\nfluctuate with the cycle, this would, it is true, be an incentive, but given the\n",

Machinery and other\nequipment may be written off completely in one year, and inventory may be\nwritten down to 30 per cent of its value in the year of purchase; in the case\nof buildings, however, a depreciation programme (for tax purposes) chosen at\nthe time of investment must be abided by in future years until the building\nhas been completely written off.\n",

The eventual disposal of the funds for stimulating purposes is partly\nunder the control of the government, which can specify the year or years\nwhen the funds should be used (on a permissive or mandatory basis). The\ngovernment through the Labor Commission, which is the administrative agency\nsupervising the investeringsfonder, may also specify which of the four funds,\ncategorized by purpose, are to be released, and whether all or only specific\nfirms or industries may utilize their funds. Furthermore, the Labor Commission\nmay in special cases permit funds set aside for one purpose to be used for\nanother. In short, the government has a wide latitude in determining when,\nwhere and how the funds should be used. ?\n\n5. The tax exemption on these funds is ultimately realized only if the funds\nare used with the approval of the government. If a firm decides to cash any\npart of its funds without government approval, the total amount withdrawn is\nsubject to taxation at the rate current during the year in which the fund is used,\nand the taxable value of the withdrawn portion of the fund is increased by a\n3 per cent interest compounded from the year in which the funds were set\naside. If the government decrees that during a certain period the use of the\nfunds is compulsory, and a firm does not spend the money as directed, any part\nof the fund not properly used plus a 3 per cent compounded increment becomes\nsubject to taxation at the current rate.\n\n6. Similarly, funds which have not been released by the government are\nliable for taxation after ten years (or a maximum of 15 years if extended by\nthe government). In this case the taxable value of the funds is compounded at\n2 per cent.\n\n7. If a firm uses its funds, with the approval of the government, to procure\nplant or equipment, it is 20\u00a3 permitted to charge depreciation on these assets\nfor purposes of reducing its taxable income in that year or in subsequent years.\nIf a firm supplements its investeringsfonder with funds from other sources, it\ncan carry the asset on its balance sheet at the value represented by the amount\nof the funds it supplied.

This unsatisfactory state of affairs is brought home to us by the\nfact that, beginning with Edgeworth, the price, under conditions of\nbilateral monopoly, is designated as \"indeterminate\" by authoritative\neconomists (B\u00f3hm-Bawerk, Bowley, A. M. Henderson, Marshall,\nNichol, Pigou, Stackelberg, Stigler, Tintner). This indeterminateness\nis not a characteristic of the price in itself (as is conceded by some of the\naforesaid economists), but is a consequence of the inadequate theories of\nbilateral monopoly that miss their mark, ;.e., the determination of the\nfinal price resulting from the bargaining. If we accept the theory that\nthis price is indeterminate, we submit to agnosticism. But the agnostic\nattitude is sometimes defended, by pointing out that the problem is not\neconomic, but one that belongs in the realm of psychology. However,\nthis argument cannot be accepted, because one of the tasks of economics\nis to elucidate the relation between the price and the psychological\nfactors (the latter being known as data). Neither is it allowable to neglect\nthe problem with the argument that the element of power plays a de-\ncisive r\u00f3le at the bargaining table; as will be shown below: power (as far\nas it is of an economic nature), can be analyzed by economic theory.\nThe present state of the theory is all the more unsatisfactory because\nwage determination under trade unions, being a case of bilateral monop-\noly, is also left in the dark.

Marshall employs a\ndiagram in which the axes each represent the total quantity of one or the\nother of the two commodities. In short, Viner prefers a diagram in which\na direct reading of terms of trade can be made, rather than one in which\na direct reading of total amounts traded by both countries and of approximate\nelasticities of both curves can be made.!? We shall now use Marshallian curves\nto present Viner's concept of the problem.\n\nIn Figure 2, curve G\" represents an elastic G demand curve, and E and E\nare elastic E-curves. The problem calls for E', the increased E demand, to be\niso-elastic to E with regard to price: at every price, the difference in the\nquantity of imports demanded (and exports supplied) between the two curves\nis the same proportion of the original quantity demanded as at every other\nprice. Therefore, when the curves are straight lines, E' is parallel to E.\nConsidering the curves in their entirety, E and E' would not normally be\nparallel, for they would pass through the origin.

In Viner's figure, the new intersection is directly right of the old,\ni.., at the same price level.\n\n? Not only is Duncan's procedure inadequate in cases involving an inelastic G-curve,\nbut, even though the E-curves be shifted in such a way as to give the same terms of\ntrade when either method is followed, the magnitudes of the imports and exports involved\nwill depend on the method employed.\n\n? When the change in trade is an increase, we may restate Marshall's conclusions in\nterms of the relative magnitudes of movements. Viner uses this terminology, and Graham\nsuggests that Marshall shoud have done so, at least in speaking of the terms of trade.\nHowever, G's exports decrease when G's curve is inelastic; thus, E's imports show less\nchange from their original total and are greater the more elastic is E's curve.\n",
                    "an equi-proportional shift for Viner is an iso-elastic shift with respect to rice;\nfor Marshall, it is an iso-elastic shift with respect to quantity. Although it\nhas not been so stated in the literature, an iso-elastic shift of some kind is\nthe significant kind of movement, for we wish to determine the effects of a\nshift of a curve of given elasticity.\n\nSince Marshall's procedure involves an increase of E's exports for a given\nquantity of G's exports, which constitutes a fall in the relative price of E's\ncommodities, Duncan states that Viner, in wishing to restate Marshall's\nproposition, should have shifted his E-curve vertically downward instead of\nhorizontally to the right.? Now, so far as just the export ratio of the two\ncountries is concerned (or the import-export ratio of either country), an\nincrease in E's demand could be represented by maintaining E's exports and\nreducing G's exports, or by holding G's exports constant and increasing E's\nexports. The latter method is Marshall's. Duncan, who is attempting to re-\nstate Marshall's solution with a Viner-type diagram, inexplicably uses the\nformer method. His version of Viner's figure is correct on that basis, but by\nassuming that E's exports remain constant while the terms of trade vary, it is\nnot possible to analyze the Marshallian problem involving an inelastic G-\ncurve.^ If Marshall's approach is used, \u00a3.e., increasing E's exports and\nmaintaining constant E's imports, by moving the increasing E-curves along a\nrectangular hyperbola, it can be seen that some of Marshall's stated con-\nclusions do not obtain for E when the G-curve is inelastic. ((The same demon-\nstration can be made on Marshall's own diagram, of course.)\n\nIn Figure 1, R is constructed as a rectangular hyperbola, so that at any\npoint on & the quantity of E's imports (G's exports) remains constant al-\nthough the terms of trade change. G is an elastic curve, and G\" is inelastic.\n\"The e and e' curves are more elastic than E and E\". With the elastic G curve,\nan increase in E's demand causes E's exports and imports to be greater and\nher terms of trade to be worse the more elastic the E-curve; and, with a\ngiven increase in E's demand, the more elastic the G-curve the greater is Gs\ntrade and the worse her terms\u2014which are Marshall's conclusions. However,\nwith the inelastic G^ curve, not all of Marshall's conclusions hold for E:\nthe more elastic is E's curve, the smaller the change!! in her trade, and the\nbetter her terms. With Duncan's alteration of Viner's diagram, it would\nappear that the more elastic is E's curve, the worse is E's terms of trade and\nthe larger her exports even when the G-curve is inelastic; and, again in\n",
