No\nincrease in reserve requirements was undertaken; long-term bonds were not\nissued by the Treasury between the summer of 1955 and the fall of 1957; the\ndiscount rate was raised in a series of small steps; and the Federal Reserve\nsystem did not initiate a continuous deflationary open-market policy\u2014the\nholdings of securities by the system were practically as large at the end of\n1956 as at the end of 1954. In short the monetary authorities were reluctant\nto initiate a vigorous restrictive monetary policy to compensate for the rise in\nthe velocity of money during this period [1, p. 38]. Under these conditions, a\ncost-inflationary bias was injected into the economy because the monetary\nauthorities were unwilling to control the volume of bank credit.\n\nTn times of full employment, it is the action of monetary authorities which\ndetermines the stability of the price level. And a qualified wage-price inflation\nthesis that only emphasizes federal spending is inadequate. Excessive money-\nwage-rate changes can be compensated for by a rise in the quantity of money\nor its velocity. It is precisely the willingness of the monetary authorities in\nmost countries to feed the stream of monetary demand sufficiently to accom-\nmodate excessive money-wage-rate increases that enables the wage-push proc-\ness to operate; or alternatively, the unwillingness of the authorities to counter-\nact the more active use of the existing stock of money induced by cost in-\ncreases or mild credit restraints.\n\nWhether trade union leaders believe that the unemployment resulting from\nexcessive wage rate increases will be compensated for by federal contracyclical\npolicies is irrelevant. (It is hard to believe that any American trade union\nleader believes this, especially in light of both Democratic and Republican\nadministration reluctance to use such policies since the passage of the Employ-\nment Act of 1946.) Union leaders only have to be aware of the fact that wage-\nrate increases do not cause continuous unemployment; given this empirical\nobservation, they will reintensify their upward pressure on wage rates. What\nis needed is to include in the Employment Act of 1946 the goal of reasonable\nstability of prices.

Given the government's commit-\nment to the goals contained in the Employment Act of 1946, the Federal Re-\nserve authorities may be expected to pursue a policy of monetary restraint\ncautiously. Otherwise the application of strong doses of monetary restraint\nwill bring on the very decline of aggregate economic activity which it is the\nresponsibility of the federal government to prevent.\n\nIn 1955 production expanded at a record rate. The index of industrial pro-\nduction, at 123 in August 1954, rose to 130 by December, and to 144 by De-\ncember 1955. The gross national product rose in 1955, 1956, and the first 9\nmonths in 1957. The consumer price index did not commence to rise until the\nbeginning of 1956, and wholesale prices until mid-1955. Although the money\nsupply (the total of paper currency plus demand deposits) expanded little\nfrom the first quarter in 1955 to the fourth quarter in 1957 (the expansion\nwas $2.8 billion), a substantial rise in the velocity of money occurred. The\nrate of turnover in the money supply increased by approximately 15 per cent\nfrom the first quarter of 1955 through the fourth quarter of 1957. This is\nequivalent to a 15 per cent rise in the money supply with a constant velocity.\n\nThese velocity changes simply reflect an increase in the supply of close\nsubstitutes for money. The public was substituting savings deposits and short-\nterm government securities for checking deposits; for this period, the level of\ntime deposits expanded from $75.6 billion to $88 billion; balances in savings\nand loan associations increased from $27.9 billion to $41 billion; and the pub-\nlic's holdings in short-term government securities rose from $25.6 billion to\n$37 billion. The public found it advantageous to economize on its holdings of\ncash, and financial institutions which gained these funds loaned them out\npromptly to spenders. As a result, the turnover of the money supply was ac-\ncelerated causing trouble for monetary policy [3, p. 180].\n\nTo be sure the government moved rather promptly to curb the inflationary\nforces generated during 1955.

Its consumption-perpetuity points are not\ngiven by tangencies in Leontie\u00ed's Figure 1.\n\nTo show that the alternative plan raises \"the level of welfare\" above that\n", "1040\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "3": ["is to be consumed, when in fact the analysis involves the determination of how\nmuch is to be consumed each day.\n\nAn optimal plan through time must meet a crucial test. Regardless of what\nthe total quantity of capital is to be at some particular future point in time,\nsay at \u00a3 \u2014 T (and what this amount is to be is, of course, itself to be de-\ntermined), so that the sum of the capital additions for all periods from say\nt \u2014 Lto\u00a3 \u2014 T is specified, it must be impossible to raise what Leontief refers\nto as the \"level of welfare,\" ie., ordinal utility, by increasing capital for-\nmation at any one point in time and reducing it by the same amount at any\nother point in time. For instance, in the plan illustrated by Leontief's Figure\nl, consider the capital stock at \u00a3 \u2014 3 specified at the stationary level de-\ntermined by him. Since the capital stock at \u00a3 \u2014 1 is given, the total capital\nformation over the interval from 1 to 3 is determined. The crucial test is:\nReshuffle (arbitrage) the total investment between the first two time periods;\nincrease capital formation by a unit at 4 \u2014 1 and decrease it by a unit at\nt \u2014 2, or vice versa; this must not increase total utility. Leontief's solution\nfails this test.\n\n'The issue is clarified and dramatized if we associate some numbers with\nLeontief's example given in his Figures 1 and 2. We select a utility index so\nthat each indifference curve has associated with it the utility:\n\nU \u2014 21n Ci t 1n Yia\n\nwhere C; stands for the consumption scheduled for \u00a3 \u2014 i (measured on the\nhorizontal axis in his Figure 1) and Y;.,, for the perpetuity of income com-\nmencing at \u00a3 \u2014 i -- 1 (measured on the vertical axis). These are seen to be\nindifference curves with the conventional diminishing marginal rates of sub-\nstitution (MUc/MUy \u2014 .2Yi,1/Ci), and the marginal utilities are diminish-\ning.

This is Leontief's solution. As in his own\n\n'For the smooth production function illustrated by Leontief in Figure 2 (but not in\nFigure 1) it is logically impossible for his stationary state to be reached in three time\nperiods. This state can be approached only in the limit as the number of time periods\nbecomes infinite. Readers familiar with the theory of the cobweb cycle should have no\ndi\u00edficulty in proving this.\n", "1039\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "2": ["It is the purpose of this brief note to demonstrate that, much like Hayek\n[3] [2, Ch. 17-18] before him, Leontief has in fact not succeeded in solving\nthe problem. Because he overlooks some crucial intertemporal relationships,\nhis time paths of economic development do not have the maximizing proper-\nties claimed for them.\n\nLeontief's graphical solution of how much to consume and how much to add\nto the capital stock at each point in time can be represented by what I will call\nLeontief's fundamental equations:\n\n(2) MU.,! \u2014 MPP'MU,! \u00a323,2,...\n\nThe term on the left is the marginal utility from consumption at time \u00a3. The\nfirst factor on the right is the marginal physical product from investment at \u00a3\nin the production of perpetuities of income commencing at \u00a3 -- 1. This is pos-\ntulated to diminish with increases in the capital stock. The second factor on\nthe right is the marginal utility derived from the claim to such a perpetuity\ncommencing at / 4- 1. Given an initial capital stock at / \u2014 1, an income for\nthis point in time is determined by the production function. As long as all\nthe income is consumed\u2014no more, no less\u2014the capital stock remains un-\nchanged and the same constant income will be produced. But how much\nshould be consumed and how much added to the capital stock in order to\nmaximize the satisfaction of the decision-maker? The first equation in the set\n(1) says that the income at \u00a3 \u2014 1 should be divided between current con-\nsumption and additions to the capital stock so that an extra unit of income\nwill give the same extra utility if consumed at \u00a3 \u2014 1 as will the claim to the\nMPP* units of perpetuity that can alternatively be produced with such an\nextra unit of income. This determines consumption and capital formation at\nt \u2014 1. It also specifies the capital stock at 4 \u2014 2 and hence income for \u00a3 \u2014 2.\nSimilarly the solution of the second of Leontief's fundamental equations\ndetermines the allocation of income for \u00a3 \u2014 2 between consumption and invest-\nment; and so on for succeeding time periods. Of course, we need not write any\nof the equations once the stationary state in which all of the income is consumed\nis reached, since the solution for every one of these is identical.\n\nThe clue suggesting that the plan sketched out by Leontief's process fails\nto maximize the utility function of the decision-maker is provided by the char-\nacteristic that decisions are made seriatim. The consumption-investment\nchoice for \u00a3 \u2014 1 is made without regard to and quite independently of the al-\nlocation of the output at subsequent points in time. Similarly for the alloca-\ntions at \u00a3 \u2014 2, 3. . . .

Surely it is im-\npossible to decide how much output at each point is to be allocated to con-\nsumption and capital formation without taking explicit account of how high\nthe marginal utility of consumption and the marginal productivity of capital\nwill be at each later date. After all, each one of these decisions determines how\nlarge the capital stock and consumption at each of these time points will be.\nIt almost seems as if Leontief's solution is a plan which determines consump-\ntion for each day under the assumption that on the following day a/] income\n", "1038\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "1": ["Time-Preference and Economic Growth: Comment\n\nIn a recent note [4] appearing in this Review, Wassily Leontief provided\n*a relatively simple method of graphic presentation and analysis . . .\" of time\npaths (involving many time intervals) of investment, capital, income and\nconsumption that are said to be the consequences of maximizing behavior.\nMany years ago Irving Fisher, on whose pioneering analysis Leontief's paoer\nis based, ended his brilliant graphical exposition of the two-period paths on\na pessimistic note for the literary economist.

To J. R. Rose we can only apologize for\nhaving led him astray by our failure to adjust explicitly the definition of a\n\"class\" [3, p. 266, par. 2] when we introduced debt financing (Sec. I.B). We\nshould have said more clearly, in the very beginning perhaps, that what\ndetermines membership in a class is the stream generated by the assets held\nby the firm, not the stream accruing to the shares. The two streams, of course,\nhappen to be completely equivalent in our first special case of no borrowing,\nbut only in that case. We hope the above emendation plus a study of Durand's\nnumerical parable of Petrolease, Leverfund and Closecorp will clear up the\nmisunderstanding.\n\nWe do not propose to go over Durand's comment point by point partly for\nreasons of space, and partly because on many issues we have little to add to\n(or retract from) what we originally wrote. There are, however, four issues\nwhere Durand's comments (plus correspondence we have had with many\nothers) have led us to believe that some further elaboration of our model and\nour approach to the empirical problems might serve a useful purpose.\n\nBefore proceeding to this task, however, we should like to remind readers\nof the considerable areas of agreement between Durand and us which are\neasy to overlook in critical exchanges of this kind. Despite his sternly critical\ntone, he agrees (1) that our conclusions, which \"contradict widely accepted\nbeliefs\" can be regarded as valid at least \"in their own properly limited\ntheoretical context\" (see p. 640) ; and (2) that for all the attention that lever-\nage has received in the literature of finance \"the influence, if any, of leverage\non the cost of capital has so far escaped detection\" (p. 652).

The underlying significance is seldom apparent\non the surface; and it is very easy to confuse rule-of-thumb procedures with\nunderlying policies, self-justifying ex ost explanations with actual objectives.\n\"These instructive case studies enrich the abstract concepts of market power\nand its exercise; but they do not seem to me to undermine the economist's\ntraditional concern with that power, and his corresponding assumption that\nto the extent such power exists it will be exercised in the interest of those\n\nwho possess it.\n- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- T^ T...\n", "It is of course impossible to state to what extent these variant pricing pro-\ncedures and proximate goals have in fact been explicitly and rationally related\nto profit calculations; it seems certain that they have not been uniformly and\nconsistently. But the evidence in the Brookings monograph certainly does\nnot justify the opposite conclusion\u2014that they represent company objectives\nalternative, and equal in importance, to profit maximization. It seems to me\nthey are best explained, primarily, as alternative roads to the same destina-\ntion.\n", "678\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "8": ["covery and pre-emption of new fields, while others will be content to meet\ncompetition\" [5, p. 939], that some companies will emphasize product qual-\nity, others service, still others price, and so on. The second observation is not.\n\nIt would take a more intensive analysis than is possible here of the reasons\nthe various companies offered for using different methods of pursuing different\nproximate goals in their pricing to support this contention that the ultimate\nobjectives might none the less have been the same. A few citations must\nsuffice. The discussion of the strategy of the big meat packers, where price\npolicy on the buying side is directed primarily at preserving market shares\n[4, pp. 46-47], runs clearly in terms of rational oligopsony.!* The necessity\nfor Standard of Indiana to abandon its hitherto rigid formula pricing methods\nafter 1948, in order to preserve its shrunken market against competitive in-\nroads, again hardly requires complex or novel explanation, any more than\ndoes the consistent price-following policy of Gulf Oil and National Steel. The\nfact that American Can aims at a fixed margin above the cost of tinplate,\npreferring to compete primarily on the basis of service; that Kennecott, by\nfar the largest seller of copper to independent fabricators [4, p. 179], tries to\nstabilize market price; that companies with large shares of their market try\nto avoid price cutting as a competitive strategy except where demand appears\nto be very elastic\u2014these various policies hardly vitiate, on the contrary\nthey seem explicable primarily in terms of, the assumption of profit maxi-\nmization. That the goal calls for different strategies and suggests different\nrule-of-thumb procedures in different market contexts does not disprove the\nuniformity of objective.\n\nThe fact that oligopolists usually refrain from increasing published prices\nexcept in response to increases in direct costs is often cited as evidence of a\nfailure to maximize. It may indeed be, except in some rather attenuated, long-\nrun sense. However, it is not difficult to reconcile such behavior with pure\nmarginalism: if the degree of monopoly power (ie., the inelasticity of de-\nmand) is (or seems to the oligopolist) unchanged, the market will in fact\nbear (or seem to bear) a fixed percentage mark-up over marginal costs. The\nprofit-maximizing price will therefore change only with changes in direct\ncosts and not with changes in demand, so long as marginal costs are constant\nwithin the relevant range [8, p. 459]. Hence cost-plus pricing, which tends to\nproduce price stability and the appearance\u2014indeed, it can hardly be doubted,\nat times like 1946-48 an actuality\u2014of charging less than the traffic will bear,\nis not necessarily inconsistent with even short-run profit maximization.5\n\n\" Conceivably, as Lanzillotti points out [5, p. 934, n. 13], the long-run investment\npolicies that must also be explained if one is to explain the long-run stability of market\nShares are irrational; but the monograph offers no evidence on this score.\n\n? [t is not clear how heroic are the assumptions required to equate short-period profit\nmaximization with cost-plus pricing in this fashion. However the two crucial assumptions\n\u2014that marginal costs be constant and the elasticity of demand unchanging (at least so far\nas business men can tell or it is feasible for them to tell) within the relevant range\u2014seer\nrealistic for manufacturing. The discussion of American Can in the Brookings study\nseems to illustrate some such situation, emphasizing as it does the importance of direct raw\nmaterial cost in the final price of the cans, and the reported lack of interest of canners\nin the absolute level of can prices. So the authors refer to American Can as the \"trans-\nmission belt for passing material and labor cost on to consumers with an inelastic demand\"\n", "677\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "7": ["IL. Other Pricing Formulae\n\nApart from the prevalence of full-cost pricing in one form or another, the\nauthors tend to reject the assumption of maximization because of the variety\nof pricing methods different companies employ. It is difficult to disagree with\nLanzillotti's conclusion that \"no single motivational hypothesis such as profit-\nmaximization . . . is likely to impose an unambiguous course of action . . .\"\n[5, pp. 938-39]. But it does not follow, as he suggests, that pricing policies\nare in almost every case equivalent to a . . . choice from among competing\nobjectives rather than policies tested by any simple concept of profits maxi-\nmization\" [p. 939, stress supplied]. The one statement merely recognizes\ndifferent possible methods for achieving the goal of maximization; the other\ndemotes the goal itself to one among a host of competing objectives.\" The\nfirst observation seems clearly justified by Lanzillott's summary of the\nBrookings studies, to the effect that *one company will prefer stability, an-\nother will seek to expand its market share, or to engage in continuous dis-\n\n?]t is here that maximizing considerations stand out most explicitly in his own discus-\n\nSion as not merely the primary but virtually the exclusive determinant [see 5, pp. 930-31,\nincluding note 10].\n", "the period after the second world war. In this event, it is a reasonable ques-\ntion whether the low price policy on ingot might not have reflected a decline\nin the company's monopoly power and the prohibition by antitrust decree of\nthe kind of margin-squeezing promotional pricing described above [see 4,\npp. 30, 142-43], just as Wallace had advocated long before [9, p. 395].\n\nIt is precisely in the case of new or distinctive products, where, according\nto the authors, companies have the widest discretion and are most apt to\nresort to formula methods in general and target-return pricing in particular\n[5, p. 930], that profit maximization stands out most clearly in these studies.\nOne final illustration is General Electric's description of the considerations\nthat went into pricing its new portable dishwasher: its unwillingness to use\nprice as a selling point because it believed demand inelastic at the outset; its\nexpenditure of \"another $5.00 . . . on streamlining and in embellishment\"\nwhich \"made it look like another $30 to the customer\" [4, pp. 59-60]. It\nis here that Lanzillotti's emphasis on the nonmaximizing characteristics of\ntarget-return pricing, with \"fairness\" and \"reasonableness\" as its prime de-\nterminant, seems most clearly inappropriate.!*\n\n5. These contentions derive some indirect support, finally, from Lanzillotti's\nobservation that investment policy is itself a vital long-range aspect and\ndeterminant of short-run price policy [5, p. 940]. The rates of return pricing\ncan seek and hope to elicit are themselves conditioned by the relationship of\ncapacity to demand; and the choice among investment projects that give rise\nto production capacity is concededly made primarily on the basis of the re-\nSpective rates of return promised. Even the biggest, price-leading companies\nprofess to be powerless to do more than seek out what the market will take\u2014\nan admission that is in any event clearly in conflict with the \"public utility\"\npricing analogy; but what the market will take is itself heavily influenced by\nthe investment decisions of the firms enjoying access to it.\n", "676\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "6": ["something to do with the way it was priced. The company's explanation of\nthe postwar pricing history of nylon [4, pp. 105-7] runs in terms of in-\ncreasing production costs and inelastic demand (except for instances when,\nin time of extreme shortage, the company refrained from charging anything\nlike what the grey market was paying); research and development costs are\nnot mentioned. The one deliberate price reduction mentioned was for 840\ndenier yarn, used in tire cord, a cut \"aimed at further penetration of this\nmarket at the expense of rayon\" [4, p. 107]. Again, the authors can explain\ndu Pont's apparently more aggressive price reductions in the corresponding\nearly history of cellophane only in terms of differences in their respective\ncosts and price elasticities of demand; the former are not defined to include\nresearch costs [4, p. 254]. And of course the company's own statement of\npolicy, quoted above, can similarly be interpreted in marginalist terms: the\nvalue of the \"achievement\" is, clearly, defined largely in terms of elasticity\nof demand. In the end, after once again implying that research expenses must\nbe allocated among products and so enter their prices on some \"fair share\"\nbasis (which may well be true as a matter of accounting procedure), the au-\nthors conclude *'the company comes close to charging, over the long run, what\nthe traffic will bear\" [4, pp. 154, 155]: research cost-plus pricing is not\nmentioned.!?\n\nThere are other instances in the monograph where alleged nonmaximizing\nconsiderations in fixing prices would have been irrational and seem moreover\nto be refuted by the evidence. For example, Alcoa officials asserted that the\ncompany's \"pricing of aluminum ingot, the pivotal price for aluminum prod-\nucts, has been based on promotion of the use of aluminum,\" and that in so\ndoing the company \"has consistently refrained from charging all the traffic\nwill bear\" in this market. [4, pp. 31-32]. Surely, first, a rational monopolist\nseeking to promote the use of aluminum could better strike the profit-maxi-\nmizing balance in the light of varying elasticities of demand for different\naluminum products not by taking a low price on all sales, but, instead, by\nholding up the price of ingot on sales to fabricators, and, integrating forward\ninto the price-elastic lines, accepting low nominal fabricating margins in those\nlines. Second, Wallace concludes that profits at the monopolistic ingot level\nwere much higher than at the competitive fabricating levels, and high also in\ncomparison with American industry generally, for the very reason indicated\n[9, Ch. 11]. The Alcoa statement quoted above refers, it is true, mainly to\n\nrepeats Judge Ryan's figure of $45 million spent on research as an example of the \"sub-\nstantial investment at considerable risk\" required for innovation today), Willard E.\nMueller's devastating analysis of what the Company's own president referred to as a\n*$27,000,000 gamble\" [7, p. 84] should be required reading for economists. Mueller shows\nthat only about $787,000, spent on rescarch, really involved \"the big gamble\"; another\n$391,000 went into the pilot plant. All the additional millions of dollars were for construct-\ning a commercial plant, after the technical and commercial attractiveness of nylon had\nbeen clearly established.\n\n? As this conclusion indicates, the authors are themselves skeptical that du Pont really\nprices new products to any significant extent on the basis of research and developmental\ncosts plus a reasonable return. They nowhere state that it does.\n", "675\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "5": ["formula in view of its having earned an average 26 per cent after tax rather\nthan the \"fair and reasonable\" target 20 in the 1947-55 period.!?\n\n4. In many situations, target-return pricing simply does not make sense\nexcept as an ex post rationalization of profit-maximization. Explications of the\nmethod by company officials tend irresistibly to proffer \"good\" rather than\n\"real\" reasons-\u2014although considerations of fairness, or defensibility before\nCongressional investigating committees (or against wage demands) undoubt-\nedly play some role in pricing decisions, in some companies more than others.\n\nFor example, the policy sometimes proclaimed by du Pont officials of de-\ntermining the prices of new products with reference to the research and devel-\nopmental expenses they have involved would actually be an irrational means\nof recouping those expenses. Here is the company's avowed explanation:\n\nIf our contribution of an improved new product is an exceptional\nachievement because of long and expensive research and development\nand a high permanent investment hazard, and if it affords profitable\nopportunities to consumers or converters, we feel we are entitled to an\nexceptionally good return and we ask a corresponding price for it. If\nour contribution has been only a moderate one, then we determine upon\na price that will give us a profit consistent with our work, effort, and\nrisk [5, p. 153].\n\nThe statement is equivocal; yet clearly, among other things, it implies that\nthe *value of the contribution\" that helps determine price is determined in\nlarge measure by its cost, including the risks it has entailed. But it makes no\nsense to try to recoup research costs by charging a cost-based price that either\nexceeds or falls short of the profit-maximizing level. Sunk costs may be used\nto justify a price embodying a high mark-up over out-of-pocket expenses,\nfor public relations purposes; but it cannot explain it, unless the responsible\nofficials have thrown rationality to the winds. The only connection in which\nthey might intelligently relate price to sunk costs ex ante would be if they\nreduced or voluntarily accepted less than a profit-maximizing price that\nthreatened to recoup too much (by standards of reasonableness or whatever)\n\u2014never if they increased or exceeded a profit-maximizing price that threat-\nened to recoup too little. So, references to heavy research and developmental\nexpenses are not convincing as explanations of high prices and profit margins;\nand that is what they are usually adduced to explain.\n\nThat du Pont does not in fact behave in this irrational manner is sug-\ngested by the monograph's story of nylon-pricing\u2014an account the authors\npreface with the (irrelevant) statement that research in developing the fiber\n\"cost the company $6 million,\"'* and with the implication that this fact had\n\n? See the authors! mild expression of skepticism about the relevance of General Motors?\npricing formula in the light of its actual profit experience [4, pp. 55, 134].\n\n?' The authors add that \"21 million was spent on manufacturing facilities before com-\nmercial operations and sales began\" [4, p. 103]. Since the financial dimensions of du Pont's\nrisks in the development of nylon have become part of the folklore on the relationship\nbetween business size, patent protection and innovation (for example, the Report of the\nAttorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws [10, p. 225, n. 8]\n", "674\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "4": ["panies to price as stably as possible over the business cycle, Lanzillotti ob-\nserves that \"in pricing different items in the product line, there will be an\neffort (sustained in individual cases by the pricing executive's conscience) to\nrefrain from exploiting any item beyond the limit set by cost-plus\" [5, p.\n932], an approach to profit-maximization at least over a period of years is\ntypically already built into either the \"cost\" or the \"plus,\" and most often\nthe latter.5\n\n3. Rationality of pricing policy, as the economist has traditionally defined\nit, is suggested also in the divergences of actual company returns from their\nrespective targets\u2014above it for extended periods of time, where the market\npermits; below it where the market requires. As for the latter instances, the\ntarget evidently represents a mixture of expectation and hope: the case\nstudies abound with instances of companies accepting less where they had to,\nwith pricing on a virtual incremental cost basis if necessary.? International\nHarvester's failure to achieve even the modest 10 per cent goal in the 1947-55\nperiod (its actual average return was 8.9 per cent) suggests that the modesty\nof the target was an evidence not of restraint on profit maximization but real-\nism; and that the company must have been trying to get all it could. More\nsignificant in the present context is the persistence of actual returns markedly\nabove the target. General Motors has shown no tendency to alter its pricing\n\nitself a reflection of the inhospitality of meat markets to this kind of pricing. So the fact\nthat some companies can and others find they cannot base pricing on full-cost or that\nSome products permit it and others do not is itself a reflection of what the market will\nallow in the way of a profit-maximizing policy. See, e.g., Kaplan's explanation of why\nthat kind of pricing is impossible in fresh meats, possible in automobiles, possible for\nAlcoa, decreasingly so for Standard of Indiana, and impossible for Kennecott [4, pp. 47,\n86-91, 131, 142, 176-77, 185]. See also the discussion in section II below.\n\n*]t is difficult to be certain how meaningful is Lanzillotti's observation that \"individual\nproducts, markets, and pricing are not considered in isolation . . . . pricing is frequently\ndone for product groups with an eye to the over-all profit position of the company\"\n[5, p. 939]. If this means anything in the context of our present discussion, it must be that\ncompanies will typically charge on their high-margin lines only enough to raise aggregate\ncompany profits to the target level, This would be difficult to prove in the case of du Pont,\nSince that company specifes no over-all target; targets evidently are set product by\nproduct only, and all together produced an average return of 25.9 per cent after taxes in\n1947-55. If instead my points (1) and (2) are correct, Lanzillotti should have gone on\nas follows: *However, individual products and markets contribute to that over-all profit\nlargely on the basis of their varying elasticities of demand, and the aggregate profit itself\nseems closely attuned to what in fact the company finds it can stably earn.\"\n\nIt appears from the context in which the foregoing statement appears, however, that\nLanzillotti may mean only that costs and revenues for individual products and markets\ncan seldom be meaningfully estimated in isolation, because of the prevalence of joint costs\nand benefits. This is of course quite true. For example, Johns-Manville and International\nHarvester are forced by their desire to offer a full line into accepting returns well below\nthe target on certain products [5, p. 160]. Vet if the two companies! faith in the full\nline is justified, the returns on the \"line-filling\" items are only nominally low; and failure\nto drop them may well reflect the maximizing calculation that the incremental costs of\ncarrying them are lower than their fully allocated costs, and the incremental revenue\nlosses from dropping them greater than their nominal returns. The authors specifically\npoint this out in the case of International Harvester [4, pp. 73, 76-77].\n\n? For examples of the latter practice, see the cases of International Harvester, just cited,\nand of Esso Standard [4, p. 82].\n", "673\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["cited rationalization of the particular target rate selected, \"fair or reasonable\nreturn\" [5, p. 931], openly invites the analogy to public utility pricing. Vet\nthe authors offer us no reason to believe that the decision-makers of Inter-\nnational Harvester (who aim at 10 per cent on investment after taxes) are\nmore public-spirited than those of General Motors (who aim at 20 per cent) ;\nof Alcoa (about 10 per cent), than du Pont (no specific figure given, but the\ncompany averaged 25.9 per cent in the period 1947-55) ; of U.S. Steel (8 per\ncent), than General Electric (20 per cent); the compilation of these targets\nand actual profits data by Lanzillotti [5, pp. 924-27] is extremely illuminat-\ning. It would seem that what is \"fair and reasonable\" varies from industry\nto industry. The most plausible explanation of the differences is to be found\nin the divergent objective facts of the market place which determine what the\ntraffic will bear\u2014in particular the ease of entry, number of sellers, indepen-\ndence of competitive action, standardization of products, degree of patent\nprotection, and so on.5\n\n2. The maximization hypothesis seems even more clearly supported by the\nwidely varying investment-return components of these companies! prices on\ndifferent products. Wide variations in what the market will bear frequently\nproduce corresponding divergent \"target\" as well as actual rates of return,\nsome above, some below the company-wide target;? in some instances, the\ncosts of joint products are themselves allocated on the basis of what the\nmarket will allow.\" When, therefore, in discussing the tendency of these com-\n\nto 'maximize' profits on a year-to-year basis. Moreover, to construe the actual profit rates\n(as against target rates) as evidence of a long-run maximization policy would require the\ndemonstration that the prices charged were based not upon the targets but on what the\nfirms believed they could get as a maximum. In any event, for this sample of firms and\nfor this time period, there are limitations upon profit maximization as an adequate explana-\ntion of the relationships between profit targets and actual profit rates.\" I have no serious\nquarrel with the doubts he expresses about maximization *on a ycar-to-year basis.\" But,\nas will appear, I do submit that the divergences between target and actual rates are\nindications of a policy of profit-maximization; and deny that the target rates are set\nprimarily, as in the case of public utilities (see note 3 above), on the basis of considerations\nof fairness or reasonableness [cf. 4, p. 931].\n\nIn his review of the Kaplan, Dirlam and Lanzillotti book [6] Jesse Markham makes\nmuch the same observations as follow here as points 2 and 3. The discussion here, orig-\ninally prepared before the Markham reviewed appeared, has been compressed to avoid\nundue repetition of his analysis.\n\n\"For an exposition of full-cost pricing in which the allowance for net profit added to\nstandard cost is explicitly related to what the market will allow, see Andrews [1, pp.\n163-80]. And of course Bain [2, Ch. 7] has done pioneer work in statistically verifying\nthe relationship between profitability on the one hand and concentration and barriers to\nentry on the other.\n\n* See, for example, the cases of Alcoa [4, p. 31], International Harvester [4, pp. 72-74],\nUnion Carbide [4, pp. 112-13; compare here particularly the pricing of ethylene glycol,\nthe raw material, and Prestone, pp. 116-17, 265], and du Pont [4, p. 151]\u2014all companies\navowedly pricing on the basis of cost plus a target rate of return. As Ronald Coase com-\nmenting on Heflebower's paper observed [3, pp. 392-03], it is very difficult to avoid mar-\nginalist explanations of price discrimination; and multiproduct sales at different mark-ups\nare a similar phenomenon from the standpoint of the seller.\n\n\" See, for example, the case in meats [4, p. 47], and of du Pont [4, p. 152, note 25].\nSwift, it is true, does not price on a target-return basis, but its inability to do so is\n", "672\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "2": ["the assumption that even giant corporations do try in their pricing to maxi-\nmize profits, in a meaningful sense, and that their prices therefore reflect\nlargely what the objective circumstances of the market will, or in a world\nof uncertainty will seem to, permit.\n\nExtensive reference to the voluminous literature on this subject is inap-\npropriate here, except to point out that it amply demonstrates how complex\nis the seemingly innocent question: Do large businesses price to maximize\nprofits? It is possible of course to answer the question affirmatively by\nstretching the concepts of *maximization\" and \"profit\" so wide in time, space\nand content as to say no more than that the community of managers and\nowners does act, and in so doing presumably tries to serve what it somehow\nconceives to be its best collective interests. The information in the Brookings\nmonograph, I suggest, lends support to a much narrower and more workable\nconclusion: that these large corporations typically price to maximize mone-\ntary profits\u2014not day-by-day, to be sure, but to a large extent year-by-year\nand certainly over a fairly brief period of years. The evidence does not, I\nsuggest, justify Lanzillotti's generalization that \"these corporations tend\nto behave more and more like public utilities\" [5, p. 940], if one refers not\nto pricing formulas, techniques or retrospective rationalizations, but to \"pric-\ning objectives,\" which are the subject of his article.'\n\nI. Pricing to Vield a Target Return on Investment\n\nAmong the \"pricing goals\" cited by company executives, the authors en-\ncountered \"perhaps most frequently\"\u2014in about half the observations, and\nincreasingly over time\u2014mention of pricing to achieve a target return on in-\nvestment [5, pp. 923, 929]. The prevalence of this phenomenon, which is\nreally an aspect of full-cost pricing,? provides their principal evidence against\nprofitmaximization in general? and the marginalist description thereof in\nparticular. The misconstruction is in confusing procedures with *goals.\" Ac-\ntually, the target return seems above all to reflect what the executives think\nthe company can get; and to the extent actual earnings diverge from the\ntarget, it is because the market turns out to allow more or less.*\n\n1. This interpretation is supported first by the differences between the tar-\ngets set by the various companies interviewed. The first and most frequently\n\n\"The difference between our interpretations is one of degree and emphasis only; but\nthe difference is important, to economics and to public policy.\n\n*See the excellent analysis and survey of the literature by Heflebower [3, particularly\np. 364]. In the sale of consumer durables, like appliances and automobiles, where com-\npetition year-by-year takes the form largely of changes in product design, the procedure\nis to some extent better characterized as \"price-minus costing\" than \"cost-plus pricing.\"\nAn acceptable consumer price\u2014say $299.50 for a standard washing machine\u2014is first\ndetermined, and the manufacturer then decides what \"features\" it can a\u00edford to build\ninto the product. But the build-up of costs in this fashion includes the target or normal\nrate of return. See especially the discussion of General Electric [4, pp. 58, 61]; on auto-\nmobiles, sce [4, pp. 49-53].\n\n*It is \"especially the target-return-minded companies\" that, according to Lanzillotti,\n\"tend to behave . . . like public utilities\" [5, p. 940].\n\n* Cf.

The latter possibility is particularly acute when the\nraw materials consist essentially of discursive statements of opinion, elicited\nin personal interviews with interested parties, as in the Kaplan, Dirlam and\nLanzillotti Pricing in Big Business, A Case Approach [4].

There is no reference to \"preventing competition\"\nor even embarrassing a competitor, or to any particular store; the letter sets\nforth a policy of continuous profitable low prices.

In point of fact, however, the problems of internal control, the\n\"banker mentality\" (liquidity-solvency motives) of large firms and the fear\nof temporary financial embarrassment or inability to expand as rapidly as\nmanagement feels necessary, outweigh the profits-maximization problem for the\nlarge corporation in the determination of price policy. In effect, if the large\nfirm is to be a profits maximizer, it will be of its own free will, not the objec-\ntive compulsions of the market.!?\n\nFinally, because of the associations Kahn has made with my statement that\nthe target-return-minded companies tend to behave more and more like public\nutilities, I must admit misgivings about my use of the analogy. The reference\nwas made z0f to stress that some of these firms are more \"public spirited\"\nthan others in the group, or than other firms generally\u2014at which point I am\nin agreement with Kahn. Rather, I wished to emphasize the similarity of\napproach to pricing in the sense of ?/anning for some average rate of return\nto which some assurance of realization could be attached, not the fairness of\nthe rate.\n\nI also wish to make clear that I do not believe the findings presented on\npricing objectives undermine the economist's traditional concern with market\npower, or that we can assume that market power will not be exercised in the\ninterest of those who possess it; to the contrary, the findings should serve to\nintensify that concern [cf. 9, p. 940 and 16, p. 296 ff.]. It seems to me that one\ncan have reservations about the realism and usefulness of the conventional\nprice theory apparatus without lessening his concern about the problems of\nmonopoly and competition.\n\n\"Denn LoT a-\u2014ToTommmaMX\n", "686\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "7": ["which they base their pricing decisions, let alone consider the alternatives\nwhich the marginalist approach would ascribe to them. Pricing officials of\nthese large corporations feel they do not need to have precise estimates of the\nprice sensitivity of demand nor detailed information on current costs. They\nvastly prefer to use standard cost methods\u2014 systems which they feel provide\nthem with more security and stability\u2014and, annually, or semiannually, revi-\nsions can be made in these standards in the light of actual experience.?\n\nIn effect, while some of the findings on pricing objectives might be recon-\nciled with some variant of the profits-maximization hypothesis, this does not\nmean that they are not also consistent with my position that profits maximiza-\ntion is not the dominant motive of the firm, particularly the large corporate\noligopoly. Given empirical findings are likely to be consistent with, or at least\npartially reconcilable with, many hypotheses. The essential question is:\nwhich hypotheses are likely to yield the most useful and reliable short-run\nand long-run predictions for such issues as the effects of fiscal policy on the\nrate of change in prices and the effects of wage-rate increases on the general\nlevel of prices? The strength of the profits-maximization hypothesis, and per-\nhaps the reason why economists have held on to it so tenaciously for all mar-\nket structures is that, granted its heroic assumptions, it yields unique predic-\ntions with respect to many variables. The essential strength of the target-\nreturn thesis is that it has a much higher degree of plausibility and realism in a\nworld where large firms have (a) such strong asset positions; (b) limited\nknowledge with respect to the possible cost and revenue alternatives created\nby (c) wide diversity of product lines, and the nature of multiprocess multi-\nplant operations; (d) uncertainty regarding the shape and possible shifts in\nthe short-period price-quantity function; plus (e) strongly entrenched market\nposition, with all this entails by way of oligopolistic interdependence, anti-\ntrust pressures, and Congressional inquiry. Under these circumstances the\nshort-run price will, I believe, be determined by some feasible /ong-rum ob-\njective such as a predetermined target rate of return on invested capital and/or\ntarget market share. These firms do not appear to be forced by their objective\nenvironmental circumstances to attempt to maximize profits in the monetary\n\n? Kahn is correct in stating that there is some investigation of demand for new prod-\nucts. I do not believe there is any real disagreement here; my position is that companies\ninsist on the prescribed return before production is undertaken; Kahn is referring to\npricing afterward. The attention given to elasticity of demand appears to vary primarily\naccording to type and age of product and structure of the market. On established products,\ndemand is considered mostly in terms of projections of total sales, or sales targets, with\npredominant emphasis on determining where the market is and forecasting secular growth.\nIn the case of products subject to model changes, or new products, some effort is made to\ndetermine demand elasticity at different price levels. In general, however, total demand\nis taken for granted and not much consideration is given to alternative sets of small or\nlarge price changes. A similar picture exists on cost data. Actual costs appear to have\nlittle influence on the current structure of prices. Even in companies where the most\ndetailed cost data are available to pricing officials, the typical practice is to base prices\non \"standard cost\" at some long-run *normal\" output rate. Of course, standard costs will\nreflect actual cost changes over time, but at any given time, and over the short period of\nprice theory, prices will not bear any necessary or direct relationship to actual, full, direct,\nor incremental costs in any meaningful sense [10, pp. 446-47].\n", "685\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "6": ["that U. S. Steel would raise its prices sharply in the midst of a recession, that\nFord would raise its prices to the level of General Motors' in the fall of 1957,\nor that during the period of grey markets in automobiles and steel following\nthe second world war, the manufacturers would set prices below what on the\nbasis of market considerations alone unquestionably could have been possible.*\nCertainly this behavior falls outside of the concept of profits maximization of\nmarginal theory. Does it also fall outside of Kahn's definition?\n\nIf Swift's management were really attempting ultimately to maximize profits\nin the monetary sense, it seems that\u2014despite the limitations imposed by the\n1920 consent judgment\u2014 they would have reinvested the company's earnings\nand depreciation funds much more in some other lines, perhaps even move\ncompletely out of or at least substantially reduce the present size of their\nmeatpacking operations. If 4 & P were really attempting to maximize profits\nin the same sense, it long ago should have relaxed its pressures on competitors.\nOther retail food chains, such as Food Fair, First National, Jewel Tea, and\nGrand Union for years have averaged considerably higher ratios of net operat-\ning incomes to sales than A & P [12, p. R79]. Beginning in 1937, and for\nmany years thereafter, A & P evidently was interested in earning a pre-\ndetermined dividend of $7.00 per share [15, pp. 85, 177, 631, and 637], and\nwith the public distribution of the company's stock a different over-all com-\npany goal likely will emerge as it did with Ford.\n\nFurthermore, if U. S. Steel and General Motors were attempting to maxi-\nmize profits in the monetary sense advanced by Kahn, then seemingly these\nfirms have a large number of alternative policies which could be pursued. For\nquite an extended period of years U. S. Steel was inefficient (just as many,\nperhaps most, firms have various kinds of inefficiencies that persist), and by\neliminating them (via the Ford, Bacon and Davis report) the corporation's\nprofits were increased. Was U.S. Steel maximizing in the Kahn sense before?\nIs it now? Moreover, using Kahn's concept, is it possible to predict where\nGeneral Motors will set its prices, and once established, how and on what basis\nprices are revised? To a limited extent this is possible by considering the\nprevious price, knowledge about the cost of style changes, and the company's\nstandard cost and target return\u2014in other words, the procedures.\n\nThus, while Kahn is correct in stating that the subject of my article is\npricing objectives and not procedures, objectives and procedures are very\nclosely interrelated; and in some companies, in fact, procedures to a large ex-\ntent determine price policy [9, p. 932]. I believe this is due largely to the prob-\nlems of internal control; but whatever the reasons, the pricing executives in\nsome of the companies studied seldom look beyond the particular formulae on\n\n*In response to the suggestion that in view of G.M.'s very high rate of return in 1955\nsome of the gains from that year's exceptionally high volume might have been passed on\nto buyers in the form of lower prices, G.M. President Curtice replied: \"They [our car\nprices] are as low as they can be and still produce the indicated return on the net worth\nat the standard volume. We can never be sure whether we are going to exceed the\nstandard volume or whether the market place will be such that we will sell less than the\nstandard volume\" (italics added) [17, p. 3609]. In effect, G.M. had to get its target\nreturn on net worth.\n", "684\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "5": ["agement statements unquestionably should be taken as rationalizations, as my\narticle indicates, especially those made in connection with *meeting or match-\ning competition\" (if any doubts still remain on this subject) and the ad-\nministration of prices through price leadership *as a means of approximating\nmarket equilibrium\" [9, pp. 922, 934-35, and 937-38]. However, I do not clas-\nsify profits targets and market-share targets as mere rationalizations. These\nobjectives provide management with a set of meaningful, useful, and rational\nyardsticks.*\n\nSecond, it seems essential to emphasize that the basic issue here concerns\nthe determinants of sAort-run pricing decisions of oligopolistic corporations.\nKahn has attempted to integrate, or at least to relate in some meaningful\nmanner, the pursuit of target return and other long-run pricing objectives\nwith his concept of profits maximization. It is not enough, however, to state\nthat the objectives of management are ex Post rationalizations or self-justifying\nexplanations of price behavior; nor does it suffice to argue that the pricing\nobjectives, whatever management states, amount to what the pricing execu-\ntives believe the objective circumstances of the market will bear. Pricing de-\ncisions made on the basis of the company objectives cited can be related to\nthe well-being or \"utility\" of the corporation, the long-run collective inter-\nests of management and stockholders, or some level of satisfactory profits\n(e.g., \u00e0 specific target rate of return), but Kahn has not shown us how they\nare related specifically to \u00bbonetary profits maximization. In order to reconcile\nthe pricing objectives of the firms studied with even Kahn's attenuated form\nof the profits-maximization assumption, it is essential to demonstrate a func-\ntional relationship between maximum profits in the Kahn sense and various\ndegrees of realization of the specific objectives cited. Reconciliation of target\nreturn with profits maximization requires, among other things, some rather\nstringent assumptions regarding costs and demand elasticity, as well as proof\nthat firms were driving for maximum profits with full knowledge. If one wishes\nto assume that marginal costs remain constant and that the demand curves\nfacing the firms are iso-elastic, secularly and cyclically, perhaps profits maxi-\nmization can be reconciled with profits targets, stable margins, and other ob-\njectives; but this is genuinely Pickwickian.\n\nKahn has demonstrated that one can make even his modified profits-maxi-\nmization concept so plastic that it is difficult to imagine any behavior which\nis not consistent with his hypothesis, thus making it incapable of refutation.\nHe is not disarmed by anything; no event is inconsistent with his theory. In\nshort, Kahn's main point is that variability in rates of return demonstrates\nprofits maximization and that differences in rates of return merely reflect dif-\nferences in charging what the traffic will bear. But what predictive value does\nsuch an hypothesis have for the types of corporate enterprises in question?\nKahn nowhere argues that such an assumption would permit him to predict\n\n\"These objectives promise \"reasonably satisfactory profits in the long run and a maxi-\nmum of stability in [the firm's] relations with customers, suppliers, and competitors, These\nconditions suggest that many businessmen are likely . . . to substitute the principle of sat-\nisfactory profits for that of profits-maximization\" [7, p. 271], see also [6, pp. 142-74].\n", "683\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "4": ["In view of space limitations here, I would invite the reader to examine the\ndecisions of the District Court [13] and the Circuit Court of Appeals [14],\nand the other literature cited, especially [3] [4] [5] and [8], after which he\ncan make a determination concerning Adelman's reference to *glaring errors\nof observation,\" as well as the locus of myopia in the A & P case.\n\nII. Pricing Objectives and the Profits-Maximization Hypothesis\n\nKahn has cast his net over a rather wide range of topics; his comments are\ndirected in significant part at various sections and conclusions of the Brookings\nbook Pricing in Big Business, as well as my article on pricing objectives. I\nshall limit my reply primarily to specific questions Kahn raises about the\nanalysis and interpretations in my article, but inevitably must touch on some\nof the other issues he raises. In doing this I wish to make clear that I am not\nin a position to speak for Dirlam and Kaplan, and I cannot necessarily expect\nthem to support my personal views on the varied comments Kahn makes.\n\nAs I understand Kahn, he believes the data set forth in my article are con-\nsistent with profits maximization\u2014not the conventional profits maximization\nof marginal price theory, but what he calls a more *workable\" hypothesis:\n*, . . that these large corporations typically price to maximize monetary\nprofits\u2014not day-by-day, to be sure, but to a large extent year-by-year and\ncertainly over a fairly brief period of years.\" On the other hand, in footnote 4,\nKahn states *. . . I have no serious quarrel with the doubts he expresses about\nmaximization on a year-to-year basis.\" It seems to me that Kahn should (1)\ndefine with greater specificity his own modified *workable\" concept of profits\nmaximization, and (2) if the definitions are substantively different, he should\nindicate whether his profits maximization concept will perform the same func-\ntion as the classical one. If he can draw a meaningful, and certainly a more\nprecise, distinction between his concept and that of marginal theory, we are\nprobably not very far apart in our thinking. But, if Kahn does not draw that\ndistinction and, in effect, is at one with traditional marginal price theory, the\ntask of reconciling his position with the empirical evidence becomes difficult\nindeed.\n\nMy position, in brief, is that whatever profits maximization may be con-\nstrued to mean, it does not prove helpful in understanding pricing policies of\nlarge corporations. The concepts of target return and target market share do\nseem useful both to an understanding of pricing policies and for predicting the\nprice behavior of these types of enterprises. Thus, the issue at hand is essen-\ntially whether by stating that target return is really another name for profits\nmaximization Kahn has explained anything about the pricing policies of large\ncorporations.\n\n\"Two points need to be clarified before proceeding further. First, some man-\n\nbehavior, the most likely pattern of *'competition' would indicate less activity, less virility.\"\nAlso, *General Foods was in a position to maintain its share of the market, both national\nand western, if it chose to do so. This conclusion holds true with or without price discrim-\nination though, of course, price discrimination would make things easier and more\nprofitable\" [11, pp. 693 and 696].\n", "682\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "3": ["These are illustrative of the practices of A & P vis \u00e0 vis potential competi-\ntors.5 Whether the cited examples of operations at a loss constitute a deliber-\nate policy to that effect can only be determined from an examination of A &\nP's entire course of action. But, even granting (a) there is evidence that some\nof A & P's losses were forced upon the company, and (b) the difficulty of at-\ntributing the demise of competitors or the maintenance or increase in A & P's\nmarket share to a single causal factor (indeed, this is diff\u00fccult even in the\n\"obvious\" cases of the old predatory monopolies such as the Standard Oil\ntrust), the numerous instances of A & P officials threatening or attempting to\ndrive specific rivals out of business, provide a reasonable basis for the con-\nclusion that A & P employed predatory tactics. In the instances cited, A & P\nofficials were consciously reducing prices below levels they thought desirable\nOr had set as a norm\u2014otherwise, why the necessity of requesting permission\nfrom headquarters to sell below cost (however defined) for specific periods of\ntime? It seems to me that in these instances \u00c0 & P had a deliberate price\npolicy; it was not simply \"meeting competition.\"\n\nFinally, there is Adelman's statement: *In theory, because of easy entry\nand numerous competitors, reasonable profit-seeking men would not consider\nan impossible policy of *preventing competition, except in the popular sense\nthat continuous low prices are an 'unfair' preventive.\" Evidently A & P offi-\ncials' concept of business behavior does not coincide with Adelman's explana-\ntion of rational action. Moreover, what may seem like **easy entry and numer-\nous competitors\" from the Olympian heights of an economist fails to appear\nin this context at the level where a few months is the long run, and stores do\nfail. Economists call this pure competition, but the *running-in-the-red\" policy\nof A & P was of great concern to the position of individual firms immediately,\nand not-so-immediately involved. This is not to deny that A & P's policy might\nbe characterized, broadly, as one of attempting to achieve large volume\nthrough low prices; but this is irrelevant for my conclusion \"It seems also\nthat in some cases the companies are not simply meeting competition\u2014they\nare preventing it\" [9, p. 935 ].5\n\nwhich headquarters investments could have earned even though not integrated with retail-\ning, non-intezrated competitors were being subjected to unfair competitive pressures unre-\nlated either to the relative inefficiency of their retailing or to the superior efficiency of\nintegrated operations\" [3, p. 213].\n\n\"Similar practices, including permission to units to sell with abnormally low or non-\nexistent gross-profit rates and use of A & P employees to buy up \"specials\" of competitors,\nwere followed in other cities in the New England division; in Birmingham and Dallas of\nthe southern division; in Buffalo, Columbus, Youngstown, Oberlin, Monongahela, and\nAltoona of the central division; in Scranton, Washington, Endicott, Kingston, and Strouds-\nburg of the Atlantic division; and Murphysboro in the middle western division.

These\ncosts are, of course, intimately bound up with the nature of the transportation\nproduct (and especially its tridimensional aspect which is at least a com-\nplex compound of weight, distance and velocity) [2]\u2014the volume offered,\nthe regularity with which it is offered, the relative significance of the traffic,\nthe phase of returns under which the transport firm is operating and whether\nor not one is concerned with short- or long-run marginal or variable costs.\nUntil we obtain some agreement or more careful analysis of these problems\nwe shall undoubtedly be plagued with the kind of inconsistencies manifest\nin the Weeks Report.\n", "133\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["average total cost and the marginal cost which are to guide the Commission\nin determining just and reasonable rates, depend upon the volume of traffic\nanticipated from the proposed rate change.\n\nTo require the Commission to use cost criteria independently of considera-\ntion of the amount of traffic to be gained or lost through rate changes is to\nask the impossible. Clearly if by \"full cost\" the Report has in mind the\nmarginal cost plus some pro rata share of fixed expenses, the Commission\nmust make estimates of volume changes. But even with marginal cost, the\nvolume is a significant determinant. In the first place, when considering\nmarginal cost, the unit to be considered marginal is a function of the volume\nof the particular traffic offered, with the costs assignable rising as the volume\nrises because of the extra equipment and other expenses involved. That is,\nif 100 pounds per day of a certain commodity is offered, it can probably be\nplaced in a partly filled box car in a train already made up and the additional\ncost incurred might be quite minor. If a carload of such a commodity is\noffered, an additional box car will have to be added to the train which entails\ngreater additional cost (though not in proportion to the tonnage increment) ;\nand, finally, if the volume offered is very great perhaps a special train will\nhave to be made up and thus additional costs are involved. The costs per\n100 pounds will decline with these volume increases but more cost items\nbecome specifically assignable to the marginal units as we move from less-\nthan-carload to carload and trainload lots.\n\nFurthermore, the behavior of out-of-pocket cost for any traffic depends\npartly on the relative importance of such traffic to the total. Eastman has\npointed out that *out-of-pocket expense tends to increase disproportionately\nas this fraction [ie ratio of the particular traffic involved to total traffic]\nincreases in size\" [1, pp. 127-28].\n\nThere is also a time dimension which must be considered in discussions of\nthe nature of marginal costs. If a particular kind of traffic represents a once-\nfor-all movement, the directly assignable costs may be greater than if the\ntraffic is offered with regularity over time. In the latter case it will be possible\nto develop specialized and more efficient handling of the traffic, especially\nif it is important to the carrier, thereby permitting certain economies in its\ntransportation. A good example of this is the permission granted by the\nI.C.C. on a few occasions for a lower rate per 100 pounds for shipment in\nmulticarload or trainload lots. Such permission has not generally been granted\nbecause it tends to favor large shippers. There is little doubt, however, that\ncosts per 100 pounds on per ton-mile may be reduced significantly for multi-\nple-car shipments. Indeed, the Report recognizes this when it recommends\n*volume rates . . . based on cost differences\" [8, p. 14].\n\nSince costs are in large part a function of volume, the I.C.C. cannot avoid\nconsidering *the effect of the [proposed] rates on the movement of traffic.\"\nThe significance of this inconsistency can scarcely be over-emphasized. It\nunderscores the extreme complexity of cost finding (both theoretical and\npractical) in transportation. Economists such as A. C. Pigou, Donald Wallace\nand J. M. Clark have done excellent work in analyzing joint and fixed costs\nin transportation but they have neglected, or left unresolved, many of the\n", "132\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "2": ["useful information on the degree of competitiveness of transportation we\nrequire elaborate information on the needs and technical alternatives of the\nvarious users of transport facilities and the available supply in particular\nareas. Until we know much more about these things we not only are unjusti-\nfied in asserting that transportation in general is highly competitive but we\ncannot know how things would work out should regulation be reduced or\neliminated. General statements concerning the changed nature of the transport\nmarket do not permit us to assume iso facto that the outcome of greater or\ncomplete reliance upon competition will be similar to that postulated by com-\npetitive models.\n\nQuite aside from the problems of assessing the pervasiveness and strength\nof competitive elements and assuming that more competition would in fact be\ndesirable, we immediately come upon a basic inconsistency hitherto over-\nlooked in the Weeks Report. The Report argues in favor of excess capacity in\nthe common carrier segments of transportation in the interests of national\ndefense [8, p. 5]. Now it is clear that if this excess capacity is held out of\ncommercial competition no problem emerges. But this is not the tenor of the\nargument. Thus the aim of the Report is to have excess capacity available\nin the event of war, a profitable common carrier industry, and at the same\ntime vigorous rate competition. These would not necessarily be inconsistent\nobjectives if no rates were permitted to fall below average total cost, but the\nReport is clear that rates may fall as low as marginal cost (short-run or\nlong-run?). Thus, in the interest of national defense we need excess supply\nand a strong common carrier industry but we cannot have both under vigorous\nprice competition since, of course, the function of price competition is to\neliminate excess supply [7]. Furthermore, since the dominant medium, rail-\nways, is subject to increasing returns, especially when excess capacity exists,\nrates based on marginal cost will necessarily be below average total cost. If\ncompetition is as pervasive as the Weeks Report implies, this can only result\nin substantial financial losses to the railways; scarcely a sensible way to\nmaintain a strong, profitable, privately owned common carrier industry!\n\nA second inconsistency is the policy recommendation [8, p. 11] that the\nInterstate Commerce Commission be permitted to prescribe just and reason-\nable maximum and minimum rates. A just and reasonable minimum is\ndefined as a rate at least equal to or above \"the direct ascertainable cost\"\nand a just and reasonable maximum which the Commission can specify must\nexceed or equal \"the full cost of performing the services to which such rates\napply.\" In other words, the rate minimum would be marginal cost and the\nrate maximum would be equal to or above average total cost. Coupled with\nthe retention of such powers by the Commission, however, is the recommenda-\ntion to repeal *one of the most objectionable features of rate regulation,\nnamely, the necessity that the Commission substitute its own judgment for\nthat of carrier management as to 'the effect of the [proposed] rates on the\nmovement of traffic by the carrier or carriers for which the rates are pre-\nscribed'\" [8, p. 11]. Regardless of one's judgment of the merits of these\nrecommendations the point is that they are inconsistent. That is, both the\n", "131\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "1": ["The Weeks Report Revisited\n\nIn his review of the Weeks Report [8] J. C. Nelson points out that the\n\"Committee has not tackled some fundamental questions concerning regula-\ntion and its effects\" [4, p. 917]. I would like to go further and suggest that\nthe Presidential Advisory Committee (or Weeks) Report shows a striking\nlack of general economic intelligence which involves it in at least two basic\ninconsistencies. If the issues to be raised here were outdated there would of\ncourse be no reason to subject the Weeks Report to further scrutiny at this\ntime. However, the basic inconsistencies continue to permeate discussions of\nnational transportation policy to such an extent that it is important to bring\nthem out into the open.\n\nAs is well known, increased reliance on competitive forces in transportation\nis the major general recommendation of the Weeks Report and one which\nhas received fairly widespread support. It is unquestionably true that the\nmonopoly position of the railways is much weaker than before 1920 but to\nargue that the entire transportation industry operates under the checks and\nbalances of vigorous and pervasive competition is going a bit too far. Those\nwho talk in these terms are moving in the direction of identification of the\ntransport market as a whole with perfect or, at least, monopolistic competi-\ntion. For example, the Weeks Report argues that the *net result [of the\n*transport revolution] is a competitive system of transportation that for all\npractical purposes has eliminated the monopoly element which characterized\nthis segment of our economy some thirty years ago\" [8, p. 1]. Though not\ngoing quite so far, many economists have emphasized the strength and\nubiquity of competitive elements in transportation [4, p. 918] [5, pp. 26-28].\n\nBut economists have also frequently pointed out the complexities of the\ntransport market [3, p. 83] [6, p. 245], complexities which are largely\ninconsistent with competitive models. Transportation service is supplied by\nhighly diverse enterprises operating under widely different technical, economic\nand market conditions. The unit of output is much more complex than an\nalleged homogeneous ton-mile. It involves considerations of speed, flexibility,\nsafety, and dependability, all of which differ substantially among the various\nmedia. Thus in the transport market we have naturally heterogeneous products\nemanating from the different competitiors and vast differences among the\ncompetitors themselves with respect to production costs (the level, structure\nand shape of the cost functions) and physical facilities. Depending upon the\nparticular needs or preferences of various shippers, these differences engender\nvastly different elasticities of demand for the services of a particular medium\nin the various segments of the market, and hence varying degrees of monopoly\npower even on those route segments where a variety of transport forms of all\ntypes are available. But in fact both the availability of forms of transport\nand numbers of firms differ substantially throughout the country.\n\nThese complexities on both the supply and demand side of the various\nmarket segments render transportation a hodgepodge running the gamut\nfrom conditions of nearly perfect competition to near monopoly.
