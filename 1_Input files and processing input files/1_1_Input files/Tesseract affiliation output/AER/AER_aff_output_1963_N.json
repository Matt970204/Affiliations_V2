Introduction: Scope and Method\n\nThis paper is an exploratory and tentative study of the specific\ndifferentia of medical care as the object of normative economics. It\nis contended here, on the basis of comparison of obvious characteris-\ntics of the medical-care industry with the norms of welfare economics,\nthat the special economic problems of medical care can be explained\nas adaptations to the existence of uncertainty in the incidence of dis-\nease and in the efficacy of treatment.\n\nIt should be noted that the subject is the medical-care industry, not\nhealth. 'The causal factors in health are many, and the provision of\nmedical care is only one.

We did not, however, intend to\ngive rules for the e\u00edf\u00fccient direction of production, as Montias seems to\nimply.\n\n1. The main theme of our article may be summarized in the short propo-\nsition that to every system of incentives there should correspond a definite\nprice structure for the means of production and for final goods. In some\ncases these price systems may seem to contradict common sense (wonder-\nland prices). Such is the case, for example, with a price structure corre-\nsponding to an incentive system based on gross output.\n\nDoes this mean that we recommend such a system of prices? Not in the\nleast. We were concerned simply to show that there exists a close connection\nbetween prices and incentives and not elaborate the details of the wonder-\nland system of prices corresponding to gross-output bonuses. This task, on\nthe contrary, consumes three quarters of Montias' comments. The reforms\nnow under discussion in Poland tend to eliminate the gross-output bonuses\nrather than to improve them by appropriate price changes.\n\n2. Incentives, prices, and methods of accounting (cost calculation) to-\ngether form an organic whole which we propose to call a formula for ad-\nministration of socialist production. This formula is composed, then, not of\ntwo, but of three, elements. The behavior of the enterprise depends not only\non the structure of prices and incentives, but also on the rules of accounting,\nLe. on the regulations governing the cost calculation, receipts, and profits.\nThis behavior depends, moreover, on all kinds of constraints imposed upon\nthe enterprise within the framework of the existing formulae. These include,\namong others, regulations, mentioned by Montias in his comments, concern-\ning the size of the labor force which can be employed by the enterprise\n(wages fund), the rationing of some of the material means of production,\nand the cost limits.\n\nIt is evident that this behavior of the enterprise, in the process of plan\nfulfillment, depends not only on the adopted price system (the parametric\npart of the formula), but to an equal extent on the nature of these regula-\ntions.\n\n3.

Thus the value of ma-\nterials consumed will not be *minimized,\" as the authors claim. The simple\nreason for the enterprise's choice is that the labor-cost constraint is such that\n100 units of y can be produced by the first process and only 3374 by the\nsecond (the total value added in one case will be 100 - 0.4 or 40 and in the\nother 3315 - .7 or 2314). Any assortment plan calling for the production of\nx will be violated. By doubling the price of A the price-setting authority\ncould induce a shift to the second process for making y, as may easily be\nverified.

At\nthis point only the labor-intensive product will be produced\u2014in outright\ncontradiction with our authors! prediction.\n\nThe introduction of concave constraints, due to the effects of diminishing\nreturns, would not alter this conclusion substantially. The tendency would\nstill be for managers to skirt the capacity constraint by concentrating on the\nproduction of the labor-intensive item; however, in this case, the bias in\nfavor of producing x would stop short of full specialization, at a point where\nthe relative marginal costs of producing the two products, in terms of ca-\npacity inputs, equalled the slope of the bonus lines, i.e., the ratio of output\nprices.\n\nNext, let us consider the claim made by the authors that under an output-\nbonus scheme the response of enterprises to changes in input prices will be\ndiametrically opposed to the one normally expected in a profit-maximizing\nsituation: a rise in the price of an input will cause it to be substituted for\nother inputs; a drop in price will check its consumption. Their reasoning\nruns as follows: Suppose output x is a-intensive and y is b-intensive (a\nand 5 being distinct inputs); let the price of a be raised relative to 5; then\nthe average cost of x must go up relative to y. This will shift the bonus line\nin favor of x and stimulate its output; the demand for a must rise fari passu.\nFrom this they infer that \"input prices, as a rule, are to be equalized\"\n(p. 112) so that they may be neutral with respect to the fulfillment of the\nenterprise's assortment plan and to the choice of inputs.\n\nThis ingenious conclusion, however, holds only in the absence of cost\nbudgets. For if the enterprise is subject to such a constraint, the rise in the\nprice of a will cause a contraction of the constraint line in the direction of\nthe origin along the abscissa. The cost-budget constraint and the bonus lines\nwill remain approximately parallel for any change in the relative prices of\ninputs (always on the assumption that the bonuses are geared to the gross\nvalue of output and that outputs are weighted by average-cost prices). If\nanything, the relative increase in price of a material will cause the cost-budget\nline to contract more than the bonus line, as material costs make up only a\npart of the total unit costs for each product that determine the slope of the\nbonus line, so that the net impact of the change will probably be to reduce\nthe demand for the material whose price has increased. If Wakar and Zielifi-\nSki chose to ignore these limits on enterprise expenditures in their specula-\ntions, then they left themselves open to the charge that their model does\nserious violence to reality: however important output bonuses may have\nbeen at any point in the development of Polish economic institutions\u2014as in\nthe early 1950's for instance\u2014their incentive effects were always restrained\nto some extent by cost limits.\n\nFinally, a word about the adjustment of the enterprise to the incentives\ncreated by a value-added bonus fund. Wakar and Zieli\u00fcski argue that this\nscheme will cause enterprises to *tminimize *transferred' value (i.e., value of\nconstant capital) and other items which are subtracted from gross output\nbecause this, ex definitione, will help to maximize their value added\" (p. 123).\n", "1091\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "6": ["DrAGRAM 2\n\non the implicit prices of the two factors, which, in this case, are nothing\nbut their marginal value products.

It is only by chance that the highest attainable\nbonus line constructed according to the Wakar-Zielihski principle would\nhit a vertex or a facet of the feasible area at a point of contact with the\ncorrect assortment ray.\n\nOn the other hand, if the binding constraints happened to coincide with\nthe material costs budget and the wage fund, as we first assumed, then the\nauthors! pricing instructions would at least be relevant, since the slope of\nthe bonus line would be directly related to the slopes of the constraints. If\nthe bonus weights were \"cost-plus\" prices, their ratio\u2014i.e., the slope of\nthe bonus lines\u2014would have to fall somewhere between the slopes of the\nRT and SV lines. On the other hand, value-added weights would swing the\nslope of the bonus lines closer to the slope of the RT line, whose coefficients\nare based on labor costs per unit of output. The point is therefore valid that\nif the desired mix were in the proportion shown by ray I, a value-added\nbonus would be more likely to induce compliance than a value-of-output\nbonus. It would be clearly wrong, though, if mix /// were in order.\n\nSuppose now that one or more of the constraints can be relaxed. How\nwill this affect the product-mix and the choice of inputs? Evidently, whether\nthe labor supply, the availability of materials, or cost budgets impose bind-\ning restraints on output at the optimal point,\" the enterprise, under a\nbonus scheme based on the gross value of output, will benefit by ordering\nmore of any of these inputs until their physical marginal productivity\nis reduced to zero, that is, until the expansion of output is blocked by a\ncapacity constraint that cannot be loosened by the more liberal applica-\ntion of any of the variable inputs. Is it necessarily true, as Wakar and\nZielihski argue, that the enterprise seeking to maximize its value-of-output\nbonus will concentrate on the making of material-intensive goods if output\nprices are equal to average unit costs plus a profit margin proportional to\ncosts (p. 122)? As can be seen in Diagram 2, we can be sure this tendency\nwill manifest itself only if the material-intensive product is not more capital-\nintensive than the other product.\n\nDiagram 2 is identical with Diagram 1, except that product y is now\nmore material-bintensive than product x and a capacity constraint LM has\nbeen added that places an eventual limit on the expansion of output, even\nif labor and materials could be obtained in any desired quantities.\n\nAt first, until the capacity ceiling has been reached, the managers may\nwish to concentrate on y and bid for more materials rather than for more\nlabor. If the bonus scheme hinges on the value of output and if relative\nprices are based on the cost-plus principle, then the bonus lines should fall\nbetween RT and SV, as in the preceding problem. Whether the labor or the\nmaterial constraint *pinches\" more at an optimal point such as B will depend\n", "1089\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "4": ["The rays from the origin identify three different assortment plans that\nmay be prescribed by the administrative authority. There are two constraint\nlines: line SV is a material constraint, drawn in such a way that the ma-\nterial intensity for making both products is the same; line TR, which stands\nfor the labor constraint, shows a higher labor intensity for product x than\nfor product y. If these lines were reinterpreted as cost-budget lines (SV\nas material costs and T'R as labor costs or value-added), then the diagram\nmight correspond to the Wakar-Zieli\u00fcski example (p. 111), which shows\ntwo products that have equal transferred values (mainly material costs),\nbut one of which has twice as large a margin of value-added as the other.\n\nIt is immediately obvious that producing at point B is most advantageous\nto the bonus-maximizing manager, since at B, the enterprise produces the\nmaximum value of output compatible with the inputs at its disposal. (Point\nB is the point of the feasible area OSBT touching the highest bonus line.)\nAs long as output prices (determining the slope of the bonus line) remain\nanywhere between the slopes of SV and RT, there will be no incentive to\nviolate product-mix 77. Note that the administrative authority, insofar as\nit determines both the assortment plan and the inputs the enterprise will\nobtain to fulfill it, will tend to set a plan in the neighborhood of B, at\nleast if it has correct information on the enterprise's production possibilities,\nfor such a plan would make the fullest use of the inputs allotted. If it\nwished the enterprise to produce some other mix, such as mix / or 7/1,\nthe authority would presumably adjust the structure of its allotments to\nfacilitate the fulfillment of this alternative plan.\n\n'The price-setting rule for outputs in this case is very simple: once the\nbinding constraints have been found (RT for mix 7, RT and SV for mix\nII, and SV for mix 711), relative output prices should be set as follows: (1)\nif a single constraint is binding, then relative prices should equal the ratio\nof input coefficients at the maximum output corresponding to this mix; (2)\nif two or more constraints are involved (as was the case at point B), prices\nshould equal some suitable average of the relative input coefficients at the\nmaximal point.\n\nHow does this solution compare to Wakar and Zieli\u00fcski's? They suggest\nthat the ratio of output prices should be set somewhere between the ratio\nof the total average costs of the two products and their relative margins of\nvalue-added. The rationale for this pricing policy is that average cost-pric-\ning unduly encourages the production of material-intensive items, while\nvalue-added pricing stimulates the production of labor-intensive items.\nHence the optimal scheme must lie somewhere in between. (They admit\nthey do not know exactly where.)\n\nMy first objection is that Wakar and Zielinski, in effect, identify the\nphysical and value constraints to which the enterprise is subject, whereas\nthis is appropriate only if relative input prices are correct indicators of the\nrelative scarcity \u00a3o the enterprise of the various inputs. Suppose, for ex-\nample, that the lines T'R and SV represented capacity constraints (e.g.,\nforging and casting capacity in a metal-processing plant), and these were\nthe only bottlenecks impeding production\u2014the cost-budget line and the\n", "1088\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "3": ["product x and 5 for product y, the slope of line will be \u2014a/b.

If bonuses are\ngeared to the gross value of output produced at fixed prices, then the lines\nwill be straight and their slope will be equal to the ratio of the price-\nweights. If bonuses depend on total value-added rather than on gross out-\nput, the bonus lines will be affected in at least two respects: (1) their\nslope will come closer to paralleling the wage-fund or labor-costs restraint\nthan in the preceding case (assuming that relative unit costs for wages and\nsalaries diverge from relative total unit costs); (2) insofar as labor costs\nper unit increase when the product-mix is biased toward one or the other\nof the products, the bonus lines may be concave to the origin. In Diagram 1\nthe bonus lines, for the sake of simplification, have been drawn straight\n(as dotted lines).

My criticism\nof their paper turns not on ideological issues but on the precision of their\nanalysis. I shall try to show in this note that the questions they raise could\nhave been dealt with more exactly and more cogently if they had made use of\nsharper analytical methods.\n\nThe essential problem analyzed by Wakar and Zieli\u00fcski is to find an\noptimal combination of managerial incentives and producers! prices \"which\nserves plan fulf\u00fcllment and precludes price or incentive stimuli not in\nharmony with planned tasks\" (p. 126). In their quest for a solution, they\nstudy alternative bonus schemes and speculate on the effects of various\nprice policies on: (1) the ful\u00fcllment of the enterprise's *assortment plan\"\n(prescribed product-mix) and (2) on the choice of its inputs and the mini-\nmization of its production costs.\n\nTheir analysis is focused principally on the level and structure of enter-\nprises! production costs and on the relation of these costs to output prices.\nMy principal objection to their article is that, at crucial points in their\nstudy, they fail to specify, to distinguish, or, for the most part, to analyze\nthe effects of the physical and monetary limitations acting as restraints on\nbonus-maximizing managers. Inasmuch as these restraints condition man-\nagers' responses to bonus schemes and price systems, they cannot be left out\nof any model aspiring to be realistic.\n\nFrom the context of their article, it is clear that the authors set their\nproblem in the usual framework of Soviet-type economies. The socialized\nenterprise has at its disposal a limited supply of fixed assets, receives cur-\nrent inputs, such as materials and components, in limited quantities (ra-\ntioned out by an administrative organ), and must confine its expenditures\non wages to a fixed wage fund; it is also usually expected to stay within a\nplanned cost budget. However, the enterprise's input coefficients may be\nreduced by technical progress or by improved management, or the managers\nmay bargain with higher authorities for larger allotments of certain inputs,\nso that the constraints within which the enterprise must operate are not en-\ntirely rigid.\n\nWith the aid of a simple diagram, we may analyze the impact of alter-\nnative bonus schemes and price systems in the simplified case of an enter-\nprise producing two products. (The algebraic extension of these results for\nmore than two products presents no special difficulty.) To start with, it is\nassumed that the constraints imposed by the limits on available inputs are\nfixed. Since the pricing problem is viewed from the vantage point of the\nadministrative authority whose information about the production processes\nopen to the enterprise is limited, the constraints may be represented by\nstraight lines, the slopes of which are the ratios of approved input coefficients,\nor *norms.\"* If, for example, the coal norm per unit of output is a for\n\n?See particularly pp. 114-15.

Indeed, it is precisely the consideration that public announcement may\ninvalidate an otherwise correct prediction that has long caused serious doubts\nabout the possibility of correct public prediction of social events (cf. Morgen-\nstern [6]) and prompted our earlier essay on this subject [3]. We do, how-\never, have serious objections to his algebraic illustration purporting to show\nthat \"accurate [public] forecasting may be impossible.\" It seems in fact to\nprovide a counterexample to our earlier proof, that, in general, correct public\nprediction is 20\u00a3 impossible, at least in so far as correct private prediction is\npossible. Fortunately Kemp's illustration does not constitute a valid counter-\nexample because the model which he uses violates one of the sufficient con-\nditions we stated, namely that the variable to be predicted, in the present\ninstance national income, y, should have a lower and upper bound.\n\n'That his model violates this condition can be verified from his equation\n(1). This equation, as stated, implies that, at a given point of time, na-\ntional income can be made as large as we please, positive or negative, by the\nrather simple device of the Central Bank announcing an appropriately large\npositive or negative number and labeling this its forecast of national income.\nWe presume that this is not the hypothesis that Kemp intended to formalize\nand that he instead conceived of his equations as providing a reasonable\napproximation in some reasonable neighborhood. Unfortunately Kemp's proof\nof the impossibility of correct forecasting does not rely at all on neighbor-\nhood properties. Actually he came close to noticing this point when he real-\nized that his system might yield a negative solution for y. He understandably\nrebelled against this absurd\" result, and the rebellion is expressed in equa-\ntion (9).

Secondly, if the quantity (y;*\u2014 y&3) is opposite in sign to Ayra,\nthen R, will actually exceed \u00e0w, and consequently produce a greater degree\nof self-reinforcement. This is what will occur when the official forecast calls\nfor a reversal of the direction of income change.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\nWithin the framework of our analysis, the claim that official forecasts\nare always self-reinforcing will prove completely valid only on the assump-\ntion of static private predictions. When private predictions are nonstatic,\nself-nullification may result, although there is ample room even in this case\nfor the self-reinforcement effect to manifest itself. A public forecast of re-\nversal, for instance, will still be always self-reinforcing in that case; and a\nforecast of continuation of current change will prove self-reinforcing pro-\nvided the magnitude of the forecasted change is a sufficiently bold one.\nThese latter possibilities of self-reinforcement serve to suggest that it would\nbe feasible, even in the (less favorable) case of nonstatic private predic-\ntions, to use official forecasts as a tool of control to influence the level of\nincome. All that would be necessary is the proper adjustment of the direc-\ntion and the magnitude of the forecast.\n\nBut what about the question that reliance on con\u00edrived forecasts may\nimpair the public faith in them? This of course may very well happen; most\ntools can be expected to be blunted through use, and forecasts are no excep-\ntion. In our model, the *blunting\" will be reflected in the deterioration of\nthe acceptance weight. But it is obvious that official forecasts will not com-\npletely forfeit their power to influence income unless the parameter s is re-\nduced all the way to zero, which, in turn, will be unlikely unless contrived\nforecasts are employed so indiscriminately as to be beyond all reason.\n\nStill, the above has dealt only with the question of feasibility, and feasi-\nbility is by no means a synonym for desirability. One may indeed wish to\nrule out artificial forecasts altogether on moral or other grounds. To con-\nsider such factors, however, would take us beyond the scope of this paper.\n\nArPHA C.

His interpretation of the term \"'self-validating\" is based on the cri-\nterion of numerical accuracy; to qualify for this epithet, a forecast must\nresult in a smaller absolute forecasting error when it is announced than\nwhen it is kept secret. Suppose an official forecast is that income will rise to\n$500 billion. Further suppose that, with the forecast kept secret, income\nwill actually be $490 billion, but with the forecast made public, income will\nreach $520 billion instead. In this example Kemp would conclude that the\nforecast is *'self-destructive,\" because the error when the forecast is made\npublic (\u2014520\u2014 500) exceeds the error when the forecast is kept secret\n(\u2014 500\u2014490).\n\nHowever, this term can also be interpreted alternatively in a directional\nsense. An official forecast may be considered \"'self-validating\" as long as\nits publication causes the variable in question to move in the direction of\nthe forecasted change, regardless of the magnitude of forecasting errors.\nIn the example above, since the forecast of an increase does cause the\nvariable to assume a larger value than it would in the absence of the fore-\ncast, we may indeed consider the forecast as having validated itself. To\navoid confusion, let us refer to this latter sense of validation as \"'self-rein-\nforcement.\"\n\nShort of taking a poll, it would be difficult to say which interpretation\nis the more widely held. It appears, however, that a stronger case can be\nmade for the directional than for the numerical interpretation, because\nwhen forecasts influence economic behavior they may serve as an instru-\nment of control, and in such instances, as Kemp recognized [4, p. 496], the\nnumerical accuracy of forecasts loses its relevance, and the reinforcement\neffect takes on the major significance. But at any rate, as long as the possi-\nbility exists that those who claim the never-failing self-validation of official\nforecasts may actually have the directional interpretation in mind, Kemp\ncould have missed the whole point, or at best have only dealt with part of\nthe question. This paper seeks to fill the gap by examining the reinforce-\nment aspect of that claim.\n\nI.

In short, we suggest that before we can reach a sensible conclusion\non this complex issue we need to learn to construct a macroeconomic model\nwhose behavior equations are more directly tied to optimizing behavior of\nthe individual units and embodying less preposterous assumptions about\nthe nature of anticipations.! Furthermore, perfect foresight may have to\nbe defined as perfect knowledge of the future time path of the relevant vari-\nables and not merely as knowledge of their standing at an arbitrarily chosen,\nnearby point of time.\n\nPerhaps, if and when we succeed in carrying out the task outlined above,\nit will turn out that at least perfect foresight\u2014and hence fully believed\ncorrect prediction\u2014cannot increase economic instability, although at pres-\nent this is no more than sheer speculation.\n\nEwILE GRUNBERG AND FRANCO MoprzGLIANI*\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

Their\nconclusion is that: \"Widespread criticisms of tight money as unfairly dis-\ncriminating against small borrowers, both in availability of loans and interest\ncosts, are not supported by the data\" (p. 79). The purpose of this note is to\nsuggest an alternative interpretation of the data presented by Bach and\nHuizenga, an interpretation equally consistent with their data and one very\nsuggestive to those who have wrestled with the knotty problem of \"credit\nrationing\" in the admittedly less-than-perfectly competitive money markets.\n\nI. The Bach-Huizenga Study\n\nData presented by Bach and Huizenga (p. 65) show a highly consistent\nrelationship between size of borrower and percentage increase in bank loans\nbetween October, 1955, and October, 1957, a period generally agreed to be\none of monetary restraint. Uncritically examined, these raw data would seem\nto imply discriminatory treatment. But, the authors point out, the data\nequally support the conclusion that loan demand increased during this period\nmuch more for large borrowers than for small borrowers. They cite, with\napparent approval, a Federal Reserve study [2] which concludes that: *The\ndemand for bank credit rose much less rapidly at small businesses between\n1955 and 1957 than at large businesses, and . . . this was the main apparent\nreason for the differential growth in lending\" [1, p. 64].' The principal ob-\njective of the Bach-Huizenga study may be said to be to test this hypothesis\nthat the differential growth in bank lending over this period was a conse-\nquence of changes on the demand side rather than of discrimination on the\nsupply side.\n\n\"The words quoted are those of Bach and Huizenga, and not the Federal Reserve's.\n", "REFERENCES\n\n- E.

FREEDMAN*\n", "III Summary\n\nWhat then can we say in summary about the effect of the economic varia-\nbles on fertility in an urban population of fecund planners?\n\n1. There is evidence that husband's income does make a difference over the\nlonger childbearing period if it is considered in relation to the average income\nfor the husband's occupational status and age. An income which is above the\naverage for one's status is associated with more children, but being in a higher\nabsolute income class means fewer children if the higher income is only what is\nusual for the husband's age and occupational status.\n\n2. 1f the wife has an extensive work history, it will be associated with having\nfewer children but this relationship is more important in the earlier than the\nlater stages of childbearing. It affects child-spacing more than total family size.\n\n3. While economic variables considered together explain only a small part\nof the total variation in family size, this must be evaluated in the light of the\nsmall proportion of the variance explained even when a larger important set\nof social and demographic variables is considered.\n\nTA-nnnarr C TuazneelrrloX*\n", "mogeneous result is attained. This suggests that differential child-spacing may\nreplace differential fertility as a central interest in fertility research.\n", "422\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "8": ["decade of married life will be considerably below average if they have worked\nfive or more years during this period.\"\n\n'The total variance in fertility explained by the economic variables for the\ngroup married 5-9 years is 18 per cent\u2014compared to 4 per cent found for the\n10-plus group. The greater proportion of variance explained for the 5-9 group\nis attributable to the strong effect of years wife has worked in this intermediate\nmarriage-duration group.\n\nIn the first step of the regression analysis we dealt only with economic varia-\nbles. In a second step we added to the economic variables eight other social\nand demographic variables usually related to fertility. The eight variables\nadded were: years married, wife's attitude toward family limitation, wife's age,\nwife's education, husband's occupational status score, wife's religion, husband's\neducation, and couple's farm background. While these variables are interesting\nin themselves, we resist the temptation to discuss them apart from their effect\non the economic variables. The main question we want to answer is whether\nadjusting for the effect of these eight variables changes the previously ob-\nserved relationship of the economic variables to fertility. The answer is no.\n\nIf we take the three economic variables which show the greatest relation to\nfertility\u2014husband's income, relative income, and years wife has worked since\nmarriage\u2014we find that the relevant beta coefficients change very little and the\ndeviations in fertility between the subclasses are only slightly altered when we\nadjust for the eight demographic variables. For an illustration, see Table 6\n(Appendix) where we compare the adjusted deviations obtained in the first and\nsecond steps for these three economic variables. The economic variables which\nwere found to be most important in the first step are still relatively important\nin the larger matrix of variables. (See Table 5, Appendix.) In the 10-years-and-\nover married group the summary betas for years wife worked and husband's\nrelative income rank equally with wife's religion as most important, with hus-\nband's income following next. In the 5-9-year group the number of years wife\nhas worked is clearly first among the 14 variables considered.\n\nFinally, the additional variance explained by adding to the economic varia-\nbles eight presumably important social and demographic variables is not as\ngreat as might have been expected. (See Table 1, Appendix.) The R? rises\nfrom .18 to .24 for the group married 5-9 years, and from .04 to .10 for th\u00bb\ngroup married longer. Considering the large group of variables, the substantial\ndifference in the total variation explained between these two marriage-duration\ngroups is an important fact in itself. It is consistent with a hypothesis that\nfamily size tends to converge towards a commonly held norm over the child-\nbearing period with the important differentials being now not in the final size\nof family but in the process of planning and spacing by which a relatively ho-\n\n\"We have some independent corroboration of this explanation in an analysis of mean\nbirth intervals for this same sample by Mr. K. Namboodiri. For wives married 10 years\nor more, he finds a much stronger relationship between their work history and the inter-\nval between births than we have found for fertility. Wives with many years of work\nhave their children later and tend to catch up, although, on the average, they never actually\nmake it.\n", "421\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "7": ["For the group married 5-9 years, the findings are quite different. The betas\nin Table 2 (Appendix) and the unadjusted and adjusted deviations in Table 3\n(Appendix) show that: (1) The work variables of the wife are consistently\nrelated to fertility for this intermediate marriage-duration group, with number\nof years wife has worked since marriage (beta \u2014 .33) having a much stronger\nrelationship to fertility than any of the other economic variables. Wife's in-\ncome (beta \u2014 .12) and wife's labor force status (beta \u2014 .10) are also asso-\nciated with fertility, though the relationship is much weaker. (2) Neither of\nthe husband's income measures has a significant or consistent relation to fer-\ntility. The largest variation from the grand mean in any of the subclasses of\nhusband's actual or relative income is .11 live births.\n\nThe unadjusted deviations in Table 3 (Appendix) show a consistently nega-\ntive effect on fertility of additional years of work by the wife. There is a di\u00edf-\nference of 1.37 children between the group working five or more years since\nmarriage and those not working at all. But the main part of this effect is ac-\ncounted for by the group of wives who have worked five or more years. They\nhave 1.10 children less than the average. When we adjust for the effect of the\nfive other economic variables, the period of work since marriage still has a\nconsiderable effect on fertility; the difference in fertility between wives who\nhave not worked since marriage and those working five or more years is 1.10\nchildren with the subclass working five or more years still accounting for most\nof this difference. It is interesting that those wives who have worked less than\none year have higher fertility than wives who have not worked at all since mar-\nriage. This is because the wives working less than one year include women who\nstarted to work after marriage and quit because they became pregnant.\n\nWife's income initially shows a fairly strong relationship to fertility; there\nis a difference of 1.20 children between the wives with no income and those with\nan income of $2,000 or more. However, when we adjust for the effect of the\nfive other economic variables, the difference in fertility between these two in-\ncome categories is reduced to .32 children. It is not surprising that the num-\nber of years worked has more independent effect than wife's income since the\nformer measure is relevant to the whole of married life while income was\nmeasured only for the year preceding the interview.\n\nThough the years the wife has worked have the same negative relationship to\nfertility for the group married 5-9 years as they did for those married 10 years or\nmore, the relationship is much stronger and of more paramount importance for\nthe younger group. (The beta coefficient for years wife has worked is .33 for\nthis group as against .19 for the older group.) The difference in fertility be-\ntween the two extreme categories of wife's work history is 1.37 children for the\n5-9 group and only .47 children for the group married 10 years or more. A\nplausible explanation is that the variables measuring wife's work affect the\ntiming of children more than they affect the number finally attained. In a so-\nciety where the average couple has only three children, wives who work for\nfive years or more can still come close to the average number of children over\nthe entire childbearing span. However, their fertility at the end of the first\n", "420\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "6": ["come group has .19 more children than average while the highest income group\nhas .33 less children than average. We interpret this to mean that lower income,\nin and of itself, leads not to small families, but to larger than average families.\nThe low fertility of the lowest income families in the unadjusted series must be\ndue to the weighting of this group with persons earning less than they should,\nsince once we control for relative income, the adjusted deviations show a nega-\ntive correlation of income and fertility. Likewise, higher income\u2014if appro-\npriate to the occupational niche\u2014does not lead to larger families; instead it is\nassociated with smaller families. Only if there is extra money above and be-\nyond these normal status demands will fertility be increased.\n\nThe years the wife has worked since marriage (beta \u2014 .19) are also associ-\nated with fertility for the group married 10 years and over but to a lesser de-\ngree than the measures of husband's income. The relationship is negative\u2014a\nlong work history is associated with fewer children. There is a difference in\nfertility of .47 children (.36 for adjusted deviations) between the group work-\ning 5 years or more and that with no work history. Wife's income is also nega-\ntively associated with fertility (beta \u2014 .13). The group with incomes over\n$2,000 has .61 children less than the average (adjusted deviations show .51 less\nchildren), while the group with no income has slightly higher than average\nfertility. Wife's labor force status and current work experience show no con-\nsistent relation to fertility.\n\nThe total variance explained by the six economic variables for the group\nmarried 10 years or more is 4 per cent. (See Table 1, Appendix.) Even though\na number of these economic variables are consistently related to fertility, the\nassociation is not strong enough to explain much of the total variation. While\nthe amount of variance may seem small, these results should be evaluated not\nonly against the small correlations found generally in cross-section data but\nalso in terms of the very complex series of events and influences which deter-\nmine the number of children born to a family after 10 or more years of mar-\nriage. No single limited set of measures will capture more than a small part of\nthis total reality.\n\n5 For this particular problem there are some considerations which lend more significance\nto the observed relationship. (1) The study from which our data are drawn shows that\nthere is a marked consensus among U.S. families on a very limited range in both desired\nand expected family size. Eighty-five per cent of the fecund planners gave 2-4 children as\ntheir personal ideal size of family, and 79 per cent expected their final family size to be\nin this range. Moreover, if the norm is that 2, 3, or 4 children are almost equally accepta-\nble, an accurate scaling of perceived social differences in family size would yield an even\nsmaller variance. Since there is such a marked consensus on a limited range of desired\nfamily size, there is less variance in family size to be explained and much less likelihood\nthat any small group of factors will be able to account for it. In addition, the fact that\nfamily size is a discrete variable makes it unlikely that we can predict it exactly. (2) By\nexcluding fecundity and fertility planning as variables, we have eliminated two of the\nprimary deterrainants of variability in family size. With a comparable multivariate analysis\nfor all nonfarm couples, including the subfecund and poor planners, we can explain a\nconsiderably higher proportion of the variation than we can for our fecund planners. The\ncoefficient of variability is considerably higher for the total nonfarm group than for our\nnonfarm fecund planners in both marital-duration groups, reflecting the greater variability\nin family size in the total group.\n", "419\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "5": ["IL Te Findings\n\nWe begin with the group married 10 or more years, since here fertility is\nclose to its final level. After 10 years of marriage, husband's relative income\n(beta \u2014 .24) is more strongly associated with fertility than any of the other\neconomic variables. (See Tables 2 and 4, Appendix.) The relationship is posi-\ntive, as expected, and it persists and is even strengthened when the effect of\nother economic variables is taken into account. The group with very low rela-\ntive incomes has .45 children less than the average, while the groups with high\nand very high relative incomes have respectively .18 and .06 children more than\nthe average. We interpret this to mean that lower incomes lead to lower fer-\ntility if the diminution in income is beyond what is usual for the husband's\nstatus. Adjusting for the effect of the other economic variables, and particu-\nlarly adjusting for actual income,* only strengthens this relationship; the low-\nest relative income group has .50 children less than the average while the high-\nest has .28 children above the average.\n\nThe husband's actual income is also significantly related to fertility (beta \u2014\n.21), but the relationship is negative rather than positive after allowance is\nmade for the other variables. In the unadjusted series there is substantially no\nrelationship except that the lowest income group has less than average fertility.\nHowever, when we control for relative income, the adjusted deviations show a\nclear negative relationship between actual income and fertility. The lowest in-\n\n*Tn this analysis we are controlling for all the five economic variables, but in a previous\n\nanalysis, where we restricted the variables to husband's relative and actual income, we\nderived almost identical results.\n", "The meaning of the adjusted deviations may be clearer if they are regarded\nas coefficients in a regression equation in which each category of each predict-\ning variable is a separate independent predictor taking on the value of one if\npresent and zero if absent. For any individual case we predict the number of\nbirths by adding the coefficients for the subcategories which characterize the\nindividual.\n\n2. A beta coefficient computed as a summary measure of the effect of each\nindependent variable on the dependent variable. The relative size of the beta\ncoefficients is used to indicate the rankings of the partial R?'s for the various\nindependent variables.\n\n3. A measure of the total variation explained by all the independent variables.\nThis measure is the conventional R? adjusted for the loss of degrees of freedom\nin using each of the many subclasses as independent variables.\n\nThis multivariate analysis was carried out for two groups of nonfarm fecund\nplanners\u2014those married 5-9 years, and those married 10 or more years. For\neach marriage-duration group we relate our six economic variables to live births\n(step 1). We also ran an additional multivariate analysis with an augmented\ngroup of independent variables. In this step (step 2) we add eight demographic\nvariables to our six economic variables in order to see whether the relationship\nfor the economic variables is much affected by demographic variables usually\ncorrelated with fertility.\n", "418\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "4": ["ratio of his actual income to what it might be expected to be on the basis of\nhis occupation, education, and age. The husband's annual income was ob-\ntained in response to a question asked of his wife in January, 1956 about his\nincome from all sources during the preceding year. The husband's relative\nincome was calculated as the ratio between his actual income in 1955 and\nthe income expected for him on the basis of a regression on 1955 income of\nhis occupation,* education, age, and residence in the South or elsewhere. Thus,\nthe relative income score measures roughly whether the husband's recent in-\ncome is above or below that of the group with which he probably is compared\nby himself and others.\n\nThe wife's work variables include: the number of years she has worked\nsince marriage, her income during the preceding year, her current labor force\nstatus, and her expectations about future work.\n\nWe have used a method of multivariate analysis in which each of the sub-\nclasses of the independent variable is a predictor related to the dependent\nvariable. To do this, each subclass of a predicting variable is converted\ninto a *dummy\" variable, taking the value of either zero or one, depending\non whether or not the case falls in that particular subclass. The advantage\nof this technique is that no assumption is made about either the linearity or\nthe ordering of the subcategories of the independent variables. Also, it is\npossible to see how the dependent variable is affected by each subclass of the\nindependent variable.\n\nIn this type of analysis the following three statistical measures are derived:\n\n1. The mean value of the dependent variable for each subclass of each\nIndependent variable expressed as a deviation from the grand mean. Also, an\nadjusted deviation is obtained for each subclass of the independent variable\u2014\nadjusted for the effects of all other independent variables being considered.\n\nThus we can see what the actual variation of the dependent variable is in\nthe different subclasses of the independent variable and the extent to which\nthese unadjusted deviations were biased as a result of intercorrelations with\nthe other explanatory factors being considered. For example, Table 3 (Ap-\npendix) shows how much the mean number of live births in each category of\nwife's income deviates from the grand mean of all families sampled. Wives\nwith incomes of $2,000 or more had, on the average, 1.06 fewer children than\nthe sample as a whole. But this difference is partly due to the correlation of\nwife's income with the other five economic variables listed. After adjusting for\nthe influence of these other factors, this income class is found to have a net\ndeviation of only .30 live births below the grand mean.\n\n*'To scale occupations for this regression, we used a socioeconomic status index which\nassigns to each occupation a prestige score. This socioeconomic status index was developed\nby Otis Dudley Duncan and reported in [12, pp. 109-38]. This index assigns to detailed\noccupations a score that is based on the well-known NORC prestige score. Since the\nNORC prestige score is available for only a limited number of occupations, Duncan\nassigned scores to other occupations on the basis of the regression on NORC prestige\nscores of education and income for occupational classes.

Furthermore, while a consumer can choose\nto own both a cheap and an expensive car, this choice is not equally possible\nin determining the costs of his children. In fact, if the expenditures for a\nchild do not conform to the socioeconomic standards of his family, he may\nbe a source of disutility. Therefore, a couple whose income is low relative to\nthe group with which it is identified may restrict its family growth so the de-\nsired standard can be furnished to a smaller number of children.\n\nIt is also questionable whether the relationship between family income and\nfertility is in fact a simple positive relationship, with higher income enabling\na family to support and thus enjoy more children. The costs of rearing\nchildren are not all monetary; their care involves attention and time on the\npart of the parents. Moreover, higher social status may involve the parents\nin interests and activities which are incompatible with a large family. Since\nthere is consensus among most U.S. families on a rather narrow range of\ndesired family size, it suggests that there is a certain minimum number of\nchildren considered essential (irrespective of size of income), but that addi-\ntional children do not necessarily continue to add equal utility; after four\nchildren, an additional child may be a source of disutility.\n\nIn the present paper we have analyzed how fertility varies in relation to\nthe husband's actual and relative income and also in relation to the wife's\nincome and labor participation.\n\nI. The Data and Methods of Analysis\n\nAll our data are from interviews with a national probability sample of\nwhite married women in the childbearing years (18-39) interviewed in 1955\n[3]. We have restricted our analysis mainly to nonfarm couples who are\n\"fecund planners\" and have been married at least five years. By considering\nonly nonfarm couples, we get a more homogeneous group and one that is\nincreasingly more typical of the U.S. population. The *fecund planners\" are\nthose couples who have no known fecundity impairments, who have used or\nintend to use some method of family limitation, and who have never had a\npregnancy they did not want. These couples have a potential need for family\nplanning since they are fecund; they are practicing or are favorably disposed\ntoward family planning; and they have planned effectively enough to date\nso all their pregnancies were wanted. By so restricting our sample we have\nlimited it to those who are most able to choose the number of children they\nwant. If economic considerations are important, they should be most evident\nin such a sample.\n\nWe deal with two groups of economic variables\u2014one related to the hus-\nband's economic position and the other to the wife's participation in the labor\nforce. The husband's economic position is measured both by his income in\nthe year preceding the interview and by his relative income\u2014that is, the\n", "416\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "2": ["widespread dissemination of contraceptive methods made effective family\nplanning feasible for most couples. While economists have recognized that\nvariations in family size and population growth are important factors affect-\ning various economic phenomena, they have given scant attention to the role\nof economic factors as determinants of family size. This paper explores the\nrelationship of several economic variables to fertility? with a unique set of\ndata for the national population.?\n\nHistorically, there has been an inverse rather than a positive relationship\nbetween economic status and fertility in the West during the period of urbaniza-\ntion and industrialization [14]. Large families were more prevalent among\nthe poor and uneducated. Recently these differentials have narrowed or even\nbeen reversed in some places. This change was predicted by a number of\nauthors for two reasons: (1) as our population has become more universally\neducated and urbanized, knowledge of contraception is no longer limited to\nthe higher socioeconomic group so that an effective choice of desired number\nof children is possible for all strata; and (2) as our economy has lost its rural\ncharacter, children have lost their economic utility. Instead, the long period\nof education required by a modern economy makes them liabilities rather\nthan assets from a strictly economic point of view. Under these circumstances,\nchildren are analogous to other consumption goods in that their value resides\nin the direct satisfactions they provide. Some have theorized that as con-\ntraceptive use became widespread, the traditional relationship would be re-\nversed so that there would be a positive relationship between income and\nfertility. Those couples having higher incomes would be able to afford more\nchildren as they consume more of other durable goods.\n\nThe problem is generally considered as involving simply the relationship\nbetween family income and fertility\u2014more income means greater ability to\nsupport children.But this ignores some vital distinctions. First, it is desirable\nto consider separately the income earned by the husband and that earned\nby the wife. The wife's participation in the labor force may increase the\nfamily's income and thus its ability to support more children, but it is also\nlikely to reduce her available time to bear and rear additional children.\n\nIt is also important to consider not only the husband's actual income but\nhow his income compares with the average attained by men of his age, oc-\ncupation, and educational status. Is he earning what is expected for a man\nin the socioeconomic group to which he is compared by himself and others?\nWe shall use the term \"relative income\" to refer to the ratio between a man's\nactual income and the income customary in his socioeconomic reference\ngroup.\n\nWhy should relative income affect fertility independently of actual income?\nThe reason is that the costs of rearing children are related to the socio-\neconomic reference group of the parents. Given the social status of a family,\nit has only limited control over the costs of its children [1].

For example, see [5, pp. 114-20] and [13, pp. 194-96].\n\nMany studies in Western Europe have reported positive rather than negative correla-\ntions between status measures and fertility for particular periods and places, or for special\nparts of the status distribution [2] [7, pp. 1-25] [11, pp. 115-27] [6, pp. 107-13] [8, pp.\n36-71].\n\nIn the United States before the war, most studies showed a negative relation between\nfertility and status measures, but some found that the highest status group had higher\nfertility than the next lower group. In the postwar period, the increases in fertility have\nbeen positively correlated with status measures so that most differentials have been greatly\nreduced, but it is still too early to tell what the final effect will be on completed fertility.\nThe American materials on differential fertility are reviewed in [4] and [9, pp. 77-112].\n\nIn the Indianapolis Fertility Study a small positive correlation was found between\nfertility and various status measures for fecund couples who effectively planned fertility\n[10, pp. 188-244].\n", "REFERENCES\n\n1.

The present writer,\nworking with data based on the B.L.S. Survey of 1950, found that the Na-\ntional Service Life Insurance dividend payments of that year were largely\nspent by their recipients [2]. The regression coefficient estimates of the mar-\nginal propensity to consume this receipt were .97 or .72, depending upon\nwhether durable goods expenditure was included in or excluded from the\nconcept of consumption. Mordechai E. Kreinin, using the Israeli Survey of\nFamily Savings of 1957-58, observed a weak tendency to spend restitution\npayments (from West Germany) on the part of the recipients [3]. Kreinin\nestimated that the relevant marginal propensity to consume was .17 if dura-\nbles were included in consumption and .16 if they were excluded. Thus the\nconclusions of these two studies, which seemingly focus on the same type of\nincome receipt, appear diametrically opposed.\n\nSeveral surface explanations come to mind, and these will be discussed be-\nlow. In this note, however, I shall argue that the principal explanation of the\ndiffering results is to be found in certain institutional features surrounding the\nrestitution payments received by Israeli residents.

This assumes that the redun-\ndant workers have no other place to go and that cultivable land is fixed in\nthe long run. And it contradicts the usual picture of sharp struggles between\nlandlord and tenant in Asian countries. See, e.g., [3]. On farm wage sys-\ntems, see [8]. I think a stronger case can be made for assuming wages to be\nbelow MPP.*\n\n4. Productivity changes and institutional wage. Farm technological change\nis shown in the model by drawing new total productivity curves denoting an\nupward shift. The flat portion of the curves representing zero MPP labor\nforce is reproduced in the new curves since the shift is assumed to be pro-\nportional.\n\nThis type of technological change is unlikely to be general under the con-\nditions of Asian paddy agriculture. Even in the case of the introduction of\nimproved seeds (which seems to fit the Ranis-Fei case best), this is likely to\ncall for more fertilizing and more weeding, both requiring additional labor. In\nthis situation, the flat portion of the new curves may be wiped out. Where\nproductivity rises because of the construction of irrigation facilities, new land\ncan be put into cultivation and double-cropping on the old land becomes\nfeasible, both requiring more labor. And in the Japanese type of rice-growing\ntechnique which is succeeding in many parts of Asia, labor requirements per\nacre increased due to careful breeding of seedlings, transplantation, fertilizing,\nweeding, etc. In all these cases, the flat portion of the new productivity\ncurves will disappear and there is not likely to be proportional upward shifts\nin other parts of the new curve.5\n\nThe part of the model (and most crucial to it) which is most difficult to\naccept from an empirical standpoint is the assumption that, with the rise in\nfarm productivity, farm wages in the first two phases remain unchanged. A\ngeneral rise in Asian farm productivity will be immediately reflected in a\nrise of real income for the peasant-proprietor and his family, since the tax\nstructure is such that only a small part of the increases is likely to be taxed\naway. The absolute share of tenants will increase because in Asia the total\ncrop of landlord farms is often divided on the basis of percentage shares. I\nsuspect that investigations into farm wages will show that, with productivity\nincreases, wages do rise in Asian agriculture.\n\nIn conclusion, if the Ranis-Fei model is to be made more generally appli-\n\nbetween 1950-1956, agricultural output grew at an annual average rate of 6 per cent but\nthis required a growth in farm labor input of about 2 per cent[2, Appendix Table]. Japan's\nexperience in the Meiji period appears to have been similar to that of Taiwan [9].\n\n*]If we drop the assumption regarding disguised unemployment, the flat portion of the\ntotal and marginal productivity curve in the model will be replaced by a gently rising\nslope. The first phase loses its distinctive character and becomes merged with the second\nas far as the industrial supply curve of labor is concerned.\n\n5 However, it must be admitted that we know very little about the nature of the shifts\nin productivity curves in Asia and more studies are indicated,\n", "451\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["have here a dualistic economy. Thus the Ranis-Fei model shows that, even\nafter the commercialization point is reached, there must be continual in-\ncreases in agricultural productivity in the absence of foreign trade if the farm\npopulation is to continue to fall.\n\n3. Disguised unemployment and institutional wages. Ranis and Fei feel\nthat in certain countries\u2014Pakistan, India, and Ceylon\u2014marginal farm work-\ners producing little or no output may be as large as 30 per cent of the farm\nlabor force. They refer to my denial of the existence of substantial (say\n5 per cent or more) zero-marginal product workers [8]. They observe that\n*with a fixed amount of land, there will be soe size of population which is\nlarge enough to render MPP zero\" [10, p. 547]. I would agree, but in such\ncases the excess population will move to the cities and in the short run will\nbe openly unemployed, as is the case in most parts of Asia today. In due\ntime, these unemployed workers will be absorbed into small industries and\nshops or will return to their villages. In the long run, the amount of land is\nby no means fixed, as the statistics of farm acreage for Asian countries\nshow. Extra-marginal land is brought into cultivation, e.g., hillsides, forests,\nand jungles. Traditionally in peasant societies the younger sons who cannot\nbe provided with family land must go out to the cities and towns or rent out\nmarginal land and eke out a living.? Though their returns are low, they are\nsubstantially above zero. Since disguised unemployment plays such an im-\nportant role in many of the theories of underdevelopment, we need some\nempirical investigations into this matter.?\n\n* Rice acreage harvested in the major Asian countries (excluding Red China) rose from\nan annual average of 52.3 million hectares in the years 1934-38 to 65.9 million for the\nperiod 1955-59, a growth rate of about 1 per cent per year, which is roughly the growth\nrate of the farm population in this period. See FAO [1].\n\n*B. Johnston and J. W. Mellor [4, p. 568]: \"The most common of these institutional\narrangements is the family farm in which the unit of production is also the unit of\nconsumption.\"\n\n*'There is one empirical study, that of J. W. Mellor and R. D. Stevens [7], of 104\nfarms in one Thai village. In this pioneer study, the conclusion is reached that there is\nsubstantial zero MPP farm workers. I feel it is hazardous to regard this study as con-\nclusive for either theoretical or policy use. The spread of the data in the scatter diagram\nrelating rice yields to labor input for each of the 104 farms suggests to me, not a linear\nregression line as it does to the authors, but inadequate data and/or dubious assumptions.\nFor example, they assume that rice production functions for each of the 104 farms were\nthe same. (Dr. Gordon R. Sitton [11] found much variability in what appeared to be\nhomogeneous situations in a Thai village.) In estimating labor input, the authors exclude\nworking children under 15 years old and include all persons 15 years and above, whether\nworking or not. The concept relevant to disguised unemployment should include all labor\nactually put into cultivation. The labor of an owner-cultivator should not be equated with\nthat of a hired worker, that of a male worker with that of a female worker, nor that of an\nadult worker with that of a young worker. One of the authors, J. Mellor, in a recent study\nof an Indian village did not find evidence to support the thesis of disguised unemployment\n[6]. In fact, the data suggested \"that yields can be raised by greater use of labour . . . ,\"\na conclusion similar to that of G. R. Sitton for Thailand [11].\n\nAccording to Edwin F. Jones [5 pp. 4-5], the basis for the shift to commune agriculture\nin Mainland China was the belief by Mao Tse-tung that there was much disguised un-\nemployment in rural China. When it became clear that the commune movement was a\nfailure, large masses of people were shifted back to agriculture in 1962. In Taiwan,\n", "450\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "2": ["sector is no longer dominated by nonmarket institutional forces but assumes\nthe characteristics of a commercialized capitalistic system\" [10, p. 543].\n\nWith agricultural productivity increasing, the model shows that the diffi-\ncult second phase can be shortened or skipped. This is because the rise in the\nmarginal physical productivity (MPP) of migrating workers enables their\noutput (1) to catch up with their wages more quickly than otherwise, and\n(2) to generate more agricultural surplus per migrating worker (that part of\nhis consumption which he is not producing), lessening the deterioration of\nthe terms of trade. (These results are obtained because wages are assumed to\nbe unchanged although farm productivity is rising.) If the rise in productivity\nis sufficient, the entire second phase can be eliminated, enabling the econ-\nomy to move smoothly into self-sustained growth.\n\nIn this note, I would like to raise some serious issues about the validity and\nempirical relevance of the Ranis-Fei model, especially with respect to prob-\nlems of foreign trade, disguised unemployment and its correlate, institutional\nwage. At the end, the conclusions of Ranis and Fei are examined in the light\nof our discussion.\n\n1. The worsening of the terms of trade characterizing the second phase. 'The\nworsening occurs in the model mainly because the authors have excluded for-\neign trade. In an open economy, industrial goods can be and are in fact ex-\nchanged for the agricultural goods produced in a foreign country, multilater-\nally, if not directly. In Asia, the Indo-Chinese countries have exported food\nto the major cities of the deficit countries to the south\u2014 Philippines, Malaya,\nIndonesia, Ceylon. If the Ranis-Fei model is to be of general applicability,\nit is imperative that the authors bring foreign trade into their model and work\nout its implications. Otherwise the theory will remain a very special one. It\nseems highly artificial to assume a closed system in a theory which makes\nthe worsening of the terms of trade a cornerstone. For example, in Asia, if\nimport of agricultural products is assumed, the terms of trade need not\nchange. In Japan before the war, the import of cheap farm products from\nTaiwan and Korea improved the terms of trade for the industrial sector.\n\n2. The commercialization point which begins the third phase. 'To the au-\nthors, this is a major landmark in the development process.\" Enough work-\ners have left the farms, leaving a labor shortage in the countryside. Land-\nlords must now pay wages commensurate with MPP and must compete with\nindustrial employers. It appears to me that in this closed model this point\nwill be the beginning of hyper-inflation. For now, to the extent of the MPP\nof the workers leaving the farm, there will be a shortage of agricultural prod-\nucts, and this shortage will increase rapidly as the migration continues, even\nif some decline in the income elasticity of agricultural-product demand is\ntaken into account.\n\nLet us assume an open economy. A large part of the industrial product in\nthe main cities will be exported to foreign countries and exchanged for farm\nproducts, as in prewar Japan. In this case, a large peasant economy, pre-\ndominantly subsistence, can coexist with a highly industrialized sector, with\nMPP \u2014 W in the economy as a whole.

In their two-sector model, the migration of\nworkers from agriculture to industry is the central process around which the\ntheory is constructed, taking into account certain basic problems, e.g.,\nworsening terms of internal trade, disguised unemployment, institutional\nwages, commercialization point, balanced growth, and technological changes.\nI feel that these problems should be discussed further, if only to clarify the\nissues for empirical research.\n\nRanis and Fei divide the development of surplus-labor countries into three\nstages, assuming as a first approximation no changes in agricultural produc-\ntivity and population. In the first phase farm workers who are not adding to\nfarm output are shifted to the industrial sector with no rise in the existing\nwage levels of the economy since there is no reduction in farm output. In the\nsecond phase, however, farm workers producing something, but less than their\nwages, are shifted to the industrial sector. Farm output declines and the\nterms of trade between the two sectors are altered in favor of the farm sector,\nrequiring a rise in the nominal wage of the industrial sector. If migration con-\ntinues, a point is eventually reached where farm workers producing output\nequal to their wages (the commercialization point) are shifting to industry.\nThis begins the third stage, marking the end of the take-off and the begin-\nning of self-sustained growth, and **we enter a world in which the agricultural\n", "MonpECHAI E.

A number of major reappraisals have already been undertaken.\nThe unprofitability of slavery in the antebellum South,* the indispensable role\nof the railroads in nineteenth-century American development, and the im-\nportance of the Civil War in accelerating U.S. industrialization,? are three\nillustrations of this critical scrutiny, and they are just the beginning of the\nreassessment of our economic past.\n\nIf we are learning what U.S. economic history is not, it is a more difficult\ntask to reach positive conclusions. A reconstruction requires far more compre-\nhensive knowledge of our past than we currently possess. This knowledge,\nwhenever possible, must be made available in the form of the quantities that\nhave constituted the external manifestation of economic change in the United\nStates. If the new Historical Statistics gives evidence of our relative richness\nwith respect to quantitative data, it is still true that we are far from well en-\ndowed with the quantitative information necessary to outline the contours\nand patterns of American economic change from the past. We have only\nscratched the surface. Even a cursory examination of the wealth of material\navailable in the form of early price data, official documents of many kinds,\nlocal historical materials, and state statistics, indicates that possibilities for a\nmuch firmer reconstruction of the quantitative estimates of our past are avail-\nable to us. While any single time series may be subject to a wide range of error,\nthe gradual accretion of independent series lends greater confidence in our\nability to arrive at careful judgments about the characteristics of our economic\ndevelopment in previous years.\n\nA more difficult problem faces us in the development of the theoretical hy-\npotheses necessary for shaping the direction of quantitative research. A decade\nor more of concentrated research on economic growth has yielded meager re-\nsults for the quantitative economic historian. The tools of the economist pro-\nvide initial hypotheses to explore a wide range of questions posed by the\neconomic historian, but for those concerned with the great question of the\neconomic rise and fall of nations the fare is still thin. Perhaps the major result\nSo far has been to disabuse the economic historian of any simple ready-made\nexplanation of U.S. economic growth, and to encourage more intensive in-\nvestigation of the varying sources of changing productivity in the economy. In\nthis area the tentative exploratory hypotheses of economists offer useful start-\n\n- A. H. Conrad and John R. Meyer, \"The Economics of Slavery in the Ante-Bellum\nSouth,\" Jour. Pol.

A number of the most important series\nadded to the new volume stems from the 1957 Conference on Income and\nWealth held jointly with the Economic History Association. Some of the\npapers at this conference were devoted primarily to a criticism of existing\nstatistics.

No doubt interest is, in some degree, a monetary\nphenomenon. (If it is not, central bank policy is an awful hoax.) Unfortu-\nnately, young economists who first make the acquaintance of capital and interest\nthrough their work in monetary theory often seem to believe that interest is\nmainly a monetary phenomenon. They are, of course, badly informed.\n\nSince B\u00f3hm-Bawerk's day the well-informed economist has known that in-\nterest is rooted mainly in the productivity of investment and the economy's\npreference for present over future consumption. The effective exposition of\nthis truth, however, has never been easy, and for the last thirty years pedagogi-\ncal progress has been distressingly slow. Monetary theorists now have a large\nbag of elegant tricks that demonstrate how changes in the money supply and\nliquidity preference can affect the interest rate. Advocates of the so-called\n\"real\" theory of interest must fall back on a set of teaching aids with a dis-\ntinctly musty odor\u2014Robinson Crusoe and his fish-catching activities, growing\ntrees, aging wine, the more roundabout method of production, etc. Therefore,\nthere may be merit in describing a pedagogical device that allows the essential\nproperties of capital and interest to be simply, albeit rigorously, conveyed.\n\nTwo of the more effective tools available are Irving Fisher's indifference\ncurves [2, pp. 387-90] and Frank Knight's Crusonia plant\u2014a species of\nvegetation that supplies all human wants and, though unattended, grows at\na constant (geometric) rate \"except as new tissue is cut away for consump-\ntion\" [3, p. 30]. In essence, the pedagogical device described here applies,\nwith modifications, Fisher's geometry to Knight's Crusonia plant.'\n\n*'The Crusonia plant has the great virtue of eliminating three complications in capital\ntheory that are fundamentally unimportant but are, nonetheless, time-consuming in the\nclassroom and a source of confusion to the young. It enables us to ignore the \"period\nof production\"\u2014the gestation period of capital assets. (For the view that the period of\nproduction is an important idea, see Robert Dorfman's rigorous restatement of B\u00f3hm-\nBawerk's theory [1].)
