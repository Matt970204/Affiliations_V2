            "found": "In recent years a number of persons have suggested that shifts in\nthe composition of demand play a role in the inflationary process. More\nspecifically, the usual hypothesis is that, other things equal, the over-all\nprice level is likely to rise more rapidly, the greater the extent of shifts\nin the composition of demand. This hypothesis is based on two separate\npropositions concerning price and wage behavior, one having to do\nwith the shape of supply schedules and the other pertaining to collec-\ntive bargaining and wage behavior. In brief, the supply-schedule prop-\nosition is that there is a ratchet effect, that prices of all kinds are more\nflexible upwards than downwards; the wage-determination proposition\nis that \"large\" increases in wages are likely to occur in rapidly ex-\npanding sectors and that these increases will be transmitted, at least in\npart, to other sectors.!\n\n* The authors are, respectively, associate professor of economics and assistant in re-\nsearch at Princeton University. They are indebted to W. J. Baumol and E. J. Kane\nfor useful comments on an early draft of this paper and to Mrs. Virginia Gebhardt for\nher computational assistance. They also wish to thank the participants in the Princeton\nSeminar on Research in Progress, and especially A. Corazzini and R. Gold, for a number\nof very helpful suggestions.\n\n\"To elaborate just a bit, for the benefit of readers who have not followed the litera-\nture dealing with this topic, the shape-of-the-supply-schedule aspect of the argument\nasserts that in imperfectly competitive markets decreases in demand are unlikely to result\nin price reductions, whereas increases in demand may well entail increases in marginal\ncosts and thus price increases. In short, the typical supply schedule is alleged to be\nhorizontal over the range of output below the current output level and to slope upward\nas capacity output is approached. The greater the extent of shifts in the composition of\ndemand, the greater the upward thrust to the over-all price level imparted by this\nrachet-type mechanism. The wage-determination aspect of the argument postulates the\nfollowing sequence of events: (1) rapid shifts in the composition of demand produce\nincreases in profits in the expanding sectors, which in turn increase union wage demands,\nlower employer resistance (by raising the cost of strikes), and thus lead to relatively\nlarge wage increases in this sector; (2) because of the importance of wage comparisons\nto unions and companies, these \"large\" increases in wages will be transmitted (at least\nin part) to other sectors, with the result that cost schedules in both sectors are shifted\nupward, assuming that the average wage increase exceeds the average increase in output\nper man-hour. Finally, it is often assumed that the monetary-fiscal authorities take\nwhatever expansionary actions are necessary to prevent total output and employment\nfrom declining as a consequence of these upward shifts in cost schedules. While much\ncan be (and has been) said about the plausibility of these various propositions, this\ndiscussion falls outside the scope of our paper.\n"

But the fact is that not all ver-\nsions of the argument have been given the attention they deserve. In\nparticular, it appears that the rise in the rates of long-term and very-\nlong-term unemployment since 1957 cannot be satisfactorily accounted\nfor or explained by the rise in the over-all unemployment rate. If, upon\nanalysis, this turns out to be the case, it may suggest to some the pres-\nence of some kind of underlying structural change. After briefly sum-\nmarizing the main lines of attack on the structural hypothesis that have\nappeared so far, this paper seeks to identify the principal factors behind\nthe increase in long-term unemployment rates, to set forth a theory of\nlong-duration unemployment and, finally, to draw certain conclusions\nrespecting public policy.\n\nI. Criticisms of the Structural Hypothesis\n\nAttempts to explain the higher unemployment rates that have charac-\nterized the economy since the mid-1950's have centered around two\nalternative hypotheses. The Council of Economic Advisers [8] [11, pp.\n40-56] [18, pp. 1751-69], along with other proponents of the inade-\nquate-aggregate-demand hypothesis, maintains that the rise in unem-\nployment rates has been due simply to the failure of the rate of growth\nof final demand for goods and services to keep pace with the rate of\ngrowth in potential supply made possible by continuing increases in\nproductivity and in the stocks of productive resources. In other words,\na \"gap\" has emerged between potential and actual output as the annual\nincrement in the number of job opportunities has been insufficient to\nabsorb the yearly increase in the number of job seekers. Accordingly,\nhigher unemployment rates are taken to mean that the economy has\ndeparted from a position of full employment.\n\nOn the other hand, proponents of the rise-in-structural-unemploy-\nment hypothesis, such as Thomas Curtis [1], Walter Fackler [17, pp.\n\n* The author is associate professor of economics at the University of Minnesota.

Malkiel in the December, 1963\nissue of this Review [2] presents a mathematical model for estimating pres-\nent and future values of growth\" and other common stocks that constitutes\na step forward, despite its serious flaws. The model may have some predic-\ntive value, but it does not provide a reliable basis for evaluating current\nlevels of share prices as claimed by Malkiel. Especially interesting is his\ntreatment of growth as a factor separate from the earnings rate; his use of\n\nn \"apparent marginal efficiency of investment\" concept; and the manner\nin which he utilizes a common-stock index to develop *normalized\" values\nfor the price-earnings multiplier, the earnings growth rate, and the marginal\nefficiency of investment.\n\nComparison of individual multipliers and growth rates against those of a\ncommon-stock average taken as a norm is a well-known method which is\nrelied on, for example, in the latest edition of the widely quoted work,\nSecurity Analysis [1, Chs. 30-31, 37-39].! However, the authors use the\n\n! The authors find from past data that the appropriate basic multiplier for both the Dow-\nJones Industrial Average and Standard and Poor's Composite Index is 15 for current earn-\nings, and 13 for future earnings (average for the next seven years). Thus the DJIA was esti-\nmated at 572 for early 1962, or 13 times estimated average earnings of $44 for 1962-68. This\ncompares with a Central Value estimate of 534. Actual market value of the DJIA in January,\n1962 was 705, far above the \"intrinsic\" value, implying a greatly overvalued market at the\ntime. Curiously enough, Malkiel's critical comments about this book have reference to the\nolder 1951 edition.\n",

Cave have attacked sev-\neral assumptions of my valuation model and have questioned both the ap-\nplications of the model and its principal implication concerning the greater\nvolatility of growth stocks. Before turning to the major points of disagreement\nbetween the authors and myself, it would be useful to emphasize the major\npurpose of my article as well as the questions to which my analysis was not\naddressed. I was not attempting to evaluate, predict, or even suggest the\ndeterminants of the level of stock market prices. Nor did I offer, or ever claim\nto present, a full-uncertainty analysis of share valuation. Moreover, I never\nconsidered the empirical section of the paper to be, in any sense, a test of\nthe model\u2014the particular calculations performed were purely illustrative.\n\nIt is well known that individual securities may differ in risk and that in-\nvestors may alter their estimates of earnings growth rates. My purpose was to\nshow that, apart from these factors, it is possible to define a meaningful\nstructure of share prices at any point in time, and that the level and structure\ncan change in the absence of changes in growth rates and risk premiums. Per-\nhaps the most interesting and important results of this analysis concerned\nthe volatility of growth stocks. Abstracting from all the reasons usually ad-\nduced to explain the greater volatility of growth stocks, such as those sug-\ngested by Friend and Cave, I found an important additional reason to ex-\npect such a pattern. Most growth stocks are \"longer in duration\"! than stand-\nard issues. The greater volatility of growth stocks is perfectly analogous to\n\n1 A holder of standard (dividend-paying) shares gets more of his money back sooner than a\nholder of low- or nondividend-paying growth stocks. Growth stocks are thus longer in **dura-\ntion\" to use Macaulay's [7, pp. 44-53] measure of maturity.\n",

The Model\n\nThe Fei-Ranis article in question here is concerned with the expansion of\na relatively small, commercialized \"industrial sector,\" alongside a large sub-\nsistence-type agricultural sector whose role during development was examined\nin an earlier article by the same authors [18], both discussions being elabo-\nrated from Arthur Lewis' celebrated two-sector model of economic develop-\nment under conditions of \"unlimited supplies of labor\" [9]. The Lewis\nmodel, however, does not hinge on the degree or trend of capital intensity\nwithin the modernizing sector, since it indicates only that, with given capital\nand given production functions, the capitalist sector will at most draw from\nthe subsistence sector just so much labor as will bring the marginal produc-\ntivity of the transferred workers into equality with the low and constant\n",
                    "Capital.Labor Ratios in Theory and in History: Comment\n\nThe prolonged debate over factor proportions during economic development\ntook a new and challenging turn in the article by Professors Fei and Ranis\nin the June, 1963 issue of this Review [6], together with a portion of Pro-\nfessor Ranis' paper at the December, 1962 meetings [16]. These authors pro-\npound a doctrine of *capital-shallowing\" in the early industrialization of re-\ntarded countries and present it with great ingenuity on both the theoretical\nand the empirical levels.\n\nMost other writers find or assume that such development entails increas-\ning capital-intensity in some degree; and they differ chiefly as to the optimal\ndegree and timing. Fei and Ranis, however, deny both the necessity and the\ndesirability of intensifying capital in the early stages of development.

They do not provide a reliable guide for estimating ex ante required\nreturns. It is not true that the investor in the common shares of Litton Indus-\ntries requires a 42.6 per cent return while the investor in Perkin and Elmer\nCorporation requires but a 21.6 per cent return, as is implied by Cave's Table\n1. Finally, as indicated earlier, Cave's neglect of dividend payments leads\nhim seriously astray.\n\nCave does not even follow a consistent earnings approach to valuation.\nFor the Dow-Jones average he calculates 7 over the period 1957-63, but g is\ncalculated over the period 1948-63. Similarly, in dealing with individual is-\nsues, he arbitrarily picks both the time periods and the method of computa-\ntion to suit his convenience in arriving at his valuations.? This makes the\nremarkable degree of convergence between his estimates and actual market\nvalues less surprising than might appear at first glance. Had Cave followed\none consistent valuation method (with consistent time periods) he would\nhave seen that his model fails to produce useful results. Cave therefore pro-\nvides neither a reliable basis for evaluating general market levels nor a useful\nmethod for appraising individual common shares.\n",

                    "B. The Apparent Marginal Efficiency of the Standard Share\n\nCave then offers a \"superior\" alternative method of determining the rele-\nvant discount rate for the representative standard share. He simply calculates\nthe discount rate that makes the discounted current price of a share equal to\nits price during some base period. Why Cave ignores the dividend payments\nthat accrue to the holder (and increase his return) is not explained. More-\nover, Cave's measure is far more sensitive than mine to the base period cho-\nsen for comparison. Starting from 1957 he gets an r of 9.1 per cent. Had he\nstarted from the close of 1958, his r would have been close to 2 per cent. The\nproblem is that Cave includes in his measure the capital appreciation re-\nceived since 1957 which resulted from an increase in the price-earnings mul-\ntiple for standard shares. The last quarter of 1957 represented the bottom of\na sharp decline in market values. During 1958 the market prices (and price-\nearnings multiples) rose sharply. Of course much the same problem besets\nmy measure of standard growth rates. However, the growth rates represent\nonly a portion of the \"7\" of my model, and they are much less sensitive to\nchanges in the base date than are market prices themselves.\n\nFriend also utilizes a similar type of argument to suggest that my estimate\nof the standard growth rate is too low. He cites the University of Chicago\nStudy [1] to suggest that average annual gains of 9 per cent were realized\non a portfolio of shares bought in 1926 and held through 1960. In the first\nplace, the 9 per cent return assumes reinvestment of dividends. If dividends\nare withdrawn, the rate of return falls to 6.9 per cent. While Friend may be\nright that my illustrative growth estimate is too low, it is worth pointing out\nthat this type of evidence can be quite misleading if applied to certain time\nperiods. The Chicago Study's measure of growth rates does not distinguish\nbetween growth that results from increases in the earnings and capital gains\nthat result from a decrease in the capitalization rate applied to those earn-\nings. There is no theoretical or empirical reason for believing that past in-\ncreases in price-earnings multiples can simply be projected into the future.\nIndeed, such a practice is particularly dangerous because it can easily lead\nto a \"vicious circle\": a higher market price serves to justify itself by increas-\ning the past over-all return. It was precisely this kind of reasoning to which\nGraham and Dodd [5, Ch. 30] attributed the *new-era philosophy\" of the\n1920's.\n\nC. Cave's Model\n\nCave finally constructs an alternative model which embodies his criticisms\nand, consequently, rests on sounder theoretical ground.\" His model turns\nout to be an identity: the price of a share equals the earnings per share times\nthe price-earnings multiple. The appropriate earnings multiple is derived in\none of two ways; Cave either uses the characteristic historical multiple for\nthe stock in question, thus committing the *Value-Line fallacy,\" or calcu-\nlates the multiple after finding the over-all returns realized over some period\nin the past, thus opening the Pandora box of problems I mentioned under\n",

This evidence would call into question Cave's\nexplanation for the volatility of IBM which relies on an expected drop in\nearnings. My model showed how such price variability can be explained even\nif earnings prospects are not revised.\n\nA. Dividends, Earnings, and the Valuation of Shares\n\nCave goes on to claim that I err by emphasizing dividends as the funda-\nmental source of valuation. On the contrary, I emphasized repeatedly the\nMiller-Modigliani view which treats dividend policy as a mere detail [8, pp.\n1007, 1015]. Cave's misunderstanding of this point leads him to a serious\nerror in his own model. The dividend-irrelevancy theorem states that, given\nthe investment decision, dividend payments to current shareholders merely\nreduce the value of their claim in the enterprise. This is so because addi-\ntional equity shares in the business (representing an amount equal to the\ndividend payment) must be sold in order to finance the predetermined level\nof capital expenditures. This theorem can readily be demonstrated in the con-\ntext of a dividend model of share valuation. Indeed, Miller and Modigliani\nthemselves evaluate shares in terms of prospective dividends to obtain this\nresult [9, pp. 418-19]. The theorem does not imply, however, that two firms\nwith identical future growth rates of earnings will sell at identical capitali-\nzations of earnings irrespective of their dividend payments. Yet it appears\nthat Cave has failed to realize this.\n\nThe underlying logic of Cave's equation (9), r \u2014 e \u00ab- g, is never made\nexplicit. Nevertheless, it must rest on the assumption that the present worth\nof a share is equal to the discounted sum of the stream of future earnings?\nBut such an assumption cannot serve as a rational basis for valuation, as has\nbeen pointed out by several writers (e.g., [3, pp. 102-3] and [9, p. 420]).\nThe crucial point it neglects is the cost of the additional capital required to\nmaintain the earnings stream at its specified level. The assumed growth of\nearnings may require the steady reinvestment of all or part of the earnings\nstream. If two firms have identical expected earnings streams, but one firm\ncan pay out all of its earnings in dividends, whereas the second must reinvest all\nits earnings to support the earnings stream, a stockholder would always be\nbetter off by buying the dividend-paying shares.\n",

He says, \"This\nimplies, incorrectly, that the market typically grossly miscalculates the values\nof growth stocks.\" Not only is this statement a non sequitur, but Cave can-\nnot go on to insist that market prices reflect warranted values unless he has\nindependent evidence of what these warranted values are. I believe [8, p.\n1027] that actual market values do oscillate about a structure of prices that\ndoes a reasonably good job of equalizing net yields. Nevertheless, I question\nthe plausibility of Cave's view, that at any time \"the market typically estab-\nlishes prices for growth shares that reasonably reflect future prospects.\"* On\nthe contrary, investors characteristically change the prices they are willing to\npay for particular growth prospects. For example, during December, 1961,\nInternational Business Machines! shares sold at 580. Six months later the\nsame shares sold at 300. Currently IBM shares are again selling at approxi-\nmately 580, adjusted for recent stock splits. A check with several influential\nWall Street security analysts convinces me that throughout this period there\n\n? Only for the representative standard share did I use the assumption of a constant price-\nearnings multiple. In this way I avoided having to predict future market levels. This was\nwhy I called the discount rate derived, the apparent marginal efficiency. In this case it is true\nthat both Friend (2] and Gordon and Shapiro (4] had previously developed my equation (3)\n[8, p. 1011].\n\n3 Cave adduces the stock market's \"reliability as a lead indicator of cyclical declines\" as\nproof that the **market's assessment of future prospects is usually close to the mark.\" A\nrecent study by M. Hatanaka [6, Ch. 12] suggests rather that stock-price indices are rela-\ntively poor indicators of actual business activity. A record of 55 per cent success in predicting\nmovements of the economy hardly seems to constitute an impressive record of prediction.\n",
                    "'To illustrate the difficulty which besets such an approach, suppose a com-\npany is expected to enjoy an interval of extraordinary growth after a period\nof stable earnings. By using its average past-earnings multiple as an appro-\npriate standard, an investor would be induced to avoid the stock if, as would\nbe likely and consistent with my model, its multiple rose in anticipation of\nthe company's favorable prospects. Now assume the growth period ends after\nseveral years and the company's earnings become stable again. My model\nsuggests, ceteris paribus, that the price-earnings ratio should revert back to\nits former (nongrowth) level. But investors who utilized a past average-earn-\nings multiple (including the high multiples which anticipated the extraor-\ndinary growth) as a norm, would tend to maintain the higher historical mul-\ntiple and thereby realize inferior returns. This would be the typical history\nof such an approach; underestimating the worth of the issue before and dur-\ning its dynamic growth period and overestimating its worth after the growth\nperiod has terminated. Of course Friend's model is subject to precisely the\nsame criticism. It is not applicable to growth stocks since it implicitly em-\nbodies the *'Value Line\" fallacy by continuing to value growth stocks at ex-\ntraordinarily high price-earnings multiples even after the termination of un-\nusually high growth rates.\"\n",

I argued that such horizons underwent rapid\nchanges and that these changes must be accorded an important role in any\nexplanation of the greater volatility of growth stocks. The point of this dis-\ncussion is not that I claim to have incorporated into the model a generally\nsatisfactory method for coping with uncertainty. At best the finite-horizon\nmethod deals with only a part of the problem. The point is rather that this\nmethod is, I believe, partially descriptive of the actual valuation process\nand, most important, that it generates precisely the same type of results as\nwould changes in the discount rate (7). Thus, Friend's \"alternative\" argu-\nment, which explains part of the greater volatility of growth stocks in terms\nof the volatility of the risk discount, is really analogous to my analysis which\nrelied heavily on changes in the putatively reasonable horizons used by in-\nvestors in valuing growth stocks.\n\nC. The Nature of the Assumptions of the Valuation Equation\n\nBoth Friend and Cave have been critical of my growth-stock-valuation\nequation: Friend impugns its originality, while Cave attacks its fundamental\nlogic. Both criticisms are wide of the mark and reflect a lack of understanding\nof the differences in assumptions between my model and previous ones.\n\nFriend suggests that my basic model is not original and cites writings, in-\ncluding his own, in which a similar model was developed before. I had al-\nways recognized and stated that the model was built on the work of J. B.\nWilliams [10]. Nevertheless, one of the original aspects of my model is that\nthe earnings multiple for a growth stock reverts back to a standard level after\nthe period of extraordinary growth is completed, and I thus avoid \"counting\nthe same trick twice.\"* A fundamental difference between my valuation equa-\ntion and those that preceded it, including Friend's, is my view that it is im-\nproper to assume that the future price-earnings multiple will be the same as\ntoday's.\n\nIndeed, it is my use of the \"standard\" earnings multiple in the valuation\nequation to which Cave most strenuously objects. He claims that the price-\nearnings ratio used for comparison should be the characteristic historical mul-\ntiple for the individual stock in question. Here Cave commits what might be\ncalled, the *Value Line\" fallacy. The popular Value Line investment service\nrelies on the assumption that each stock has its own characteristic earnings\nmultiple against which the current multiple should be compared to detect\ncases of over- and undervaluation.\n\nreturn by the regulating agencies, can often project their earnings for much longer periods, is\nan exception rather than a refutation of my argument.\n\n5 Compare this with the following assumption in Friend's model (2, p. 23]: The one import-\nant assumption is that investors expect that the price earnings multiple ...at the end of\nthe period when they are going to liquidate their investment will be the same as when they\ninvest. This is a very reasonable assumption, certainly a very good first approximation for\nmost companies for most periods of time.\"\n",

                    "As mentioned above, my analysis never claimed to offer a general model\nfor the valuation of shares under uncertainty, although some elements of un-\ncertainty were later added to the analysis. It was because my model addressed\nitself to other questions and because no generally acceptable method for deal-\ning with uncertainty exists that the abstract model was couched in terms of\nperfect certainty. It is one thing to believe that an extension of the model to\ncope with uncertainty would leave particular findings untouched, but quite\na different matter to build a full-uncertainty valuation model.?\n\nWhen I undertook to apply the model, I decided to \"ignore any risk differ-\nences resulting solely from the fact that the expected yield from one security\nmay come largely from capital appreciation, whereas the yield from the sec-\nond is expected to be derived largely from dividend payments.\" My argu-\nment to support that position relied on the dividend-irrelevancy theorem of\nModigliani and Miller [9]. I readily admitted, however, that growth stocks\nmay still be riskier than standard shares [8, p. 1019n.]. The matter will never\nbe settled outside a full-uncertainty valuation model and an attendant em-\npirical investigation.* Inability to deal fully with uncertainty is the most\nimportant lacuna of my model. Nevertheless, as I shall argue presently, my\nuse and alteration of the horizon period can serve as a means for taking ac-\ncount of at least some elements of uncertainty.\n\nIn my analysis I utilized the concept of a limited horizon period over which\nextraordinary growth could be projected. The finite-horizon method for deal-\ning with uncertainty has always figured prominently in the literature of in-\nvestment theory and has attracted a considerable following among practition-\ners. Economists have pointed out that this technique leaves much to be de-\nsired for, among other things, it ignores any prospective receipts after the cut-\noff date and can be shown in some circumstances to lead to rather absurd\nrankings of investment projects. But the growth-stock model employed a fi-\nnite-horizon device which was rather less crude. If investors! horizons are lim-\nited as a practical matter to five years, this does not imply that all receipts\nto the shareholders after the horizon period are ignored. All that is implied\nis that only normal growth is projected after the cut-off period.5\n\n* Tam guilty, however, of using the word \"certain\" carelessly in the passage cited by Friend\n[8, p. 1022]. I meant that an investor would have had to expect\" extraordinary growth rates.\nI had specifically argued that the portion of the analysis in which the quoted passage ap-\npeared did not assume certainty.\n\n* Iam well aware that my example comparing U.S. Steel and IBM is unconvincing. It was\nchosen only because a leading investment advisory service had assigned equal risk ratings to\nthe two companies. Both Friend and I have been guilty of frequently resorting to casual\nempiricism in our references to uncertainty. We will be able to shed light on these more in-\ntractable problems of investment analyses only through the route of painstakingly building up\nthe empirical evidence.\n\n5 Three reasons were adduced for suggesting a five-year horizon for industrial corporations,\npurely as a practical matter. First, the workings of compound arithmetic render highly im-\nplausible the projection of extraordinary growth rates for prolonged periods. Moreover, the\ntypical historical pattern for growth companies has involved only limited periods of extraor-\ndinary growth.

One\ncould list a number of important occurrences in the postwar period which are\nignored by the model and which could be expected to a\u00edfect the standard\nprice level. Perhaps most important, there has undoubtedly been a signifi-\ncant reduction in investors! perceived appraisals of the risks involved in hold-\ning common stocks. The mildness of postwar business fluctuations has gradu-\nally convinced investors that the disastrous losses incurred by holders of com-\nmon stocks in the early 1930's are no longer likely. Consequently, the risk\npremium demanded by investors holding common shares has probably de-\nclined significantly in the postwar period. If such risk premiums tended to be\nvariable in the short run, ceteris paribus changes (in terms of my model) in\nthe standard price level would be more often the rule than the exception.\n\nMany additional factors, not treated by the model, have affected the post-\nwar level of share prices. Important legal and institutional developments, in-\ncluding the growth of pension and mutual funds and relaxation of the limi-\ntations on common-stock investment on the part of life insurance companies,\nhave significantly broadened the market for common shares. At the same time,\nthe ability to avoid taxes on capital gains unrealized until death has prob-\nably contributed to a locking-in of a substantial portion of the existing stock\nof equities.\n\nFinally, a change in the market rate of discount for nonrisk streams will\naffect the standard price level by changing an important component of the\ntotal return. Of course, as Friend has pointed out, the postwar rise in s, oc-\ncurred despite a substantial rise in the riskless yield.

Our differences on this score are then, at most, matters of degree, and\nit is certainly admissible and apposite to inquire into the effects of changes\nin the level of share prices which are not accompanied by changes in g,.

Uncertainty and the Horizon Period\n\nMost of Friend's other comments deal with two (related) matters: the\ntreatment of uncertainty and the horizon period. He questions why the origi-\nnal model was cast in terms of perfect certainty and argues against the ap-\nplication of the standard discount rate to growth stocks without the addition\nof a premium to account for their greater risk. Such a premium, he claims, can\nexplain the relative volatility of growth stocks because \"the risk element in\nmarket evaluations is more volatile than the pure interest rate.\" Finally, he\nobjects to my use of a limited horizon period for projecting extraordinary\ngrowth rates.\n",

Hence he con-\ncludes that my model is inadmissible because it assumes g; to be a constant.\nIn particular, he implies that the theorems stating that the values of growth\nstocks are inherently more volatile than standard issues do not hold because\na change in zz, does not necessarily imply a change in (the apparent margi-\nnal efficiency of the representative standard share), as I assumed [8, p. 1012].\nAlthough he admits that my volatility conclusions may hold in reality, he\nbelieves they hold not for the reasons implied by my model, but rather be-\ncause the public's estimates of g (the anticipated growth rate of growth\nstocks) may themselves be more volatile than are estimates of g;.\n\nFriend's assertion that g, may vary and hence may be a major determinant\nof the level of share prices is quite plausible, as I have stated [8, p. 1027].\nWhile it was not my original purpose to deal with this possibility, I agree it\nwould be worth while to incorporate this assumption into the model. First,\nit should be noted that allowing g, to vary does not destroy the applicability\nof the model in determining a structure of share prices at any time. In fact,\nif, as Friend suggests, the projected standard-security growth rate (g,) at\nthe December, 1961 market peak was higher than 2 per cent, then my\njudgment about the overvaluation of growth stocks is supported a fortiori,\nsince the growth rate of growth stocks would have had to be correspondingly\ngreater to provide any justification for the high market prices that then\nprevailed. Had the standard-security growth rate been higher, the standard\ndiscount rate would have been higher, and the implicit growth rates for my\nsample of growth stocks would have been even larger (and/or the growth\nperiods longer) than I had suggested.\n\nMore important, all the important theorems of the model still hold. It is\nnot necessary to assume (as Friend does) that estimates of prospective\ngrowth rates of growth stocks fluctuate proportionately more than growth rates\n",
                    "I. Professor Friend's Comment\n\nIn view of the general purpose of my article, it would appear that many of\nFriend's comments which quarrel with my particular illustrative calculations\nor which claim that, in fact, my ceteris paribus assumptions may not hold\nare, to some extent, beside the point. The more important questions are\nwhether or not Friend has successfully overturned the principal theorems of\nthe model. Consequently, my response will largely be confined to these ques-\ntions.\n",

                    "Equity Yields, Growth, and the Structure of Share Prices: Reply\n\nIn their two comments, Irwin Friend and Roy C. Cave have attacked sev-\neral assumptions of my valuation model and have questioned both the ap-\nplications of the model and its principal implication concerning the greater\nvolatility of growth stocks. Before turning to the major points of disagreement\nbetween the authors and myself, it would be useful to emphasize the major\npurpose of my article as well as the questions to which my analysis was not\naddressed. I was not attempting to evaluate, predict, or even suggest the\ndeterminants of the level of stock market prices. Nor did I offer, or ever claim\nto present, a full-uncertainty analysis of share valuation. Moreover, I never\nconsidered the empirical section of the paper to be, in any sense, a test of\nthe model\u2014the particular calculations performed were purely illustrative.\n\nIt is well known that individual securities may differ in risk and that in-\nvestors may alter their estimates of earnings growth rates. My purpose was to\nshow that, apart from these factors, it is possible to define a meaningful\nstructure of share prices at any point in time, and that the level and structure\ncan change in the absence of changes in growth rates and risk premiums. Per-\nhaps the most interesting and important results of this analysis concerned\nthe volatility of growth stocks. Abstracting from all the reasons usually ad-\nduced to explain the greater volatility of growth stocks, such as those sug-\ngested by Friend and Cave, I found an important additional reason to ex-\npect such a pattern. Most growth stocks are \"longer in duration\"! than stand-\nard issues. The greater volatility of growth stocks is perfectly analogous to\n\n1 A holder of standard (dividend-paying) shares gets more of his money back sooner than a\nholder of low- or nondividend-paying growth stocks. Growth stocks are thus longer in **dura-\ntion\" to use Macaulay's [7, pp. 44-53] measure of maturity.\n",

                    "The Stability of Neutralism: Comment\n\nProfessor Hirschman's refreshing treatment of \"The Stability of Neutral-\nism\"' suggests the type of contribution that economic tools can make to the\nsolution of problems in the other social sciences. However, such an excursion\ninto interdisciplinary analysis requires a high degree of precision, especially\nwhen new concepts are introduced. When using new concepts care must be\ntaken not to revert to their often imprecise and confusing colloquial connota-\ntions; in this instance lack of care resulted in an error in reasoning.\n\nTwo concepts\u2014economic independence and political neutrality\u2014 were in-\ntroduced and lack of differentiation between them led to conflict. In his dia-\ngrammatic presentation Hirschman represented economic aid on the ordinate\nand political alignment on the abscissa. Aid is available from both Russonia\nand Usonia, and each is willing to give a maximum of OT tons of gold (Fig-\nure 1) to a fully committed nation; economic independence may be defined\nas equal aid for \"Thirdonia from each of the two big powers. On the other\nhand, political alignment is measured by the proportionate distribution of the\nunderdeveloped land's votes in the United Nations General Assembly; politi-\ncal neutrality is achieved at ON when its votes are distributed equally be-\ntween the two superpowers.\n\nThe true meaning of the concepts may best be demonstrated in the case\nwhere Russonia and Usonia act symmetrically and do Not Penalize Neu-\ntrality. No conflict between the two ideas arises; Thirdonia can maximize\nthe volume of bullion it receives by behaving like a neutralist and demand-\ning economic independence. Referring to Figure 1b in the article (reproduced\nas Figure 1 below), we find that political neutrality can be achieved with-\nout sacrificing economic independence; OA tons of gold will be forthcoming\nfrom each donor if ON votes are delivered to Russonia and Usonia at appro-\npriate times in the General Assembly. In Hirschman's framework this is a sta-\nble solution\u2014the concave opportunity locus determined by the policies of\nthe two powerful, industrialized nations will be tangent to a convex indiffer-\nence curve of the independent and neutralist Thirdonia.\n\nA pitfall in the use of the two concepts arises when one of the powers at-\ntempts to take advantage of this stable equilibrium.

On\nthe basis of a model which he has developed, Baumol claims to be able to\nshow that the oligopolist is in equilibrium at that price and output where\nrealized profit is equal to the minimum acceptable profit. It is my contention\nthat the equilibrium which Baumol derives is only one of many possible con-\nstrained output levels.\n\nBaumol's basic static oligopoly model is presented in Figure 1. Output is\nmeasured on the horizontal axis, and total revenue, costs, and profits are\nmeasured on the vertical axis.*\n\nIf the firm were a profit maximizer, it would produce X, units of X; how-\never, Baumol hypothesizes that the firm attempts to maximize sales (total\nreceipts) subject to a profit constraint.

A higher rate of growth of investment would\nhave led to higher total output, assuming conventional multiplier\neffects. Another relationship may exist between the growth of output\nand investment in response to it. Would a higher rate of growth of\noutput lead to correspondingly larger investment? If output fluctu-\nated less, would investment be more stable, or higher? This study aims\nto throw some light on these questions. It analyzes manufacturing in-\nvestment in the United States since 1950. Linear regression equations\nindicate close relationships between investment, excess capacity, and\noutput changes, both in total manufacturing and in most of the in-\ndustries analyzed. These equations can be used to obtain tentative\nanswers to the above questions, assuming the relationships found are\nnot themselves altered by changed conditions of output growth.\n\nTo analyze the effects of output changes on investment is to test\nsome form of the acceleration principle. In its simplest mechanical\nform, the accelerator has failed to explain short-period changes in\ninvestment. A more flexible form of the accelerator is used in this\nstudy; investment is assumed to be negatively related to the differ-\nence between capacity output and actual output, positively related to\ntotal capacity, and positively related to the change in output. The\nacceleration principle cannot provide a complete explanation of invest-\nment, but it may explain a substantial part of it. Edwin Kuh empha-\nsized recently that real and financial factors must be considered com-\nplementary [4, pp. 260-68] and suggested that accelerator-type forces\nmay be more important in periods of pressure on capacity. This paper\ntests the accelerator in a period during most of which there was little\nor no pressure on capacity.\n\n* The author is professor of economics at Boston College.

One cause is that capital has many forms and several characteristics,\nand different writers stress different aspects. There is no reason to suppose a\n\"single object called *capital can be defined to sum up in one number\" all\nthe facts about time lags, gestation periods, and all the different kinds of\ncapital goods.

Yet much empirical\nanalysis is based on capital-output ratios or incremental capital-output ratios.\nSolow's comment that the only way one can make any sense out of these ratios\nis to suppose they are meant as crude approximations to rates of return, and\nthat, if that is indeed the intent, economists have an obligation to do better,\nis not unneeded.\n\nSolow states that rates of return on investment can be calculated without\nmeasuring the capital stock.

Let me quote the sentence: *. . . if we observe\nthe behaviour of a representative firm in one country it will be exactly the\nsame in all essentials as a representative firm taken from some other country\n\u2014regardless of the difference in total factor amounts and relative industrial\nconcentration\u2014 provided only that factor-price ratios are really the same in\nthe two markets\" [2, pp. 187-88, emphasis supplied].\n\nAt the end of his discussion Samuelson evaluates some important qualifica-\ntions which he finds help to \"reconcile results of abstract analysis with the\nobvious facts of life concerning the extreme diversity of productivity and\nfactor prices in different regions of the world\" [2, p. 196]. These \"qualifica-\ntions\" to the theorem furnish Samuelson with the \"causes\" of the factor-price\ndiversities. In other words, he does not hesitate, quite rightly in my view,\nto explain the observed facts of life\u2014factor-price differentials\u2014by the di-\nvergences of real conditions from the ideal ones which form the basis of the\nfactor-price equalization theorem.\n\nWould the Samuelson of the A-B-C argument against unrealistic, abstract\nmodels approve of the Samuelson of the intuitive proof of the factor-price\nequalization theorem? Frankly, I do not know. Perhaps both Samuelsons\nmake a distinction between a theorem and a theory, meaning by the former\na proposition deduced from counterfactual assumptions and postulates, and\nby the latter a proposition stipulating something about observable reality.\nBut the Samuelson of the Foundations of Economic Analysis, who preceded\nboth other Samuelsons, did pledge allegiance to a program emphasizing *the\nderivation of operationally meaningful theorems\" [1, p. 3].\n\nSince, according to Samuelson, a theorem deduced from counterfactual\nhypotheses cannot yield empirically true consequences, and does not contain\noperationally defined terms, it is not immediately clear just what an \"*opera-\ntionally meaningful theorem\" is supposed to be. If it is supposed to be a\n\"strong simple case\" pointing the way to \"an element of truth present in\na complex situation\" [2, p. 181], then we have no quarrel. For, I submit,\nthis is what the bulk of economic theory does. It is based on counterfactual\nassumptions, contains only theoretical constructs and no operational concepts,\nand yields results which, we hope, point to elements of truth present in com-\nplex situations. To call such theorems *operationally meaningful\" is to confer\non them a designation which is slightly deceptive; but in any case it gives\nthem the recognition which Samuelson, as critic of the Friedman position,\nor \"the F-twist,\" wants to deny.\n\nI conclude that Samuelson, one of the most brilliant theorists in present-\nday economics, produces his best work when he deduces from unrealistic\nassumptions general theoretical propositions which help us interpret some of\nthe empirical observations of the complex situations with which economic life\nconfronts us.\n\n1 37. .\n",

                    "he discusses, not methodology, but substantive propositions of economics. Let\nus choose the brilliant performance with which he demonstrated an important\nproposition in the theory of international trade.\n\nIn his ingenious papers on international factor-price equalization [2] [3],\nSamuelson shows *that free commodity trade will under certain specified\nconditions, inevitably lead to complete factor-price equalisation\" [2, p. 181].\nHe admits that *it would be folly to come to any startling conclusions on the\nbasis of so simplified a model and such abstract reasoning,\" but he submits\u2014\nvery rightly, in my opinion\u2014that \"strong simple cases often point the way\nto an element of truth present in a complex situation\" [2, p. 181].\n\nWhat are his assumptions, hypotheses, conditions? Here is the list:\n\n1. There are but two countries, America and Europe.\n\n2. 'They produce but two commodities, food and clothing.\n\n3. Each commodity is produced with two factors of production, land and\nlabour. The production functions of each commodity show \"constant\nreturns to scale\"... .\n\n4. The law of diminishing marginal productivity holds. . . .\n\n5. The commodities differ in their labour and land intensities\". . . .\n\n6. Land and labour are assumed to be qualitatively identical inputs in the\ntwo countries and the technological production functions are assumed\nto be the same in the two countries.\n\n7. All commodities move perfectly freely in international trade, without\ntariffs or transport costs, and with competition effectively equalizing\nthe market price-ratio of food and clothing. No factors of production\ncan move between the countries.\n\n8. Something is being produced in both countries of both commodities\nwith both factors of production. . . .\n\nFrom this he concludes: *Under these conditions, real factor prices must\nbe exactly the same in both countries (and indeed the proportion of inputs\nused in food production in America must equal that in Europe, and similarly\nfor clothing production)\" [2, p. 182].\n\nIn his \"intuitive proof\" he goes so far as to state this: *I have established\nunequivocally the following facts:\n\nWithin any country: (a) a high ratio of wages to rents will cause a\ndefinite decrease in the proportion of labour to land in both industries;\n(b) to each determinate state of factor proportion in the two industries\nthere will correspond one, and only one, commodity price ratio and a\nunique configuration of wages and rent; and finally, (c) that the change\nin factor proportions incident to an increase in wages/rents must be\nfollowed by a one-directional increase in clothing prices relative to food\nprices\" [clothing being the more labor-using commodity, food the more\nland-using commodity] [2, p. 187].\n\nIt may be fair to state that Samuelson had characterized the problem as\n*a purely logical one\" [2, p. 182]. But he sometimes uses language of em-\npirical operations, for example, when he speaks of \"observing the behaviour\nof a representative firm.\" It should be clear, however, that what he *observes\"\n",

                    "Professor Samuelson on Theory and Realism\n\nIn a discussion of \"Problems of Methodology\" at an AEA meeting [4],\nPaul Samuelson embarks on a critique of theories which employ unrealistic\nassumptions. He concludes with this strong indictment of \"unrealistic, ab-\nstract models\": *If the abstract models contain empirical falsities, we must\njettison the models, not gloss over their inadequacies\" [4, p. 236].\n\nLet us first indicate how Samuelson reaches this judgment. He defines a\ntheory *as a set of axioms, postulates, or hypotheses that stipulate something\nabout observable reality [4, p. 233]. Denoting the theory as B, the *conse-\nquences\" derived from it as C, and the \"assumptions\" antecedent to it as A,\nhe argues that 4, B, and C must actually be identical in meaning, mutually\nimplying one another. Thus, he holds, if the assumptions are empirically false,\nand the theory therefore unrealistic, the deduced consequences cannot pos-\nsibly be empirically valid. In other words, an unrealistic theory cannot yield\nrealistic consequences.\n\nSamuelson also considers the possibility that the assumptions are wider\nthan the theory, and that the theory is wider than the consequence, so that\nthere is a subset C \u2014 of C, while A is a subset of A. In this case 44d- may\nimply B, without B implying A-- ; and C may imply C\u2014, without C\u2014 im-\nplying C. If C\u2014 happens to be empirically valid, does this *validate\" the\nwider theory B, or the even wider set of assumptions, A4-d-? Samuelson ex-\nplicitly rejects this. He regards as \"nonsense\" the claim that the validity of C\u2014\njustifies holding an unrealistic theory B, let alone the completely unwarranted\nset of assumptions At.\n\nWhat Samuelson does here is to reject a// tAeory. A theory, by definition,\nis much wider than any of the consequences deduced. If the consequences\nwere to imply the \"theory\" just as the theory implies the consequences, that\ntheory would be nothing but another form of the empirical evidence (named\n*consequence\") and could never \"explain\" the observed, empirical facts.\n\nIn addition, Samuelson errs in another way. We never deduce a conse-\nquence from a theory alone. We always combine the postulated relationships\n(which constitute the theory) with an assumption of some change or event\nand then we deduce the consequence of the conjunction of the theoretical\nrelationships and the assumed occurrence. Thus, we do not infer C or C\u2014\nfrom B, but rather from the conjunction of B and some occurrence O. If C \u2014\ncan be deduced from B cum O; and if both O and C\u2014 are found to corre-\nspond to data of observaton which can be regarded as the empirical counter-\nparts (referents, proxies) of the theoretical O and C \u2014 ; then we rule that the\ntheory B has sustained the test. This test does not prove that B is \"true,\"\nbut we have no reason to \"jettison\" B\u2014unless we have a better theory B'.\n\nLet us now leave aside the argument by which Samuelson reached his\ndecision against \"unrealistic, abstract models\" and theories; let us, instead,\nconfront Samuelson's judgment with Samuelson's pattern of theorizing when\n",

(Both my footnote and its context\nmake clear that a maximum point is also contemplated.)\n\nAlthough Nutter implies that my view is identical to that of Stonier and\nHague, he is wrong: My position is simply that *'a thorough search of the\nliterature has failed to reveal a single case in which a writer has sfecified\na linearly homogeneous production function which produces such a total\nproduct curve.\" Nor has Nutter cited any examples.

This is a point\nwhich economics students often fail to grasp. In the process, however, he\nmay have raised fresh doubts in the minds of our charges on the relationship\nbetween the marginal products of the variable and fixed factors.\n\nUsing the linear and homogeneous function\n\nx-\u2014 22a1/45314 \u2014 20a 35218\n\nwhere x is output and a and 5 are the two inputs, Nutter shows that the\nmarginal product of b increases over the range 2.45\u00bb b\u00bb 1, and concludes:\n\nOf course, over the range at which 5 has increasing returns, a has a\nnegative marginal product.

The con-\nclusion is obvious that a nonzero value of Michaely's index is no guarantee\nat all that the situation calls for a multilateral balancing of trade.\n\nIf we now turn to the League's index (T;), we can immediately see the\nattempt to remove the influence of unbalanced trade in the last term of\nboth the numerator and the denominator.

There is at least one practical and one theoretical\nreason for preferring the reformulated League's index (henceforth called\nsimply *League's index\"). The practical reason is simply that it is very\nmuch easier to calculate. When calculating the League's index for a par-\nticular country, only one operation of division is required, while two such\noperations are needed for each trading partner of the country when Mich-\naely's index is calculated. Thus if a country has 70 trading partners,\nMichaely's index would require 140 division operations, some of them\nshowing quotients only in the sixth or seventh decimal place, against only\none such operation for the League's index.\n\nHowever, the much more serious deficiency of Michaely's index is\nanalytical. There is nothing in his formula to remove or even reduce the\ninfluence of unbalanced trade. Michaely is himself aware of this and has\ntherefore excluded a number of countries from consideration because they\nhad a large trade imbalance. He even suggests that the higher average of\nthe indices for various countries in 1948 as compared with 1938 may be the\nresult of a greater unbalanced trade in 1948, rather than of greater multi-\nlateral trading in that year [2, pp. 689-91].

At the same time he has\nformulated another such index based on an early report published by the\nLeague of Nations [1, p. 60].! He has then proceeded to use his own index\nrather than the League's (or more accurately, the one based on the League's\nreport) for calculating the indices of multilateral balancing for various\ncountries. Surprisingly, Michaely nowhere discusses why he has used his\nown index rather than the League's or any other index. He has done so\npresumably because he considers his index in some way superior to others.\n\"This can be the only justification one can give for introducing a new index\nwhen an old one is known to exist. The purpose of this note is to examine\nthe validity of this implicit claim on behalf of Michaely's index.\n\nBefore we do that, however, we shall have to remove a slip in Michaely's\nalgebraic formulation of the League's index. The League's report divides\ntotal trade into three parts: bilaterally balanced (BB), multilaterally bal-\nanced (MB), and unbalanced (U). While in his footnote 7 [2, p. 693]\nMichaely interprets the League's index to mean M B/(BB-- M D), in his\nfootnote 5 [2, pp. 688-89], where he gives the algebraic formulation of the\nindex, he declares it wrongly to be (MB4-U)/(BB-4- M B).\n\nUsing a simplified version of Michaely's notations (which will be em-\nployed in the rest of this note), if we let X and M, respectively, stand for\nthe total export and import of the country concerned, and X; and M; for\nits export to and import from country i, then the League's index (following\nMichaely's interpretation) would be\n\nipx-w|-|ix-u|\n\ni-1\n\nTr\nX-M-\u2014-|X-M|\n\nwhere z is the number of the trading partners of the country concerned, and\n\nnot\n",

This has been done for several\nreasons,? whose acceptance is implied, it seems to me, in the League's index,\nand which are not disputed by Ahmad.\n\nThere is thus need to eliminate somehow that part of imports which is\nfinanced by capital imports, and treat the trade of the country in question\nas if it were balanced. There may be various ways of doing it, and each of\nthem rests on arbitrary assumptions.\n\nThe question may be stated as follows: what would have happened to\ncountry A's trade had capital imports disappeared and the country's trade\nbeen balanced? The use of the League's index assumes, in the situation on\nhand, that the elimination of 50 units of capital imports would have reduced\nimports from country C\u2014the one with whom country A maintains an im-\nport surplus\u2014by the same amount. This, however, is only one of many\npossibilities. Even had the capital imports been provided in fact by country\nC, there is no need that their elimination would have expressed itself\nnecessarily in the reduction of imports from C. Moreover, without access\nto further data, there is no reason to presume that country C is indeed the\nsource of capital imports\u2014it could be country B just as well.\n\nIn other words, the use of the League's index assumes, implicitly, that\nall exchanges of goods for financial assets are necessarily bilateral. This,\nobviously, is merely one of various possible assumptions. One might, for\ninstance, go to the other extreme and adopt the assumption that all such\nexchanges are multilateral. I cannot see any a priori reason for selecting\neither of these two extremes.

                    "The Paternity of an Index\n\nIn the March issue of this Review, Benton F. Massell [5, pp. 52 ff.] uses\nan index of trade concentration of the form 4/Z(x;/x)? where x;is the value\nof a country's trade in commodity 4 (or with trading partner i) in some\nperiod, while x is the country's total trade. This index appears to have\ncome into wide use recently and, to my rather chagrined surprise, is referred\nto, by Massell as well as by Kindleberger [4, p. 143], Michaely [6], and\nTinbergen (9, pp. 268 ff.], as the **Gini index\" or \"*Gini coefficient.\" Given\nthe sudden popularity of the measure, I feel that I should stand up for my\nrights as its originator. It was first introduced and computed for a large\nnumber of countries in my book National Power and the Structure of Foreign\nTrade [3, Ch. 7 and pp. 157-62]. As explained there, the use of the index is\nindicated when concentration is a function of both unequal distribution\nand fewness. The traditional measures of concentration, generally devised\nin connection with income distribution and the Lorenz curve, are sensitive\nonly to inequality of distribution, and we do owe several such measures to\nGini.\n\nThe confusion on this score is the stranger as I referred at length in my\nbook to the important work of the Italian statisticians on measurement of\nconcentration, and particularly to Gini [3, pp. 157-58]. Upon devising the\nindex I went carefully through the relevant literature because I strongly\nsuspected that so simple a measure might already have occurred to some-\none. But no prior inventor was to be found.\n\nTo complicate the story, I must add that there was a posterior inventor,\nO. C. Herfindahl [2], who in 1950 proposed the same index, except for the\nsquare root. While obviously unaware of my earlier work when writing,\nHerfindahl did acknowledge it in a footnote [2, Ch. 1 and p. 21, n.]. Never-\ntheless, when the index is used for measuring industrial concentration, the\nsecond principal area of its application, it is now usually referred to as the\n*'Herfindahl index,\" owing to a well-known paper by Rosenbluth [7] who\nhas, however, recently made a valiant, but probably vain, attempt to\nstraighten the matter out [8, pp. 391-92].\n\nThe net result is that my index is named either after Gini who did not\ninvent it at all or after Herfindahl who reinvented it. Well, it's a cruel\nworld.\n\nn oT do\n",

These proved unable to handle the task with the\nmeans placed at their disposal, and the continuing pressure of rising\ndemand upon declining output resulted in the emergence of a de jure\nblack market. Faced with this situation, the Soviet leadership found it\nconvenient in 1932 to resurrect the ancient, and but recently and offi-\ncially discarded, institution of the so-called bazaar trade (or farmers'\nmarkets). These markets were re-established under a new name and\nsubjected to strict government controls [25]. Ever since, the collective\nfarm market (hereafter briefly referred to as the market\") has con-\ntinued to function as the only market in the otherwise tightly planned\neconomy where prices are established by the interplay of demand and\nsupply.\n\nDuring the last decade, the importance of the market in the Soviet\ndistribution system has declined, but its position as a source of urban\nfood supplies is still very respectable. According to an official statistical\nhandbook, it accounted for 14.1 per cent of \"sales of comparable food\nproducts\" in 1961 [30, p. 632]. All averages, however, can be made to\ncover a variety of sins, and it appears that this one is no exception.\nAround 1960-61, the share of the market in \"total sales to population\"\nwas said to exceed 50 per cent for a number of products [1, p. 54]. In\n1957, when the corresponding handbook percentage was 18.2, the share\nof the market in total physical volume of sales to population was 63 per\ncent for potatoes, 48 per cent for eggs, 35 per cent for vegetables, and\n23 per cent for meat products [6, p. 15].'\n\n* The author is assistant professor of economics at the University af California, Santa\nBarbara.

James J.\nSullivan and Robert P. Anderson helped with the calculations.\n\n!In 1957, the share of the market in all purchases by families of those employed in\nindustry was: 28 per cent for meat, 26 per cent for fresh milk, 54 per cent for eggs, 67\nper cent for potatoes, and 39 per cent for vegetables [21, p. 8].\n"

                    "externality in the Marshallian or Pigovian sense exists only if proper com-\npensalion is nol paid to the actor so that his private marginal gain is not\nequal to the marginal social gain. Only this sort of externality produces a\nnonoptimal competitive equilibrium. Thus, interdependence is a necessary\nbut not a sufficient condition for the significant classical externality con-\ncept.?\n\nStrictly speaking, the assertion that marginal social gain differs from the\nmarginal private gain requires information about the effects of the ac-\ntivity in question upon at least two persons: the effects upon the actor,\n1, and the effects on 2, the person whose welfare is influenced by 1's ac-\ntivity. For without such information we cannot judge whether or not 1's\nmarginal gain equals that of the group (1 and 2 together). Following Bu-\nchanan and Stubblebine [3], we may then conclude that a pair of sufficient\nconditions for the existence of an externality (they call it a Pareto-relevant\nexternality) require (a) that the actor, individual 1, be in equilibrium with\nrespect to his own activity, so that ;W,\u20140, and (b) that the marginal effect\nof his activity on individual 2 be nonzero, i.e., 9/1740. Thus, throughout the\npreceding note it is assumed implicitly that each individual is in equilibrium\nso that no celeris paribus marginal change in his activity will produce any\nchange in his own welfare. For then we can be sure that, if a marginal\nchange in his activity does affect the welfare of others, its private payoff\n(zero) must differ from its yield to society.\n",

                    "APPENDIX C: ON THE DETINITION OF 'EXTERNALITY\"\n\nIt transpires that it is not quite as easy to provide a usable formal defini-\ntion of \"externality\" as might at first appear. This appendix offers some re-\nmarks on this subject and comments on some peculiarities in the use of the\nterm which has been made in this paper.\n\nTwo implicit features of the definition of \"externality\" employed in this\nnote should be brought to the reader's attention:\n\n1. The usual externality concept asserts that agent f's activity affects\nthe /olal welfare of some other individual, (21WW1740), and does not neces-\nsarily imply that agent 1's activity influences the marginal return to the\nactivities of the other individual, 2, (215740). However, in this note the\nlatter, marginal criterion (;1/;1\u00bb740) is employed throughout. Clearly the\ntwo criteria do not necessarily yield the same results: e.g., if the welfare\nfunction of individual 2 is ;W \u2014 Kai/a\u00bb (where a; again measures the ac-\ntivity level of individual 1, etc.), then ;W\u2014 K/as7 0, so that in the conven-\ntional sense external economies are present; but ;3W;3\u2014 \u2014 K/a? \u00ab0, so that\nin terms of my usage individual 2's activity produces external diseconomies.\nNevertheless, both in principle and in practice, the two criteria are not\nunrelated. Thus if for a9\u20140, the total welfare of the second individual, .W.\nis unaffected by a;, and if 3\u00c0W 157 0 throughout, then we must have ;:\u00c0W,\u00bb0\nfor all a57 0. That is, if the y intercept of 2's welfare function does not\nchange but its slope (marginal value) rises throughout, then his lota] welfare\nmust also increase to the right of the y axis. More important, most if not\nall of the examples of external economies which are found in the literature\ninvolve both ;W120 and 3W1?70 (with a corresponding assertion holding\nfor diseconomies). For example, if an increased output by firm 1 makes it\neasier for company 2 to obtain skilled workers or some other specialized\ninputs, then both the total and marginal costs of company 2 may be ex-\npected to fall.\n\nIt will be noted that my externality concept then rules out the relatively\nuninteresting case Davis and Whinston [4] have called *'separable external-\nities,\" Le. externalities which involve ;W(ai, a;) 23W*(a1) J-3W **(ag) so\nthat, necessarily, \u00bb1W15\u20140.\n\n2. A second important element in the definition of an externality has,\nwith one noteworthy exception, been overlooked in most of the formal\ndefinitions which are found in the literature. It has become customary to\ntake the easy option and equate externalities with interdependence\u2014that\nls, an externality is defined to exist if, and only if, individual 2's welfare is\naffected by the level of individual 1's activity. In fact, such a definition of\nan externality robs it of its most important welfare implications. For an\n",

(concave downwards).\n\n'Thus we are given:\n\n() W 2f(a, * * * , a;) -f(A) is strictly concave.\n\n(ii) The function has a maximum (which by our concavity assumption is\nnecessarily unique and absolute).

The first claim has\nbeen discussed at some length in Western literature. Independent indexes of\ngrowth for the planned economies have been developed by Western scholars,\nand the results have been analyzed and compared with similar indexes for the\nfree-market economies [1] [11]. Considerably less attention has been paid to\nthe second claim, possibly because measuring the degree to which the two sys-\ntems utilize available inputs is an even more complex problem than the\ncalculation of growth indexes. Little attention has been devoted to the\nthird claim? that \"Socialism is characterized, above all, by the absence of\ncyclical disturbances in production\" [14, p. 9]; no statistical comparisons of\nfluctuations in economic activity in the two systems are available.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to compare the year-to-year fluctuations in\noutput for a group of planned and a group of free-market economies.

The results of the test are shown in Table III. The\nvariances of total outputs in the two groups are too different to permit the\nt-test)\" For the other three aggregates, the mean fluctuation is significantly\nhigher in planned economies in agriculture and construction, but not in in-\ndustry.\n\n3. The degree of association between fluctuations and growth rates can be\nexpressed by the correlation coefficient between the two variables. Consider-\ning both groups together, the coefficient for total output is --0.15 and is not\nsignificant. A significant relationship exists in agriculture where the coefficient\nis 4-0.53 and in construction where it is 4-0.45; the first one is significant\nat 1 per cent level, the second one at 5 per cent level. In industry, a surpris-\ningly negative (though not significant) relationship exists between the two\nvariables; the coefficient is \u20140.25.

Only the future\nwill show how \"'unrepresentative\" the decade of the \"fifties might have been\nfor the planned economies or for the free-market group. The experiment of\nintegral planning was new for all countries of the Communist bloc except the\nSoviet Union, and, with the exception of agriculture, the Soviet Union ex-\nperienced the lowest fluctuations. As more planning expertise is acquired and\nperhaps more institutional stability achieved, these countries will probably\nreduce fluctuations in their economic activity. The free-market economies\nmay, on the other hand, find their era of relatively stable growth coming to\nan end. We can state with reasonable certainty, however, that unless the\nperformance of the f\u00edree-market countries deteriorates substantially, the\nplanned economies have some considerable way to go before they can sub-\nstantiate the claim of superiority with respect to fluctuations. Should the bloc\ncountries be unsuccessful in dampening their output fluctuations experienced\nin the last decade, a \"cycle theory\" will perhaps have to be advanced for this\nnew type of economic organization. The explanation would presumably run\nin terms of such factors as rapid shifts in economic policies, changes in\n",

Comments\n\nThe findings of this study\u2014that the planned economies of the Communist\nbloc were subject to fluctuations in economic activity equal to or greater than\nthose experienced by the free-market economies of the OECD-\u2014\u2014raise four\nquestions. First, was there a difference between the two blocs in the extent\nto which fluctuations took the form of mere changes in positive growth rather\nthan absolute decline when compared to the preceding year; if a decline, how\nlong did it last? Second, assuming that the eight planned economies con-\nsidered here in some way represent all planned economies and the 18 free-\nmarket economies represent all free-market economies, what statistical sig-\nnificance can be attached to the differences of means in the two groups?\nThird, may the larger fluctuations of the planned economies have been merely\nthe price paid for an allegedly more rapid increase in output? Fourth, what\ninfluence does the particular time period studied have on the results obtained?\n\n1. The percentage of absolute declines in all year-to-year changes amounted\nin the planned economies to 10.1 for total output, 30.4 for agriculture, 2.5\nfor industry, and 8.7 for construction. The corresponding figures for the\nfree-market economies are 5.6 for total output, 27.9 for agriculture, 9.5 for\nindustry, and 23.2 for construction. Thus, the free-market economies had\nfewer interruptions in positive growth of total output and, by a slight margin,\n\n(See next page for Tables I and II)\n\nX These countries are Austria, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,\nthe Netherlands, Portugal and Turkey. For the planned economies, the range of per\ncapita income is $177 in Yugoslavia and $500 in Czechoslovakia. For the free-market\neconomies, the range is $219 in Turkey and $508 in the Federal Republic of Germany\n[27, pp. 69-73].\n",

Three pairs of averages have been calculated.\nFirst, the averages for the eight planned and the 18 free-market economies.\nSecond, since fluctuations in total output might depend on the level of eco-\nnomic development (with agricultural output comprising a large and widely\nfluctuating share), only those OECD countries are considered which had in\nthe mid-fifties per capita incomes similar to those of the Communist bloc.!*\nFinally, four planned economies of Central Europe (Czechoslovakia, East\nGermany, Hungary, and Poland), which had previously belonged to the\neconomic community of Western Europe but which introduced economic\nplanning after World War II, are compared with the Common Market\ncountries.\n\nIn all these comparisons the indicated mean fluctuations were higher in\nthe Communist bloc than the OECD economies for all four aggregates. Only in\nindustry is the mean for the planned economies close to the average for free-\nmarket countries.\n",

There is considerable variation in degree of fluctuation both\nwithin and between the groups. The path of growth was quite smooth in some\ncountries (Poland, the Soviet Union; France, Italy, Norway), while in other\ncountries it fluctuated widely (Bulgaria, Yugoslavia; Greece, Turkey, the\nUnited States). Considering both groups together, the lowest fluctuation in\ntotal output occurred in the Soviet Union and in Norway, the highest in\nYugoslavia and, to a lesser degree, in Turkey. The output of agriculture\nfluctuated little in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Luxemburg, Sweden, and the\nUnited States; widely in Yugoslavia and Canada. Industrial output of the\nSoviet Union grew more smoothly than that of any other country considered;\nthe United States registered the highest fluctuations. The growth of construc-\ntion was smooth in the Soviet Union, in France, and in the United Kingdom;\nit varied greatly in Bulgaria, Rumania, and Turkey.\n\nThe performance of the Soviet Union is of particular interest not only for\nthe obvious reason that it is the most powerful nation of the Communist\nbloc, but also because it is the one with most experience in economic planning.\nExcept for agriculture, it experienced the lowest fluctuations among the\nplanned economies. Its performance, however, seems to have been duplicated\nby free-market countries. It was either matched or surpassed by France, Italy,\nNorway, and Sweden in total output; by Austria, Denmark, France, the\nFederal Republic of Germany, Luxemburg, Sweden, the United States, and\nthe United Kingdom in agriculture; and by Denmark, France, Italy, and the\nUnited Kingdom in construction. Only in industry\u2014the show-window of its\n\nCzechoslovakia agricultural output does not include forestry but does include fisheries.\nYugoslavia publishes separate series for these three sectors. Definitional differences would\nof course be important if we attempted to measure, for example, the relative levels of\noutput in the two systems. These differences should not have much influence on fluctu-\nations over time.\n\n?' Net production constituted in Poland less than one-half of gross production in agri-\nculture, about one-third in industry, and about one-half in construction [8, pp. 58-59].\n\n^ Fluctuations are about equal in the net and gross output of Czechoslovak industry.\n\n5 pata for some aggregates are published as three-digit numbers only.\n",
                    "planned economies are the familiar gross values of output, which include large\namounts of double-counting.'? Only for three of the eight planned economies\nare data on income originating in these three sectors available. The income-\noriginating aggregates exhibit larger fluctuations than the gross value aggre-\ngates in all but one of the nine cases.!* Since the concept of income originat-\ning is closer to gross product at factor cost, used in the free-market econ-\nomies, it is likely that the subsequent use of gross value of output data for\nthe planned group somewhat underestmates the degree of their fluctuations.\n\nThe limitations of the available information should not be overemphasized.\nMore uniform and detailed data?* would of course make the comparisons\nmore precise. I am convinced, however, that the conclusions presented in the\nnext section would not be altered.\n",

                    "Data for planned economies were obtained from official statistics released\nby the central statistical offices of each country. Practically all information\non free-market economies was obtained from OECD publications.\" Two ob-\njections might be raised to these data. The first is that the official statistics\nfor growth of output in planned economies suffer from an upward bias. This\nbias in the trend should not, however, distort the variations around the trend.\n\nThe second, more troublesome, objection is that the aggregates studied are\nnot strictly comparable. Most data for all four aggregates in the free-market\ngroup refer to gross domestic product at factor cost.? For the planned econ-\nomies, data on total output refer to income originating in material production\nexclusive of depreciation. In an attempt to make the two sets of data more\nnearly comparable? two alternative series were used for the free-market\neconomies. First, the part of domestic product originating in the services sec-\ntors was omitted.'? This adjustment probably overcompensates for exclusion\nof services in planned economies. As Alec Nove points out [16, pp. 253-54],\nnational income of planned economies is built up from the production side by\nsubtraction of material expenditures from total value of their output. Conse-\nquently, services rendered to productive enterprises find their way into the\n\"material\" national income. Therefore, calculations were also made for the\nfree economies using the official concept of domestic product at factor cost.\nLack of data makes impossible any adjustment for depreciation charges,\nwhich are excluded from total output in planned but not in free-market statis-\ntics. \"This shortcoming should not, however, greatly affect the comparability\nof fluctuations. Depreciation charges are small compared to national income\nin the planned economies, and consequently their exclusion could not in-\ncrease significantly the measured degree of instability even if we make the\nextreme assumption that their growth rate was constant.\n\nUnfortunately, no adjustments are possible to make the concepts of agri-\ncultural, industrial, and construction outputs more nearly comparable. The\nboundaries of productive activity in these sectors are not identical in the two\ngroups of economies? More importantly, the data for these three sectors in\n\n* Data for the United States are from the Department of Commerce.\n\n*Tn the case of Ireland, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, and the United\nStates, outputs of the respective industries are represented by the official industrial pro-\nduction indexes; output of construction is represented for each country by the \"resi-\ndential construction\" and 'other construction\" components of the gross domestic fixed\ncapital formation.\n\n?For a discussion of an attempt by the Russian economist, Kolganov, to adjust the\nUnited States national income to Soviet definition, see [17].\n\nT'\"The following sectors compose the gross domestic material product at factor cost:\nagriculture, forestry, and fishing; mining and quarrying; manufacturing; electricity, gas\nand water works; construction; transportation and communication; wholesale and retail\ntrade. Excluded are: banking, insurance, and real estate; ownership of dwellings; public\nadministration and defense; health and education services; and miscellaneous services\n[19, XXXVII].\n\n\"In Poland, for example, depreciation amounted to about 8 per cent of national in-\ncome [8, p. 58].\n\n?

Scope and Methods\n\nWe define as planned economies those whose means of production are\nowned predominantly by the State and whose economic activities are directed\npursuant to an over-all economic plan. The countries for which information is\nreadily available belong to the European Communist bloc: Bulgaria, Czecho-\nslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Rumania, the Soviet Union, and\nYugoslavia.? The free-market countries are the members of the Organization\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development: Austria, Belgium, Canada,\nDenmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ire-\nland, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Turkey,\nthe United Kingdom, and the United States.* Neither group is homogeneous.\nIn each there prevail significant differences in per capita income. The ap-\nproaches to problems of integral planning vary from country to country\nwithin the Communist bloc as much as the degree of government interven-\ntion varies within the free-market group. Yet a sharp distinction can be drawn\nbetween the two on the basis of the institutional framework within which\ntheir economies operate, and meaningful comparisons can be made.\n\nThe investigation covers 11 years, 1950-60. The recovery years immedi-\nately following World War II are excluded as unreflective of normal \"*peace-\ntime\" differences in the performance of the two systems. By 1950 outputs in\npractically all the countries studied had either reached or surpassed the\nprewar level. And the basic institutional changes in the Communist bloc had\nbeen completed; all these economies were operating on long-term plans.\n\nVariations in volume of four output aggregates are investigated: total out-\nput, output in agriculture, in industry (composed of mining, manufacturing,\nand utilities), and in construction. Since there is no unique way to measure\nthese fluctuations, several methods were tested. They all led to essentially\nthe same results. The results of two methods are presented.5 The first measure\nis the standard error of the least-squares fit of the series Y;/Y;., to time,\nwhere Y stands for the value of the variable in constant monetary units and\nt stands for time; it expresses the fluctuations in percentage points measured\nfrom the trend-line fit to yearly growth rates. The second measure is the\nantilog of the square root of logarithmic variance of the series Y;/Y;.,, with\nunity subtracted from the antilog.5\n\n*'The first seven countries form the COMECON. No data were available on Albania.\n* Adequate data were not available for Spain and Switzerland.\n\n5Other measures of fluctuations tested were: (1) Pearson's coefficient of variation; (2)\nthe standard error of the least-squares fit to the index of growth with 1950 as the base\nyear; and (3) the standard error of the least-squares fit to the logarithms of index of\ngrowth with 1950 as the base year.\n\n$ For a discussion of the second method, see [5, pp. 23-24]. The formula is:\n1 z\nV. x [s Q/Yu) - x X s Qn 1-2]\n\u20141,\nN\n\nwhere Y. stands for the value of the variable in constant monetary units, / stands for time,\nand N for the number of years minus one.\n\nFluctuation \u2014 antilog\n",

The first claim has\nbeen discussed at some length in Western literature. Independent indexes of\ngrowth for the planned economies have been developed by Western scholars,\nand the results have been analyzed and compared with similar indexes for the\nfree-market economies [1] [11]. Considerably less attention has been paid to\nthe second claim, possibly because measuring the degree to which the two sys-\ntems utilize available inputs is an even more complex problem than the\ncalculation of growth indexes. Little attention has been devoted to the\nthird claim? that \"Socialism is characterized, above all, by the absence of\ncyclical disturbances in production\" [14, p. 9]; no statistical comparisons of\nfluctuations in economic activity in the two systems are available.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to compare the year-to-year fluctuations in\noutput for a group of planned and a group of free-market economies. The\nfirst section describes the scope of the project and the data used, the second\npresents the results, and the third comments on the findings.\n\n'The possibility of underutilization of inputs in planned economies has been pointed\nout, among others, by Joseph Berliner [2, pp. 358, 363-66], Emily Brown [3, pp. 181-\n82], Robert Campbell [4], Naum Jasny [9], Alec Nove [15, p. 579], Alfred Oxenfeldt\n[21], and Lazar Volin [35, p. 306].\n\n?Fluctuations in the Soviet Union are discussed by Naum Jasny [10, pp. 11-13], G.\nW.

                    "The Brown Shoe Case and the New Antimerger Policy: Comment\n\nI should like to offer several comments on the recent Brown Shoe decision\n[1] which David Maitin ably analyzed in the June 1963 issue of this\nReview [3].\n\n1. The Brown decision ostensibly settles one of the thorniest issues in\nantitrust law: the issue of market definition in merger cases. In holding that\nrelevant submarkets, product and geographic, may exist within the bound-\naries of the broad market, the Court apparently ruled that the market may\nbe drawn more narrowly in a merger case than in a monopoly case. Unfortu-\nnately, the decision is not altogether clear on this point. After stating that\nsubmarkets are germane in a Section 7 case, the Court proceeded to argue\nthat the relevant market must be drawn broadly enough to recognize com-\npetition where it exists and to correspond to economic reality. Obviously, a\nmarket drawn to include competitive products and suppliers traces out the\ntrue boundaries of a market, regardless of whether it is termed a broad\nmarket or a submarket.\n\nMartin argues, however, that in the Brown case the Court did not accept\nthe Sherman Act guidelines to market definition in merger cases.

In other words, this second conclusion is in no way inconsistent with\nthe proposition that *The American Economy\" was highly successful in\nfulfilling those objectives it set out to achieve.\n\nThere are several grounds upon which these conclusions and their signifi-\ncance might be challenged. It is perhaps useful to anticipate and evaluate\nthese possible criticisms [4].\n\n1. A first potential criticism is that the experiment does not embrace\ncertain variables that might reasonably be expected to have a bearing upon\nthe performance of the groups compared. There are two defenses for this\ncriticism which, in our view, substantially diminish its relevance. First, as\npreviously noted, the matched-pairs comparison took cumulative grade\naverage, credit hours completed, and college affiliation into account. While\nother variables, e.g., outside employment, sex, family background, and type\nof student housing, might be argued to have some bearing upon the perform-\nance of the two groups, it can be countered that the cumulative grade aver-\nage used in the comparisons can reasonably be expected to reflect these other\nvariables. Second, if these allegedly neglected variables are of crucial impor-\ntance, the relative homogeneity of the television and lecture groups would\nseem to constitute a prima facie case that such variables would influence the\nperformances of both groups in the same direction.\n\n2. A second criticism might be that this experiment has validity only\nwithin the confines of the University of Nebraska. However, the students at\nNebraska are probably typical of students in the elementary economics\ncourse at a large number of American colleges and universities. l'urthermore,\nthere was nothing atypical about the control (lecture) group, and the course\nwas quite standard as to subject matter, type of presentation, textbook and\nsupplementary materials, etc. The class size (107) is undoubtedly less atypi-\ncal than would have been the case a few years ago. In short, there is reason\nto believe that a similar experiment at any one of a large number of other\ninstitutions would have yielded similar results.\n\n3. Objective examinations were employed in this comparison for two\nreasons: (a) to avoid the subjective element involved in the scoring of non-\nobjective examinations and (b) to facilitate the sampling of student under-\nstanding of a wider range of subject matter. It can be argued that many basic\neducational goals may be ignored in the measurement of students! grasp of\nfactual information and basic concepts and their ability to manipulate anal-\nytical tools through multiple-choice questions. It is true, of course, that the\nover-all effectiveness\" of any economics course is undoubtedly multidimen-\n\nsional. Which of the two groups acquired a more permanent interest in eco-\nnomics? How have the attitudes of the two groups toward value (policy)\npositions which they do not share been affected? With what impressions of\n",

On\nthe other hand, the lecture group periormed substantially better on the 60\nconceptual and 40 problem-analytical questions than did the television group.\n\nComputation of *7\" values revealed that the mean differences on the con-\nceptual questions were statistically significant at the 5 per cent level, while\non the problem-analytical questions the difference was significant at the 0.1\nper cent level. The mean differences on the factual questions and the Test of\nEconomic Understanding were not statistically significant.\n\nA non-parametric test of significance, namely, the Wilcoxon matched-\npairs signed-rank test, was also applied to the same data.

Two conclusions seem warranted upon\nthe basis of this particular evaluation.\n\n1. The performance of the two groups on the Test of Economic Under-\nstanding and the factual data component of the Course Examination suggests\nthat *The American Economy\" television course was as successful as the\nlecture course in conveying a broad, general understanding of economics.\n\n2. The lecture group seems to have achieved a higher level of understand-\ning of specific economic concepts and of analytical tools than did the tele-\nvision group. Stated differently, if a firm grasp of economic concepts and\nthe ability to apply the analytical tools of economics to problems and issues\nare held to be basic goals of the college principles course, The American\nEconomy\" may not have been a perfect substitute for the typical college\ncourse. It is relevant to note at this juncture, however, that this second con-\nclusion tends to impose an objective on The American Economy\" that is\nnot entirely consistent with the goals set forth by the national teacher.

The remaining 40 questions were problems\nor analytical questions wherein, for example, students were required to in-\nterpret graphs, calculate and analyze cost and demand data, compute the\nelasticity coefficient from demand data, and determine the gains from trade\nand the terms of trade from comparative cost data. All of the 120 questions\nwere based upon textbook material which was common to both the television\nand lecture groups.\n\nA brief discussion of the rationale for identifying and employing three\ntypes of questions in the Course Examination is in order. Inasmuch as the\ntelevision course was designed primarily to further general economic under-\nstanding rather than to prepare students for more advanced work in eco-\nnomics,? it was hypothesized that the lecture group would perform relatively\nbetter than the television group on questions that required the mastery of\ntechnical economic concepts and their application to the solution of numeri-\ncal and graphical problems.\n\nThe second examination given to the two groups was the Test of Economic\nUnderstanding prepared by a distinguished group of economists and educa-\ntors and published by the Joint Council on Economic Education. It is to be\nnoted that this 50 multiple-choice question examination was designed pri-\nmarily for high school students who might or might not have had formal\ncoursework in economics. In other words, this examination was not designed\nto measure achievement after a student had taken a specific course or read\ncertain materials. While the questions contained therein are a mixture of the\nthree types used in the Course Examination, the Test of Economic Under-\nstanding is undoubtedly less discriminating at the college level.\n\nBecause the cumulative grade averages of the television group and the\nlecture group were substantially different? the authors decided to make a\nmatched-pairs comparison. Twenty-seven of the 107 students comprising the\nlecture group were matched to the 27 television students on the basis of three\nvariables: cumulative grade average, number of credit hours of college work\ncompleted, and college affiliation (course of study). The mean cumulative\ngrade averages for the matched groups were identical (4.8). The average\nnumber of credit hours completed per student was very similar\u201461.8 hours\nin the television group and 60.4 hours in the lecture group. College affilia-\ntions, while not identical, varied little: each group contained 15 business ad-\nministration students; the television group contained three engineering stu-\ndents and the lecture group four; etc.\n\nIL Test Results and. Their Significance\n\nThe results of the matched-pairs comparison are summarized in Table 1.\nThe television group scored very slightly higher on the Test of Economic\n\n\"The television lectures on price theory, for example, made no reference to marginal\ncost and marginal revenue in the determination of output adjustments under different\nmarket conditions.\n\n* Based on a scale where 9 is the highest and 1 is the lowest grade, the lecture group\nwas found to have a 5.4 cumulative grade average as compared to 4.8 for the television\ngroup.\n",

If future courts scrupulously follow Brown, the frequency of the\nsmall-merger exemption may be small: even small mergers are now vulnerable\nunder the law if industry trends are present, and it would take a most unimagi-\nnative antitrust prosecutor who could not find evidence of some kind of trend in\nthe history of an industry.\n\nIn conclusion, the Brown decision crystallizes a question which long has\nplagued students of antitrust: how reliable are our predictive (analytical)\njudgments as to the probable competitive impact of a merger involving market\nshares of from, say, 2 to 20 per cent in industries having varying degrees of\nseller concentration, product differentiation, and entry barriers, as well as\nunpredictable firm behavioral patterns? My suspicion is that the variety of\nprofessional judgments concerning the impact of any given merger would be\nembarrassingly large. If I read Brown correctly, the Court has brushed aside\nthe intricacies of the competitive impact question and has come down on the\nside of those who urge that antimerger policy should stress large numbers of\nseller alternatives and low seller concentration. And certainly this was what\nCongress had in mind in amending the Clayton Act in 1950. But even those\nwho sympathize with this objective may be dismayed in the Brown ruling by\nthe Court's confusing submarket approach to market definition and its overt\nhostility toward vertical merger.

Such a modi-\nfication of the law would retain for society the benefits of the merger device,\nwithout subverting society's efforts to prevent competitive damaging mergers;\nand it would take the sting out of the charge that the purpose of the Clayton\nAct is to protect producers from hard competition.\n\n3. A close reading of the Court's approach to horizontal mergers in the\nBrown case suggests that the Supreme Court views a substantial increase in\nconcentration, brought about by a merger involving a substantial share, as\ntantamount to a lessening of competition or tendency toward monopoly. Per-\nhaps this is what Martin meant in arguing that under the Brown ruling hori-\nzontal mergers are to be governed by the incipiency doctrine, whereas prior\nto 1950 they were governed by the more stringent Sherman Act test of\nillegality.\n\n\"That an increase in industry concentration (rather than damage to competi-\ntion) has become the gravamen of Section 7 is clear from a number of points\nin the Brown decision. The Court eschewed an analysis of market structure\nand conduct, viewed the instant merger against the backdrop of industry\nconcentration trends, held (in another section of the decision) that the com-\npetitive vigor remaining after a merger is not relevant if oligopoly trends are\npresent, argued that market shares as low as 5 per cent\u2014at least in a frag-\nmented industry\u2014are substantial shares, and justified its over-all approach\nto merger legality on the ground that Congress had given a mandate to pre-\nvent tendencies toward concentration in their incipiency. More significantly,\nthe Court pointed out several times that there are three types of mergers\nwhich Congress wished to immunize from the law: mergers involving de\nminimus shares, failing companies, and small firms seeking to compete more\neffectively with the industry leaders. Presumably, all other mergers are illegal.\nSince it would be difficult to demonstrate on a priori grounds that all other\nmergers might damage competition, it is a fair inference that the focus of the\nlaw has been shifted from damage to competition to increases in concentration.\n\nThe above interpretation of the Brown decision forces me to question\nMartin's observations that market-share information will play a subsidiary\nrole in future merger cases, that future courts may permit a merger involving a\nmarket share of, say, 5 per cent or more if industry competitors possess a\nlarger share, and that the Brown decision confirms a rule of reason approach\nto merger legality. By emphasizing concentration, in the Brown case, the\nCourt has pulled the rug from under the Pillsbury rule-of-reason doctrine and\n",

                    "Court also considered the alleged industry trend toward concentration. It is\nclear that competition at some level may be threatened if only a few firms\nintegrate into backward or forward markets, especially if these firms possess\nlarge shares at one of the industry levels. But it is not clear that a multifirm\nvertical integration movement will damage competition at any level: if 100\nshoe manufacturers acquire all of the retail outlets, competition will not be\nrestricted at either the manufacturing or the retailing level [6, p. 183].\n\"Though the evidence in the Brown case did show that the number of manu-\nfacturers declined in the period 1947-54, it cannot be assumed that this was\ndue, entirely or in large part, to the vertical merger movement in the industry;\nmoreover, Justice Harlan admitted that the 4-firm, 8-firm, and 15-firm con-\ncentration ratios at the manufacturing level actually declined from 1947 to\n1955.? Instead of arguing that the vertical merger movement in the industry\nthreatens competition, the Court could just as easily have concluded that the\nvertical integration movement in the industry has worked to the disadvantage\nof the largest firms.\n\nThe Court also held that the vertical merger threatened competition at the\nretailing level. Justice Warren pointed out that a chain of vertically integrated\noutlets has lower costs than independent retailers because the wholesaler is\neliminated and the chain units can purchase in large quantities. Justice Har-\nlan argued that a vertically integrated chain can sell at a lower profit. Martin\npointed out that these cost advantages were not given much weight by the\nCourt. But the important point is that the Court failed to consider the attempt\nto lower costs as a legitimate purpose for merging; in fact the economic ad-\nvantages of this particular merger were regarded by the Court as a threat to\nretail competition. With this stroke, the Court may have succeeded in closing\nthe door on vertical mergers; for even if the market foreclosure is quite small,\nthe merger can be condemned because of the adverse competitive effects at\nthe forward market.\n\nMartin concluded that the Brown decision does not make vertical mergers\nper se illegal but it *puts much less burden on the government than before\"\n[3, p. 353]. If this view is correct (and this writer thinks it an understate-\nment), it is important that we understand the costs of a tough law on verti-\ncal mergers. If there are genuine economies to be gained by vertical integra-\ntion, business firms are under strong pressures to take advantage of them. This\ncan be accomplished by the building of new assets or the acquisition of existing\nassets. In either case, the nonintegrated firms will eventually fall by the way-\nside. The pains of economic adjustment, however, may be more severe if these\nfirms are gradually eliminated from the industry by the competitive pressures\ngenerated by new and more efficient capacity; for the sale of distressed assets\nto buyers inside or outside the industry is likely to be relatively disadvantageous\n\n* According to the Bureau of Census studies of the 4-digit footwear industry, the 4-\nfirm and 8-firm concentration ratios rose slightly from 1947 to 1954, while the 20-firm\nratio remained constant. All three ratios were a shade lower in 1958 than in 1947, See\n[8, p. 27].\n",

                    "would weaken its case under the Clayton Act and destroy it under the Sher-\nman Act. But this implies that the merger is significant in terms of actual or\npotential competitive impact precisely because the products of sets A and B\nare substitutes and in the same market.\n\nMartin has argued that the judiciary has accepted the submarket ap-\nproach to market definition in order to tighten the merger law. But this can\nbe done, as the Brown case demonstrates, by lowering the size of the market\nshare vulnerable under the law. There is, then, no need to narrow the market\ndefinition and artificially inflate the relative size of the merger. Nor is it a\nmatter of indifference as to which way we turn the screw: the attempt to\ntighten the law by means of a submarket approach to market definition might\nhave some unfortunate side effects.\n\nA submarket approach in merger cases is not likely to increase the clarity,\nconsistency, or acceptability of the law. What criteria are to be used in\nidentifying a submarket? The six criteria enumerated by the Court in the\nBrown case are the same criteria which establish or identify the broad\nmarket. Some courts will accept at face value the market definition offered\nby the government, provided there is some supporting evidence; other courts,\nhowever, will demand that the relevant market must be drawn realistically,\nand the Brown decision will be cited as authority. Thus the definition of the\nmarket and the criteria used to identify it wil! vary from case to case, lending\nsupport to the argument that the antitrust laws are too capricious to be work-\nable. And this argument will be bolstered by the allegation that the competi-\ntive impact of a merger is sometimes evaluated in a gerrymandered market.\nIt is preferable, in this writer's opinion, to face the difficulties involved in\nidentifying the true boundaries of the market than to use a submarket ap-\nproach and run the risk of undermining the strong case for strict antimerger\nenforcement.\n\n2. In finding the vertical aspect of the Brown-Kinney merger illegal, the\nCourt considered three factors: the foreclosure effect, industry trends, and\nthe competitive strength of the combination. Each of these three points will\nbe briefly commented upon.\n\nThe Court did not attempt to analyze the competitive impact of the verti-\ncal merger at the manufacturing level; instead, it assumed as an article of\nfaith that the permanent foreclosure of a market share which came to only\n1.2 per cent of national sales would be inherently damaging to competition.\nJustice Harlan, in one of the separate opinions, expressed an opposite fear:\nthat some of the independent retail stores would be prevented by the merger\nfrom dealing in Brown shoes. The possibility that the foreclosed manufac-\nturers could sell to the foreclosed retailers was apparently not given any weight\nby the Court. The failure of the Court to go beyond the bare fact of market\nforeclosure testifies again to a point once made by Professor Mason: that the\nlegal concept of monopoly emphasizes market exclusion [5]. It should come\nas no surprise, then, if small merger foreclosures are equated with monopolistic\ntendencies.\n\nIn judging the legality of the vertical merger at the manufacturing level, the\n",

                    "a common interpretation, I shall address my comments to the question of\nwhether the definition of the market should vary with the violation and anti-\ntrust statute. Is it tenable, as several commentators have argued, to exclude\nsubstitute suppliers in merger cases under the Clayton Act, even though we\ninclude them in monopoly cases under the Sherman Act [7] [4] [2]?\n\nThe assumption underlying the submarket approach in merger cases is that\nthe submarket is meaningful in itself, ie., that the submarket marks off an\nimportant area of competition. The difficulty with this assumption is that one\ncannot determine whether this is true without examining the broader market,\nthe market comprising those firms selling substitute products to a common\ngroup of buyers.! It is within the broad market, not the submarket, that the\nstuff of price determination and competitive rivalry is found. If the market\ndefinition in a monopoly case excludes some of the firms within this market,\nwe cannot determine whether a defendant has insignificant or substantial\nmonopoly power. If the market definition in merger cases excludes some sub-\nstitute products or if the market is defined so narrowly that it includes only\nthose firms which happen to be selling in a given area, we cannot reasonably\nknow whether the merger will damage competition; for the submarket ap-\nproach will restrict us to an examination of only a segment of the market and\nonly a part of the forces which determine price and firm behavioral patterns.\nThe merger of two companies which retail low-priced shoes in the same urban\nneighborhoods may or may not affect industry leadership, alter price, change\ncompetitive tactics, inconvenience buyers or suppliers, or trigger other mer-\ngers. And there is no way of knowing such things if we restrict ourselves to\na product and geographic submarket.\n\nRightly or wrongly, the courts have sometimes taken a quantitative ap-\nproach to merger legality, concentrating entirely on market-share statistics.\nEven on these terms, the market should not be defined differently in merger\nthan in monopoly cases. Suppose there are two sets of firms, that each set\nhas three firms, that each firm is equal in size, and that the products of set A\nare competitive with, but differentiated from, the products of set B. If one of\nthe firms in set A acquires the other two firms in its set, the government could\nchallenge the acquisition under either Section 2 of the Sherman Act or Sec-\ntion 7 of the Clayton Act. If substitute products are included, as they pre-\nsumably would be in a monopoly-power case, the firm has achieved a 50 per\ncent share of the market; if substitute products are excluded, as the Brown\ndecision implied they could be in a Clayton Act proceeding, the firm has\nachieved complete monopoly control. But obviously the probable damage to\ncompetition is the same regardless of how we define the market. Surely we do\nnot multiply the actual or potential damage of the merger by choosing to\nprosecute under one law rather than another. Alternatively, if one of the firms\nin set A acquires two of the firms in set B (rather than set A), the govern-\nment would not characterize the merger as conglomerate, realizing that this\n\n\"The broad market may, of course, exclude certain goods which are extremely poor\nsubstitutes because of quality or price differences.

His life-\ncycle model in Section I is not under discussion here, and its validity is\nunaffected by the following arguments. It is here contended that his debt-\nincome model is technically misleading, if not positively erroneous. His\nassumptions are so strong that further analysis of their consequences re-\nveals that, instead of growing to an asymptote, the debt-income ratio is\nconstant (or becomes so as soon as the assumptions of the model have taken\neffect, which will happen within about three years at most).\n\nEnthoven assumes that borrowings in each year are a constant proportion\nof income, that repayment conditions are constant, and that income in-\ncreases by a fixed proportion each year. Under these conditions it may be\nseen that (a) total debt at the end of each year is the sum of those fixed\nproportions of borrowings in that and earlier years which are still outstand-\ning (since repayment conditions are constant). Therefore (b) total debt is\nthe sum of fixed proportions of income over the past few years (since borrow-\nings are proportionate to incomes). Therefore (c) total debt bears a fixed\nratio to income in the given year (since the income in each previous year\nis a fixed proportion of income in the given year). Hence Enthoven's con-\nclusion that the debt-income ratio tends to a limit is correct only in a trivial\nsense; in fact it always equals the \"limit.\" If the borrowing-income ratio is\nnot equal to its constant value before year 0, say, perhaps because instal-\nment credit was only then legalized, the debt-income ratio does not reach\nits constant value until year /, where / is the number of years for which\ncontracts run. But it clearly must be constant from then onwards since the\nborrowing, if any, up to year 0 is irrelevant to total debt once it has all been\n\n!

MassELL*\n\nIn recent years there has been considerable discussion of the problem\nof fluctuations in commodity markets and the impact of these fluctua-\ntions on countries producing primary products. The newly developing\ncountries, in particular, many of whom are heavily dependent upon\nearnings from the sale of primary commodities to finance much-needed\ncapital goods imports, have evidenced substantial concern with the\ninstability of their export proceeds. In large part, this concern derives\nfrom the fact that commodity prices\u2014and, consequently, foreign ex-\nchange earnings\u2014have often exhibited a tendency towards secular de-\ncline; but in part it stems also from the shorter-run fluctuations around\nthe trend!\n\nTo a considerable extent, the source of fluctuations in export proceeds\n\u2014at least, from the standpoint of a single country\u2014is often believed to\nbe concentration on an unnecessarily narrow range of products for ex-\nport. There are many examples of so-called *one crop economies,\"\nsuch as Ghana (cocoa), Mauritius (sugar), and Sudan (cotton). It is\nsometimes argued that if these economies were to diversify their ex-\nports, their export earnings would exhibit a greater degree of stability\nover time.?5\n\nIn the present study an attempt is made to determine whether di-\nversification is likely to provide a greatly increased measure of stability\nin export earnings.* This is done by examining empirically, in a sample of\n\n* 'The author is a research economist at The RAND Corporation.

The author is indebted to RAND colleagues R. C. Kao, A. W. Marshall, and\nE.

Nevertheless, whatever the trend in export\nearnings may be, there are obvious advantages in reducing fluctuations around this trend.\nUncertainty and unreliability of annual foreign exchange earnings may well create complexi-\nties in development planning. Furthermore, fluctuations in exchange proceeds tend periodically\nto exert strains on the balance of payments, possibly resulting alternatively in inflationary and\ndeflationary pressures on the economy.\n\n? *Fluctuations in proceeds from particular exports are more serious if the country concerned\ncannot rely on an averaging of the price movements of many different types of goods\" (6, p. 9].\n\n53 The United Nations has noted, '*A high degree of specialization is often a result of small\n*economic size,' and is accompanied by a high degree of dependence on foreign trade, so that\nfluctuations in export proceeds have a devastating effect on the domestic economy\" (6, p. 10].\n\n^ Two recent publications which deal with related issues are Michael Michaely's book [3]\n\n47\n"

In a two-way\nclassification these are embodied, but the fact is of no significance. We then\nmove down to those changes requiring appreciable investment, which must be\nexpected to yield rates of return ranging from very high down toward zero.\n\nIf one seriously wished to measure the embodiment effects of having (say)\n$50 billion instead of $40 billion of gross investment a year, he would need\n(1) to specify the composition of the extra $10 billion in terms of types of\ncapital goods; and (2) to measure the quality improvement in these capital\ngoods. The first is difficult, the second, I have argued [3, pp. 229-34] and am\nconvinced, impossible.\n\nCalculations that assume (1) that quality improvement in capital is neces-\nsary for all productivity increase and (2) that quality improvement in (say)\nthe first $40 billion of gross investment is no larger, per dollar, than in the\nnext $10 billion, yield results that are, I believe, enormously too large. They\nare useful only because they yield such small numbers that we can deduce\nthat the true figures must be insignificant under normal circumstances in the\nUnited States.\n\nThere is an important reservation to universal application of the conclusion\nthat it makes little difference to analysis whether or not one takes account of\nembodiment e\u00edfects. It need not hold in countries where (or times when)\ncapital goods are used much longer than in the present-day United States\n(hence have more room for variation) or their age distribution is greatly\ndistorted and where (or when) tendencies toward equalizing rates of return\nare (or recently have been) extremely weak because of lack of competition\nor because of controls on investment. These conditions existed to a degree in\nthe United States in the immediate postwar years, their effects on short-term\nproductivity changes perhaps being important until around 1950. Because\nspecific investment controls during the war and wartime demand patterns\nprevented the introduction of new capital in the industries serving postwar\nmarkets, at war's end there presumably was a significant backlog of high-\nyielding investment opportunities deriving from improvement in capital goods.\nThis was reflected in a catching-up of productivity, particularly from 1948\nto 1950. Opportunities deriving from previous improvement in capital goods\nare therefore significant in examination of the early postwar period. A one-\nyear change in the true average age of equipment had a different effect then\nthan in normal times; and the change recorded by the available capital stock\nestimates probably understates the change in average age that actually took\n\nplace.*\nCTYTexanns DP oDeesrcemnmsM\n",

Moreover, a particular type\nof capital good acquired for replacement will be applied first to uses where\nthe gains from replacement are greatest. Also, the mix of capital goods, and\nconsequently the average quality change, varies greatly among industries;\nhence so does the average profitability of replacement of capital. Industries in\nwhich average quality of new capital goods changes most will, other things\nequal, have the highest replacement rate. Any reasonable amount of gross\ninvestment in the economy will already provide for taking up those investment\nopportunities arising because quality change in capital goods is large: i.e.,\nwithin firms and industries, large relative to all capital used; and, as among\nindustries, large relative to the average industry.\n\nIt follows that if we suppose $50 billion of investment in the economy will\nembody 25 per cent more technological progress than $40 billion\u2014an assump-\ntion which would be consistent with calculations made earlier based on average\nlives\u2014we shall have a radical overestimate. Within ranges of gross investment\nworth talking about\u2014that is, above some reasonable minimum, certainly\nabove the point of no net capital formation\u2014I should think the additional\namount of technological progress that will be incorporated into production at\na higher investment rate rather than a lower rate must be very small relative\nto the amount incorporated at the lower rate. We can legitimately take only\na small fraction of the .16 previously computed as the difference between the\n10-year growth rates if everything or nothing is embodied (given a one-year\nchange in average age) because that calculation assumed quality change on\nincremental investment to be the same as on average gross investment. AII\nthe calculations I have seen on embodiment effects assume the same rate of\nquality improvement for all capital goods, hence are great overestimates.*\n\nThe same reasoning disputes the importance of the idea that a high rate\nof gross capital formation is necessary in order to get radically improved\nequipment into use quickly so that, with experience in its use, further tech-\nnological advance will be accelerated. Any attention to rates of return will tell\nus that introduction of capital goods representing radical improvement over\nthose previously available will be made at even a low rate of gross capital\nformation. There may be cases of radically improved capital goods whose\nmerit is not obvious to potential buyers, so that attachment of a high risk\npremium makes their introduction marginal, but the point hardly deserves\nmuch weight.\n\nI have explained why the embodiment question appears to me unimportant\nin the United States at present. The same reasoning shows it would not be\nhelpful to know the fraction of \"technological progress\" that is, or must be,\nembodied. We are dealing not with a two-way classification but with a curve\nof rates of return. Some innovations (the purely unembodied) require no\ngross investment, and their introduction, if computed against capital cost\n(other costs may be involved), yields an infinite rate of return. Others (I\nsuspect a great many) require some trifling readjustment of existing capital\nor insignificant capital expenditure to achieve a substantial continuing gain;\nthese imply a near-infinite rate of return on capital if we compare the effects\n\n*In addition to Solow [7] and myself, I may refer specifically to W.

This is especially the case with equipment, for\nwhich the age level is short and observed variation small. Commerce Depart-\nment calculations [5, p. 17] based on Bulletin F lives give an average age for\nequipment of 7.2 years in 1961 and a range of 1.5 years during the period\nsince 1929. An alternate calculation based on assumed lives 20 per cent shorter\ngives an average age of 5.6 years and range of 1.2 years. Ranges even as large\nas these were possible only because of the extreme variation in gross capital\nformation due to the depression of the 'thirties and war.\n\nEquipment, quite reasonably, is usually stressed, but some attention is\ngiven to structures. Their age is longer and the range greater. If structures\nand equipment are weighted by value of gross stock (surely the maximum\nweight that can be assigned to structures), based on an average of 1929 and\n1961 weights in 1954 prices, extreme ranges of 2.6 and 3.6 years are given\nby the alternative estimates. Both extreme ranges include 1945. From 1929\nto 1961 the change was only .3 years by one estimate and 1.0 years by the\nother.?\n\nSuch data illustrate how insensitive is the age of equipment, and even of\nplant and equipment, to big swings in the rate of gross investment. Edmund\nPhelps has also shown that average age is independent of the equilibrium (or\naverage) level of capital formation and tends to return to an equilibrium\npoint, so that sustained changes are hard to obtain [6]. This is borne out by\nthe actual data.\n\nThe purpose of the present note is to argue that, though such calculations\nand considerations themselves assign no large importance to the embodiment\nquestion unless rates of technological progress well outside the bounds of\nexperience are assumed, they overstate its significance by what I should judge\nto be an enormous amount. To speak of technological progress embodied in\ncapital is simply to refer to changes in the quality of capital goods. The index\nof quality change in capital goods is the quotient of indexes of the quantity of\ncapital goods when capital of different vintages is equated (1) by ability to\ncontribute to production, and (2) by production cost at a common date.*\nOrdinary observation indicates that the amount of quality change in any\ntime period must vary enormously among di\u00edferent types of equipment or\nstructures, ranging from zero for many types of capital that aren't changed\nto huge amounts for a few types. The profitability of replacing any capital\ngood (or complex of capital goods) before it is physically worn out depends\ndirectly upon the extent to which its quality falls short of the quality of its\npotential replacement. If an industry invests $50 million, profit maximization\nwill lead it to replace those types of capital in which quality improvement\n(hence obsolescence) is greatest. An extra $10 million will go to capital in\n\n?'These average lives are computed from stock estimates derived by the perpetual inven-\ntory method. Lives were probably extended during the war, so the divergence between 1945\nand more normal periods is probably understated.\n\n* That is, quality change is the quotient of indexes of capital computed by methods 3\nand 1 in the language of an earlier article [3], where the meaning of these indexes is\nspecified more fully.\n",

                    "The Unimportance of the Embodied Question\n\nIn a recent article in this journal, Moses Abramovitz noted that Robert\nM. Solow and I obtain different estimates of the effect on economic growth of\nalternative investment rates because of different appraisals of the importance\nof embodiment of new knowledge in capital goods. Abramovitz suggested *'an\nissue of first-rate importance is, therefore, posed\" [1, p. 773]. Recent litera-\nture seems to imply that the issue can be resolved by discovering what fraction\nof developments that can potentially raise productivity must be embodied in\ncapital. I wish to suggest here that the whole embodiment question is of little\nimportance for policy in the United States; that the issue is not usefully\nformulated in terms of the fraction of progress that is embodied; and that the\nright question can't be answered beyond a showing that it s unimportant.\n\nThe argument that the question was of no great consequence that was\ngiven in my Sources of Economic Growth may be stated as follows [2, pp.\n234-37, 254-55]. The embodiment effect operates through the age distribution\nof the gross capital stock of business. This distribution can be summarized ac-\ncurately enough by average age, provided weights of different types of capital\ngoods (particularly structures and equipment) are held constant. Suppose\nthen the growth rate of output per man is 1.6 per cent a year, of which .6\nper cent is due to advances in knowledge (my estimates for the 1929-57\nperiod). Suppose we can change the average age by one year from 1960 to\n1970.* In so far as productivity-changing developments are embodied, we will\nthen be working in 1970 with the technology that we would be using in 1971\nif average age did not change. If nothing is embodied, the change in average\nage of capital will not affect output. If all advances of knowledge but not other\nproductivity-affecting developments are embodied, 1970 output will be .6\nper cent higher than if nothing is embodied and the 1960-70 annual growth\nrate .06 percentage points higher. If everything affecting output per man\nfavorably or unfavorably is embodied, 1970 output will be 1.6 per cent higher\nas a result of the reduced age of capital and the annual growth rate .16 per-\ncentage points higher. If half of either is embodied, the amounts will be half\nas large. After 1970 the growth rate will be the same as otherwise unless the\naverage age is again changed. Thus the most extreme assumptions yield\nannual growth rates, calculated over a ten-year period, that differ by .16\npercentage points for each year that the average age of capital changes; there-\nafter, for as long as the new average age is maintained, the levels of national\nincome differ by a constant 1.6 per cent.\n\nThe force of the calculations depends on the fact that average age is a\n\n!]f average age (and the rate at which knowledge advances) does not change between\ndates or assumed situations, the calculated growth rate is the same whether advances are\nor are not embodied in capital.\n",

Taking\nthe most worrisome unstable case where a neutralist country faces aid-giving\nbehavior that penalizes neutralism (the 4/-PN combination), it appears that\nthe function of multilateral aid or of aid from countries other than the two\nsuperpowers may well be to restore stability by stepping up aid from these\nsources as Thirdonia moves to neutralist ground. In this way the total aid\navailable to Thirdonia from all three sources of aid could approximate the\nNPN rather than the PN shape and stability would be restored. It is con-\nceivable that Usonia and Russonia, realizing the domestic policy constraints\nunder which they operate, find it difficult in their bilateral relations with\nThirdonia to adopt anything but the PN-type of aid-giving behavior; it would\nthen make good sense for them to foster deliberately multilateral aid or aid\nfrom other industrial countries in such a way as to compensate for their\ninability to make their own bilateral aid-giving behavior conform to the\nrequirements of stability.\n\nFinally, it might be tempting to analyze how the behavior of each of our\nthree principal actors is shaped by expectations about that of the other two.\nBut before the resulting complications are explored, it was perhaps worth\nwhile to show that a simple static model can account satisfactorily for a va-\nriety of real-life situations and can even yield some suggestions for policy.\n\nALBERT O.

This point was not clear.

There is one basic conceptual difference, however, between\nthe two studies, but apparently it does not lead to very different empirical\nresults. In the Ando and Modigliani study, net worth for the period is based\nupon the average price during the year; therefore, their measure of net worth\nfor the period zzcludes the impact of net worth changes due to price level\nmovements during the period, i.e., includes the gains for the period. My study\nexamines net worth based upon the price at the beginning of the year (4:4)\nand includes capital gains on this net worth (G;) as an explicit exogenous\nvariable in the consumption function. There are other minor differences in\ndefinitions and in the time covered by the data, but the basic difference lies\nin the inclusion in the consumption function of the capital gains variable and\nthe estimation of its impact upon consumption.

As a result, some of the\nevidence that has been taken to reflect economies of scale may in fact reflect\nthe accumulation of experience by long-established large firms and plants. If\nso, then available estimates of minimum optimal scale of production may be\nhigh; long-established, large firms and plants may have low unit costs because\nof their past output experience, not because of their present size.\n\nThe importance of \"progress functions\" as described here for the explana-\ntion of cost behavior within the plant and firm also carries implications for\nmacroeconomic analysis. Hirsch [5b, p. 155] has pointed out the relevance of\n\"Jearning\" considerations in the forecasting of cost and labor requirements on\nindustry-wide and economy-wide bases. In addition, progress in technique due\nto \"learning\" may need to be considered as a third variable, along with autono-\nmous technological progress and research and development activity, in explain-\ning changes in the aggregate production function and differences between rates\nof economic growth, both over time and between countries. The widely held\nview that the pattern of long-term economic change in the United States is\nmore largely due to the increasing productivity of the workforce than to in-\ncreasing capital per worker may be, in part, a macroeconomic reflection of the\n\"learning\" phenomenon. The existence and form of such relationships, if any,\nwill require careful investigation. As a beginning, the inclusion of accumulated\nproduction experience along with *scale\" and \"production technology\" as\ndeterminants of the efficiency of the fundamental production unit suggests the\npossibility of these macroeconomic effects and also suggests a resassuring\nsymmetry between the analysis of production in the small and in the large.\n\nLrr E.

Implications\n\nThe inclusion of both the cumulative level of output and the level of out-\nput per production period as significant variables in the explanation of the\nlevel of unit production costs has important implications for both teaching\nand research. Judging from current textbooks and casual observation, the\n\"learning\" phenomenon receives almost no mention in the standard treatments\nof production costs in economics or industrial engineering courses. This neg-\nlect of the principle of \"progress in technique\" in the classroom is reflected\nin the neglect of the differing ages and production histories, as well as sizes,\nof plants and firms in empirical studies of scale economies.

The production tech-\nnology was similar in all cases, and the five sets of data were reduced to a\nsingle series of cost-output observations for purposes of analysis. Output,\nunit cost, and unit labor cost on the initial production run for each piece of\nequipment were designated 100, and all subsequent cost and output values\nwere converted to an index on this basis. From examination of the data, it\nwas determined that the rising phase of the short-run cost curve would not be\nobserved with sufficient frequency to permit estimation.\n\nThe variables were defined as follows:\n\nX; \u2014 unit labor cost\n\nX;,'\u2014 unit total cost\n\nX; \u2014 lot size (i.e., the volume of output per production period)\nX; \u2014 cumulative quantity.\n\nBecause we do not know the exact shapes of the functions, for each of the\ncost variables three regressions were computed:\n\n(1) unit cost as a function of the logarithms of lot size and cumulative\n\noutput;\n\n(2) unit cost as a function of the inverse of lot size and cumulative output;\n\n(3) the logarithms of unit cost as a function of the logarithms of lot size\n\nand cumulative quantity.\n\nFive significant regression equations were obtained. In one regression (equa-\ntion 1a) the lot size variable proved to be insignificant.\n\nThe five equations, with standard errors and levels of significance of the\nregression coefficients and coefficients of multiple determination, are shown\nin Table 1. AIl of the regression coefficients are significant at the 5 per cent\nlevel or better, and all of the correlations obtained are high. As may be ob-\nserved from a direct comparison of the regression coefficients (because the\nvariables are measured in the same units) and from a comparison of the Beta\ncoefficients shown in Table 2, cumulative output is in all instances a more\npowerful explanatory variable than lot size. The increase in the Beta coeffi-\ncients for lot size in regressions 2b and 3b over the corresponding coefficients\nin regressions 2a and 3a indicates that the relative importance of lot size as\nan explanatory variable is greater for unit total cost than for unit labor cost;\nthe relative importance of cumulative quantity is correspondingly less. This\nresult indicates that the decline in unit costs attending the accumulation of\noutput over time is well described as a \"learning\" phenomenon; the accumu-\nlation of output experience is a more important explanation of changes in\nlabor costs than of changes in total costs.\n\n\"These results both confirm and extend those obtained by Hirsch. His analy-\nsis was cast entirely in terms of unit labor cost, and he found neither lot\nsize nor size of plant to be a significant variable [5a, p. 145].

                    "The *Life Cycle? Hypothesis of Saving: A Correction\n\nIn the March, 1963 issue of this Review, we presented an aggregate theory\nof consumer behavior based on considerations of households' life cycle of in-\ncome and of consumption needs, as well as some empirical tests.* At that\ntime, we were unaware of the existence of revised data on net worth of con-\nsumers prepared by Goldsmith and Lipsey.? We also had some numerical er-\nrors in adjusting the old, now obsolete, data by Goldsmith to fit our frame-\nwork. We have prepared new estimates of the basic parameters, using the\nrevised data by Goldsmith and Lipsey, and they are reported in Table A.\n\n!

                    "I. Reply to Campbell\n\nCampbell has raised two issues: (1) the elasticity of supply of oil lands\nand its relation to the extensive margin, and (2) the effect of uncertainty on\ncontractual rent payments. Space limitations in my article allowed me to\nmention these issues only obliquely and I am grateful for the opportunity now\nto elaborate on them.\n\nCampbell has set up a straw man only dimly related to my model. He pro-\nceeds to \"completely vitiate\" the \"strict version [straw man] of Davidson's\nconclusion\u2014that a subsidy will not increase exploration at all.\" This is not an\naccurate interpretation of my position, for I have stated that \"percentage\ndepletion does not significantly encourage the allocation of additional resources\nto exploring presently nonproductive oil lands . . . [it] is primarily an ad\nvalorem subsidy to mineral rights owners\" [3, p. 107, italics added; also see\npp. 102]. In other words, the present depletion policy is an inefficacious means\nfor encouraging the allocation of additional resources into the exploration of\noil lands.?\n\n! Campbell, however, misses the significance of the latter point, that is, that with lease\ncontracts and uncertainty, actual rent payments to landowners (which are based on ex ante\nrents) need not equal ex fost rents.\n\n? [nefficacious in the sense that most of the subsidy dollar goes to windfall rents and\nvery little remains to encourage producers to explore.\n",
                    "Public Policy Problems of the Domestic Crude Oil Industry:\nA Reply\n\nIn this reply, most of the space will be devoted to a discussion of Camp-\nbell's comment, for it indicates the necessity to elaborate some points of my\narticle, and it requires further discussion about the rate of exploration. Steele's\ncomment, on the other hand, is primarily based on what he believes to be the\nrelevant political, rather than economic, considerations. His argument lacks\nanalytical rigor and is, in fact, devoid of analytical content. (Moreover, his\nattempt to demonstrate \"imperfections in the mode of analysis [of my paper]\"\nsuffers from logical errors.) Given the space limitations, therefore, I will give\nonly brief consideration to some of the major deficiencies in Steele's argument\nat the end.\n",

She set out to explain mortality rates of different age groups by (1)\nthe percentage rate of growth of per capita income, (2) the percentage of\nlabor force outside of agriculture, and (3) the number of physicians per\n10,000 inhabitants. Neither consumption (per capita or otherwise) nor\ninvestment appears in her mortality regressions. Consequently, Mrs. Adelman\nhas not tested the possibility that I mentioned.\n\nShe further states that the flaw in my \"contention\" is that *even though\na higher rate of growth of per capita income is associated with a decrease\nin over-all consumption, it is also associated with an increase in the amount\nof consumer products accruing to the lower income groups. This decreases\nmortality among the laboring classes without a corresponding increase in\nthe mortality rate of upper income groups\" [1, p. 329]. I grant that this is\na possibility to be placed alongside my own. The point is, though, that,\ndespite her claim, Mrs. Adelman has tested neither one.\n\nHARVEY LEIBENSTEIN'*\n\n* The author is professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
