Thus a capital rich country exports capital intensive\nproducts. Leontief [13] applied the theorem to upset the popular no-\ntion that the United States exports capital intensive commodities.\nLeontief's input-output data show that America imports capital inten-\nsive commodities compared with American export goods. Heckscher\ndefined relative factor abundance by the pre-trade ratio of factor\nprices in the two countries. By definition capital is relatively cheaper in\nthe capital rich country before trade.

Money in the modern world,\nwhether central-bank money or commercial-bank deposits, has always been\nearned by the people holding it, and paid for in terms of resources that were\nthen made available to business and government to help national economic de-\nvelopment. In an expanding world, the demand for international reserves is\nalso expanding; and it makes good sense to fill this demand only against real\nresources that can contribute to development. At the same time, the newly cre-\nated Fund Obligations would be backed in this plan by the gold-guaranteed\ncurrencies of the developed countries\u2014an essential condition for establishing\nconfidence in an international paper money.\n\nThis advantage, however, comes at a price. For one thing, only developed\ncountries would be able to buy newly created reserves from the Fund; for an-\nother, they could only buy these reserves through the cumbersome machinery\nof budgetary appropriation subject to parliamentary or congressional approv-\nal. Both restrictions have their justification. The only excuse for creating new\nreserves is the economic possibility of creating something out of nothing; and\nthis is only possible when unemployed and re-employable resources are present.\nThere is no point, however, in creating additional products that nobody wants,\nand no justification for creating new reserves against payment in such prod-\nucts. This is why I propose to let the Fund create new reserves only against\nthe currencies of countries that can pay for these reserves in products that\ndeveloping countries want and need.\n\nAs to reliance on the budgetary process when a deficit country wants to\naugment its reserves, this is a way to remind the public that there is no easy\nway out of payments difficulties. Imports and foreign investments alike must\nbe paid for by exports; although there are times when these are easily spared\nand do not reduce domestic availabilities. Both these truths need to be stressed;\nand the budgetary process is the most likely to accomplish that. This is why\nit seems the best machinery for an orderly expansion of the world supply of\ninternational reserves and the best safeguard against inflation.\n\n\"This brings us to another apparent shortcoming of the plan: the tied nature\nof the aid, which is the counterpart of reserve creation. A tied gift, however, is\nvery different from a tied loan and free from the latter's shortcomings. The\nobjection to a tied loan is that it can be expensive. Interest and repayment that\nseem reasonable in money terms may prove exorbitant and usurious when the\ndebtor is forced to buy at the creditor's high prices. By contrast, a gift, even\na tied gift is unrequited generosity; and there is truth in the saying that one\nmust not look a gift-horse in the mouth.\n\nThe purpose of tying grants-in-aid is to confine their expansionary influence\nto the deficit country that has decided that its economy can afford the addi-\ntional exports and absorb the expansionary effects they entail. The tying of\naid therefore is a safeguard against the inflationary influence of reserve creation.\n\nIt is true that money is fungible and tying seldom 100 per cent effective. In\nthis case, however, there are two guaranties of reasonable effectiveness. One is\nthat such grants-in-aid would finance specific development projects and could\n", "1219\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "7": ["they usually regard a fellow developed country not so much as a market in\nwhich to buy as one in which to sell and as a competitor in third markets.\nThey are quite likely therefore to live happily with its currency overvalued.\nAs to the developing countries, as a group they would gain either way, per-\nhaps more from development aid than from a slight improvement in their\nterms of trade.\n\nHaving presented the bare bones of the plan and its economic justification,\nthere remains to be added its monetary mechanism, the money veil so to\nspeak. There are many different ways, of course, in which such a plan can be\nimplemented; the following is just one example among many, chosen primari-\nly for simplicity of exposition.\n\nCredit instruments (owned reserves) are preferable to credit, which is why\nthe newly created reserves should be instruments of indebtedness, internation-\nal paper money, issued by the IMF against the security of member countries\ncurrencies. These Fund Obligations could be created only on the initiative of\nthe countries desirous of obtaining them, though preferably subject to approv-\nal by the Fund. If a deficit country, such as the United States, wished to ob-\ntain, say, $1 billion additional reserves, her government would have to have\nthe corresponding appropriation in its budget, so as to be able to hand over to\nthe Fund $1 billion in U.S. currency. This would also have to carry a gold\nguaranty. Against the security of the U. S. currency, the Fund would issue $1\nbillion worth of Fund Obligations, which would ultimately become part of the\nU.S. external reserve, acceptable and usable as equivalent to gold by all mem-\nber countries of the Fund. (To assure this, central banks would have to be re-\nquired to hold Fund Obligations in prescribed minimum proportions to other\nreserves.) At first, however, the Fund Obligations would be restricted in use\nand handed over, not to the United States, but to the International Develop-\nment Association. The IDA would use them to finance investment projects of\ndeveloping countries approved by the IBRD's regular screening machinery as\ntechnically feasible and economically sound; but giving priority to projects\nleast likely to generate hard-currency earnings and therefore least suitable for\nfinancing by loans.\n\nFor the $1 billion would be used by IDA as grants-in-aid, not as loans.\nThey would not be repayable but could be spent only in the originating coun-\ntry (ie. the country against whose currency they were issued). In other\nwords, they would be \"tied gifts,\" although without restriction as to the\ncommodities on which they could be spent within the country specified.\n\nOnce the developing countries spent the $1 billion Fund Obligations in the\noriginating country (the United States), they would become unrestricted re-\nserves, as good as gold, spendable and acceptable in all member countries. The\ndelay with which the originating country would, under this arrangement, ob-\ntain the addition to her external reserves could be eliminated by the Fund's\nextending to her a line of credit repayable out of the new Fund Obligations as\nthese are spent in, and so reach, the originating country.\n\n\"This, in a nutshell, is the monetary side of functional international finance.\nThe link it establishes between the creation of international reserves and the\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "1218\n"], "6": ["their reserves and pay for them in products. The social cost of these, and\nhence of the reserves, depends on the state of the economy ; economists as well\nas the general public are likely to consider this cost prohibitive in inflationary\ntimes but worth paying and even beneficial in all others.\n\nAccordingly, the scheme as here outlined would enable deficit countries to\nobtain newly created reserves when there is unemployment but force them to\nmake payments adjustment when inflation threatens. It would also put indi-\nrect pressure on countries with payments surpluses and inflationary pressures\nto take the initiative in eliminating both.\n\nThis raises two questions. First, should not also surplus countries with un-\nemployed resources be allowed to obtain additional reserves on the terms here\noutlined and so enabled to raise employment levels? Second, is it right to\nmake newly created reserves available to countries with deficits and unem-\nployment at times when these are due to an overvalued currency that has\npriced the country out of world markets?\n\nThe answer to the first question is yes. If a surplus country prefers this way\nof raising employment or considers its reserves so small that it wants to add to\nthem faster than its surplus allows, there can be no objection to its buying\nmore reserves against products if it can do so without harming other countries\nand even while benefiting some. Tbis case may be quite important, because\ndeveloped countries will find it easier to maintain employment by extending\nforeign aid than by stimulating domestic investment whenever they lack the\namount and type of labor needed to man the new equipment that additional\ndomestic investment would create (cf. [2]).\n\nThe second question is tricky. One might argue that additional reserves\nshould be made available only to countries in temporary payments dif\u00fcculties;\nwhereas a permanent payments disequilibrium, and especially one due to\nmisalignment of price levels, should be remedied by exchange-rate readjust-\nment. The principle of functional finance, however, may well give a different\nanswer.\n\nAn overvalued currency often leads to both underemployment and pay-\nments difficulties; but the country may nevertheless be reluctant to devalue its\ncurrency, for fear not only of losing face but also of worsening its terms of\ntrade. Here is a real cost of exchange-rate readjustment, which must be\nweighed against the cost of producing the goods that would buy the new re-\nserves needed if exchange rates were kept unchanged. This, we argued earlier,\ninvolves no social cost at a time of underemployment\u2014at lezst not in the\nshort run. In the long run, other ways of raising the level of employment must\nalso be considered; and, weighed against such alternatives, the opportunity\ncost of buying reserves with development aid is quite likely to be positive.\nWhether this cost will be greater or smaller than the cost of worsened terms of\ntrade cannot be determined a priori; there might well be situations in which\nthe country would prefer to keep its currency overvalued indefinitely and\nfinance the resulting payments deficit out of newly created reserves paid for\nby products. There remains the question how the outside world would view\nsuch preference and behavior on the part of the deficit country.\n\nOther developed countries would probably accept and even prefer it. For\n", "1217\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "5": ["put than their nominal value. Nevertheless, the recipient country should not\nbe made to pay more than their nominal value for the new reserves, because\nthere are also other and usually cheaper ways of curtailing foreign payments:\ntrade restriction and administrative controls.\n\nWhen, for lack of reserves, a country curtails its imports through duties,\nquotas, or administrative controls, the consequent loss is the value of the im-\nports foregone, plus the nuisance value and inefficiency such measures entail.\nThese latter costs, though real, are intangible and difficult to measure; and\nthey may well be offset by the beneficial side effects of import restriction: the\nstimulus to and protection of domestic production. As a first approximation\ntherefore, the loss created by import restriction may be said to be no more or\nnot much more than the value of the imports foregone. Here, then, is the\njustification for selling newly created reserves to the country in need neither\nfor more nor for less than the nominal value of the reserves.\n\nAnother argument for exacting payment in products for newly created re-\nserves is that it maintains the deficit countries! balance-of-payments discipline\nfor the occasions when this is necessary. It may seem paradoxical to argue for\nbalance-of-payments discipline and adjustment and for reserve creation at the\nsame time. After all, the latter's purpose is to avoid the need for adjustment.\nPayments adjustment, however, must not and cannot always be avoided; and\nan ideal system of international payments will both minimize the need for ad-\njustment and encourage and facilitate it when adjustment is required.\n\nThis combination of trying both to avoid adjustment when unnecessary and\nto encourage it when called for is the Scylla and Charybdis on which past re-\nforms have foundered. It seems very hard to provide reserves or extend credit\nto a deficit country without weakening its will to make payments adjustment\nin the future. Conditional credits seemed at one stage the solution to the di-\nlemma; but they too proved a broken reed. Vet, this will must be preserved in\na world where payments adjustment is often necessary, always painful, and\nwhere the pain can only be mitigated by dividing the burden of adjustment\nbetween deficit and surplus countries.\n\nIt is true that the deficit countries have for many years carried the main\nburden of adjustment, which makes one wonder if concern to preserve their\nwill to adjust is not misplaced or exaggerated. But the reason why they did\nmost of the adjusting in the past was the world's defiationary bias, with more\nunemployment in the world than inflationary pressure. If new reserves are cre-\nated as here proposed, they will not only relieve many deficits but eliminate\nmuch of the deflationary bias as well. In fact, my proposal may be regarded as\nan extension of Keynesian policy into the international sphere. While Keynes\nwanted to increase the supply of national moneys in order to lower interest\nrates and so stimulate investment and employment, I am proposing to increase\nthe supply of international reserves in order to eliminate restrictive national\npolicies when these lead, or threaten to lead to unemployment.\n\nIf there were no deflationary bias in the world, the surplus countries would\nbe under much more pressure to eliminate their surpluses; and for them to\nbear the main burden of adjustment in an inflationary world would be just as\nbad as its opposite. This is why the deficit countries must be made to earn\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "1216\n"], "4": ["revaluation, by temporarily liberalizing imports, by special taxes on foreign\ntourists or foreign capital, to mention just the more agreeable weapons in the\nsurplus country's armory. By eliminating their surpluses, the surplus countries\neliminate also the deficit countries! deficits and thereby prevent their needing,\nand causing the creation of additional reserves.\n\nUnder this plan therefore new reserves could be created only when there are\ncountries with surpluses and deficit countries with unemployed resources. (See,\nhowever, p. 1217 below for an exception.) Since the new reserves would be\nmade available primarily to deficit countries and only against products, these\ncountries domestic and external troubles would be relieved at the same time.\nThe products, obtained against and representing the real counterpart of the\nnewly created reserves, become the unrequited imports of the developing\ncountries, which can always use the right kind of imports from industrial\ncountries with benefit to their economies.\n\nThe one seemingly arbitrary element in this scheme is the transfer of prod-\nucts from deficit to developing countries; and the equality of their value to\nthat of the new reserves created (they could just as well be half or twice as\ngreat in value).\n\nThis latter, however, also has its justification. To provide a country with\nnew reserves and thereby allow it to run a deficit without drawing down either\npreviously earned reserves or subsequently repayable credits amounts to giv-\ning that country something for nothing. This can be done without a corre-\nsponding loss to other countries only when its acquisition of these new re-\nserves goes hand in hand with the production of output that would not be pro-\nduced otherwise. The best way to assure this is to require the country that\nwants additional reserves to surrender in exchange products at least equal in\nvalue; and it is a matter of equity to make these available to those most in\nneed.\n\nThe deficit country, however, which obtains the new reserves, is enabled to\nraise its output (or avoid restricting it) by an amount much larger than its\nnew reserves. For its new reserves enable it to make foreign payments in equal\namount; and these would equal only the additional imports resulting from the\nmuch larger increase in aggregate income and output.\n\nThe difference between the additional output and that part of it which is\nsurrendered in exchange for the reserves obtained resembles a Marshallian\nsurplus and is a net gain to the deficit country. Hence the question whether\nthis gain should be allowed to accrue to the deficit country or whether instead\nit should be transferred, wholly or partly, to the developing countries? In\nother words, should not $1 million of newly created reserves be sold at a price\nhigher than $1 million worth of products? To answer this question it is best\nto ask first what would happen if the country in need of reserves would not be\nable to obtain them. It would then have to curtail its foreign payments by a\nlike amount, which it could do by restricting aggregate output by a larger\namount: larger in the ratio of the reciprocal of its marginal propensity to im-\nport. If this were the only way to curtail foreign payments, additional reserves\nthat made the curtailment unnecessary would be worth more in terms of out-\n", "1215\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["might restore balance-of-payments equilibrium, which, he said, is not what we\nwant\u2014certainly not what we need and ought to want. His argument was that,\nover the past 15 years, the Western European countries (not to mention\nJapan) had a very fast rate of growth, unprecedented in Europe; and that\nthis had much to do with their balance-of-payments surpluses, since it was\nbased on export-oriented expansion, which in these countries is more feasible\nthan the expansion of domestic markets, which inevitably increases competi-\ntion at home. Their payments surpluses in turn were made possible by the per-\nsistent payments deficit of the United States, which she did not seem to mind\nas long as the outside world did not object, and which did not cramp her style\nof growth either during most of this time. Dollar devaluation might bring to\nan end this perfectly satisfactory state of affairs by worsening (eliminating\nthe surplus in) the European and Japanese balances of payments. He hoped\nthat we would be able to do better than that\u2014devise some means whereby the\nEuropeans and Japanese could continue their surpluses, we our deficits, and\nall of us our fast rates of growth.\n\nLet us now try to devise such a system. Deficit countries should certainly\nnot be put under pressure to improve their balances of payments by means of\nrestrictive policies that would lower either the level or the efficiency of em-\nployment of their resource capacity, and so inflict a net loss on the world as a\nwhole. Instead, additional international reserves should be created to accom-\nmodate these countries, but made available to them only in exchange for\ngoods and services. To exact payment in products for the newly created re-\nserves is to guarantee that they will be claimed, created and used only when,\nand only to the extent that unemployment or inefficiency exists in the recipient\ncountries or would be created if such reserves were not available. For the so-\ncial cost of the products paid for the new reserves is zero or less than zero at\ntimes of underemployment (or when the alternative to producing them is to\ncreate underemployment) ; whereas it is quite high and likely to be considered\nprohibitive at times when their production would create or aggravate in-\nflationary pressures. At such times therefore the deficit countries would fear\nthe inflationary pressures of the payment exacted for the new reserves; and,\nrather than obtain these, they would choose to eliminate the deficit through\nrestrictive fiscal and monetary policies, more appropriate also to the domestic\nneeds of the economy.\n\nThe products surrendered in exchange for the newly created reserves would\nbe available to fill part of the development needs of the developing countries;\nand their composition would have to be suitable for this purpose\u2014a restric-\ntion that will be discussed further.\n\nThe creation of additional liquidity, and its injection into the system\nthrough deficit countries short of reserves, would enable surplus countries to\ncontinue their surpluses if they wished to. At the same time, they could also\neliminate their surpluses\u2014and simultaneously slow or prevent the creation of\nadditional liquidity\u2014if they found either their surpluses or their reserves ex-\ncessive. A surplus country can always eliminate its surplus if it wants to (and\nmuch more easily than a deficit country can eliminate its deficit), by exchange\n", "1214\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "2": ["more pertinent example of this art is public works to relieve unemployment,\nsince these create something, a bridge, or a post office, or tidily raked leaves,\nwhose social cost is nothing or less than nothing, zero or negative.\n\nIf we must have a moral doctrine to govern our economic affairs, a much\nbetter one would be that no country be required to give up anything without\nreceiving something, an adequate quid pro quo in exchange. This is a much\nless restrictive rule, more acceptable also to the economist; and we shall explore\nits implications in the following.\n\nThe economist has no business to accept unquestioningly and to regard as\nself-evident dogma the desirability of long-run equilibrium in the balance of\npayments. There are times and situations when payments balance is, indeed,\ndesirable; but its desirability must be established by economic argument and\nnot treated as a premise. The functional approach to international finance is to\nforget about payments equilibrium in the long as well as in the short run and\nto ask instead whether it might not be possible to let each country have the\nkind of balance of payments that best serves its domestic goals whatever these\nmay be: price stability, fast growth, full employment, or some combination or\ncompromise of these.\n\n\"The reason, I suspect, why no one so far has bothered to ask this question\nis that the answer obviously is no. It is obviously not possible to let every\ncountry have the balance of payments it needs or wants. The developing coun-\ntries for example would probably show an insatiable appetite for payments\ndeficits; and even according to the conservative estimate of a banker, Mr.\nWoods, president of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Develop-\nment, they could absorb another $4.5 billion of unrequited imports per\nannum. But if it is impossible to satisfy every country, might there not be a\ncompromise? There are deficit countries, such as the United States today, that\nmake insufficient use even of their own resources and certainly do not need,\nand do not want, unrequited resources from abroad. And there are surplus\ncountries that are happy with their surpluses, or at least not unhappy enough\nto try to eliminate them. Could not a system of international payments be de-\nvised to accommodate at least these countries? And if, in the process, some of\nthe developing countries' desire for unrequited imports can also be satisfied, so\nmuch the better.\n\nA plan to achieve this will be presented in the following. It will call for the\ncreation by a reformed International Monetary Fund of international paper\nmoney, to be made available to developed countries with unemployed\nresources against their national currencies to be held as security by the IMF,\nand against real resources to be given as grants to developing countries. But\nbefore discussing the detail of this plan, we shall first state its principles and\nshow how they follow from the requirements of functional finance and the new\nmoral doctrine enunciated on the preceding page. It is also worth noting here\nthat the need for some such plan was first stated by a very practical and pol-\nicy-oriented expert in the field.\n\nRichard Cooper has argued, in contrast to most international-trade theo-\nrists, against the devaluation of the dollar (cf. [1]). He was afraid that this\n", "1213\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "1": ["A New Approach to International Liquidity*\n\nAlmost a quarter century ago, Professor Abba Lerner advocated a revolu-\ntionary new doctrine he named functional finance. The gist of it was that pub-\nlic spending and taxation should be governed exclusively by the goals of full\nemployment and price stability, without regard to whether the budget was\nbalanced. At the time, this doctrine looked like Lerner at his wildest\u2014today it\nis fiscal orthodoxy not only in the classroom but in many treasuries and minis-\ntries of finance as well.\n\nThe idea can be extended into the international sphere. There is a lively\ndiscussion going on today of whether or not the supply of international liquid-\nity is adequate; and if not, what would constitute an adequate level. There is\nmuch disagreement and little hope of its ever being resolved. All parties to the\nargument, however, seem to agree on one thing: if the supply of liquidity were\nto be brought to what is considered an adequate level, all would wish to keep\nit stable at that level, or, at the most, increase it at an annual rate of three per\ncent\u2014which is the limit to which respectable economists are willing to stretch\nthe meaning of the word stable, as a concession to the realities of our ex-\npanding universe. The reason why the warring factions can agree on this one\npoint is that they all believe in the desirability of balancing, in the long run,\nthe balance of payments. Disagreement on how large a supply of liquidity is\nadequate is disagreement on how long the long run should be. AIl economists\nseem to agree that in the long run, however defined, each country shou!d\nmaintain balance-of-payments equilibrium.\n\nLet me point out first of all that this is a moral doctrine. Our moral con-\nscience tells us that it is not rigAit for anyone or any country to get something\nfor nothing\u2014although that, precisely, is what an indefinite balance of pay-\nments deficit implies. If the deficit is on the current account of the balance of\npayments, there is the further connotation that the country lives beyond its\nmeans and spends more than it earns, with all the moral disapprobation that\nthis calls forth. It is all right to run a deficit temporarily, in an emergency,\nand as long as one's reserves allow; but people consider it morally imperative\nthat these reserves be finite and either of the kind that have been earned be-\nforehand or of the kind that must be repaid afterwards. This is the puritan\nethic of international trade. What is wrong with it?\n\nWhat is wrong with it, I think, is that it is ethics rather than economics.\nNot only is it perfectly good economics occasionally to get something for\nnothing; it is or should be one of the economist's main preoccupations. It is,\nindeed, the subject matter of welfare economics. To move from a non-optimal\nto a Pareto-optimum situation is the art of getting something for nothing.

To Working, the magnitude of this premium\nwas in general not a function of either the expected size or the expected\ntiming of the forthcoming harvest: * . . . the price of May wheat (in April,\nlet us say) is above the price of wheat for September delivery because the\nlast crop was small (perhaps the carryover from still earlier crops was small\nalso, contributing to the effect).

Wharton [9] [10] stresses this\npoint and then, as have other commentators on the subject, condemns the awarding of\n\"second class\" degrees to those from abroad. Wharton's policy prescription is to assist\nforeigners to achieve the same level of attainment by spending longer on their education.\nThere may, however, be a role to be played by \"half-trained\" economists; using Friedman's\nanalogy in discussing the training of doctors and lawyers [2, p. 153], the developing countries\nprobably cannot afford only \"Cadillac\" economists. Certainly some American colleges employ\nteachers without the highest level of training. Perhaps the policy solution is more \"labels\"\nrather than more training.\n", "faculty at these schools are foreign-born.

Eight of these 18 departments appear on Cartter's list of the\ncountry's leading 20 [1]. In fact, of all foreign graduate students in econom-\nics in 1964-65, 40 per cent were enrolled at the leading 20 institutions.\n\nOfficials of the leading departments reported to the author that in the past\nthe mean academic performance of foreign graduate students in economics has\nbeen poorer than that of U.S. students, and the dispersion of the foreigners'\nrecords has also been greater. Table 3 gives a breakdown on enrollment and\ndegrees for 98 departments of economics as a group, and for 18 departments of\nagricultural economics. This information suggests that, at least in regard to\nearning degrees, foreigners do about as well in graduate schools as domestic\nstudents. For example while 27 per cent of the present Master's candidates are\nfrom abroad, foreigners received 30 per cent of the Master's degrees between\n1959 and 1964. For doctoral candidates the situation is that 25 per cent of the\nstudents are foreign and between 1959 and 1964 foreigners received 20 per\ncent of the degrees. In the past, however, the proportion of doctoral candi-\ndates from overseas was smaller than it is today; adjustment for the lag would\nshow that foreigners have also been about as successful as Americans in earn-\ning the Ph.D. degree.*\n\nThe data in Table 2 suggest that at some schools foreigners have been less\nsuccessful than Americans in earning the doctorate. A comparison of enroll-\nment and degrees is, however, less accurate for a single institution than for a\ngroup. At the 20 leading departments 28 per cent of the enrolled doctoral can-\ndidates are foreign; between 1959 and 1964 students from abroad earned 26\nper cent of the Ph.

Today with roughly\none out of every four advanced students being foreign, economics is as a disci-\npline second only to agriculture in the percentage of its graduate candidates\nwho come from abroad.\n\nWhile the number of graduate students in economics from all areas of the\nworld has risen in recent years, the most rapid growth has been in students\nfrom Africa and Latin America. Table 1 shows the number of students coming\nfrom the world's principal regions and separately for countries with 35 or\nmore graduate students in economics.

The percentage going back to Korea is not much larger.\nOther countries with a substantial \"loss\" of students include India, Iran,\nEgypt, Lebanon, Pakistan, Greece, Colombia, Argentina, and Ecuador [3].\nNo separate information is available for economists? but anyone who has vis-\nited the campuses of the smaller colleges is aware that a substantial number of\n\n*During the decade 1945-54 over half the foreign graduate students in economics were\ntrained at 10 institutions.\n\n*'There is still considerable concentration of foreign students at particular schools; half\nthe foreign economics students were enrolled at 18 institutions in 1964-65. But out of 170\nuniversities offering graduate work in economics, 153 reported at least one foreigner enrolled.\n\n*In 1964-65 graduate students in economics came from 109 countries. During the decade\n1945-54, 40 per cent of foreign students in economics came from European and North\nAmerican universities; in 1964-65 only 20 per cent came from these two areas.\n\n* The data on students in economics are available only for recent years. The rate reported\nis for the three-year period 1961-64 and is based on special tabulations prepared by the\nInstitute of International Education.\n\n\" This rate is for the three-year period 1960-63 and is taken from the annual reports\nof [7].\n\n* These figures exaggerate the numbers coming annually from India, China, Korea, and\nthe United Arab Republic.

Foreign\nstudents inevitably raise problems for the universities. While the problems are\nnot different in kind, they are certainly exaggerated in degree from those asso-\nciated with training Americans. It is harder to interpret and compare creden-\ntials of foreign applicants; to find adequate financing for foreign students who\nare frequently unable to draw upon personal funds because of currency regu-\nlations, and whose employment opportunities in the United States are re-\nstricted by law; to design courses with content and level appropriate for stu-\ndents of diverse backgrounds; to teach people whose comprehension of En-\nglish is imperfect; and to find topics suitable and faculty able to supervise dis-\nsertations for those who wish to work on problems of their own countries.\n\nAs recently as a decade ago these difficulties, at least as regards depart-\nments of economics, were largely confined to a small group of universities\n\n''This is the rate of growth for the decade 1954-1964.

If investment decisions are made within an\nextended family unit, then little if any distinction is made between capital\nand labor income. Consequently, this type of unit can be expected to com-\npare the change to its total product by adding more capital with the margi-\nnal cost of doing so. Thus fx, not r, is the relevant decision-making variable,\nand no special problem is introduced by the divergence of fx and r owing to\nlabor-surplus conditions.\n\nOn the other hand, if the investment decision is made by a landlord who\n(1) has alternate investment opportunities, (2) is committed to paying the\ntraditional real wage, and (3) is unwilling or unable to control L, then r is\nclearly relevant, not fx. If ro is the opportunity cost of investing in his agri-\ncultural enterprise, then a rise in labor from L, to L4 may induce him to\nallow his agricultural capital to depreciate and invest elsewhere. Alterna-\ntively, he may raise his rate of return by more investment, restoring r to ro.\nBut surely it is not clear that a falling rate of return will induce a higher rate\nof investment.\n\nVarious tenant and sharecropping arrangements bring both fx and r into a\njoint decision-making process too involved to analyze here. Nevertheless,\nperhaps enough has been said to suggest that the labor-surplus assumption\nmay imply private investment behavior in the labor-surplus sector which\ncould lead to underinvestment in agriculture, a fall in the industrial terms of\ntrade with agriculture, and a consequent retardation of the development\n\nprocess.\nTDu---4\u2014- \u00c0 NT.\n"], "2": ["FiGURE d\n", "prvuMuveaud\nLo\n25 AL.\n0\n\nThe wage bill is OLoH\u00fc and capital's rent is the shaded \"'triangle,\" E.

Moreover,\nan exogenous rise in the labor force (e.g., due to higher birth or survival\nrates) will drive down the private return to capital while its social product\nrises. Conversely, an increase in capital employed with a given labor force\nwill raise its private return although its marginal social product fails.\n\nThis \"perverse\" effect is illustrated in Figure 1.

At-\ntempts to refine these empirical production functions to bring them closer to\nthe physical production functions of the classroom have led to a mass of\nliterature.

Alternate Censoring Rules and their Deficiencies\n\nThe K-M censoring rule is misleading because it asserts that, whenever a\nnumber of machines have the same output per labor hour, the best choice is\nnecessarily the machine which has the lowest price and involves the least\ninvestment outlay.! To escape the bias this efficiency criterion imparts to\nthe production model, an alternate rule is needed. One possibility is to base\nthe selection of technical alternatives on a comparison of machine-tool\nprices with the corresponding present values which can be estimated for the\nseparate tools.? The latter approach permits choices to be made from the\nstandpoint of optimization over time. Thus, reasonable weight can be given\nto factors which operate throughout the whole life of a capital asset and\ninfluence its effective economic contribution to the firm?\n\nThe use of the present-value concept may help to resolve one difficulty,\nbut immediately raises another. Obviously, the present value attached to\nany machine tool depends on the expectations held concerning the economic\nenvironment in which the input will perform. However, since different ob-\nservers are almost certain to see future technical and market developments\n\n1 Thus, any quality of a machine which tends to raise its supply price, without simultane-\nously altering its one-period productivity, must be viewed as undesirable.\n\n? There are, of course, problems connected with the use of the present value approach. In\ngeneral, machines will involve different investment costs and have different lifespans; thus,\nadditional assumptions about the investment plan are necessary to insure comparability of\nthe alternatives. Further, questions arise about replacement policy and the extent of the\nplanning period.\n\n3 One implication is that choice of relatively high-priced machines is conceivable. The pro-\nduction function obtained need not be shaped by the odd strategy of investment minimization.\n", "Engineering Production Functions and Capital-Labor\nSubstitution in Metal Machining: Reply\n\nA point of universal agreement is that the production function of pure\ntheory raises the most difficult problems for empirical work. If the concept is\ninterpreted rigorously, an impasse is reached because the set of efficient\ntechnical alternatives for the typical commodity is virtually limitless and,\nhence, incapable of capture by any practical econometric technique. Pro-\nfessor Lave has emphasized, correctly, the need for empirical studies to\nfocus on what is, in effect, a fariial production function\u2014i.e., a function\ndefined subject to a series of price conditions and able to show some subset\nof the efficient alternatives. However, as the Kurz-Manne paper [3] makes\nclear, the introduction of prices does not eliminate all difficulties; indeed,\nnew problems arise which seem almost as intractable as those from which\nescape is sought.

Microeconomic\ntheory is concerned with allocative efficiency. Empirical evidence has\nbeen accumulating that suggests that the problem of allocative efficien-\ncy is trivial. Yet it is hard to escape the notion that efficiency in some\nbroad sense is significant. In this paper I want to review the empirical\nevidence briefly and to consider some of the possible implications of\nthe findings, especially as they relate to the theory of the firm and to\nthe explanation of economic growth. The essence of the argument is that\nmicroeconomic theory focuses on allocative efficiency to the exclusion\nof other types of efficiencies that, in fact, are much more significant in\nmany instances. Furthermore, improvement in *nonallocative efficien-\ncy\" is an important aspect of the process of growth.\n\nIn Section I the empirical evidence on allocative efficiency is pre-\nsented. In this section we also consider the reasons why allocation\ninefficiency is frequently of small magnitude. Most of the evidence on\nallocative inefficiency deals with either monopoly or international\ntrade. However, monopoly and trade are not the focus of this paper.\nOur primary concern is with the broader issue of allocative efficiency\nversus an initially undefined type of efficiency that we shall refer to as\n* X-efficiency.\" The magnitude and nature of this type of efficiency is\nexamined in Sections II and III.

This conclusion is not justified,\nfor long distributed lags in investment response can exist without caus-\ning comparable lags in the response of aggregate demand to changes in\nthe money supply. The lags and parameter values in other sectors of\nthe economy have fully as much influence as those in investment in\ndetermining the dynamics of the system. In particular, lags in the\nmoney-demand function tend to counteract, rather than reinforce, the\ninvestment lags. In tbis paper, a dynamic Keynesian income model\ncharacterized by distributed lags in the behavioral equations is analyzed\nto demonstrate this point.\n\nOne of the crucial questions for monetary policy is the question of\nSpeed of adjustment, of how rapidly production and income respond to\nchanges in the money supply. At issue is whether attempts at counter-\ncyclical management of the money supply are stabilizing or destabiliz-\ning, for monetary policy may, in fact, aggravate business cycles if its\neffects are mostly felt many months after money-supply changes occur.\nOne of the economic mechanisms through which a change in the money\nsupply is thought to influence real national income operates through the\ninterest rate. Investors base their spending decisions in part, according\nto this Keynesian argument, on the current and expected future levels\nof interest rates. When these change in response to a money-supply\nchange, then investment also changes, inducing a corresponding change\nin consumption spending. Clearly, then, one factor of major importance\nto the question of the speed of monetary policy is the speed with which\ninvestment spending responds to interest rate changes.\n\nIn recent econometric studies of investment the most satisfactory\nresults have often been obtained with models in which investment re-\n\n* 'The author, assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago, is indebted to\n\nthe members of the Workshop in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics at the University\nof Chicago for their suggestions on an earlier draft of this paper.\n"}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Donald P.

The question\nto be answered is, to put it simply, *If U.S. corporations paid $1 million more\nin dividends to individual stockholders, how much of this $1 million would be\npaid to the Internal Revenue Service by these stockholders?\"\n\n\"This tax rate was desired for a number of reasons. First, it could be useful\nin the formulation of dividend policy by publicly-owned corporations. Second,\nit could measure the effect of personal taxation on the cost of retained earn-\nings in cost-of-capital calculations.? Third, it could be useful in forecasting the\nmacroeconomic effects of changes in total dividend payments. Fourth, it might\nbe of interest to those formulating national income tax laws.\n\nA second objective of this study is to determine the \u00a3rend in the marginal\ntax rate. It was not clear to the author whether increasing dividends and in-\ncreasing incomes would raise the weighted average, or whether these would be\noffset by a slowly increasing proportion of dividends being paid to stockhold-\ners in the lower tax brackets.\n\nThird, during this study the United States Congress revised the tax laws,\neliminating the 4 per cent dividend tax credit and reducing income tax rates,\n\nJThroughout this article \"tax\" refers to federal income tax.

Conclusions\n\nThree major conclusions follow from the analysis in this paper: (1) the\nabsolute dispersion of wage changes is a statistical artifact; (2) in comparing\ntwo different sets of industries, the level of aggregation affects the amount\nof measured dispersion, yet comparability is difficult to obtain or even\n\n35 For example, does the 4-digit industry Farm Machinery and Equipment\" (SIC-3522)\nrepresent the same level of aggregation as the 4-digit industry Motor Vehicles and Parts\"\n(SIC-3717), or the 3-digit industry Motor Vehicles and Motor Vehicle Equipment\" (SIC-\n371), or the 2-digit industry \"Transportation Equipment\" (SIC-37)?\n\nM This problem arises even when the dispersion for a group of 2-digit industries is examined\nat different points in time to determine whether the advent of unionism has reduced inter-\nindustry wage change dispersion. Tbis technique has been employed by J. E. Maher [5]\nwho finds that coefficients of variation in manufacturing have risen rather than declined since\nthe growth of unionism in the 1930's. While this would appear to contradict the spillover\nhypothesis, the aggregation issue makes it difficult to interpret this evidence.\n", "ou;\nige\n\nNumber of observations)\nurables:\n\nX)X100\nge\n\"ufacturing\n\nX)X100\nge\n", "3.84\n16.2\n23.705\n\n6.4-22.1\n53\n", "16.597;\n11.8-22.5\n66\n", "2.62\n16.0\n", "18.705\n9.1-23.0\n79\n", "3.06\n16.4\n", "] deviation)\nfic mean)\n"], "7": ["499\n", "COMMUNICATIONS 499\n\nestablishment basis or on the basis of a collection of establishments cor-\nresponding to a particular aggregation procedure. In general, a smaller\ninterindustry variance will be observed if the observation unit is defined\nin terms of, say, the 2-digit industrial classification than if it were defined\nby, say, the 3-digit classification. Measures of dispersion vary systematically\nwith the aggregation level because aggregation averages out, so to speak,\nrandom errors.! In terms of the interindustry variance of wage changes,\nthis relationship between aggregation and dispersion is verified by the avail-\nable data, which indicate that the aggregation effect is quantitatively im-\nportant.\n\nPercentage changes in average hourly earnings over the period 1958-63\nwere computed for three industry groups\u2014durable manufacturing, non-\ndurable manufacturing, and nonmanufacturing, which includes trade,\ntransportation, services, etc. The interindustry variance is computed for\neach industry group at the 2-, 3-, and 4-digit level whenever sufficient data\nare available.? The standard deviation for each of the three sectors at each\nof the three levels of aggregation is shown in Table 1. Also shown in the\ntable are the arithmetic mean of wage changes, the coefficient of variation\n(the standard deviation divided by the mean times 100), and the range.\n\nThe statistics in Table 1 highlight the main argument of this section.\nFor each of the three sectors\u2014durables, nondurables, and nonmanufactur-\ning\u2014both the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation, a measure\nof relative dispersion, decline in magnitude as the level of aggregation in-\ncreases. In the durable-goods sector, for example, the standard deviation\nis about 50 per cent larger when computed on the basis of a 4-digit industry\nclassification than when computed at the 2-digit level. The absolute size\nof the variance is a statistical artifact and the notion of an absolutely small\ndispersion is either meaningless or not very helpful.\n\nThe data in Table 1 also reveal an inherent difficulty in testing the spill-\nover hypothesis by comparing interindustry variance between two sectors,\none in which spillovers are alleged to operate and one in which they do not.\nIt is suggested frequently that the extensively unionized durable-goods\nsector is a spillover domain. Assuming that spillovers reduce variance, which\ncoefficients of variation (or other measures of dispersion) are to be com-\npared? It is not at all obvious that wage dispersion at the 2-digit level in\nthe durable sector should be compared to its counterpart in the nondurable\nor nonmanufacturing sector. It may be no less appropriate to compare 2-\ndigit durables with, say, 3- or 4-digit nondurables than with 2-digit non-\ndurables.

In general, 52,70 and, conse-\nquently, $3.52 S2.\n\n** Because A. M. Ross [7] and others assert that the durable sector is a single spillover do-\nmain, this sector has been isolated in computing the variances.

The wage relationship\nbetween the ith and jth sectors is \"derived\" from a political influence\ntheory which suggests that traditional economic variables are to be supple-\nmented, or in some cases supplanted, by additional spillover variables if a\ncomplete explanation of wage movements is to be obtained.

Market Wage Determination and Wage Change Dispersion\n\nThe implications of the traditional market hypothesis for interindustry\nwage change dispersion will first be examined, and then compared with\nthose of a spillover model of wage determination. The market theory of\nthe wage determination process asserts that, for a particular industry, wage\nchanges will reflect variation in underlying labor demand and supply con-\nditions. According to traditional economic theory, the demand by the ith\nindustry for any factor of production, including labor, is a function of the\nprices of all other inputs, technology, and the relevant variables of the\nproduct-demand schedule. The supply of labor to the ith industry is a\nfunction of the wage rate in that industry and the alternative wage rates\nfor labor of comparable skill offered by other industries.

The chief fault in Turvey's\notherwise excellent paper is that he does not clearly state the relation be-\ntween these critical assumptions and his conclusions for public policy. It\nshould be useful to examine in more detail exactly which conditions must\nbe present for one or the other of these regulations to in fact be necessary\nfor a Pareto-optimum.\n\nIt is well known that if institutions are such that technological external-\nities are present, competitive equilibrium will not be Pareto-optimal. Tur-\nvey states that two kinds of external diseconomies are present in the kind\nof competitively organized, single-trawl fishery which he considers. In the\nfirst place, a fish caught by fisherman A reduces the stock of fish available\nto other fishermen, increasing the amount of resources which these others\nmust use to land a given catch. Secondly, a fish caught today by fisherman\nA will not be around tomorrow as a larger, more valuable fish, again impos-\ning additional costs upon the industry as a whole.\n\nLet the set of all fish in the banks be divided into two subsets: fish that\nhave reached catchable size (called the **fish stock\") and fish which have\nnot yet reached that size. The size of the smallest fish in the fish stock is\ndetermined by the size of the mesh in nets used by the fishermen. Turvey\nstates [1, p. 65] that operational models used by biologists to assess\nfisheries commonly make the following assumptions: (a) growth of fish\nand natural mortality are functions of age, (b) fishing mortality rate (catch)\nis proportional to \"effort,\" and (c) recruitment into the fish stock, i.e., the\nnumber of fish reaching catchable size, is exogenous.\n\nIf assumption (c) is taken literally, then \"weight recruitment,\" or\npounds of fish reaching catchable size per time period, would depend only\non mesh size, since larger mesh would lead to recruitment at a heavier\nweight. Specifically, the number of fish in the fish stock or the size of the\ncatch would not affect recruitment.

Cross's theory of the bargaining process is composed of three ele-\nments: a theory of decision-making, a theory of expectations, and a theory\nof learning. The theory of decision-making consists of the maximization of\nthe present value of an expected payoff, in utility terms, and this aspect\nof Cross's work will not be questioned in the present paper. The theory of\nexpectations, however, will be examined from the point of view of both\nempirical plausibility and theoretical fruitfulness, and as a result of this\nanalysis a reinterpretation will be suggested. This will be shown to have\nrepercussions not only within the learning part of the model, but also for\nthe predictions of the theory as a whole. It will be argued that the revised\nmodel has some relevance to a bargaining situation of considerable theo-\nretical interest and practical importance, which could not otherwise have\nbeen treated within the framework of the Cross theory. This is a bargaining\nsituation involving 'brinkmanship.\"\n\nI. Bargainer's Expectations\n\nThe particular aspect of the theory of expectations which I would like\nto examine is that concerning each bargainer's expectations of the other's\nconcession rate. Obviously, relatively simple assumptions must be made\nabout the behavior of such rates if an analytically manageable model is to\nbe built. However, by making the particular assumption that he does, Cross\nautomatically excludes from his theory a particularly interesting case\u2014\nthat of bargaining involving brinkmanship. What I mean here by a brink-\nmanship situation is one in which a bargainer expects his opponent to make\n\u00e0 concession at some point in the future and, in the light of this expecta-\ntion, is prepared to wait, making no concession himself. Casual observa-\ntion seems to suggest that this brinkmanship type of situation is one that\ntypically occurs in bargaining processes.\n\nLet us confine our attention, as Cross does, to the pure intransigence case\nof bargaining, i.e., the case where each bargainer always expects to obtain\nagreement at his own current demand. Using the Cross notation, we have\nutility functions f(g:), g(q\u00bb) defined over the quantity variables qi, q\u00bb where\nqi is I's share of Q, q; is II's share, and the total amount of Q is M. Disagree-\nment occurs when the demands q:i4-q?? M, and the amount of disagreement\n(i.e., the total concessions which must be made before agreement is pos-\nsible) is (g;--q; \u2014 M).

In any short period of an inflationary nature, therefore, consider-\nable dispersion in the rate of change of sales is likely to be apparent. It can, of\ncourse, be objected that the suggested correlation merely confirms the impor-\ntance of unequal changes in demand as a cause of inflation. This is a logical\npossibility. The postwar inflation ay have been due largely to unequal\nchanges in demand, and economists may have been mistaken in emphasizing\nthe role of such pressures as high liquidity, generalized excess demand, and\nunion aggressiveness. A more reasonable interpretation, however, is that the as-\nsociation of varying degrees of dispersion with changing rates of inflation is\nless a causal relationship than a consequence of the tendencies outlined above.\nIn any event, it becomes difficult to maintain that there was anything special\nabout the periods 1955-57 and 1957-63. Bowen and Masters would need to\nShow that sales changes were even more unequal in the former period and\neven less so in the latter than the normal relationship between inflation and\ndispersion would lead one to predict.\n\n'The second hypothesis is more straightforward: the degree of dispersion is\nlikely to diminish as the interval of time considered is extended, for the gener-\nal movement of sales, under conditions o\u00ed inflation and increasing real output,\ncomes increasingly to submerge short-term changes in prices and output in\ndifferent industries. If this expectation is confirmed, the Bowen-Masters mea-\nsures cannot validly be used to compare periods of different length.\n\nConsiderable manipulation of the published data is necessary before these\nhypotheses can be tested, and limitation of time has obliged me to rely on\nAustralian data which, for other purposes, were converted into suitable form.\nProfessor Bowen and Mr. Masters, after reading a draft of this comment,\ntested the second hypothesis against their data for the United States and have\ngenerously allowed me to use their results; they could not, unfortunately, un-\ndertake a similar test of the first hypothesis. The disadvantage of using the\nAustralian statistics is perhaps reduced by Australia's diverse experience of\ninflationary conditions, because of which properties of the Bowen-Masters\nmeasures which emerge less conspicuously in the American data may be easier\nto detect.\n\nThe Australian manufacturing industries distinguished in the official statis-\ntics have been consolidated in 27 groups,! and the two dispersion measures are\ncalculated on this basis for each year from 1948-49 to 1961-62. Statistics of\nsales are not available and value of output estimates, differing from sales to\nthe extent of inventory changes, are substituted. Otherwise the data appear to\nbe strictly comparable with those used by Bowen and Masters. Table 1 shows\nboth the values of the dispersion statistics calculated for successive annual\nchanges in output and estimates of annual price increases. The latter estimates\nare obtained by calculating the implicit price index for gross national product\n\n!

The other measure (/*,) is the weighted standard deviation\nof the different growth rates. The principal conclusions are, first, that there\nwere indeed uncommonly pronounced disparities in demand changes during\nthe period 1955-57 and, secondly, that the period from July 1957 to March\n1963 was one in which the disparities were extraordinarily slight. From the\nlatter result, a by-product of the inquiry, Bowen and Masters infer that re-\ncent price stability may have been due partly to a fortuitous circumstance.\n\nIt is argued in this comment that Bowen and Masters' evidence relating to\nchanges in sales is an unsatisfactory basis for these inferences. The central\nproblem is whether the changes in the money value of sales on which they rely\ncan be accepted as a measure of changes in demand. Although Bowen and\nMasters draw attention to some defects of their technique, its limitations re-\nquire greater emphasis. Why does the value of sales in one industry increase\nat a different rate from sales in another? If both industries are initially in mar-\nket equilibrium, the following possibilities are perhaps the most important:\n\n1. The two industries, although they have demand and supply functions\nwith similar elasticities, are confronted with unequal movements in their de-\nmand curves. In this instance the unequal changes in sales can be attributed\nunambiguously to unequal changes in demand, and Bowen and Masters' rea-\nsoning is justified.\n\n2. Similar movements in the demand curves cause different changes in the\nequilibrium quantities and prices because demand and supply elasticities\ndiffer.\n\n3. Supply functions may change for a variety of reasons, including changes\nin physical production functions and spontaneous alterations in the costs of\nfactors of production. Wage increases due to union aggressiveness are one ex-\nample of the latter. Again, unequal movements in sales may ensue either be-\ncause the separate industry supply functions are unequally affected or because\nsimilar changes interact with different demand and supply elasticities.\n\n4. Although the new equilibrium conditions may involve equal proportional\nchanges in sales, the speeds at which industries and their markets respond to\nchanged circumstances may differ. Thus within any period less than that re-\nquired to reach equilibrium, sales may change at unequal rates.\n\nRelaxing the assumption of initial equilibrium, we encounter two further\nimportant possibilities. One is that factors of production previously in limited\nsupply become available, with unequal effects on the output of different indus-\ntries; the other that, for reasons implicit in factor (4) above, industries inher-\nit from earlier periods unequal pressures to alter their production and prices.\n\nNo attempt can be made here to separate the effects of these factors, but\nthe implicit assumption of Bowen and Masters that (1) predominates seems\ngratuitous.

The\nfirst is that the measures of dispersion and the rate of increase of prices are\nstrongly correlated.

Their inquiry was inspired by Charles L.\nSchultze's well-known study of the inflation of 1955-57 [2], but their model\ndiffers from his in its emphasis on disparate changes in demand rather than\ndifferences in the prevailing levels of demand.

Thus, (a) no regulation, (b) toll only,\nand (c) toll plus mesh-size regulation, are three possible optimizing pre-\nscriptions, depending on conditions actually encountered.\n\nIn the special case where Pareto-optimality does require both scale and\nmode regulation (case (c)), there is still no necessity to institute regulation\nby fiat to control mesh size. A penalty toll on all fish in a catch smaller\nthan the size corresponding to the optimum mesh size would accomplish\nthe same end. This fact hints that Turvey's dual recommendation, when\nvalid, is a product of the peculiar technology involved in fisheries. Suppose\nthat fishermen could choose whatever size distribution of catch they wanted,\ninstead of being limited to choosing only the minimum size of fish in the\ncatch. Then, regulation only of the minimum-size fish and of fishing effort\nwould probably not be sufficient for a Pareto-optimum.\n\nIn terms of Figure 1, fishermen ought to be penalized for catching fish\nyounger than the maximum expected weight age, and encouraged to de-\nvote relatively more effort to older age classes. A variable toll, either con-\ntinuous or by size class, would be necessary. The actual form of the toll\nwould also depend on the relative costs of landing different-size fish and\nupon the effects of the fishing activity on the shape of the E(W) curve and\non the number of eggs hatching.

In connection with both problems the distinction between\n\"embodied\" and \"'disembodied\" technical progress has achieved wide\ncurrency. In this paper, after a discussion of some of the properties of an\naggregate production function and of \"efficiency units,\" it will be argued\nthat the concept of embodied progress has not received a precise defini-\ntion. Three alternative interpretations of the concept are given; it is\nshown that on only one of these interpretations\u2014a somewhat unortho-\ndox one\u2014is embodied progress directly relevant to the relationship be-\ntween investment and growth.\n\nl.

Continuous casting at the present time involves an uninter-\nrupted process of steelmaking and steel-forming of in-process shapes for future\nconversion. The authors again claim that the U.S. industry adopted the con-\ntinuous-casting. metkod slowly and only with great reluctance. But, once\nagain, it is necessary to point out that the structure of steelmaking operations\nin the United States is very different from that in Europe, and that the size of\nthe economical producing unit in the United States is much larger. Even in the\nUnited States, the mills that found it economical to adopt continuous-casting\ntechniques at first were the smaller plants.\n\nAlthough the authors do indicate that continuous casting abroad \"began to\nmove into high gear about eight years ago,\" they do not add that most of the\n40 machines installed from 1955 to 1962 had very small capacities. Only 10 of\nthe 40 had annual capacities in excess of 100,000 tons, and the largest was\nrated at about only 350,000 tons. This contrasts with modern blooming and\nslabbing mills (which they replace) in the United States that have annual ca-\npacities in excess of 3,000,000 tons.\n\nAlthough it would have been possible for large, integrated U.S. producers to\nconstruct small continuous-casting units at an earlier date, such an approach\nwould undoubtedly have resulted in higher unit costs. For the small producer,\nhowever, who could not produce the volume of steel necessary to make the op-\neration of large-volume blooming, slabbing, and billet mills feasible, small-ca-\npacity cntinuous-casting units were economical. Continuous casting was not\ninstalled by any large producers until a large-scale process was developed\nWhich would be more efficient than what the producer had at the moment, and\nuntil the return on such an investment was anticipated to be higher than any\nalternative use of funds.\n\nIn summary, with reference to technological advances, it is imperative to rec-\nognize that the introduction of new methods is not dictated solely by the\navailability of a new process. The very technological nature of the industry\nitself affects the wide use of newer methods, since early applications may be\nrestricted to smaller producing units. It also is important to recognize that a\nbasic factor affecting decisions about investments is consideration of alterna-\ntive uses of money. There are many ways that a firm can spend funds for in-\nvestment in plant and equipment. The key decision is to spend the monies\nwhere they will earn the best returns. With different rates of growth in de-\nmand in the United States, Europe, and Japan, the facility decisions necessari-\nly must be different. With rapidly expanding demand, it is financially possible\nfor a firm to install new capacity; without such growing demand, alteration of\nexisting facilities frequently is a more economical move.\n\nRzusEN E.

This, of course, would not have\nprecluded the very small U.S. producers from constructing small oxygen fur-\nnaces, since these producers did not have the same need for volume; generally,\nhowever, these very small steel producers do not have blast furnaces, which\nare a prerequisite to an oxygen stcelmaking operation. A second reason why\nU.S. producers deferred making investments in oxygen furnaces is undoubted-\nly that they felt they could develop higher-capacity oxygen furnaces in the\nnot-too-distant future and that such furnaces would be much more efficient\nthan small-capacity furnaces, which were the only type that could have been\nbuilt during this earlier time period. To make the oxygen furnace feasible for\nwidespread use in the United States, a great deal of research and development\nfirst had to be undertaken; this was to come at a future date.\n\nAt present, some 300-ton oxygen furnaces are already in operation in the\nUnited States and others are being built, but the average-size oxygen furnace\nnow in operation in the United States is about 140 tons. Until the large oxy-\ngen furnaces were developed, a number of companies adapted their large,\nmodern open-hearth furnaces with oxygen lances and have operated them as\nefficient production units. In light of these facts, it seems quite apparent that\nthere would have been little or no advantage to the major U.S. companies\nfrom oxygen furnaces, rather than continued use and improvement of the ex-\nisting open hearths, during the years before the large oxygen furnaces were\nperfected.\n\n\"The process of the introduction of the oxygen furnace is neither hit-or-miss\nnor one of massive replacement. Companies tend to replace the oldest and\nhighest-cost open hearths first, and only replace those where capital could not\nbe utilized more efficiently elsewhere. Now that 150- and 200-ton furnaces\nhave been engineered, one company after another is building this type of ca-\npacity.\n\nSo long as steel produced by conventional methods can compete with that\nproduced by newer technology, it would not be a wise economic decision to\nscrap the existing facilities and to destroy vast investments in fixed capital. It\ncan be expected that newer technology will become more general as old facili-\nties wear out and are scrapped. This is why it is unlikely that there will be\nany future purchase of new open-hearth capacity, but there will continue to be\nmodifications, adaptations, and modernizations of such facilities so long as\nthey are cost-competitive. Any decision that involves the contemplated scrap-\nping of open hearths and their replacement by oxygen furnaces is carefully\nweighed against the alternative uses of funds.\n", "154\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "2": ["?Subsequent discussion will indicate why such a choice was not present for much of\nthe period.\n", "that a firm has the option of using existing technology or new methods, even if\nthe latter were operationally suitable at the time.?\n\nThe authors assert that while the U.S. steel industry was emphasizing open\nhearths, the European and Japanese firms were instead installing oxygen fur-\nnaces at a *breakneck pace\" [1, p. 627]. The record shows, however, that from\n1953 to 1960 the U.S. producers increased their open-hearth capacity by only\nabout 23 per cent in contrast with an increase of about 79 per cent for mem-\nbers of the European Coal and Steel Community and of approximately 169\nper cent for Japan.\n\nThe authors criticize the U.S. industry for being slow to adopt the oxygen\nprocess in spite of its alleged widespread use in Europe more than ten years\nago [1, p. 647]. The oxygen process was first used commercially in Austria\nin 1952 on two 35-ton furnaces with an annual capacity of about 400,000\ntons. In Europe, another shop was started in 1953, still another in 1955, one\nmore in 1956, two more in 1957, four more in 1958, and two more in 1959.\nThe total capacity of all these operations approximated 4,000,000 net tons. An\nadditional five shops were started up in 1960, bringing the total oxygen-fur-\nnace capacity in Europe by 1960 to about 5.3 million net tons. These data ob-\nviously cannot be interpreted to mean that oxygen-furnace-produced steel was\nwidespread in Europe ten years ago. In fact, as late as 1963, only about 6 per\ncent of the steel produced in Europe was made by oxygen furnaces; this com-\npares with about 774 per cent in the United States by 1963. By this measure-\nment, U.S. producers were technologically ahead of\u2014not behind\u2014European\nproducers.\n\nTo understand the rate of introduction of the oxygen furnace in the United\nStates, it is necessary to examine both economic and engineering factors.

This communication will be limited to\nan examination of the authors! contentions about steel industry technology.\nAlthough several other assertions of the authors justify a re-examination,\nspace limitations are such that this communication will not be able to examine\nthese in the detail necessary.\n\nThe authors contend that U.S. steel producers have lagged behind foreign\nproducers in investing in technologically improved facilities and, further, that\nthey have invested in obsolete equipment and that improvements have been\nadopted only when the industry has been forced to do so by the increasing\npressure of foreign competition [1, pp. 626, 646]. To support their charges,\nthe authors cite the examples of the oxygen furnace and the continuous-cast-\ning process.\n\nSpecifically, the authors state that during the 1950's, the U.S. steel industry\nbought 40 million tons of the wrong kind of capacity, namely the open-hearth\nfurnace. They state that *Much of the U.S. industry's current investment in\nplant and equipment is calculated not to add to capacity, but to correct the\nembarrassing investment errors of the last decade\" [1, p. 627].\n\nIncreases in open-hearth capacity in the steel industry are shown in Table\n13\n\nAlthough there was a net increase in open-hearth capacity of nearly 40 mil-\nlion tons, only about 1614 million tons were accounted for by the construction\nof new facilities during this period. Further, the steel companies built only 5.6\nmillion tons of 2ez\u00bb open hearths\u2014not 40 million tons\u2014during the portion of\nthis period following 1953, when information about the oxygen furnace first\nbecame generally available to the industry. The remainder of the increase in\ncapacity represented the results of improved utilization of existing facilities\u2014\nan approach which the steel companies found to be economically more desir-\nable than construction of completely new facilities.\n\n\"The authors surely do not mean to imply that a fully integrated steel mill\nhas complete control over the fluidity of its capital use. On the contrary, most\nof the capital becomes sunken and fixed once it is brought into being. The best\nthat can be done in connection with technological changes is to attempt to\nkeep the existing physical plant from becoming uneconomical to operate by\nmaking steady improvements and modernizations as these become technologi-\ncally and financially feasible.

The plain fact is that economists have neglected the study\nof technical change at the structural and micro level to the point where\nwe are quite incapable of answering many of the most important ques-\ntions of our day. We have been obsessed with macroeconomics, with\npiddling refinements in mathematical models, and with the monumen-\ntally unsuccessful exercise in welfare economics which has preoccupied\na whole generation with a dead end, to the almost total neglect of some\nof the major problems of our day. Almost the only group of economists\nwho have much sense of realism are the agricultural economists, and\nthese are dealing with a vanishing sector that is now only 5 percent of\nthe total economy. The whole economics profession, indeed, is an ex-\nample of that monumental misallocation of intellectual resources\nwhich is one of the most striking phenomena of our times.

Deci-\nSion making by instinct, gossip, visceral feeling, and political savvy\nmay stand pretty low on the scale of total rationality, but it may have\nthe virtue of being able to take in very large systems in a crude and\nvague way, whereas the rationalized processes can only take subsys-\ntems in their more exact fashion, and being rational about subsystems\nmay be worse than being not very rational about the system as a\nwhole. I would not argue, of course, that rationality about the system\nas \u00e0 whole is impossible. On the other hand, the economist has a cer-\ntain mind-set in favor of his own skills, and it is easy for him to leave\nout essential variables with which he is not familiar. Here, indeed, a\nlittle learning may be a dangerous thing, or even a little rationality.\n\nOne area where economists have a good deal to be humble about is\nin the field of economic development of the poor countries. In the rich\ncountries we have done fairly well; in the poor countries our record is\ndistinctly spotty. This is almost certainly because we are dealing in\nthis case with a total social process, and the economic abstractions are\nsimply not sufficient to deal with the problem. Here what we need is\nclearly economic anthropology, and this science, unfortunately, hardly\nexists. Our great gift to the world is national income statistics and the\npercentage rate of growth of GNP. In fact, as every economist knows,\ncalculations of GNP, especially in the poor countries, are largely exer-\ncises in the statistical imagination, and even if they were accurate, the\nGNP itself can be a very poor measure of welfare. The GNP can rise\nbecause of arms races, because of stupid dam-building, or even\nthrough the building of presidential palaces. It can be rising because\na small proportion of a population is getting better off while the vast\nmajority remain in stagnant misery. Valuable as the GNP is, there-\nfore, as a rough overall measure of economic success, it can easily be-\ncome a fetish and a quite misleading statistic. Economists certainly\nshould be the first to issue warnings against its misuse.\n\nLet me conclude with some brief notes on the state of economic\nknowledge in the United States. At the moment I get the impression\nthat economists in this country are bathed in a warm glow of self-con-\ngratulation, rising out of the long Kennedy-Johnson upswing and the\nsuccessful tax cut, and they are all climbing onto the bandwagon of the\nGreat Societv, waving flags and tooting horns. That we have some\ncauses for self-congratulation I would not deny, and I hate to seem\nlike a skeleton at the feast. There is real danger, however, that our\ncurrent euphoria will prevent us from seeing the immensity of our un-\nsolved problems and the enormous intellectual task that still awaits us.\nIt is not much to the credit of the economics profession, for instance,\n"], "10": ["10 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nAnother point where the knowledge of economics has had some\npayoffs in the social system has been through the development of oper-\nations research and management science, with the aid of computer\ntechnology. Here again it is not altogether clear how much economics\nitself has contributed to this, as the basic ideas, for instance of maxi-\nmizing something under constraints, are so obvious that it is almost\nembarrassing to credit economics with them, and it is the technology\nthat has really made the difference. However, I suppose it can be\nargued that if economics had not beaten out the marginal analysis with\nan intellectual sledge hammer over a couple of generations, the com-\nputer boys might have had to spend a few minutes in thinking about\nwhat they were doing. Some of us, perhaps, still have to learn that\narithmetic is a complement to, not a substitute for, thought, and that\nwhat my spy in IBM calls the \"gigo principle\" (that is, garbage in,\ngarbage out) is a sound approach even to the most elegantly computer-\nized simulation. I confess I am a little worried about one aspect of this\nmovement, fruitful as it undoubtedly is. The very power of the com-\nputer to simulate complex systems by very high-speed arithmetic may\nprevent search for those simplified formulations which are the essence\nof progress in theory. I have an uneasy feeling, for instance, that if the\ncomputer had been around at the time of Copernicus, nobody would\nhave ever bothered with him, because the computers could have han-\ndled the Ptolemaic epicycles with perfect ease.\n\nThe general movement towards the rationalization of decision-mak-\ning processes in both private and public life through the use of opti-\nmizing procedures applied to complex masses of information may have\nsome other costs lurking among the benefits, particularly in regard to\npolitical decision making. For one thing, these elaborate procedures\nmay easily produce a sense of subjective certainty, which is quite un-\nwarranted by the uncertainties of the actual system. One worries about\nthis particularly in the international system, where the principle that\n*he who hesitates is saved\" is usually very sound, and an illusion of\ncertainty can be quite disastrous. The use of political war games and\nof computer simulation in the Department of Defense is a genuine\ncause for alarm on this score, and one would very much like to see\nsome studies of the effect of gaming, for instance, on business behav-\nior. It could easily be that the euphoria produced by these exercises\nresulted in some disastrous decisions, though I have not been able to\ndocument this hypothesis.

That is to say, we are\nnot simply acquiring knowledge about a static system which stays put,\nbut acquiring knowledge about a whole dynamic process in which the\nacquisition of the knowledge itself is a part of the process. It is quite\nlegitimate, therefore, to ask ourselves what is the impact of economic\nknowledge, that is, of the image of the economic system or econo-\nsphere, in the minds of professional economists, on the dynamic pro-\ncesses of the econosphere itself. The only point at which knowledge can\naffect a social system is through its impact on decisions. This impact can\nbe small or large, depending on the relevance of the knowledge in ques-\ntion. Thus in the case of the operations of a market and the behavior\ninvolved in buying and selling, it is doubtful whether the knowledge of\neconomics as such makes very much difference. Economists, for in-\nstance, have not been noted for their success in market speculation,\nwith two notable exceptions of Ricardo and J. M. Keynes, and even in\ntheir cases, they made their major contributions to economics after,\nnot before, they made fortunes in speculative markets. There are cer-\ntainly few marketers who have been assisted in their operations by\nknowledge of the Walrasian Equations, just as few tennis players are\nmuch assisted by knowledge of the mathematics of moving balls.\n\nAt some points, however, economic knowledge is showing some dan-\nger of being useful. Economists can take a good deal of credit for the\nstabilization policies which have been followed in most Western coun-\ntries since 1945 with considerable success. Tt is easy to generate a eu-\nphoric and self-congratulatory mood when one compares the twenty\nyears after the first World War, 1919-39, with the twenty years after\nthe second, 1945-65. The first twenty years were a total failure; the\nsecond twenty years, at least as far as economic policy is concerned,\nhave been a modest success. We have not had any great depression; we\nhave not had any serious financial collapse; and on the whole we have\nhad much higher rates of development in most parts of the world than\nwe had in the 1920's and 1930's, even though there are some conspicu-\nous failures. Whether the unprecedented rates of economic growth of\nthe last twenty years, for instance in Japan and Western Europe, can\nbe attributed to economics, or whether they represent a combination of\ngood luck in political decision making with the expanding impact of\nthe natural and biological sciences on the economy, is something we\nmight argue. I am inclined to attribute a good deal to good luck and\nnoneconomic forces, but not all of it, and even if economics only con-\ntributed 10 percent, this would amount to a very handsome rate of re-\nturn indeed, considering the very small amount of resources we have\nreally put into economics.\n"], "8": ["8 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\ntions, for instance, would only be interesting if there were any evi-\ndence at all that as a parameter it had some stability, or even that its\nrate of change had some stability. There may be some stability in ex-\npectations when there is nothing to expect, that is, in a poor, stable en-\nvironment, but outside of this the evidence for any simple relationship\nbetween present rates of change and future is not well supported. Per-\nhaps the most plausible theory is that people tend to interpret the\npresent in terms of the traumatic experiences of their youth. Thus a\ngeneration that was traumatized by inflation will have different images\nfrom one traumatized by depression. It is clear we are on the border-\nline here between economics and psychology, and it is to the intersti-\ntial discipline of economic psychology that we must look for answers.\nThe trouble is, of course, that even psychology knows very little about\nthe human learning process, mainly because it takes place over such a\nlong period and is almost certainly subject to phenomena such as *im-\nprinting\" in which inputs at certain moments of \"readiness\" in the de-\nvelopment of the person produce effects which far outweigh their in-\ntrinsic importance.\n\nAnother profitable line of study lies in economic sociology, in the\nanalysis of the way in which organizational structure affects the flow\nof information, hence affects the information input into the decision-\nmaker, hence affects his image of the future and his decisions, even\nperhaps his value function. There is a great deal of evidence that al-\nmost all organizational structures tend to produce false images in the\ndecision-maker, and that the larger and more authoritarian the organi-\nzation, the better the chance that its top decision-makers will be oper-\nating in purely imaginary worlds. This perhaps is the most fundamen-\ntal reason for supposing that there are ultimately diminishing returns\nto scale. In the most extreme form of this view, we can suppose that\nthe role structure and communication network of an organization de-\ntermine the inputs to each role so completely that there is virtually no\nfreedom of decision at all, and that no matter who is the role occupant,\nthe decisions will be much the same. The inference of this theory, of\ncourse, is that fools in high places will make just the same decisions as\nwise men, and though there is something com\u00edorting in this, one cer-\ntainly hesitates to believe it too wholeheartedly.\n\nLet me now focus my attention even more narrowly on the problem\nof the contribution of economic knowledge itself, that is, what econo-\nmists know, to the processes of operation of the economic system. We\nhave here a certain epistemological paradox, that where knowledge is\nan essential part of the system, knowledge about the system changes\nthe system itself.

Thus even be-\nfore 1776 Adam Smith had perceived the enormous importance of\nwhat today we would call research and development in the processes\nby which everybody gets richer.\n\nThe third area of interest to economists where tbe epistemological\nproblem is overwhelmingly important is in the area of decision making\nitself, in the private sector, in households and businesses, and in gov-\nernment; for the problem of government policy is just as much a prob-\nlem in decision making as is the problem of the behavior of private\npersons and organizations. In my book, Te Image, Y have sketched\nwhat might be called an epistemological theory of behavior, pointing\nout that a decision is always a choice among alternative perceived im-\nages of the future. The study of decision, therefore, must concentrate\non how these images of the future are derived from the information\ninputs of the past, as this is the only place from which they can come.\nThat is, we have to think of our images of the future as essentially\nlearned out of our inputs from the past, and the nature of this learning\nprocess is therefore of overwhelming importance. Similarly, the utility\nor welfare function, which we impose over these images of the future,\nis likewise learned, though economists have been surprisingly unwilling\nto recognize this fact, perhaps because it was called to their attention\nin such strident tones by Veblen, who argued most convincingly, to my\nmind, that if we wanted to have a dynamic economics, we could not\nsimply take preferences for granted but had to regard them as essen-\ntially learned. The process by which we learn our preferences, how-\never, is mysterious indeed. A substantial monkey wrench is thrown\ninto dynamic economics by the fact that the price system itself may\noperate as a teacher, and preferences may change in response to the\nprice structure just as the price structure changes in response to pref-\nerences. We have, for instance, what might be called the \"sour grapes\"\nprinciple\u2014that what we cannot get we decide we do not like. There is\nalso a counterprinciple that might be called the \"Mount Everest\" prin-\nciple, that if something is hard to get, we want it, just because it is\nbard to get. Furthermore, if we know somebody else has paid a\ndifferent price from what we have paid, our satisfaction may be corre-\nspondingly increased or diminished.\n\nThe epistemological theory of decision making is, of course, pretty\nempty unless we can specify ways in which the inputs of the past de-\ntermine the present images of the future. Unfortunately, the observa-\ntions of economists on this question are for the most part simple-mind-\ned to the point of embarrassment.

Pro-\nduction is then seen essentially as a process of increasing structure, re-\npairing the decay and depreciation of consumption, replacing the\nknowledge lost by death, and so on: We could further think of produc-\ntion as having two functions: one a replacement function, which is\nnecessary to restore an existing knowledge and capital structure; the\nother a developmental function which expands, improves, and reorga-\nnizes the structure of knowledge in general into new forms. If consump-\ntion is so great that all production has to be used for maintenance,\nthere will, of course, be no development. We also get certain consump-\ntion processes which can be remedied by no known input, such as\naging. Fortunately in society we have solved this problem by having\nbabies, and in organizations we solve it by having competition, bank-\nruptcy, and various forms of organizational death. Birth and death,\nindeed, are the price that we pay for aging, so that we can have a pop-\nulation that does not age, even though the individuals do.\n\n'The recognition that development, even economic development, is\nessentially a knowledge process has been slowly penetrating the minds\nof economists, but we are still too much obsessed by mechanical mod-\nels, capital-income ratios, and even input-output tables, to the neglect\nof the study of the learning process which is the real key to develop-\nment. It is true, of course, that what might be called the *human\nresources school\" of Theodore Schultz and Fred Harbison has laid\nvery proper stress on education as the mainspring of the developmen-\ntal process. Even here, however, there has perhaps not been sufficient\nattention paid to the problem of learning as a whole, outside as well as\ninside the institutions of formal education; and there has been a con-\nsiderable neglect of the role of the price system as a teacher.\n\nIt is always depressing to go back to Adam Smith, especially on eco-\nnomic development, as one realizes how little we have learned in near-\nly two hundred years. It is, however, perhaps worthy of notice that our\nfather Adam saw very clearly that the learning process was the key to\ndevelopment, for if we examine his causes of the increase in the pro-\nductive powers of labor, which is what we mean by economic develop-\nment, we see that they all involve the knowledge process. The first of\nthese, the development of skill and dexterity through the division of\nlabor, is a learning process mainly in the lower nervous system. The\nsecond, the gains due to constant application at a single task and the\nelimination of *sauntering,\" involve the problem of forgetting and re-\nlearning as we take up tasks intermittently; and the third, and by far\nthe most important, is the development of machines (frozen knowl-\n", "6\n"], "5": ["RICHARD T.

Throughout the sciences, physical, bio-\nlogical, and social, we are still really more at home with equilibrium\nsystems than we are with dynamic systems.\n\nThe plain fact is that knowledge or something equivalent to it in the\nform of improbable structures is the only thing that can grow or\nevolve, and the concept is quite crucial in any evolutionary theory. As\nfar as matter and energy are concerned, we are subject to inexorable\nlaws of conservation. Here we are faced with simple exchange: what\none system acquires, another system must give up. In the case of avail-\nable energy, there is not even conservation; the second law of thermo-\ndynamics informs us there is constant degradation and decay. From\nthe point of view of energy alone, the universe is clearly running down\ninto a very thin brown soup, and all processes in time are seen merely\nas the exhaustion of preexisting potential, a kind of squandering of\navailable energy capital. It is only information and knowledge process-\nes which in any sense get out from under the iron laws of conservation\nand decay, though they only do this, as it were, by operating at an-\nother level. Two processes may be distinguished here. The first might\nbe called printing, in which a structure is able to reproduce itself by\nmaking a copy of itself out of the incoherent matter around it. The\ngene evidently operates in this way; the mass production of\ncommodities is largely three-dimensional printing; and even the trans-\nmission of a good deal of knowledge by rote learning in the educational\nprocess falls into this category. Printing by itself, however, would\nnever organize an evolutionary or developmental process. It would\nmerely fill the whole universe with copies of an initial structure. There\nmust therefore be a second process to which we might give the name of\norganizing. This is the kind of process, for instance, by which the\ncoded information contained in the gene is able to organize a pheno-\ntype such as a man. This is the way in which a blueprint organizes the\nconstruction of a building. This is the way in which an idea creates an\norganization, or an image of the future governs an individual life.\n\nWe then see any developmental process, whether this is the develop-\nment of a fertilized egg into a human being, the development of an\nidea into an organization by an entrepreneur, the development of a re-\nligion out of a \"sacred history,\" or even the process of economic de-\nvelopment itself, as essentially a combination of printing and organiz-\ning, the one developing rote knowledge, the other new knowledge.\nThus we can think of capital essentially as knowledge imposed on the\nmaterial world, in the first place by an organizing process which\ncreates a producing organization and in the second case by a process\nakin to three-dimensional printing.

We can perhaps wriggle our way\nout of this dilemma by supposing that the knowledge problem in per-\nfect markets is taken care of by specialized arbitrageurs, who by de-\nvoting themselves full time to the problem of knowing what prices\nthere are in different parts of the market and by taking advantage\nthemselves of the price differentials thereby revealed, reduce these\nprice differentials to so small a quantity that all the rest of the people\nin the market are justified in assuming that the price which they hap-\npen to observe at one point is characteristic of all transactions all over\nthe market. From a social point of view, the income of the arbitrageurs\nmight be regarded as the cost of acquiring the knowledge which is nec-\nessary to operate the market, and the other people in the market are\nevidently willing to pay this rather than become arbitrageurs them-\nselves.\n\nWe can then think of the development of imperfect markets as a re-\nsult of the fact that when commodities become extremely diverse and\ncomplicated, when we have to know not only their price but also their\nquality, arbitrage in effect breaks down, because the cost of acquiring\nthe relevant knowledge is more than the market is willing to support.\nHence we get imperfect markets facing both buyers and sellers, in\nwhich they face not merely a price at which they can buy and sell as\nmuch as they wish but a function relating the amount that can be\nbought or sold to the price at which it can be bought or sold. Once we\nhave imperfect markets, however, the epistemological problem for the\nmarketers themselves increases enormously. If prices are advertised in\na perfect market, or \"cried,\" every seller knows his sales function and\nevery buyer knows his purchase function immediately. If, however, we\nhave an imperfect market, the problem of knowing what are the sales\nor purchase functions becomes not only acute but almost insoluble,\nsimply because in order to know a function we must have experience\nwith a system beyond its present point. It is this failure to understand\nthe epistemological problem involved which has vitiated much of the\notherwise laudable attempt to expand the theory of perfect competi-\ntion into imperfect markets. This attempt which began so hopefully in\nthe 1930's now seems to have petered out in an epistemological swamp.\n\nWhen it comes to the theory of economic development, the failure to\nrecognize explicitly the essentially epistemological nature of the prob-\nlem has led to a proliferation of mechanical models of very doubtful\nvalue, and, one fears, the giving of a large amount of bad advice.

It is certainly tempting to\nthink of knowledge as a capital stock of information, knowledge being\nto information what capital is to income, and to use the bit itself in the\nform of a stock as the measure of knowledge. Certainly the improba-\nbility of a structure, which is what the bit really measures, is highly\nrelated to the knowledge concept. The bit, however, abstracts com-\npletely from the content of either information or knowledge, and while\nit is enormously useful for telephone engineers, who have no interest in\nwhat is being said over their telephones, for purposes of the social sys-\ntem theorist we need a measure which takes account of significance\nand which would weight, for instance, the gossip of a teenager rather\nlow and the communications over the hot line between Moscow and\nWashington rather high. Up to now we seem to have no way of doing\nthis, short of a kind of qualitative guesswork, though even this will be\nbetter than nothing.\n\nAnother difficulty is that only things which are clearly capable of\nbeing appropriated are subject to being exchanged, and if a thing can-\nnot be property, it obviously cannot be a commodity. While knowledge\nhas many of the aspects of property, its capacity for reproduction in\nmany minds and its accessibility in the form of the published word\nmake it a very peculiar form of property. Thus as Major John Wesley\nPowell said to a congressional committee in 1886: \"Possession of prop-\nerty is exclusive; possession of knowledge is not exclusive, for the\nknowledge which one man has may also be the possession of another.\"?\nIn spite of Major Powell's dictum, some knowledge, of course, is exclu-\nsive, such as trade secrets and patents, and thereby becomes property.\nWhat is perhaps even more important, knowledge which has the capac-\nity of generating more knowledge in a single head is also exclusive and\nbecomes property to the individual possessing it.\n\n\"These difficulties may have led to a certain neglect of the commodity\naspects of knowledge, even in economic theory itself. One notices this\nin at least three areas of economic thought: in the theory of the mar-\nket, in the theory of development, and in the theory of decision mak-\ning, both public and private. In the theory of the competitive market,\nthere is usually made an explicit assumption about \"perfect knowl-\nedge.\" What this means in effect is that the acquisition of knowledge\nof prices or exchange opportunities in a perfect market is costless, so\nthat knowledge is, as it were, a free good.

In terms of\nour model of consumption, the di\u00edference between a new product and a\nproduct variant is only the degree to which the characteristics mix of\nthe new product differs from that of existing products. We have, in this\nmodel, a satisfactory technique for analyzing product differentiation.\n\nConsider a simple model with two characteristics, derivable in\ndifferent proportions from two goods. We can use the same diagram as\nbefore and suppose A4, B to represent the two goods. If the goods are\ndivisible and can be used in combination, the attainable characteristics\ncollections for a consumer, given the budget constraint, correspond to\nthe line 4B. The introduction of a third good, C, whose characteristics\nvector lies between those of 4 and B can be regarded as a product\nvariant, and this good will sell if its price is low enough to bring the\ncharacteristics vector to point C' or beyond in the diagram. Given\nthis product variant, further variants lying between A4 and C, and\nC and B would, if suitably priced, expand the efficiency frontier\nand therefore be sold.

On assumptions that are\nnot severely restrictive it is possible to justify statements which point\nto a preference for innovations of a more labor-saving kind when the\nwage-rental ratio shows a rising trend, and for innovations of a more\ncapital-saving kind when the wage-rental ratio shows a falling trend.\nTo illustrate what I have in mind, I will repeat briefly the content of\ntwo propositions which I presented in an earlier note.?

Thus over-\nall the prediction is that innovations are laborsaving. Few would dis-\npute the point about (at least some) innovations being induced. The\nquestion is what is the mechanism?

Suppose we think that in fact\nlabor's share has risen. We can account for this by postulating neutral\ninnovations and an elasticity of substitution of less than one. Or we\nmay prefer capital-saving innovations and an elasticity of one. Or cap-\nital-saving plus an elasticity of more than one. If we felt great\nconfidence in the meaning and statistical significance of fitted macro-\neconomic production functions, we might make progress,\"? but in the\nabsence of such agreement is it possible to find predictions that differ\nand the relevant economic conditions when these different predictions\nwould show up? A possibility would occur if we could identify periods\nof low or near-zero technical innovation and see whether noticeable\nchanges in relative shares do occur in these periods. In the absence of\nan agreed index of innovation this seems unlikely.\n\nLet me now briefly turn to the Kaldorian approach. Kaldor of\ncourse rejects the neoclassical analysis, lock, stock, and barrel. In his\nsurvey of relative share models he appears to reject the classical and\nMarxian models on straight empirical grounds (although he tends to\nabstract from technical progress). His rejection of neoclassicism is not,\nas I understand it, on empirical grounds; i.e., that the predictions that\nare made are false; rather, the rejection is a priori. Be that as it may,\nin the Kaldor model relative shares depend upon the investment-out-\nput ratio and on the factor savings ratios. The investment-output ratio\nis \"determined\" by a technical progress function and thus innovation\nonly comes into the relative share problem via its effect on this func-\ntion. The from of technical progress (i.e., its degree of neutrality) does\nnot appear to effect the issue. The fact that both in the U.K. and the\nU.S.A. the investment ratio has undergone considerable long-period\nfluctuations in the face of near constancy of shares would persumably\nhave to be explained via compensating changes in the savings functions\nalthough the evidence on this factor is too sketchy to enable us to\nreach any definite conclusions.\n\nEmbodied in Kaldor's macro theory of relative shares there is a\nmicro counterpart. His micro explanation of relative shares (i.e., con-\nstancy of the wages share) rests on the assumption of a normal rate of\nprofit towards which the actual rate will tend via changes in the rate of\ncapital accumulation. It clearly has close affinity to the Kalecki degree\nof monopoly approach, and we can here just say a few words about the\nmarkup approach to relative shares and the way in which it can handle\nthe question of innovation. If we stick to the constancy of shares as-\n\n? Recent fits of the CES production function seem more reliable statistically than the\nCobb-Douzlas fits and give elasticities of less than one. See K.

Solow, *Capital-Labour Substitution and Economic Efficien-\ncies\" Rev. of Econ. and Statis., 1961.\n"], "5": ["form is used).\n\nThis approach has in common with the classical one the central\nproperty that movements along a production function are (at least an-\nalytically) distinguishable from shifts of that function due to innova-\ntion in the system.\n\nBut even in the absence of technological change the assumption of\nconstant returns in the production function does not pin us down to any\nrelative share predictions; resources may be growing at differential rates,\nthus altering relative factor prices and inducing substitution. It is thus\nuseful to specify a form of the function that makes factor shares inde-\npendent of differential rates of factor supply. Hence, the concentration\nuntil recently on the Cobb-Douglas form. In this case, as is well\nknown, the ratio of the marginal to the average product of a factor is\nconstant, which means that the share of that fact is constant.\n\nWe now allow for technological innovation, and keep within our\nstylized fact constraint of constancy of shares. This can be accounted\nfor by postulating that innovations have been neutral, and the Cobb-\nDouglas underpinning makes consistent the Hicksian and Harrodian\ndefinitions of neutrality. Moreover, we also get out as predictions the\nconstant rate of profit and (inevitably) the constancy of the capital-\noutput ratio.?\n\nThus (and keeping in the background of our discussion the empir-\nical validity of our stylized facts) it seems that the Cobb-Douglas as-\nsumption of neutral innovations is not a patently false picture of the\nworld. Unfortunately, there are other interpretations within the neo-\nclassical framework that are equally consistent with the facts. We may\npostulate that for a given state of technology the wages share would\nrise as capital accumulates at a greater rate than labor (i.e., the elas-\nticity of substitution is less than one), but that this bias is offset by\ntechnical progress which is laborsaving. We could prop up this postu-\nlate with some theory of induced innovation to *economize\" the rela-\ntively scarce factor. I shall come to this point in a moment.\n\n* Until quite recently the Cobb-Douglas form appeared to be substantiated by statisti-\ncal fitting. However, the fitted form of this function is now seen to be open to very\nbasic difficulties. See, e.g., H. Phelps Brown, \"The Meaning of the Fitted Cobb-Douglas\nFunction,\" QJ.E., Vol. 71.\n\n* The assumption of an elasticity of substitution of unity and neutral technical progress,\nunambiguous though it appears, becomes very cloudy once we introduce (1) more than\ntwo factors and (2) more than one sector. The first problem is that of deciding what fac-\ntors are held constant as we measure the elasticity in a pairwise manner (on this see\nJ. E. Meade, A Neo-Classical Theory of Economic Growth, Appendix 1). The second\nquestion is more fundamental. In the absence of technical progress a shift in demand\nbetween sections will alter distribution even if both sectors were Cobb-Douglas but had\ndifferent coraponents on, say, the quantity of labor. With technical progress, neutrality\nmust mean that the balance between sectors is not disturbed. Thus neutral innovations\nthat fall solely in the consumption goods sector will have different results to innovations\nthat fall solely on the capital goods sector.\n", "ALLOCATION AND DISTRIBUTION THEORY\n", "37\n"], "4": ["36 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nThe stationary solution of this model is where the rate of profit falls\nto the rate where net accumulation is zero. This is the classical sta-\ntionary state and the time paths of the variables that we are concerned\nwith are predicted to be: the rate of profit falls, the share of wage\nrises, the share of profit falls, and the share of rent rises. (We should\nnote that strictly speaking the last two assumptions do not follow from\nthe assumptions of the model. The rising rent share and falling profit\nshare require that the marginal product curve of labor-capital doses be\nfalling at a constant or increasing rate.)*\n\nAt this level it seems clear that the predictions of the model patently\nconflict with the agreed facts of economic history. The stationary state\ndoes not seem to be around the corner nor has it in fact ever been. But\nof course these predictions are ceferis paribus, which in this case\nmeans \"in the absence of technical progress.\" We now superimpose\ntechnological innovation (without explaining the whys and wherefores\nof the mechanism). What predictions do we now get about our key\nvariables? 'The answer will now be of the form ^it all depends.\" And\ncrucially it will depend upon things like (1) how rapidly innovation\npushes upwards the average and marginal productivity curves to offset\nthe tendency to diminishing returns; (2) whether the innovations are\nlabor-capital saving or land saving; (3) what assumptions we make\nabout the labor supply adjustment function; i.e., whether real wages\nrise above subsistence in response to an excess demand for labor.\n\nThe classical approach, then, I would argue is compatible with the\nfailure of the secular rate of profit to fall noticably, with the near con-\nstant secular wage share, etc. Now you may say that this \"it all de-\npends\" view of the classical theory is really farfetched and is not in\nthe spirit of the classical writers themselves.? Let us then turn to the\nneoclassical approach.\n\nNeoclassical models are, as their designation suggests, an extension\nof the classical analysis. The key respects in which they differ are: (1)\n\"They use a generalized marginal productivity approach as an explana-\ntion of all factor rewards. The capital-labor division replaces the three-\nfold classical one at the functional share level of analysis. (2) Con-\ntinuous substitution is assumed between all factors.\" (3) The assump-\ntion of diminishing returns to scale tends to be replaced by the as-\nsumption of constant returns to scale (often a specific Cobb-Douglas\n\n\"On this point, see H.

The fears were\neither about what we would now term \"structural unemployment\" or\nthe failure of real wages to rise over time. Neither of these predictions\nhas any necessary connection with hypotheses concerning relative\nshares. I shall leave this point on one side for the moment but will re-\nturn to it later.\n\nA very simple way of looking at our problem is to present the rela-\ntive share issue in terms of two ratios. We have them quite simply:\n\nwhere L is the quantity of labor, w the average wage, K the quantity\nof capital, r its average return, W the wages bill, and P total profits.\nThis way of putting things highlights two important aspects of the\nproblem: (1) since price and quantity are inversely related we would\nexpect a certain stability in the W/P ratio (although not of course\nconstancy) and (2) each one of our variables is really a very slippery\nindex number. For example, the capital stock is a heterogeneous collec-\ntion of different inputs, with different ages, different technological\nefficiencies, different costs, different lengths of life, different designs\nand doing different jobs. Much the same sort of classificatory schema\ncan be, and is increasingly being, used to describe the notion of a labor\nforce (although the retention of the homogeneity assumption lingers\nlonger here).\n\nWhen we contemplate the possible influences on the four variables\nin our equation above, e.g., rates of growth of factors, demand condi-\ntions, international trade, and on top of all this the process of techno-\nlogical innovation, we rapidly see the obvious: that this is far excel-\nlence a general equilibrium problem. In the face of this indubitable\nfact economists have been forced (as always) to simplify. If you like\nwe can think of this as variable saving innovation. We have produced\nhighly aggregative models which attempt to pinpoint certain key rela-\ntionships that *determine\" the pattern of relative shares over time. It\nis no criticism of these models that they are oversimplified; ultimately\nthey must be judged in terms of their empirical validity.\n\nIn an effort to limit the possible theoretical permutations that can be\ndreamed up, resort has been made to what I shall call (following Kal-\ndor) the constraint of the stylized fact. Let me say something about\nthis device. This constraint is of course a commendable one and has\nmuch to be said for it on methodological grounds.

Hence we must examine the indexes of investment goods prices\nthat underly our measurement for possible sources of bias.5\n\nFirst, except for the price index for road construction the published\nprice indexes for structures that underly the U.S. national accounts are\nindexes of the cost of input rather than the price of output. The use of\ninput prices in place of output prices for structures results in an im-\nportant error of measurement. To eliminate this error it is necessary to\nuse an output price index in measuring prices of both investment goods\noutput and capital services input. The Bureau of Public Roads prices\nindex for a \"standard mile\" of highway construction is such an output\nprice index. The corresponding input price index behaves in a manner\nvery similar to that of the input price of all of new construction.\"\nSecond, the price indexes for equipment that underly the U.S. national\naccounts are based primarily on data from the wholesale price index of\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since expenditures on the wholesale\nprice index are less than those on the consumers' price index, adjust-\nments for quality change are less frequent and less detailed. To eliminate\nthis source of bias, we replace the implicit deflator for producers' dur-\nables by the corresponding deflator for consumers' durables. In view of\nthe upward bias in the consumers! durables price index this adjustment\nis conservative.? Third, the price indexes for change in business inven-\ntories from the U.S. national accounts contain year-to-year fluctuations\nthat appear to be highly implausible. To represent these movements\nmore accurately, we replace the implicit deflator for change in inventories\nby the deflator for private domestic consumption. The level of this index\ngenerally coincides with that of the implicit deflator for change in busi-\nness inventories; however, the fluctuations are much less than those for\nthe inventory investment deflator.\n\nTo study the relationship between the structure of capital and\nmeasured productivity change we begin by constructing indexes of in-\nvestment goods output and capital input without correcting for errors\nof measurement. As an initial index of investment goods output we take\nU.S. private domestic investment in constant prices as measured in the\nU.S. national product accounts. As an index of capital input we take\nthe stock of capital in the private domestic sector of the U.S. economy.\nThe stock of capitalis the sum of land, plant, equipment, and inventories\nemployed in this sector. To study the effects of errors in measurement on\nmeasured productivity change we weight the rate of growth of invest-\nment by its share in U.S. private domestic output and the rate of growth\n\n* All data except those for the stock of land are taken from U.S. Income and Output [15]\nand subsequent revisions of the data given there.

We turn now to measurement of the\nrate of return.\n\nFirst, to measure the values of output and input it is customary to\nexclude the value of capital gains from the value of input rather than to\ninclude the value of such gains in the value of output. This convention\nhas the virtue that the value of output may be calculated directly from\nthe value of transactions. Second, to measure total factor productivity,\ndepreciation is frequently excluded from both input and output; this\nconvention is adopted, for example, by Kendrick [12]. Exclusion of\ndepreciation on capital introduces an entirely arbitrary distinction\nbetween labor input and capital input, since the corresponding exclusion\nof depreciation of the stock of labor services is not carried out.? To cal-\nculate the rate of return on all capital, our method is to subtract from\nthe value of output plus capital gains the value of labor input and of\nreplacement. This results in the rate of return multiplied by the value\nof accumulated stocks. The rate of return is calculated by dividing this\nquantity by the value of the stock.?

Concluding Comments\n\nI have argued that in the study of aggregative models it is useful to\nthink of technical knowledge as a public good of production, while the\nlevel of inventive activity (the process of production of knowledge) is\ndependent upon the amount of economic resources devoted to that\nactivity. Of course, invention is a particularly risky form of social\ninvestment. In my model, a given fraction of inventions is \"successful,\"\nthus removing the difficult decision problems associated with uncer-\ntainty. Perhaps this is a legitimate approximation in a macroeconomic\nmodel. On the other hand, differential equation (2) represents the most\nunsatisfactory simplification in the model. A complete theory should\nexplicitly treat the problems of transmission of knowledge, e.g., educa-\ntion, book publishing, etc., and its effect upon the efficiency of different\ngenerations of the labor force and different vintages of capital. Finally,\nthe recent contribution of Kennedy [6] warns us that additions to\ntechnical knowledge should not be thought of as increasing efficiency\nin any specified way. That is, the ''bias of technical progress,\" whether\nin a stylized economy or in a planned economy, should be a subject for\neconomic decision.\n", "AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n", "68\n"], "6": ["equivalent of the imputed value of gross national product.

Introduction\n\nIn at least two recent models of economic growth, the rate of techni-\ncal change depends upon other economic variables. The first, a model\nintroduced by Kaldor [3] [4] [5], assumes a positive relationship (the\ntechnical progress function) between relative changes in productivity\nper worker and relative changes in gross investment. The technical pro-\ngress function is an eclectic amalgam summarizing basic technical and\ninstitutional forces in a free enterprise economy. Kaldor takes the\nSchumpeterian view that the creation of new ideas largely occurs at\nan autonomous rate, but that the implementation of these new tech-\nniques by entrepreneurs can be explained by economic phenomena.\nObviously, if the implementation of a new technique requires new capi-\ntal equipment as opposed to mere organizational change, increased pro-\nductivity can only be transmitted through new (gross) investment. In\naddition, Kaldor argues that for a capitalist economy the higher the\nrelative rate of gross investment the higher the degree of \"technical\ndynamism.\" Technical dynamism is a mass measure of entrepreneurial\npsychology including the readiness to adopt new methods of production.\n\nIn the second model with endogenous technical change, Arrow [1]\nconcentrates upon the relation between learning and experience. Eco-\nnomic learning results in higher productivity, while cumulative gross\ninvestment is the measure of economic experience. Therefore, in refining\nthe technical progress function, Arrow explicitly postulates that produc-\ntivity per worker is determined by accumulated gross investment. The\nproduction of new technical knowledge (invention) and the transmission\nand application of that knowledge (innovation) are treated as by-\nproducts in the production and adoption of new capital goods.\n\nWhile it is doubtlessly true that technical change is related to gross\ninvestment both as a by-product of capital goods production and as a\nvehicle for embodying new techniques in new capital equipment, it is\nalso true that the rate of production of technical knowledge can be in-\ncreased by increasing the allocation of economic resources explicitly\ndevoted to inventive activity.\n\n* Research for this paper was supported in part by National Science Foundation Grant\nGS-95, *Economic Growth of the United States.\"\n62\n", "TOWARD A THEORY OF INVENTIVE ACTIVITY\nAND CAPITAL ACCUMULATION*\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Karl Shell"], "stable_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1821268"}, "1821269": {"affiliations": {"raw": {"7": ["theoretical level of technology has been treated as exogenous. Finally,\nit might be useful to build a model which combines elements of both the\nfirst and second model: the rate of technical progress in practice may\ndepend both upon the length of time during which a new technique has\nbeen in existence and upon its profitability. But we hope that these two\nmodels may be a useful starting point.\n\nIV. Concluding Remarks\n\nThe general subject at this session is the relationship between capital\nstructure and technological progress. Recalling that the process of\neducation can be viewed as an act of investment in people that educated\npeople are bearers of human capital, we see that this paper has relevance\nto that subject. For, according to the models presented here, the rate of\nreturn to education is greater the more technologically progressive is\nthe economy. This suggests that the progressiveness of the technology\nhas implications for the optimal capital structure in the broad sense. In\nparticular, it may be that society should build more human capital rela-\ntive to tangible capital the more dynamic is the technology.\n\nAnother point of relevance for social investment policy may be men-\ntioned. If innovations produce externalities, because they show the way\nto imitators, then education\u2014by its stimulation of innovation\u2014also\nyields externalities. Hence, the way of viewing the role of education in\neconomic growth set forth here seems to indicate another possible source\nof a divergence between the private and social rate of return to educa-\ntion.\n\nFinally, the connection between education and growth which we have\ndiscussed has a significant implication ior the proper analysis of eco-\nnomic growth. Our view suggests that the usual, straightforward inser-\ntion of some index of educational attainment in the production function\nmay constitute a gross misspecification of the relation between education\nand the dynamics of production.\n", "CAPITAL THEORY\n", "75\n"], "6": ["(12)\n", "(1)\n", "the equilibrium gap is given by\nT()) \u2014 A*()) 20\u00c0\n\nan A\" 30\n\nIn a technologically stangnant economy (A\u2014 0), the gap approaches zero\nfor every 50.

The pertinent fea-\nture of this kind of production function is this: The *marginal produc-\ntivity\" of education, which is a function of the inputs and the current\ntechnology, can remain positive forever even if the technology is sta-\ntionary. In the models we shall later introduce, education has a positive\npayoft only if the technology is always improving.\n\nWe shall consider now the importance of education for a particular\nfunction requiring great adaptation to change. We then propose two\nmodels which these considerations suggest.\n\nIL. The Hypothesis\n\nWe suggest that, in a technologically progressive or dynamic econ-\nomy, production management is a function requiring adaptation to\nchange and that the more educated a manager is, the quicker will he be\nto introduce new techniques of production. To put the hypothesis\nsimply, educated people make good innovators, so that education speeds\nthe process of technological diffusion.\n\nEvidence for this hypothesis can be found in the experience of United\nStates agriculture! It is clear that the farmer with a relatively high\nlevel of education has tended to adopt productive innovations earlier\nthan the farmer with relatively little education. We submit that this is\nbecause the greater education of the more educated farmer has in-\ncreased his ability to understand and evaluate the information on new\nproducts and processes disseminated by the Department of Agriculture,\nthe farm journals, the radio, seed and equipment companies, and so on.?\nThe better educated farmer is quicker to adopt profitable new processes\nand products since, for him, the expected payoff from innovation is\nlikely to be greater and the risk likely to be smaller; for he is better\nable to discriminate between promising and unpromising ideas, and\nhence less likely to make mistakes. The less educated farmer, for whom\nthe information in technical journals means less, is prudent to delay the\nintroduction of a new technique until he has concrete evidence of its\nprofitability, like the fact that his more educated friends have adopted\nthe technique with success.\n\nThis phenomenon, that education speeds technological diffusion, may\ntake different forms outside of agriculture. In large, industrial corpora-\n\n1See E. M. Rogers, Diffusion of Innovations (Free Press, 1962), especially Chap. 6.\n\n* To be sure, some of the correlation described between education and diffusion may be\nspurious. Some farmers are undoubtedly both progressive and educated because they come\nfrom progressive and prosperous farming families that could afford to give them an education.\nBut there is no question that educated farmers do read technical, innovation-describing\n\nliterature more than do less educated farmers\u2014and presumably because they find it profit-\nable to do so.\n", "AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n", "70\n"], "1": ["I. Introduction\n\nMost economic theorists have embraced the principle that certain\nkinds of education\u2014the three R's, vocational training, and higher edu-\ncation\u2014equip a man to perform certain jobs or functions, or enable a\nman to perform a given function more effectively. The principle seems\na sound one. Underlying it, perhaps, is the theory that education en-\nhances one's ability to receive, decode, and understand information,\nand that information processing and interpretation is important for\nperforming or learning to perform many jobs.\n\nIn applying this principle we find it fruitful to rank jobs or functions\naccording to the degree to which they require adaptation to change or\nrequire learning in the performance of the function. At the bottom of\nthis scale are functions which are highly routinized: e.g., running a\npower saw or diagnosing a malfunction in an automobile. In these func-\ntions, the discriminations to be made and the operations based on them\nremain relatively constant over time. In the other direction on this\nscale we have, for example, innovative functions which demand keeping\nabreast of improving technology. Even a highly routinized job may\nrequire considerable education to master the necessary discriminations\nand skills. But probably education is especially important to those\nfunctions requiring adaptation to change. Here it is necessary to learn\nto follow and to understand new technological developments.\n\nThus far, economic growth theory has concentrated on the role of\neducation as it relates to the completely routinized job. In its usual,\nrather general form, the theory postulates a production function which\nstates how maximum current output depends upon the current services\nof tangible capital goods, the current number of men performing each\nof these jobs, the current educational attainments of each of these job-\nholders, and time. To simplify matters, some analysts have specified a\nproduction function in which output depends upon tangible capital and\n\"effective labor\"; the latter is a weighted sum of the number of workers,\nthe weight assigned to each worker being an increasing function of that\nworker's educational attainment. This specification assumes that highly\neducated men are perfect substitutes for less educated men (in the\ntechnical sense that the marginal rate of substitution between them is\nconstant).

If we concentrate attention\non those countries of South America, Asia, and Africa that would seem\nto be most in need of help in developing their vehicular capacity and\nleast likely or least inclined to develop internal production of vehicles,\nwe find that the available supply of vehicles is shockingly small. Cer-\ntainly it is less than will be required if these countries are to make full\nor best use of highways now being constructed or planned. More indi-\nvidual highway transport also would seem useful in achieving the ex-\npansion of market agriculture now sought in many development plans.\n\nTo be specific, the total automobile population of Africa, Asia, and\nLatin America (exclusive of Communist countries, the Union of South\nAfrica, Rhodesia, Israel, Japan, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico) can be\nestimated as little over 3.5 million [1] [5]. The equivalent figure for\ntrucks and buses is approximately 2.0 million. By way of contrast,\ntotal vehicular registrations in the United States today are just short\nof 90.0 million. The United States scraps over 6.0 million vehicles per\nyear of which approximately 800,000 are trucks and buses and some-\nwhat under one million more are station wagons that might be expected\nto have considerable value for commercial transportation in less de-\nveloped countries [1]. Of course, some four-door sedans might also be\nuseful (as taxis, jitneys or for light-freight hauling). On a conservative\nestimate, therefore, today's scrappage rate in the United States would\nbe sufficient to almost double the present stock of commercial vehicles\nin these less developed countries in one year.\n\nThe major point of this paper, however, is not to recommend any\nspecific solution to the transport problems of the less developed coun-\ntries. Indeed, it seems fairly safe that one cannot recommend one uni-\nversal panacea that will meet the needs of all of these countries equally\nwell. A fairly detailed analysis, involving both engineering and eco-\nnomics and incorporating an evaluation of the total system effects,\nseems required in each case. That detail, moreover, would seem to be a\nprerequisite to intelligently analyzing the questions so often raised\nabout \"labor intensity versus up-to-date technology.\" Actually, the very\ndichotomization of *labor intensive versus up-to-date\" may be rather\nirrelevant in many instances. In transport, \"capital saving\" rather\nthan \"up-to-date\" or *labor intensive\" would seem to be the key con-\nsideration, though even this generalization is subject to significant ex-\nceptions. Up-to-date equipment generally will be attractive if recent\nimprovements have led to considerable capital saving per unit of out-\nput, as well as laborsaving or service improvements. By contrast, if re-\ncent technological change has not induced any significant changes in\n"], "6": ["88 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nneeds by reducing average operating speeds and by placing reliance on\na fleet with less total horsepower. Similarly, if cars are not manufac-\ntured within the country and must be imported, the transport costs per\nvehicle should not be greatly affected by substituting used for new ve-\nhicles and, if anything, might be slightly reduced. The transport costs\nto be amortized per unit of output would, though, normally increase.\n\nAt any rate, an initial assessment of the cost relationships (though\none that could use refinement) strongly suggests that for a given ex-\npenditure of foreign exchange on used vehicles a considerably greater\ntotal potential volume of transportation output often should be pur-\nchasable. The exact extent of the advantage will vary, of course, from\none area to another and will depend on the level of ocean freight rates,\nthe existing indigenous capability for vehicle parts manufacture, and\nthe extent to which existing maintenance practices on new vehicles re-\nduce maintenance requirements as vehicles age. Given that a certain\nlevel of transport capability is to be achieved, the essential choice is\nbetween large initial expenditures of foreign exchange (on new vehi-\ncles or new auto manufacturing machinery) with lower vehicular main-\ntenance costs later, or smaller initial outlays of foreign exchange (for\nused vehicles) but with higher subsequent outlays for maintenance.\nThe high discount rates commonly recommended for evaluating for-\neign exchange expenditures by the less developed countries implies an\nadvantage for the timing of outlays associated with the second of these\ntwo alternatives. Furthermore, to the extent that auto manufacture is\nmarked by more scale economies than parts manufacture and vehicle\nrehabilitation, some advantage, at least initially, should reside with\nused vehicles.\n\nThe question arises, of course, of why this substitution of used for\nnew vehicles has not already occurred on a greater scale if these econo-\nmies are indeed achievable. The answer would appear to lie in a num-\nber of considerations, the most important of which seems to be the na-\nure of excise taxes and import quotas imposed by the less developed\ncountries. In large measure, these policies discriminate against used\nvehicles. Since a common justification for the quotas and taxes is con-\nservation of foreign exchange, perhaps one way out of the tangle is for\nthe United States to inaugurate a \"cars for peace\"? program parallel to\nits *food for peace\" program. The objective would be to accept pay-\nment for used cars in soft currency. As a by-product, disposal of some\nof our used vehicles would help reduce the flow over time to our junk-\nyards\u2014eyesores which have attracted much attention of late.\n\n\"The potential returns from substituting used for new vehicles in less\n"], "5": ["ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 87\n\nwith the rather well-developed tradition of sending any and almost all\nused airplanes, ferry boats, ships, and, to a lesser extent, railroad and\nurban transit equipment. The logic of transferring more used vehicles\nwould be to transfer automobiles and trucks from high to low labor\ncost economies at some point in their life when the labor required for\nmaintenance becomes relatively substantial. Buses, trucks, and autos\nare examples far excellence of technologies that have had relatively\nfew recent innovations that effectuate important capital savings and\nthus would appear to be particularly suitable for transfer to less de-\nveloped countries when in a used condition. To put the matter\ndifferently, most recent improvements in commerical highway vehicles,\nparticularly in the United States, have been mainly aimed at saving\nlabor.\n\nFor those who would object that vehicular maintenance requires a\ndegree of skill not commonly encountered in less developed countries,\nit should be observed that many of these countries do an uncommonly\ngood job of such maintenance today. Indeed, a considerable ability to\nmake \"creative adaptations\" in European and American vehicles to\nmake them more suitable for Asian, African, and South American con-\nditions has been displayed. Of course, spare parts may pose a problem.\nBut as a rule the manufacture of spare parts should be considerably\nsimpler than manufacture or fabrication of complete automobiles, as\nmany of the larger less developed countries now attempt. At a mini-\nmum, specialized rehabilitation of vehicles and manufacture of some\nspare parts would seem to be considerably more industrially feasible\nfor the smaller of the less developed countries than development of a\ncomplete automobile industry. Furthermore, cannibalization of scrapped\nvehicles for spare parts would be marginally more attractive in less de-\nveloped countries than in North America because of lower labor costs;\nthus, as the less developed countries accumulated a larger stock of ve-\nhicles the spare parts problem would be partially self-correcting. In-\ndeed, by making cannibalization marginally more attractive, some re-\nduction in the number of very old vehicles might be induced which, in\nturn, would reduce overall fleet maintenance costs.\n\nAnother argument commonly tendered against employment of used\nhighway vehicles in less developed countries is the possibility that a\nconsiderable expansion of highway fleets would generate an intolerable\nincrease in petroleum imports in some cases. This would seem to be a\ngeneral argument against use of any highway vehicles in such coun-\ntries or an argument for purchase of used European rather than Amer-\nican vehicles. Actually, employment of used rather than new vehicles\nshould have only a very slight effect upon total fuel consumption per\nunit of output. Furthermore, used vehicles might even reduce fuel\n"], "4": ["86 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nimports for petroleum and is short of foreign exchange, railroads can\nhave an attraction over highways. This would be particularly true if\nthe country has coal and its railroads are steam driven or has consider-\nable hydroelectric power and an electrified rail system. Any foreign ex-\nchange advantage of railroads, however, can easily be exaggerated\neven in circumstances where the country has no indigenous petroleum\nreserves. It is usually easier to conceive of a country developing import\nsubstitution in the supply of vehicles and parts for a highway system\nthan for rail.\n\nMany intriguing possibilities for factor and technological substitu-\ntion occur when contemplating different highway transport systems\n[2]. For example, it is tempting to conclude a priori that American\nand European highway engineers have been entirely too prone to apply\nthe engineering and specifications developed within the context of\nNorth American and European experience to less developed economies.\nAs Kindleberger has aptly put it: *AIl too frequently it is the techno-\nlogically culture-bound expert from the developed country, rather than\nthe politicians of the underdeveloped, who need . . . an . . . understand-\ning of elementary economics\" [4, p. 183]. To be specific, many (in-\ncluding myself) have challenged whether less developed countries real-\nly need roads engineered to modern North American standards, say\nwith twelve-foot lanes, six- to ten-inch pavements, six- to ten-foot\nshoulders, etc.\n\nOn closer inspection, however, it would appear that highway engi-\nneers in applying the standards and specifications of Europe and\nNorth America to less developed countries may well have been doing\napproximately the right thing\u2014albeit sometimes for the wrong rea-\nsons. (This is not to deny that in many instances they may have over-\nbuilt, at least partially or temporarily.) Whenever volumes achieve a\nrather nominal level, reasonably good roads seem to be justified in less\ndeveloped countries for much the same reason as modern airplanes.\nGood roads permit higher operating speeds, and thus conserve on vehic-\nular capital required per unit of output. Also, they reduce tire wear,\nvehicular maintenance, and the rate of physical depreciation of the ve-\nhicle as well as saving on operating labor. Furthermore, as often noted,\ngood roads reduce road maintenance requirements, and road mainte-\nnance can be a somewhat difficult function to organize in some less de-\nveloped countries.\n\nIn general, possibilities for achieving economies in highway trans-\nportation in less developed countries would seem to lie more with the\nvehicles than with the highways. Specifically, there has been only lim-\nited transfer of used cars, trucks, and buses from Europe and North\nAmerica to the less developed countries of the world. This contrasts\n"], "3": ["ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 85\n\ncost advantage may shift to the used propeller plane. However, any\ncapital cost saving on depreciated piston aircraft is likely to be so\nsmall as to be offset by other savings. For example, the simpler main-\ntenance of turbine engines is a particular source of appeal and cost re-\nductions in less developed countries. Furthermore, while flight crew\npersonnel required for aircraft operation are normally available at\nlower salaries in less developed countries than in Europe or North\nAmerica, these salaries are still not inconsequential, so that laborsav-\ning remains attractive. In short, jet aircraft appear to be thoroughly\ndominant in a technological sense. Piston craft will be attractive \u00edn less\ndeveloped countries only if opportunity costs on capital and foreign\nexchange are extremely high (which, of course, they sometimes can\nbe) or if the route structure has a very low density and many short\nhops. (Actually, two-engine planes of post-World War II vintage re-\nequipped with turbo-prop engines\u2014a bit of old and new\u2014can be the\nmost economic in such circumstances.)\n\nIn the important road versus rail choice, by contrast, the adherents\nof a more labor intensive approach are likely to receive comfort. How-\never, to the extent trucking is considered the more up-to-date as well\nas labor intensive technology, there is some support for both views.\nSpecifically, road transport would seem to have a potentially greater\neconomic role (relative to railroads) in less developed countries than\nin Europe or North America [3] [5] [6]. The choice, though, is only\nvery partially explained by the labor inputs required. Any advantage\nof trucks or buses over railroads in less developed countries largely de-\nrives from two factors. First, low volume densities commonly occur on\ntraffic corridors in less developed countries, particularly in South\nAmerica and Africa, and highway vehicles tend to be more economic\nthan railroads under such circumstances. Second, railroading generally\nrequires much more centralized and sophisticated management and\ncontrol than trucking, and the required sophistication is not always\nfound in the less developed countries. As one major consequence, the\nquality of rail services in some parts of Asia, Africa, and South Ameri-\nca can be markedly inferior to the quality of such services available in\nEurope or North America, while the quality of truck services usually is\nnot. Slow deliveries, of course, increase inventory costs which, in turn,\nfurther increase the total relative capital requirements of a rail system.\n\nNeedless to say, roads will not supplant all need for railroads in less\ndeveloped countries. Where heavy volumes of bulk commodities, par-\nticularly minerals, are to be moved and no water transportation is\navailable, the railroad almost invariably will be the most economical\nchoice. For these bulk commodities, service considerations usually do\nnot loom large. Furthermore, if the country is very dependent upon\n", "85\n"], "2": ["84 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nnatural resources as a means of earning badly needed foreign ex-\nchange. At any rate, most (though by no means all) less developed\ncountries need more transportation capacity if they are to develop eco-\nnomically. The questions, therefore, are not whether to provide more\ntransport, but how much and how.\n\nFinding answers to these questions quite clearly involves both engi-\nneering and economics or issues very commonly formulated today\nunder the headings of \"operations research\" or \"systems analyses.\"\nFurthermore, a consideration of the engineering and economic details\nstrongly suggests that it is difficult to generalize the findings. In trans-\nportation, at least, some support can be found for any and all of the\ngeneral positions that have previously been assumed on these issues of\n*]abor intensity versus up-to-date technology.\" Examples and counter-\nexamples abound.\n\nIn some applications, very modern technology would indeed seem to\nbe justified\u2014technology in some cases beyond the normal range of ex-\nisting commercial application in the industrialized countries. Thus,\nhelicopter and vertical (or, more accurately, short-distance) take-off\naircraft have very real applicability in certain less developed countries\nas devices for opening up new territory or uniting geographic areas\nseparated by difficult water or other geographical barriers [5]. The\nrole of any relatively *exotic\" technology, however, is likely to be lim-\nited to an initial period until more permanent and less costly conven-\ntional transportation, usually on the ground, becomes available. There\nis, of course, nothing startlingly new about this: it has been recognized\nfor some while in Alaska, the Canadian North, and more recently in\nAlgeria, Colombia, Pakistan, and Peru, among other places.\n\nAir transport, in fact, generally provides strong support for those\nwho adhere to the position that a modern technology is best for less\ndeveloped countries (5] [7]. Air transport of a utilitarian type often\nmay have a greater relative role to play as a basic passenger mode.\nThis will be particularly true if the distance between major cities is\nrelatively great or the cities are separated by rugged geographic bar-\nriers, as in Colombia, for example. Furthermore, if a decision has been\nmade to use air transport in some application, it very often is advanta-\ngeous for a less developed country to use modern jets rather than used\npiston aircraft. This should be particularly true as the new generation\nof two-engine jets become more available. Because of much higher\nspeed and simple maintenance which permits more hours of daily utili-\nzation, a modern jet normally can produce many more seat miles of\ntransportation for a given dollar of initial investment than older pro-\npeller driven aircraft were able to do when new.

In ab-\nbreviated form the issue has been stated as that of \"labor intensive\nversus up-to-date technology\" [4, Chap. 10]. It is, of course, conceiva-\nble, and in a few cases perhaps even practically possible, to use rela-\ntively more labor advantageously with a modern technology. Also, an\nolder piece of capital equipment may not necessarily embody an out-\ndated technology, may little affect labor requirements, and may be\nworthy of consideration mainly because of savings in capital cost.\nSimilarly, a useful distinction can be drawn between the problems of\nchoosing between industries with different capital requirements and\nthe problem of choosing between more or less capital-oriented technol-\nogies for performing a specific industrial or other economic function.\nIn short, the problem is considerably more complex than choosing be-\ntween a labor intensive or an up-to-date technology.

This may account for the seemingly paradoxical em-\nphasis on industrial development by predominantly agricultural low-\nproductivity societies; since the ineradicable differences in the natural\nparameters of agriculture (and also the very deep differences in the\nsocial circumstances of agriculture) in low-productivity vis-\u00e0-vis high-\nproductivity societies probably makes it more difficult to adapt ad-\nvanced agricultural technologies than to adapt advanced industrial\ntechnologies for assimilation.\n\nWhether or not it will be economic to use a particular technology\nwill depend on the cost pattern of materials, of equipment, of energy\nsources, of the various skills of labor, and of access to markets.\nDifferences in cost patterns will check the transference of advanced\ntechnologies. Particularly significant are cost differences which reflect\nthe relative lack of skilled labor in low-productivity economies. An\nadaptation of advanced technology to this lack may call for the use of\na less costly accumulation of producer's durables per unit of output,\nLe., for \"low capital intensity\" techniques, than is usual in high-pro-\nductivity economies\u2014or it may call for exactly the opposite.

He also observed that there\nexisted in India a number of highly trained and very able mathemati-\ncians and scientists who might be mobilized to design and introduce\nfully automated industrial processes where the need for ordinary in-\ndustrial skills would be minimal.

It is to adapt advanced technol-\nogy's very mechanism for adaptation and for further advance.\n\nAn instance of development-oriented science, familiar to this au-\ndience, is that of development economics.

This suggests another fact. The capacity to\nadapt advanced technology to the requisites of low-productivity soci-\neties need not be wholly indigenous to those societies.

The rate of \"production of invention\" depends on the\nprofitability of the inventive activity.

Since labor's share is the larger, there will be\na tendency for innovations to be laborsaving. To demonstrate this,\nKennedy makes use of a transformation relationship between reduc-\ntions in capital cost and reductions in labor cost which is implicitly as-\nsumed to be symmetric. Professor P. A. Samuelson has shown that if\nrelative shares are not technically determined, as in the Cobb-Douglas\nproduction functions, the argument leads to the paradoxical result that\nin equilibrium labor and capital shares will be equalized.'? With other\nstrong assumptions about the nature of the production functions and\nthe relative growth rate of capital and labor, Samuelson is able to de-\nduce a laborsaving bias for inventions. However, against such argu-\nments for an inherent laborsaving bias, Samuelson and Salter have\nargued that entrepreneurs in seeking out inventions are interested only\nin reducing total costs. In pursuing this goal, and without knowledge\nas to the relative ease with which labor- or capital-saving cost reductions\ncan be achieved, there is no reason to believe they will have a tendency\ntoward either labor- or capital-saving innovations.

It might then be argued that whatever the factor\nbias in the invention which created the technology, the relatively capi-\ntal intensive factor combinations resulting from input substitution are\n\"frozen\" into the design of standard equipment. In turn, the less de-\nveloped countries may face the alternative of either buying the stan-\ndard equipment or paying higher prices for equipment especially de-\nsigned for their own factor intensities. In either case the input substi-\ntution which potentially exists in a technology does not become as\nfully available to the less developed countries as to the advanced coun-\ntries, due to economies of scale in manufacturing equipment for the\nlatter.\n"], "8": ["ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 105\n\npriori judgments about these are difficult. For example, risk elements\nin costs associated with new technologies are often considered to be\nmore significant in less developed than in advanced countries. Even if\nthis is so, such cost di\u00edferentials may be offset in the less developed\ncountries by a greater assurance as to revenues which derives from\ngovernment protection or the monopoly position which is often associ-\nated with new products or processes in less developed countries.\n\nThe extensive debate in the literature on the choice of technology in\nless developed countries is relevant to the dispersion of technological\ninnovations. The debate has, for the most part, been addressed to the\nnormative question: *What is the optimal choice of technique in the\nless developed countries?\" Though the issues have not been fully re-\nsolved, it is now clear that the answer takes the form: *It depends on\nthe content of the development goals and whether there are any rela-\ntions between their attainment and the technology other than the di-\nrect contribution of output to the national product.\" When the goals\ninclude achievement of a certain growth or employment rate and these\nin turn are related to the savings rates from the different factor shares\nwhich in turn depend on the relative input intensities, the optimal\nchoice of technology may well be different than it otherwise would be.\nThe normative discussion has not, however, culminated in practical\nmeasures to control technological choice other than the suggestion of\nsubsidies or government exhortation.

Though the qualitative analysis in this case will be\nthe same for less developed countries as for advanced countries, the\nparticular quantitative results in technical dispersion may vary sub-\nstantially due to the different weights of the controlling factors.

In many of the less developed countries it would be unusual and\nsocially not acceptable for a productive enterprise to be organized as a\nfirm employing labor and other resources by impersonal contracts in\norder to maximize profits. The predominant form of social organiza-\ntion for work is often the extended family or the tribe or the govern-\nment firm with no inclination to maximize its profits A brief analysis\nof one such case will help to indicate some of the difficulties in identi-\nfying the sources of technical change and the reasons for the use of\nfactors in different relative intensities. Suppose in Figure 1 the line\nOABCD represents the conventional total product curve for a family\nfarm. In many countries the farm simply accommodates as many\nproducers and consumers as there are in the extended family.* It is ra-\ntional to treat the subsistence requirements of the available laborers as\na fixed cost and to maximize the output which can be achieved with\nthat labor.* If the family grows in a Malthusian way and subsistence\nrequirements are indicated by the slope of the line OB, the size of the\nfamily will grow until Ls laborers are available and the family will pro-\nduce at B.\n\nFamilies of size less than Ls will be able to save and invest and in this\nway be able to shift the total product curve upward to, say, OA'B'C'.\nWith perfect capital markets even the Malthusian family at B could\nalways borrow, invest, and obtain more output but there is no reason\nto suppose such perfection in rural, subsistence farming. On the other\nhand, such behavior should not be surprising, and, in fact, there appears\nto be evidence that it does occur. It may be noted that families with a\nlower level of subsistence, as indicated by the slope OD, might expand\nuntil L\u00bb amount of labor was available, even though the marginal pro-\nductivity of labor beyond Lc is zero. In a family-organized, subsistence\nagriculture, it would not in fact be surprising to find farms at various\npoints along such O4 BC D or OA\" B'C'D' curves, since the ordinary com-\npetitive pressures would not exist.\n\n? As a fairly typical example see Kusum Nair's Blossoms in the Dust (London, 1961).\n\n*Though the particular implications to be drawn from the analysis have not been\nstressed before, I believe, it is related to that of Professor A. K. Sen, Choice of Tech-\nniques (Oxford, 1960), and recently, Professors J. Fei and G. Ranis, Development of the\nLabor Surplus Economy (Yale, 1964), as well as some of my own previous work.\n\n5]If the ratio of work force members to nonmembers is fixed, the discussion can be\nconducted, as here, in terms of the number of laborers in the work force and their sub-\nsistence defined to include the requirements for their proportionate share of those in the\n\nfamily who are not members of the working force. Otherwise it becomes slightly more\ncomplicated to make the simple point of the argument presented.\n"], "4": ["* Transforming Traditional Agriculture (New Haven, 1964), Chap. 3.\n", "II. Innovation in Less Developed. Countries\n\nThere are theories of the condition of the less developed countries in\nwhich technical change is not mentioned but these should not be taken\nas implying a subsidiary role for such change. Economic development\nis seldom envisaged as a scalar expansion of all productive factors and\noutputs in some original set of proportions. Thus, when the \"vicious\ncircle of poverty\" or the need for \"infrastructure\" or the arguments\nabout *balanced growth\" are adduced, the omission of discussion of\ntechnical change is usually only a convenient device for the purpose of\nobtaining greater insight into the role of other factors. The omission is\nto some extent, however, a reflection of the paucity of our understand-\ning and practical knowledge. For example, it is easy to criticize most\nof the various quantitative development planning models on the\ngrounds of their omission of technical change. Yet, in many of the\nmodels there is in principle no barrier to the embodiment of changes in\ntechnical coefficients. The difficulty is in the lack of a theoretical and\nempirical basis to predict such changes.\n\nWe may make headway in appreciating the barriers to achievement\nof the most effective factor combinations in less developed countries by\nexamining some of the customary assumptions, starting with that of ra-\ntional profit maximization. There is an abundant literature with the\ntheme that lack of development is characterized by the absence of pur-\nposive, profit maximizing rationality. This is often accompanied by the\nargument, as in some theories of the \"rise of capitalism,\" that the ap-\npearance of such rationality will as a natural consequence lead to eco-\nnomic growth. Though the examination of situations characterized by\nthe absence of profit maximizing rationality would be of general inter-\nest, the only object here is to indicate the possible effects on the tech-\nnology used.\n\nIrrationality may take the form of acceptance of new technologies\nsimply because of a faith in modernity as well as an uncritical perse-\nverance with traditional methods. This point has been made before.\n\"Though there is an underground of stories which are told of technologi-\ncal *mistakes,\" a judgment as to their quantitative significance is diffi-\ncult. For example, on the one hand we have Professor Theodore Schultz,\nwho argues that peasants in less developed countries have made a more\nor less optimal adjustment to their circumstances.?

The firm is concerned only with its revenues and costs.\nPerhaps it might be argued that there is greater uncertainty associated\nwith innovation as compared to factor substitution which justifies the\ndistinction at the level of the firm. But this need not be true at all for\nthe imitators of the first innovator, and, depending on the circum-\nstances, need not be true even for the first innovator.

Thus it will ordinarily\ntake some period of time for a new process innovation to become pre-\ndominant and for a change in input prices to work itself through an\neconomy. The speed of dispersion depends in part on the potential\nflexibility of the existing productive factors in entering into new input\ncombinations. Disembodied technical change, which is ordinarily taken\nto mean that it is not uniquely associated with a particular type of\ncapital, may or may not proceed more quickly than embodied innova-\ntions. Technologies are also embodied in labor skills and materials, and\nthese too have fixed cost elements which should be ignored in calcu-\nlating the current costs of the old technology but not in such calcula-\ntions for the new one.\n\n'The above discussion restates the various types of changes which\nmay lead to use of different input-output combinations in the produc-\ntion of already known goods and services: input substitution resulting\nfrom changes in their relative prices, a more efficient adjustment to\ngiven relative factor prices at preexisting output levels, the effects of\nchanges in the scale of output with given factor prices or the innova-\ntion of a new technology. In turning to a discussion of technical\nchange in less developed countries I shall try to observe these distinc-\ntions and ask whether there are special features of less developed\ncountries which act to impede the achievement of the most effective\ninput combinations.\n\nThere are economic as well as noneconomic theories of invention to\naccount for the appearance of new technologies and new products.

Product inno-\nvations, by which new goods are created, offer a different set of analyt-\nical challenges including the one of rigorously maintaining the process-\nproduct innovation distinction itself. *New\" goods in less developed\ncountries may be \"old\" goods in the more advanced countries. Their\nproduction raises questions of the relative effectiveness of investment\nin import substituting versus export gaining industries which I do not\nwish to take up here.\n\nProcess innovations in the less developed countries, as in the more\nadvanced, are generally taken to mean a change in \"technology\" with\na corresponding change in factor productivity. Engineers know what a\ntechnology is and identify processes by the character of the physical\nand chemical transformations involved or the equipment which pro-\nduces them. Economists on the other hand do not need to know about\nphysical and chemical processes and identify technologies by the\namounts of productive factors used and the associated outputs. The\nproduction function is simply a summary of all the alternative physi-\ncally efficient combinations of productive factors which are necessary\nfor different output levels. Because of the theoretical convenience,\neconomists are fond of representing production functions by smooth\nand continuous analytical functions. Technical change substitutes for\none set of factor inputs, which is required for a particular output, an-\nother set, which is superior in the sense that it uses less of at least one\nfactor. It is often represented as a change in all the possible factor\ncombinations associated with each possible level of output but need be\nonly a change in a particular factor combination.\n\nEconomists have customarily distinguished the actions of firms in\nchanging their input combinations because of changes in the relative\nprices of the inputs, i.e., factor substitution, from those changes due to\ninnovation of new technologies. This distinction has its origins in the\ndifferent sources of the causal factors. Changes in input prices are\ngiven a straightforward economic explanation in terms of changes in\ndemand and supply conditions of the inputs. The deeper reasons for\nsuch changes are in turn the subject of some of the more fundamental\nanalyses in economics. Even with constant factor prices, optimal input\nproportions can change with the scale of output unless the production\nfunction has the particular property of being homogeneous of the first\ndegree. The ascription of this property to production relations is usual-\nly a matter of theoretical convenience rather than one for which there\nis a strong empirical basis.\n\nThough the innovation-factor substitution distinction is certainly\n", "99\n"], "1": ["I. Introduction\n\nInvention and innovation in the less developed countries present\nparticular problems for analysis because of the special characteristics\nof the organization of their economies, their resource proportions and\ntheir relations with more advanced economies and partly because of\nthe intensity with which their economic growth is being pursued. In\nthis paper I hope only to illustrate rather than resolve the difficulties\nin understanding the role of technical change and in making policy for\nit.\n\n'The distinction which I shall adopt between invention and innova-\ntion is between the processes by which new products or processes are\ncreated and the actual implementation of the new processes and pro-\nduction of the new products.

The limited literature with which I am familiar\non the sociology of innovation suggests to me that the distinction is\nusually a matter of degree and that the psychological and cultural bar-\nriers to imitation of a technological change are often no less significant\nthan those to the first use. The innovation-imitation distinction may\nalso be given an economic interpretation in terms of the relative risks\ninvolved. It might be argued that except where monopolization is com-\nplete the first innovator creates a true externality which reduces risk:\nthe knowledge of his success or failure. But success or failure is not\nalways quickly identified, except in extreme cases, and even in the case\nof success in less developed countries neither the original innovator nor\nhis potential imitators may be fully aware of how much is due to the\nnew seed or new product, for example, or the special attention and fa-\nvors of government officials.\n\n'The role of process innovation in directly increasing factor produc-\n\n!

There would\narise, however, considerable costs in constructing the mathematical\nmodels of the economy, developing the necessary algorithms, writing\nthe programs for the computers, providing sufficient computer time,\nand transmitting data to the center and orders from the center.

My reason for\ncalling it *computopia\" is the belief that, even if computer experts and\ncommunications experts were able to solve the difficult technical prob-\nlems, economists will not be able to solve the problem of constructing\neconomic models that can be trusted to provide a basis for managing\nthe economy effectively and it will not be possible to obtain all the nec-\nessary data. Even if economists were able to construct a complete\nmodel of the economy, they would be forced to simplify it drastically\nto make it computationally feasible [28, pp. 97-101]. The imperfect\nknowledge of all the relevant variables and of the values of all the pa-\nrameters, the necessity to simplify, and the lag between the time the\nmodel construction began and the time the model is ready for use\n(U.S. experience with the construction of large models in the military\nsphere indicates the complexity of the task) all point to the fact that\nthere is likely to be a significant divergence between the model and\nreality. In addition, a computerized system can only give good results\nin those parameters that can be measured, programmed, and con-\ntrolled.

The fundamental problem is that consider-\nable dispersion of decision-making power is required to make this sys-\ntem work efficiently, and this brings forth the danger that the\nplanners may not be able to ensure that the results correspond closely\nenough to their preferences. A number of economists have, in fact,\nargued that a mixed system of this type would perform more poorly\nthan either a predominantly market economy or a predominantly com-\nmand economy [e.g., 5, pp. 190-92] [36, pp. 24-25].\n\nComputopia\n\n\"The visible hand represents an effort to reduce the burden placed on\nthe information system by reducing the volume of information that\nmust be handled at the center. It achieves this goal by operating pri-\nmarily on the organizational and motivational variables. The cybernet-\nic route, on the other hand, operates primarily on the informational\nvariable, to a much lesser extent on the organizational variable, and\nnot at all on the motivational variable.

Arrow has taken a similar position\nin arguing that one should accept the proposition, long recognized in\npractice and in management literature, that individuals in close con-\ntact with the productive processes cannot, even if they wanted to,\ntransmit all the necessary information in all its detail to someone re-\nmoved from these processes [1, p. 11].\n\nSoviet managers, as well as any managers whose performance is\njudged by the data they supply, have a very strong incentive to filter\nand bias the information [10, pp. 58 and 27, pp. 228-29]. It is easy to\nsee why a system in which planners do not depend on this flow of de-\ntailed information and can legitimately deal with aggregates may yield\npositive output effects, as well as reduce the input burden on the infor-\nmation system. This point has been stressed by McDonough, who has\nargued that a problem should be assigned to the most qualified individ-\nual or group, and *qualified\" is defined as the one who is able to make\nthe best decision in the shortest time with the smallest cost in terms of\ninformational inputs [25, pp. 127-31].\n\nA similar conclusion is reached by Richardson. He argues that com-\npetitive firms are limited by their inability to have at their disposal\nsufficient information with respect to investment actions by their com-\npetitors or their suppliers. On the other hand, central planners are lim-\nited by an inherent inability to get all the necessary information and\nprocess it perfectly. He concludes from this that the best results might\nbe obtained, in practice, by arrangements in which both competition\nand deliberate coordination\u2014public or private\u2014play some part [30,\npp. 29-34, 45].\n\nA somewhat different conclusion is reached by Martin, who argues\nthat it is not at all clear that the introduction of planning in a free en-\nterprise economy will yield superior informational efficiency compared\nwith an increase in informational outlays by individual firms [24].\n\nIn the visible hand, the informational efficiency at the enterprise\nlevel might be expected to be greater than under the present Soviet\nsystem.

The Yugoslav system would appear to\ncome closest to the visible hand of all existing systems. Among the\nvariants of the visible hand that have been proposed are those by O.\nLange in Poland [19], O. Sik in Czechoslovakia [33], and A. Birman\nin the Soviet Union [4].

This conclusion differs\nradically from that of Professor Liberman, who, in his latest article\n[21], argues strongly that there are no contradictions in the new re-\nforms and that they will work very well.\n\nInvisible Hand\n\nAt first glance, it might seem that the purely competitive market\nsystem, the invisible hand, would have the greatest informational\nefficiency. It has been claimed that prices are the only information\ngenerated in this system and constitute all the information necessary\nfor decision making [11, p. 526]. Since prices result from the free in-\nterplay of supply and demand, and there is no need for any control\nmechanism, virtually no resources would be needed in the information\nsubsystem, and we would get the most favorable input effect possible.\nIf, in addition, the purely competitive system provided the optimal\noutput mix and the maximum efficiency of production, i.e., the static,\nPareto-optimal *bliss point,\" and also the greatest dynamic efficiency,\nthen we would get the paradoxical result of having the most favorable\nqualitative and quantitative output effects from a virtual zero alloca-\ntion of resources to the information subsystem. There is no need to\nspend much time knocking down this straw man. It is, of course, not\ntrue that even in a purely competitive system the entrepreneurs are\nsatisfied with the information supplied to them by the current market\nprices of their inputs and outputs. Even in this extreme case, they\nwould want some information about future prices, since expectations\nmust necessarily enter into their calculations. Second, purely competi-\ntive markets are very rare and in imperfectly competitive markets\nfirms do invest considerable resources in information gathering and\nprocessing. In large firms, there is an additional need of information\nfor purposes of internal control. There exists a voluminous literature\ndealing with the question of market failures, explaining why purely\ncompetitive markets would not necessarily yield static or dynamic\nefficiency or the optimal mix of final goods [2].\n\nIt might seem that this whole discussion is beside the point, since\nthere is no possibility that Soviet leaders would agree to the institution\nof a purely competitive market system. The only reason for this dis-\ncussion is that it examines the informational efficiency of one extreme\npure model and throws some light on the probable results from moving\nin this direction by the institution of a visible hand regime.\n\nVisible Hand\n\nThere is no one particular model that could be said to represent the\nvisible hand.

Is it likely that any positive quantitative or qualitative output\neffects would result from a change in the role played by the informa-\ntion subsystem? I would argue that such effects might be expected, but\nmy expectation is that they would not be very significant. I believe\nthat this is true whether improvement is measured by an increase in\noutput or in the rate of growth of GNP (quantitative output effect) or\nby a rise in the value of the final bill of goods, when measured by true\nscarcity prices (qualitative output effect).\n\n\"There are several reasons for expecting some positive output effects,\ngiven the very favorable assumptions I have made. Decisions on how\nto produce are being partially shifted toward those who have at their\ndisposal the greatest amount of the most reliable information with the\nleast time lag.

With the\nweakening of the need for maintaining a \"safety factor\" by seeking\nlower plan targets or worrying about the \"ratchet effect\" [3, pp.\n76-78], it is possible that they will even produce a larger output. Two\nkey problems, however, are how the supply system is going to operate\nand whether the phenomenon of the sellers! market is going to con-\ntinue. In addition to stressing the faulty signals given by the existing\nprice system, critics of the Liberman proposals questioned whether it\nis possible to permit enterprises to determine freely how to produce, if\ntheir supplier enterprises are not free to choose what to produce [9]\n[32]. This same problem occurred in connection with the Bol'shevichka\nexperiment when customers wanted clothing made of a synthetic fab-\nric, but the Bol'shevichka association could not obtain this fabric [18].\nThe existence of the sellers! market will be one of the major factors\ndetermining the level of excess inventories held for safety purposes,\nthe quality of output, and the introduction of new technological inno-\nvations.\n\nI do not believe it very likely that prices will be made to correspond\nclosely to true scarcity values, that the centralized supply system will\nbe abandoned\" or that the ministries, glavki, and associations will re-\nfrain from bureaucratic interference.

But these crops require only\n6 or 7 percent of the total sown area.\n\nAnd, of course, not every aspect of technological improvement in the\nrest of agriculture has been so badly handled as I may have implied.\nBut on balance, the Soviet Union's experience in developing or adapt-\ning new techniques of production has been responsible for a significant\npart of the unsatisfactory performance of Soviet agriculture. While the\nhuge size and the organizational structure of state and collective farms\nhave adverse effects upon efficiency and output, the numerous and\ncostly mistakes in the promulgation of unsound techniques, the failure\nto provide inputs in the variety, quality, and quantity that was possi-\nble, and the efforts to dictate methods of production, such as rotations,\ntillage practices, and herds of livestock, on a national basis have per-\nhaps been as serious deterrents to productions.\n", "SOVIET ECONOMY\n", "153\n"], "8": ["152 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nproduce a pig weighing 100 kilograms compared to half that long in\nthe U.S. While part of the reason for the long feeding period has been\nthe limited availability of high protein feeds, much of the reason has\nbeen the pressure to meet goals for the number of hogs on farms. Other\nlivestock have been similarly affected. A complaint by a farm manager\nin July, 1964, merits noting:?\n\nOur collective farm once had 18 to 20 dairy cows per 100 hectares, with an average\nyield of 3,700 kg. . . . we had about 400 head, which fully provided for the sale of the\nestablished milk norm to the state and consumption within the farm itself.\n\nBut a few years ago the district set a control figure for us: We must have not less\nthan 800 cows! What could we do? The plan is the plan! We increased the number of\ncows to the figure set by the district but the milk yield fell to 2,000 kg. per cow. It\nturned out that while the herd was doubled, there was no longer enough conditioned\nfodder for the cows. ...\n\nThe new agricultural leadership has stated repeatedly that it is only\noutput and sales that counts. But has the lesson that livestock number\ngoals are inconsistent with efficiency and maximum livestock output\nbeen learned? I do not think so. I will have been proved wrong if the\nnext plan omits any mention of goals for livestock numbers. If it does,\nthe underlying inconsistencies will not have been removed.\n\nBrief notice may be taken of two important departures from\nefficiency in the use of resources. First, a recent article lauds the ad-\nvantages of moldboardless or disc plows in the virgin land areas.? It\nwas only a few years ago that Maltsev's deep plowing\u2014plowing up to\na meter deep\u2014was being recommended \u00edor the same region. Deep\nplowing not only did not increase yields on the average\u2014it probably\nreduced yields in areas with thin soils\u2014but it was extremely costly in\nterms of fuel and wear and tear on the tractors and in labor used. Sec-\nond, seeding rates for wheat and other small grains have always been\nhigh in the Soviet Union compared to Western Europe or North Amer-\nica. However, in recent years sowing norms have been increased to as-\ntronomical levels\u2014in many cases to 300 to 350 kilograms per hectare.\nIn many instances the amount of seed used would equal a fourth to a\nthird of the gross harvest in a good year and half or more in a bad\nyear.'?

I have\nin mind the scientific service, the introduction of scientific achievements. What is valuable\nin the American practice of organizing scientific service for the farmers? Concreteness, a\nbusinesslike attitude.\n\nIn the United States of America a farmers! service exists under the universities and\ncolleges. . . . How does this service work? It has inspectors, or agents, as the Americans\noften call them. The agents meet with the farmers and persuade them to introduce this\nor that method, help them in the organization or production and furnish them with\nplans and recommendations. . . .\n\nThe farmer pays for the scientific service. This payment is in the form of a tax levied in\nthe state budget. The farmers! funds are used to pay for the specialists who serve farm\nproduction.\n\n. . . f the farmer does not receive concrete help from the agent, he no longer turns to\nhim and the agent has to quit the service.\n\nThe reorganization that Khrushchev referred to was the establish-\nment of the production administrations in 1962 which were charged,\namong other things, with bringing new scientific developments to the\nattention of the farms. Among the other things for which the produc-\ntion administrations were responsible were procurements and plan\nfulfillment. It is obvious that Khrushchev did not understand all of the\nsecrets of the land grant system and the extension service. He did not\nunderstand that one of the unique features of the extension service was\nits disinterestedness with respect to government policies and programs.\nIt is of no concern to the county agent that the government wishes to\nrestrict corn or wheat production; if he can show the farmer how to\nincrease production of these crops and profit as a result, the county\nagent will do so. Nor are the agents expected to engage in propaganda\nactivities in support of government programs.\n\nBut the inspectors or agents lodged in the production administra-\ntions were clearly a part of the government apparatus that controlled\nagriculture. They must have been considered with the same suspicion\nas the rayon party chairman or a tax collector.\n\nThe United States almost made the same mistake as did Khrush-\nchev.

Corn and\nwinter wheat are not satisfactory partners in a rotation unless the ro-\ntation is long enough to permit planting a crop such as oats or barley\nbetween the corn and the wheat. If winter wheat is sown after corn,\nthe winter wheat will ordinarily not be sufficiently well established to\nwithstand the winter. Since Khrushchev campaigned so vigorously\nagainst oats, this crop could not be introduced into a corn and wheat\nrotation without earning disfavor.

Thus Brezh-\nnev felt compelled to state the following on March 24, 1965:*\n\nA few words about corn. In many regions of the country this crop gives high yields\nboth as grain and as silage, and it would be incorrect not to use its rich possibilities\nto strengthen the fodder base.

They have learned from bitter experience that many inno-\nvations have been worthless; in fact, many innovations have been\nmore than worthless\u2014they have increased costs and/or reduced out-\nput. Many of these disasters can be traced to Lysenko and his near\nmonopoly of agricultural biology for almost a quarter of a century. Lys-\nenko's innovations included vernalization of seeds, pinching back of\ncotton plants, the summer planting of potatoes, and forest shelter\nbelts. But Lysenko could not have been responsible for so many\nwrong-headed innovations without support from the highest places. He\nachieved this support from Stalin, and despite a year of critical discus-\nsion following Stalin's death, Lysenko emerged once again, this time\nwith Khrushchev's support. Lysenko achieved this support, in part at\nleast, because his innovations promised important increases in output\nwith little real cost to the nonagricultural sector of the economy.\n\nBut Lysenko was not the first of the oracles to receive acclaim. Be-\nfore Lysenko there was Williams with his grassland rotations. The\nmerit of grassland rotations was that they eliminated the need for\nchemical fertilizers\u2014an important consideration when there were so\nmany demands upon capital investment for industrialization.\n\nLysenko's theories of heredity and biology not only resulted in ad-\nverse changes but prevented others from occurring. Work on hybrid\ncorn was halted for approximately two decades because hybridization\nwas inconsistent with those theories.\n\nWhile perhaps not technological changes in the strict sense, the nu-\nmerous modifications of the concepts of desirable rotations and the\npressure from planning agencies to shift from one rotation to another\nmust have created serious doubts about the validity of almost any\nchange recommended from above. Williams! grassland rotation, which\nwas so long supported by Stalin, came under sharp attack by Khrush-\nchev. Millions of hectares of hay, meadows, and pastures were plowed\nup and planted to cultivated crops after 1960. As a part of the same\ncampaign, clean or black fallow was denigrated and reduced to mini-\nmal levels even in dry regions where the merits of fallow are most evi-\ndent.\n\nThe forced introduction of corn into winter wheat regions bears a\n"], "3": ["SOVIET ECONOMY 147\n\nthere appears to be little incentive to the farm machinery industry to\nintroduce new machines. Most of the time excess demand for the in-\ndustry's output has existed and the introduction of a new machine or\ndifferent kind of tractor may result in a failure to meet plan goals.*\nThus there has been a strong incentive to standardize output and to\nproduce long runs rather than to increase the variety of machines pro-\nduced.\n\nThere appears to have been a general failure to recognize the many\ncomplementarities that exist in the modernization of agriculture. While\nthere is some evidence that progress has been made in recent years, for\ntwo decades the emphasis upon combines to the exclusion of comple-\nmentary inputs may have meant that the heavy investment in com-\nbines resulted in relatively little overall labor saving and may have in-\ncreased the seasonal harvest peak in labor requirements. Without the\nauxiliary equipment for grain handling and drying and cleaning, the\nlabor requirements for harvesting grain with combines were usually no\nless and frequently greater than when the grain binder was used. The\ngrain binder allowed natural drying of the grain and made it possible\nto spread out threshing of the grain over several months if necessary.\nThe combining of grain must be done in a very brief period\u2014generally\nthree weeks or less.\n\n'Two other matters affecting the introduction of new inputs may be\nnoted briefly. First, there is no institutionalized way of rewarding indi-\nviduals or institutes for the actual introduction of new discoveries into\nuse. An invention or discovery is rewarded at the time it is made, rath-\ner than when the invention or discovery is used in practice. Second,\neven when new machines or other inputs are produced there does not\nexist an adequate organizational structure for the effective distribution\nto the regions or farms that could obtain the greatest benefit there-\nfrom. Machines are sent to farms that do not order them, while all too\noften machinery that is ordered never arrives or arrives with a major\ncomponent lacking such as the cutting bar on a combine. And the\nproblem of providing adequate spare parts is still far from solution.\n\n? B. G. Sivak, director of the Minsk tractor plant, discussed the problem of the intro-\nduction of new machines in this way: \"Tractor plants are now putting more economical\nand productive machines into production, but existing planning practice does not stimu-\nlate the rapid introduction of new machines. In the past six years the Minsk Tractor\nPlant has produced tractors of the same tvpe and has modernized the design and thus\nhas consistently fulfilled the production plan while maintaining the necessary technical\nand economic indices. The introduction of a new tractor into production would mean, in\naddition to difficulties of an organizational and technical nature, increases in our own\nproduction expenditures in the form of temporarily increased production costs and\nlarger labor expenditures. Despite the fact that new tractors would obviously be effective\nin the national economy, the planning agencies have not yet appropriated the money\nand materials needed to make them. As a result, we are in an inferior position with\n\nrespect to plants making obsolete tractors. . . .\" (Pravda, Mar. 9, 1962; translation in\nThe Current Digest of the Soviet Press, Apr. 11, 1962, p. 38.)\n", "147\n"], "2": ["Supply of New Inputs\n\nOne of the most serious restraints upon technological advancement\nin Soviet agriculture is the failure of industry to provide agriculture\nwith the appropriate inputs. In the United States, Western Europe,\nand Japan many significant technological advances are made available\nto agriculture through industries that sell inputs to agriculture. The\nknowledge that underlies the improved or new input may have come\nfrom public research, but the hybrid corn, the antibiotics, the herbi-\ncides, the vitamins, and the mineral feed supplements must be pro-\nduced and made available to the farmer.\n\nSoviet planning has been largely incapable either of anticipating the\nnature of economically justified machines or inputs such as medicines,\nfeed supplements, insecticides, or herbicides or have failed to give\nthese items a reasonable priority. For example, Soviet farms gain noth-\ning from the fact that herbicides can be used to control weeds effec-\ntively unless the decision is made and carried out to produce the herbi-\ncides in adequate variety and amount.'\n\nIn the design and production of farm inputs the Soviet Union has\nnot yet found an adequate substitute for the market test. Apparently\nrecognizing that manufacturing plants could not be trusted to disci-\npline themselves to produce machines of appropriate design and ac-\nceptable quality, given the planning rules under which the plants oper-\nated, all designs must be approved by machine testing plants.

Furthermore,\n\n? Khrushchev commented on the production of herbicides as follows: \"Two years ago\nthe Central Committee and the government adopted a decision on (the production of\nherbicides).

Or, to put the matter another way, this certainly does not\nmean changes in the stock of these assets can safely be ignored.\n\nGurley and Shaw argued that restriction of money supply growth to\ncurb inflation might induce expansion and innovation by nonbank in-\ntermediaries, leading to an increase in growth of money substitutes\n[17, pp. 228-46]. If money is defined narrowly as demand deposits\nand currency, the same argument might be applied to bank innovations\nthat increase the supply of time deposits or bank notes. A tentative de-\nscription by Milton Friedman and David Meiselman of the channels\nthrough which money supply changes operate implies a quite different\nhypothesis [11, pp. 217-22]. If the supply of narrowly defined money\ngrows more slowly than the demand for it, the public may try to con-\nvert other liquid assets into money in order to maintain cash balances\nat their desired level. This would have the effect of reducing the vol-\numes of bank time deposits and deposits in nonbank intermediaries\n(for any given set of deposit interest rates) rather than increasing\nthem. The converse would be true if the supply of money grows faster\nthan the quantity demanded; growth of time deposits and deposits in\nother intermediaries would increase. Studies of changes in intermedi-\nary deposits by David Fand, Warren Smith, Robert Parks, and Edgar\nFeige appear more consistent with the Friedman-Meiselman view than\nwith the Gurley-Shaw view, but the question is not settled [9] [10]\n[28] [29]. We badly need to learn more about the public's preferences\nfor demand and time deposits and other assets.\n\nThis raises the question of how fast the total liabilities (and assets)\nof the banking system can be permitted to grow without risking price\ninflation or deflation. Here again, we need to know more about the\nsubstitution relationships. As George Morrison has argued, \"shifts\nfrom demand to time deposits or from time deposits to savings and\nloan shares would be inflationary if such shifts cause the public to\nhave excess amounts of liquid assets, whether they be in the form of\ntime deposits, demand deposits, or savings and loan shares\" [26].\nFeige's results indicate that demand deposits and time deposits are\nweak substitutes. If this is so, a higher rate of bank growth could be\npermitted by the Federal Reserve when the ratio of new time deposits\nto new demand deposits is large than when it is small.\n\nOr, more generally, the rate of bank growth that is consistent with\nprice stability will depend on the degree of *moneyness\" of bank lia-\nbilities. Recognizing both the intermediary and monetary functions of\nbanks suggests the following hypothesis for resolving the apparent\nparadox that banks can influence the rate of growth of their total as-\nsets while under effective control of the monetary authorities. Faced\n", "175\n"], "8": ["174 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\ntiative through CD's or notes, and an increase in the proportion of sav-\nings deposits should reduce both the quantity of excess reserves de-\nmanded under any given set of market conditions and the volume of\nborrowing from the Federal Reserve. An increase in the proportion of\nvolatile CD's, on the other hand, might have the opposite effect. Al-\nthough each such innovation may shift banks! demand schedules for\nreserves and borrowings, there is no a priori reason for expecting a\nshift to make the schedules less stable.\n\nAs long as the demand schedules remain stable, the shifts produced\nby bank innovations and changes in public preferences merely change\nthe volume of open market operations required to produce a given\nchange in deposits. How much the demand functions have changed in\nrecent years or whether they have become unstable must be deter-\nmined empirically. Nevertheless, precise estimates of these parameters\nare not essential for effectiveness in controlling the money supply, be-\ncause the monetary authorities can cut and try until they produce the\ndesired effects on money stock. The level of money supply was pre-\ndicted for biweekly periods in 1961 with an average error of less than\n0.2 percent by Robert Black, from the data then available for conduct-\ning open market operations [2].\n\nBecause the new promissory notes are not subject to reserve require-\nments, they might be expected to escape Federal Reserve control. I\nwould argue, to the contrary, that Federal Reserve control of the stock\nof bank reserves provides effective control not just over deposits but\nover total bank liabilities, whether or not reserve requirements apply\nto all of them. Preferences of the banks and the public influence the\nrelative shares of demand deposits, time deposits, and notes in total\nbank liabilities, but the total is limited by the stock of reserves. Banks\nwill want to hold some reserves against the promissory notes and thus\nwill in effect observe a voluntary reserve requirement. Incidentally,\nDeane Carson and others have argued that reserve requirements are\nnot even necessary for control of deposits [6].\n\nBank Innovations and the Effectiveness of Money Supply Changes\n\nDevelopment of a new liquid asset, such as the CD or some new in-\nstrument offered by another intermediary, may shift the public's de-\nmand schedule for money, whether money is defined to include or to\nexclude the new asset. Changes in characteristics of deposits or other\nassets by modification of regulatory constraints may also shift the de-\nmand schedule for money. Consequently, such innovations and other\nchanges impair the predictive value of parameter estimates made\nunder the conditions that existed before the changes occurred. Nev-\nertheless, this does not offset the value of using as a policy variable\n"], "7": ["MONEY AND BANKING 173\n\nempirical question: Are there stable relationships among reserves, total\ndeposits or money supply, and other variables that will afford the cen-\ntral bank effective control? The studies of Clark Warburton, Milton\nFriedman, Anna Schwartz, and Phillip Cagan provide abundant evi-\ndence that stable relationships do indeed exist and that the Federal Re-\nserve can control the money supply [5] [12] [31] [32]. Their findings,\nfurthermore, are strongly supported by the theoretical and empirical\nwork of others and by experience in other countries, as well [1] [2] [3]\n[4] [7] [14, Chap. VII] [20] [21] [22] [25].\n\nThe key to the Federal Reserve's power is that banks must hold\nsome reserves in the form of vault cash and balances at the Federal\nReserve banks to provide for expected and unexpected clearings\ndrains. Federal Reserve open market operations in turn control the\nStock of unborrowed reserves. Two built-in sources of slippage in the\nSystem as it is now constituted are the ability of banks to vary their\nexcess reserves and borrowings, mentioned by Tobin, and a tendency\nfor aggregate reserve requirements to change because of differences in\nthe reserve requirements applied to various classes of deposits. One\napproach to these sources of variation in deposits might be to reduce\ntheir influence through institutional changes, by eliminating member-\nbank borrowing or instituting uniform reserve requirements, for exam-\nple. Another is to learn to cope with them by becoming more familiar\nwith their behavior, so that they can be predicted and offset.\n\nHave the recent innovations in banking so changed the responses of\nbanks that the Federal Reserve's degree of control has been reduced?\nTilford Gaines, Lyle Gramley, and Samuel Chase argue that this is the\ncase; they believe growth of interest-sensitive time deposits, CD's, and\nother bank liabilities has much reduced the Federal Reserve's control\nof the money supply, if it ever existed [13] [15]. Their criticisms of\nconventional money supply theory actually do not depend crucially\nupon recent institutional changes and therefore should be confronted\nwith the evidence from other time periods and other countries men-\ntioned earlier.

If banks are prevented by Regulation Q\nfrom adjusting their offering rates when market rates increase on com-\npeting instruments, such as commercial paper and Treasury bills, CD\nholders might shift into these other instruments on a large scale. Thus\nfar, however, the Federal Reserve Board has raised Regulation Q ceil-\nings each time rising market rates threatened to induce liquidation of\nCD's. The current ceiling of 5.5 percent on time deposits and\ncertificates of deposit of more than thirty days! maturity should be\nhigh enough to relieve apprehensions about the volume of CD's but the\n4 percent ceiling on savings deposits still is a potential tripwire.\n\nInsurance companies and pension funds depend for liquidity in part\nby matching long-term assets with long-term liabilities [24]. When\ntheir term lending increases, banks might seek liquidity protection in\nsimilar fashion by extending maturities on their liabilities, through\nissue of time certificates with maturities of, say, three to five years or\nmore. In 1965, however, the average maturity of newly issued CD's\nwas being inexorably shortened by the rise of market rates in relation\nto the Regulation Q ceiling, until the ceiling was raised in December.\nRemoval of deposit rate regulation, therefore, would reduce uncertain-\nty about the volume of CD's and would facilitate adjustment of matur-\nities on bank liabilities, as well.\n\nNotes and debentures, which also might be used to lengthen maturi-\nties of bank liabilities, are now restricted in volume by regulatory limi-\ntations on borrowing.

Time certificates of\ndeposit, however, have placed bankers in something of a quandary. Al-\nthough CD's are a convenient means for an individual bank to obtain\nfunds at its own initiative, it is feared that the total volume of CD's in\nthe system might suddenly contract if shifts in yield differentials make\nother instruments more attractive to investors. Possible consequences\nof such shifts go far beyond the embarrassment of banks, as George\nMitchell points out. ^Indeed,\" he says, *the most immediate and di-\nrect constraint on monetary policy posed by the new profile of bank\nliabilities may lie in the need to weigh carefully the impact of specific\nactions on such differentials\" [24]. Even savings deposits, he suggests,\nmight prove vulnerable to sudden withdrawals to fuel a spurt in con-\nsumer spending or to support investment in the stock market.\n\nThe immediate result of a shift out of bank time deposits would be\nan increase in required reserves, as time deposits were converted to de-\nmand deposits.

Phillip Cagan found, however, that large\nshifts between demand and time deposits from 1875 to 1955 did not\nappreciably affect reserves [5, pp. 164-79].

(2) Have bank innovations loosened the links between central\nbank actions and the money supply? (3) Have bank innovations loos-\nened the links connecting money supply with income and prices?\n\nIt is, of course, impossible to settle such complex theoretical and\nempirical questions today, but some of the research published since\n1960 provides preliminary answers and suggests where additional evi-\ndence might be found.\n"], "4": ["Banks as Intermediaries\n\nThe new stress on intermediary functions of banks is useful in as-\nsessing significance of recent developments. But, as I shall argue in a\nmoment, recognizing that banks are intermediaries does not detract\nfrom their function as monetary policy links.\n\nIntermediaries, according to Gurley and Shaw, \"lend at one stratum\nof interest rates and borrow at a lower stratum,\" and thus are compen-\nsated for their services by the margin between yields on primary and\nindirect securities [16, p. 259]. The intermediary service, as James\n\"Tobin says, consists of satisfying port\u00edolio preferences of two groups\nof people or firms simultaneously [30]. On one side are borrowers who\nwant to acquire more real assets than they can command with their\nown net worth. On the other side are lenders who want to hold some of\ntheir wealth in assets of stable money value and negligible risk of de-\nfault.\n\nIn the 1950s, demand for services of institutions specializing in real\nestate mortgage lending was increased by the housing boom. In addi-\ntion, the attractiveness of shares in savings and loan associations was\nincreased by improvement of insurance provisions in 1950 [12, pp.\n659-72] [5, pp. 173-75]. In the 1960's, demands for the kinds of loan\nservices commercial banks are especially adept in supplying and are\npermitted to supply have been relatively great [18]. The banks there-\nfore have had strong incentive to attract funds to meet the demands.\nThe expansion of banks' intermediary function was helped also by re-\nlaxation of regulatory constraints by the Federal Reserve and the\nComptroller of the Currency. Regulation Q ceilings were raised in sev-\neral steps, permitting banks to raise offering rates on time deposits and\nCD's. Removal or reduction of restrictions on some types of lending\nfurther aided banks to meet borrowers! demands. Surely, much of the\nvariation in relative growth rates of banks and nonbank intermediaries\nsince World War II can be explained by changes in demands for real\nassets and in regulatory constraints [8].\n\nInnovations have helped banks to accommodate changing prefer-\nences of borrowers and lenders, and thus to produce a larger share of\ntotal intermediary services in the economy. I agree with Homer Jones's\njudgment that the innovations were not accidental; when profitable\nopportunity developed, innovation appeared [18]. It is probable, fur-\nthermore, that some of the innovations reduced the spread between\nborrowers' and lenders! rates, thus in effect improving the efficiency of\nthe capital market [19, p. 62, n. 9].\n\nThese observations would probably be accepted without disagree-\nment if they dealt with any financial intermediary other than banks.\n", "AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n", "170\n"], "3": ["MONEY AND BANKING 169\n\nCD's.

Just before the December, 1965, increase in Regulation Q\nceilings, some bank promissory notes were being issued at rates above\nthe maximum 4.5 percent permitted on CD's.\n\nThe federal funds market has continued to develop, with an increase\nin the number of banks participating and with more banks acting as\ndealers. Money market center banks also have increasingly tended to\nbe net borrowers of federal funds. The federal funds rate has been\nabove the discount rate by one-eighth of a percentage point for days at\na time this year and occasionally has been one-quarter point higher.\nThe seemingly irrational practice of paying a premium for reserves\nborrowed in the federal funds market reflects restriction of access to\nthe discount window under Federal Reserve Regulation A, which pre-\nscribes that continuous borrowing and *profiting from rate differentials\"\nare to be avoided. The actual discount rate to the banks, accordingly,\nis somewhat higher than the nominal rate posted by the Reserve banks.\n\nBanks have raised long-term capital through issue of $1.5 billion in\ncapital notes, convertible debentures, and preferred stock in the last\nthree years. They have borrowed an additional $200 million or more\nthrough subsidiaries or affiliates holding title to their premises. The\nnotes and convertible debentures are subordinate to depositors' claims\nand are subject to the statutory restrictions on banks! total borrow-\nings.\n\nIn the last decade, and especially in the last four years, the average\nmaturity of bank assets has increased substantially, as the shares of\ntotal assets devoted to mortgages, state and local government securi-\nties, and term loans have grown. Over the same period, the proportions\nof cash and short-term government securities have declined. Whether\nit is called evolution or innovation, this is a major change in banking\npractice.

We can indicate,\nhowever, that these results are broadly supported by a similar study of\nthe behavior of the spread in the corporate market between the yield on\nAaa rated bonds and the commercial paper rate, both for the postwar\nperiod and for the longer span beginning with the inception of the\nFederal Reserve System. At this stage we feel that the following conclu-\nsions can be advanced with considerable confidence.\n\n1. The expectation model can account remarkably well for the rela-\ntion between short- and long-term rates in the United States. Further-\nmore, the prevailing expectations of long-term rates involve a blending\nof extrapolation of very recent changes and regression toward a long-\nterm normal level.\n\n2.

The spread between long and short rates in the government market\nsince the inception of Operation Twist was on the average some twelve\nbase points below what one might infer from the pre-Operation Twist\nrelation. \"This discrepancy seems to be largely attributable to the suc-\ncessive increase in the ceiling rate under Regulation Q which enabled the\nnewly invented CD's to exercise their maximum influence.\n\n4. Any effects, direct or indirect, of Operation Twist in narrowing the\nspread which further study might establish, are most unlikely to exceed\nsome ten to twenty base points\u2014a reduction that can be considered\nmoderate at best.\n\nY! Note that if Z is interpreted along the lines of footnote 16, then for the initial period\n1962-I to 1963-II when r, remained below the old ceiling rate of 3 percent, the introduction\nof CD's would have contributed some to the closing of the spread even if the ceiling had not\nbeen raised. \"Thus for this initial span the contribution of the increase in ceiling as such must\n\nbe estimated at somewhat less than 12 points, although how much less it is not really possible\nto say with confidence.\n", "AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n", "196\n"], "18": ["(8)\n", "statistical significance and the small magnitude of the coefficient esti-\nmated for Q raises the possibility that other events in the periodafter1961\nare causing a spurious effect. One such major development, and one that\ncould have affected the ability of commercial banks to attract short-\nterm funds, was the introduction in 1961 of negotiable Time Certificates\nof Deposit (CD's). To be sure, the spectacular growth of this instrument\nafter 1962 could not have occurred had not the ceiling been raised that\nyear, so that banks could offer CD's at rates competitive with other\nshort-term instruments. Nonetheless, the CD must be regarded as a\ntrue financial innovation which could have enhanced the capacity of\nbanks to arbitrage even if Regulation Q had never existed.\n\nTo test the effect, if any, of this innovation, one could rely on the\ndummy variable technique, adding to (7) a variable taking the value one\nafter 1962 and zero everywhere else. This would allow the constant term\nof the equation (which is a measure of the risk premium) to assume two\nvalues: one value for pre-1962 and a second, lower value (the sum of the\nconstant term and the coefficient of the dummy variable) after 1962.\n\nWhen we entered into the regression such a dummy-\u2014\u2014denoted by Z in\nthe equation below\u2014its coefficient has the expected negative sign and is\nsignificant in relation to its standard error:\n\n16\n(8) S, \u2014 1.278 \u2014 0.6957, -- 35 oar; \u2014 0.124215\n(0.064) (0.031) \u2014 i (0.043)\n\nR? \u2014 0.964 SS, \u2014 0.103 DW - 1.02\n\nActual and computed values for this equation are shown in panel 2 of\nFigure 2.\n\nWhen Q is added along with Z in a similar regression, the coefficient\nof Q not only loses its statistical significance but actually becomes nega-\ntive. \"This result is confirmed by rerunning (7) with Q but not Z for the\nperiod before 1962, thereby excluding the CD years altogether.

This outcome suggests that the suc-\ncessive increases in the ceiling contributed to twist solely by permitting\n\n16 The use of a dummy variable in (8) may appear less than satisfactory, failing to bring\nout the fact that the contribution of the newly introduced CD's depends on whether the ccil-\ning rate is sufliciently high to enable banks to offer rates competitive with other short-term\ninstruments. With these considerations in mind, we had actually defined the variable Z to\ntake (1) the value 1 only when the ceiling g, exceeds r; by at least 50 base points, a gap which\nwe assumed to be sufficiently large to give banks the needed elbow room; (2) the value zero\nwhen r, equals the ceiling, by which time banks would likely lose nearly all power of attracting\nCD funds; and (3) to decrease linearly between these limits as (g,\u20147;) shrinks from 50 base\npoints to zero. \u00c0s it turns out, however, from 1962 to 1965-II the ceiling was consistently kept\nat least 50 base points above r;. (Note in this connection that for the last quarter of 1964 the\nceiling was taken as 4.25, a simple average of the 4 percent rate ruling up to November 24 and\nthe 4.5 rate ruling thereafter.) Therefore, the variable defined above always has the value\none, and is undistinguishable from an ordinary dunimy.

We have further seen\nthat under these conditions the size of the premium on longs would\ndepend, among other things, on the \"facilities for effective arbitrage\noperations.\" In particular, we should expect that any significant im-\npediment to arbitrage, such as a curtailment of the ability of a certain\nclass of would-be arbitrageurs to attract short-term funds with a rate as\nhigh as they would otherwise be prepared to pay, would tend to raise the\npremium. Among such potential arbitrageurs one presumably would\ninclude commercial banks, hence the Regulation Q ceiling on time de-\nposit rates (if sufficiently low to be effective) would be a force creating an\nartificially large premium. Thus, we would presume that increases in the\nceiling rate would tend to reduce the spread by allowing banks to\narbitrage away part of this premium.\n\nThis theoretical formulation suggests that to measure the effect of\nRegulation Q we need to introduce a variable which (1) should treat the\nsuccessive lifting of the ceilings, not as positive forces contributing to\ntwist, but rather as the removal of an interference with normal arbitrage\noperations; and (2) should play the largest role when other short-term\nrates are very close to or above ceiling; while it should cease to have\neffect once the ceiling is sufficiently above these rates. Beyond that level,\nchanges in the ceiling should no longer affect the spread. Thus we define\na variable, Q, as follows:\n\nQro n\u2014 (q-\u2014 a) if positive, zero otherwise\n\nwhere q, is the ceiling rate under Regulation Q and (r;-4-a) is a threshold\nlevel such that any higher ceiling would be irrelevant at time \u00a3.

Testing the Effects of Operation Twist\n\nSince equation (7) has sound theoretical underpinnings, as well as\nstrong empirical support, it should provide a sensible basis for a test of\nthe effectiveness of Operation Twist. To this end we extrapolated this\nequation from the first quarter of 1962 to 1965.-II, and the result is\ngraphed as a dashed curve in the top panel of Figure 2. It is apparent\nthat, through the middle of 1964, there is very little evidence that these\npolicies produced an appreciable effect on the term structure. With but a\ncouple of exceptions, the error is within ten base points, or less than the\nstandard error; beginning with the second quarter of 1962, however, the\nspread is consistently smaller than the computed value and, beginning\nwith 1964-IV, the difference becomes impressive, four to six times the\nstandard error. Thus the best that could be said on the basis of (7) is\nthat the twist policy was slightly to moderately successful.\n\nSince our results indicate that this success is not attributable to debt\nmanagement by the Treasury or the Federal Reserve, we must consider\nwhether the only other major tool applied might be responsible for what\ntwisting took place. That was, as we noted, the successive increases in\nthe ceiling rates on time deposits under Regulation Q. Particularly note-\nworthy is the fact that the major increases in the ceiling rate came pre-\ncisely at the beginning of 1962 and again in the last quarter of 1964. But\nwhile the coincidence of dates is suggestive, it is at best circumstantial\nevidence. To put our case on a solid footing, we must specify the mech-\nanism by which an increase in the ceilings on interest payable to savings\ndeposits could be expected to affect the spread, and then look for direct\nevidence that this mechanism was actually at work in the period under\nconsideration.\n\nTo see what light the Habitat Theory can shed on the nature of the\nmechanism, we note once more that the rather large constant term in\n(7) suggests that during the postwar period the expected return from\nlong-term bonds tended to exceed the short rate by a positive premium.\nAccording to the Habitat model the prevalence of such a positive pre-\nmium would indicate a systematic tendency for the primary supply of\n", "AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n", "192\n"], "14": ["resulting from supply eflects.

He could find no\nevidence that the proportion outstanding in the various classes had any\neffect, but found some evidence that an increase in the proportion of\nboth short (less than one year) and intermediate debt (one to five years)\ntended to reduce the spread.\n\nWe have repeated the tests of De Leeuw and others, and we find that\nnone of the many debt variables we have tested obtains a significant\ncoefficient with the predicted sign.? This is somewhat surprising in light\nof our a priori expectations, but does confirm the findings of most other\nauthors. We must conclude that neither the maturity structure of the\ngovernment debt nor changes in the maturity structure exert any sig-\nnificant, lasting or transient, influence on the relation between the two\nrates. This conclusion is supported by lack of positive evidence that\nthese variables affect the spread in the generally supposed direction, and\nis reinforced by the consideration that the behavior of the spread can be\naccounted for quite closely without any reference to such variables,\nimplying that their effect, if at all present, could be only of a secondary\norder of magnitude. This is not to say, of course, that there are no\nsupply-demand effects, but merely that we could find no evidence that\noperations on the government component of the supply have a notice-\nable effect on the term structure as defined.\n\nIronically enough, this finding should be a source of relief to the\nauthorities concerned with debt management because it turns out that,\n\n33 'Toillustrate, when we add to (7) the two variables that De Leeuw found to have significant\n\neffects in the predicted direction, namely, the change in the proportion of short-term debt,\nA[Ds/Dr|], and the change in the proportion of intermediate debt, A[D1/Dr], we find\n\n16\nS, \u2014 1.233 \u2014 0.709, -- 3: Bir 0.98 [75] \u2014 0.974 [5-]\n(0.061) (0.040 \u2014 7 (1.20) T^ (19) 77\n\n'The variables Ds and Dr were calculated with an elaborate averaging technique by the flow-\nof-funds section of the Federal Reserve Board, who generously made them available to us.

This substitution is in essence equivalent to hypothesizing\nthat the expected long rate R? can be approximated as a weighted aver-\nage of past short rates rather than past long rates. This is certainly as\nsensible a hypothesis as De Leeuw's original. Indeed, it is basically an\nimplication of that hypothesis, and conversely.

Estimation techniques for the\nPascal-Solow lag distribution [15] now being developed by Robert Hall look to be suitable for\nsuch a model, but this will have to wait for a later date. It is very unlikely, however, that re-\nfined estimation techniques could substantially alter our conclusions. Incidentally, equation\n(6) can be recognized as simply the first stage of the Liviatan technique as applied to this\nmodel (see footnote 8 above).\n\n1? The only statistically significant difference between (5) and (6) lies in the stochastic\n\nproperties of the error term hypothesized for the two models. If (5) holds with nonserially\ncorrelated error, then (6) will have an error vector which is autoregressive, and conversely.\n", "the a priori specification of the intercept yield the five points neces-\nsary to define a fourth degree polynomial.\n\nHowever, before we attempt to apply this technique, we must face\nanother difficulty. Equation (5) purports to explain the dependent vari-\nable R, in terms of lagged values of itself. It is well known that in the\npresence of serial correlation of the error term, e, such a procedure will\nlead to biased estimates of the coefficients [7 ].\n\nThe problem is particularly serious for our present purposes, as it can\nbe shown that if, in fact, Operation Twist was successful, then an equa-\ntion of the form (5) estimated by ordinary least squares would very\nlikely tend to conceal and understate the true effectiveness.\n\nOne way to handle this difficulty would be to estimate (5) using re-\ncently developed techniques for consistent estimation of equations\nwhich include a lagged dependent variable.5 However, we propose an\nalternative approach. As is well known, an equation in the form of (5)\nimplies that R, can also be expressed as a function only of r, and a\nweighted sum of all previous short rates, r, ;.

The final result involves only r,.;, with 7\nextending indefinitely into the past, but with the coefficients of the far\nremoved r, ; approaching zero.

Estimation of the Model\n\nl\u00ed we disregard for the moment the nondescript supply term F',\nequation (5) contains only observables and is in principle ready for\nestimation and testing. In so doing, however, we must face two rather\ndifficult problems. Since the distributed lag on the previous long rates\nshould be quite long and not of the familiar exponentially declining\ntype, it poses estimation problems. These De Leeuw solved with an\ningenious technique that involved estimation of only a small number of\ncoefficients rather than a separate coefficient for each lagged value of R\n(an alternative which would undoubtedly lead to severe multicolinearity\nproblems). However, since his writing, an alternative, more powerful\nand far more flexible technique for estimating lag structures has been\ndeveloped by Shirley Almon [1] and pursued by Charles Bischoff in\nwork currently in progress at the Massachusetts Institute of Technol-\nogy. This procedure imposes very little a priori restriction on the lag\nstructure, requiring merely that it can be approximated by a poly-\nnomial. Since our formulation suggests that the lag distribution should\nrise to a single peak and then fall, we concluded that a fourth degree\npolynomial would be sufficiently flexible to closely reproduce the true\nstructure.\n\nThe Almon Interpolation Distribution involves the calculation of\nLagrangian interpolation polynomials, which are used to weight a\nspecified number of past values of the variable whose lag is to be esti-\nmated. These weighted averages, or Almon variables, are then entered in\nthe ordinary least squares regression equation. For a fourth degree\npolynomial, five Lagrangian polynomials would be needed to define the\nstructure. However, since we have a priori reasons to believe that the\nlag structure will taper off to negligible values at some finite distance in\nthe past, we further impose the restriction that the polynomial to be\nestimated should assume a zero value at a finite lag. This allows us to use\nonly four Lagrangian polynomials and hence also four Almon variables.\"\nThe four coefficients estimated for these variables in the regression plus\n\n? This is a modification of the procedure which Mrs. Almon followed in her paper on lags\nbetween capital appropriations and expenditures [1]. She specified that the lag distribution\nbegan as well as ended with a zero value, and thus only three Almon variables were necessary\nto estimate the fourth degree polynomial. For our purposes the requirement that the poly-\nnomial pass through zero at / plus one seemed to place an unwarranted restriction on the shape\n\nof the distributed lag. Experiments with several alternative restrictions indicated that a free\nestimation of the head of the distribution yielded more sensible lag structures and closer fits.\n", "We note that, since 8 and a are supposed to be positive, the coefficient 4\nshould be positive but distinctly below unity, and that, since the lag\ncoefficients, B;, are proportional to the 5; of (4), our earlier inferences\nabout the b;'s\u2014which define the lag structure\u2014applies equally to the\nBjs.\n", "MONEY AND BANKING\n", "187\n"], "9": ["H c\n/ 14 fa\n\nand e, is the error term.\n", "where\n", "(3)\n", "R,- And Y BR CHF\n\ndel\n", "R, 7 r,\u2014 BaR, \u00bb\u00bb Bb;R.-; d- 8dc 4- Fi\ndel\nwhere r, is used hereafter to denote the short rate R(1, /).

Strictly speaking, 8 can be shown to be a function\nboth of the length to maturity \u00bb and of R(n, /) (as well as possibly future short rates). How-\never, the dependence on \u00bb need not be neglected if we deal with a fixed maturity \u00bb; and the\neffect of R(n, f) can be shown to be sufficiently small to be neglected to a first approximation\nwithin the range of variation of R(n, !) prevailing in the period with which we are concerned.\n\n5 Meiselman [14] and Kessel [9] have also made important contributions in this area, but\nwhile their work provides impressive support for the expectations model, their approach is not\ndirectly applicable to our problem.\n\n* This hypothesis could also be derived by replacing the notion of a normal level with the\nnotion of a normal range (cf., Malkiel [13]).\n", "where F, stands for the net effect of relative supply factors and could in\nprinciple be positive or negative.

If, however, he stays short, his outcome\nis uncertain, as it will depend on the future course of the short rates\nin periods 2, 3,. . . , \u00bb-1. Furthermore, he is likely to have to incur\ngreater transaction costs. Thus, if he has risk aversion, he will prefer to\nstay long unless the average of the expected short rates exceeds the long\nrate by an amount sufficient to cover extra transaction costs and to\ncompensate him for the extra risk of going short. Similarly, if he should\ninvest in maturities longer than \u00bb, he would also be exposing himself to\nrisk, this time to the Hicks-Keynesian uncertainty as to the price he can\nfetch for his not-yet-matured bonds. Thus, risk aversion should not lead\ninvestors to prefer to stay short but, instead, should lead them to hedge\nby staying in their maturity habitat, unless other maturities (longer or\nshorter) offer an expected premium sufficient to compensate for the risk\nand cost of moving out of one's habitat. Similar considerations will\nclearly apply, mutatis mutandis, to the borrower's side of the market.\n\nUnder this model the rate for a given maturity, z, could differ from\nthe rate implied by the Pure Expectation Hypothesis by positive or\nnegative \"risk premiums,\" reflecting the.extent to which the supply of\nfunds with habitat z differs from the aggregate demand for 5 period\nloans forthcoming at that rate. If the \u00bb period demand exceeded the\nfunds with z period habitat, there would tend to arise a premium in the\n*: period maturity, and conversely.? Such premiums or discounts would\ntend to bring about shifts in funds between different maturity markets,\nboth through the \"speculation\" of investors tempted out of their natural\nhabitat by the lure of higher expected returns and through \"'arbitrage\"\nby intermediaries induced to \"take a position\" by borrowing in the\nmaturity range where the expected return is low, and lending where the\nexpected return is high.\n\nIn summary, then, the Habitat Model implies that the spread S(n, f)\nbetween the long rate R(z, t) and the short rate R(1, /) should depend\nprimarily on the expected change in the long rate, AR'(n, f). But it sug-\ngests that the spread could also be influenced by the supply of long- and\nshort-term securities by primary borrowers (ie., by borrowers other\nthan arbitrageurs) relative to the corresponding demand of primary\nlenders, to an extent reflecting prevailing risk aversion, transaction\ncosts, and facilities for effective arbitrage operations.\n\n\"These conclusions can be conveniently summarized in the following\nequations.\n\nT^. n-LbnAd u-..nuLbnundbl.na o nunnunaiene-4x3lihszed\n", "AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n", "184\n"], "6": ["term borrowers, the expected return on these maturities must exceed\nthat on shorter-term instruments by an expected risk or liquidity\npremium.

The size of\nthese risk premiums might be expected to depend on the relative sup-\nplies of longer maturities and the strength of investors! risk aversion.\n\n3. Finally, there is the view that might be labeled the Market\nSegmentation Hypothesis. The proponents of this approach suggest\nthat both lenders and borrowers have definite preferences for instru-\nments of a specific maturity, and for various reasons, partly due to\ninstitutional factors and regulations constraining financial intermedi-\naries, will tend to stick to securities of the corresponding maturity,\nwithout paying attention to rates of return on other maturities.? Hence\nthe rates for different terms to maturity tend to be determined, each in\nits separate market, by their independent supply and demand schedules.\nThe rates so set might well imply wide differences in the expected re-\nturn obtainable in the current period, or over some sequence of periods,\nby investing in different maturities, but such differences, it is argued,\nwould not induce traders to move out of their preferred maturity\u2014or\nmaturity habitat, as we shall call it\u2014except possibly when the dis-\ncrepancies become extreme and glaring.\n\nIn our view, each of the three models has its merits, but also suffers\nfrom shortcomings. We propose, therefore, an alternative model which,\nin essence, blends the previous three, and which we label the Preferred\nHabitat Theory. This model shares with the Hicksian approach the\nnotion that the yield structure is basically controlled by the principle\nof the equality of expected returns, but modified by the risk premiums.\nYet it differs from it in one fundamental respect. The Hicksian model\nassumes that all traders are concerned with the short period return and\nthat, therefore, anybody going long is bearing the risk associated with\nthe uncertainty of the short period return from longer-term instruments.\nBut this view would be correct only if we could assume that every lender\ndesires to turn his portfolio back into cash at the end of the short pe-\nriod; i.e., that he has a short habitat (cf. Meiselman [14]). In reality,\nhowever, different transactors are likely to have different habitats, as the\nsegmentation theory points out. Suppose that a person has an \u00bb period\nhabitat; that is, he has funds which he will not need for z periods and\nwhich, therefore, he intends to keep invested in bonds for \u00bb periods. If\nhe invests in 2 period bonds, he will know exactly the outcome of his\ninvestments as measured by the terminal value of his wealth (this\nbeing only approximately true if he were to invest in a conventional\nloan and precisely true for a pure & period loan; that is, a loan that was\n\n? This view has been stressed by a number of authors, in particular Culbertson [3].\n", "MONEY AND BANKING\n", "183\n"], "5": ["future rates for one period loans prevailing in each of the \u00bb periods to\nmaturity, R(1, 2, R(1, t-F1), - - - R(1, t--&\u2014 1), although the precise\nform of the functional relation will depend on the shape of the stream\nof cash payments promised by the bond until maturity. Finally, be-\ncause the return to the lender and the cost to the borrower over any\ninterval will be the same regardless of the maturity of the instrument\nheld or issued, neither would have a special incentive to match the\nmaturity structure of his assets or liabilities to the length of time for\nwhich he intends to remain a creditor or debtor.\n\nThere is unfortunately much less agreement as to the determinants\nof the yield structure in the \"real\" world. The prevailing points of view\nmay be summarized as follows.\n\n1. At one end of the spectrum is the Pure Expectation Hypothesis,\nwhich holds that the certainty model provides an adequate approxima-\ntion to the real world, except that the equality of returns of the cer-\ntainty world must now be replaced by the equality of *'expected\" re-\nturns, where the expected returns may be thought of as the mean value\n(or some other analogous measure of central tendency) of the subjective\nprobability distribution of possible returns. In particular, for every m,\nR(n, f) must equal R(1, /) minus the expected capital gain, determined\nby the expected change in the z period rate, say AR'(z, f). For otherwise\nholders of bonds with lower expected returns would try to sell them,\nbidding down their price and raising their yield, and to acquire higher\nyielding instruments, bidding up their price and reducing their yields,\nuntil the postulated relation would come to hold.\n\n2. A variant of the expectation hypothesis, of Keynesian inspiration\n[10] but articulated largely by Hicks [8], which has wide support at the\npresent, may be labeled the Risk Premium Model. It basically accepts\nthe view that yields on various maturities are related to each other by\nthe expectations of future long rates, and hence also short rates, but it\ncalls attention to differences in the degree of uncertainty which attaches\nto the expected return to be obtained, in the short run, from holding\nsecurities of different length. While the return on short-term securities\nis certain (since the value of the principal is guaranteed by repayment\nat the end of the period), the return on longer maturities is not guar-\nanteed because of the uncertainty of future rates and hence of the end\nof period market value of the bond. Furthermore, the uncertainty tends\nto be greater the longer the maturity, since a given change in the long\nrate tends to produce a greater variation in terminal value the longer the\nremaining life to maturity.

Clearly, to draw such a conclusion from the rudimentary\nevidence presented above would be no more warranted than to infer\nfrom the figures of Table 1 that the policy was a howling success. The\npoint of these simple tests is rather to emphasize that the task of assess-\ning the success of the operation is far from trivial and can only be\nadequately tackled with the help of a theoretically grounded and\nempirically tested understanding of the basic forces which tend to shape\nthe yield structure and its variations in time. It is, then, to this challeng-\ning task that we must turn first.\n\nI. Recent Theoretical Developments in the Analysis\nof the Maturity Structure\n\n'There is by now general agreement that in an ideal world of no trans-\naction costs or taxes, rational behavior and certainty (about future\nrates), the maturity structure of yields must be controlled by the simple\nprinciple that all outstanding instruments, regardless of maturity, must\nproduce identical returns over any given interval of time\u2014where the\nreturn is defined as the sum of cash payments plus any increase (or\nminus any decrease) in the market value of the instrument. This prin-\nciple in turn implies that at any date 7 the spread between the yield\nof an 5 period bond and the short rate, S(\u00bb, 2) - R(n, t) \u2014 R(1, 1), is\nequal to minus the capital gain from holding the \u00bb period instrument.\nThe capital gain in turn is inversely related to the change in yield:\nAR(n, i) 2 R(n\u20141, t2-1) \u2014 R(n, 1). Consequently, R(n, 1) can be ex-\npressed in terms of the current short rate R(1, /) and the future long rate\nR(n\u2014 1, t4- 1). Moreover, since R(1\u20141, t-I- 1) can in turn be expressed in\nterms of R(1, 1-1) and R(n\u2014 2, t-- 2), and so on, recursively, it is readily\napparent that R(z, f) can also be expressed in terms of the current and\n", "180\n"], "2": ["ture of ceiling rates payable on commercial banks' time and saving de-\nposits under Regulation Q.

As a result, the spread between rates on long-term\ngovernment bonds and the bills rate has declined from 150 base points\ndown to 35 base points, while the difference between Aaa corporate\nbonds and the commercial paper rate shrank from 125 to 12 base points.\n\"These figures would seem to provide impressive evidence that Operation\nTwist was a remarkable success. To make such an interpretation (as\nhas been frequently done) would be much too hasty, for as historical\nexperience has shown, the spread typically tends to close in a period of\nrecovery and rising short-term rates, such as prevailed between 1961\nand the present. Indeed, currently prevailing spreads are still appreci-\nably larger than they were at the peak of the previous cycle in 1959\nand early 1960, as can be seen from the last row of Table 1, Part B.\nThus the closing of the spreads between the turn of 1960 and the\npresent might reflect merely the normal tendency for spreads to close as\nshort-term rates advance. This hunch can be tested by estimating the\nhistorical relationship between the spread and short rates with ordi-\nnary regression techniques, and then comparing the actual relation be-\ntween short and long rates with that predicted by the least square re-\ngression.

The Internal\nRevenue Service recognizes that research is a normal part of the activ-\nity of professors, regardless of whether they have any specific contrac-\ntual obligation to do research. There is no distinction in this respect\nbetween professors with tenure appointments and other faculty mem-\nbers.

Provision for the current deduction or amortization of a\nbroad range of expenditures for income-increasing education would\nmake the income tax more equitable and would eliminate a discrimina-\ntion against a strategically important kind of capital formation.\n\nIn my judgment, however, it would be wrong to expect that this tax\nrevision would greatly stimulate education or would have an important\ninfluence on occupational choice. According to my estimates, amortiza-\nble costs of college and university education would amount to only\nabout one-sixth of total private costs; the remaining five-sixths con-\nsists of forgone earnings. With marginal tax rates of 20 to 25 percent,\nthe tax saving due to amortization would amount to only about 3 to 4\npercent of total private costs, and the saving would be spread over\nmany years. The significance of amortization would diminish if schol-\narships became more prevalent or tax rates fell. It would increase if\nloans and higher tuition became more usual or tax rates rose. The\namortization scheme, in any case, would have the advantage of calling\nattention to the investment aspects of education which have often been\noverlooked or misunderstood.\n\nThe amortization plan differs sharply from the proposals for a de-\nduction or tax credit for parents of college students which have re-\nceived much public and congressional attention. The deduction or\ncredit for parents, as explained above, could not be justified as a\nrefinement of the income definition but would have to be defended as a\nsubsidy or encouragement of a socially desirable expenditure. As such,\nthe allowance for parents should be expected to meet more rigorous\nstandards of equity and effectiveness than would the deduction or\namortization of costs of earning income. In particular, the allowance\nfor parents should be compared with larger government expenditures\nfor scholarships and student loans. This is true if one accepts a proposi-\ntion that I hold to be basic to a sound income tax, that there is a pre-\nsumption in favor of the deduction of all legitimate costs of producing\nincome but a presumption against other deductions and credits.\n\nResearch\n\nIt is now possible for individuals to offset against taxable income\ncertain expenditures for scholarly inquiry as well as many outlays for\napplied research.

Provision would have to be made for later ad-\njustment of the original estimate if earnings were prematurely ended\nby death, disability, or obsolescence. A straight-line, declining-balance,\nor other reasonable method might be used. It may be objected that the\nusual formulas would be inappropriate since the economic value of\neducation tends to increase rather than decrease until middle age or\nlater, as indicated by rising earnings curves for highly educated\npeople? I find this argument unconvincing, for two reasons. First, a\nlarge part of the increase in earnings with age seems to be due to expe-\nrience or on-the-job training rather than to formal education. Second,\nin my opinion, income tax depreciation or amortization schedules\nshould be regarded as a conventional means of spreading capital costs\nover time rather than a measure of the changing market value of an\nasset.\n\nThe timing of allowances, to be sure, is significant. In fact, it could\nbe argued that amortization of educational expenditures is unnecessary\nto secure equal treatment of human and physical capital because for-\ngone earnings, which are the major component of educational invest-\nment, are in effect immediately offset against taxable income. On plau-\nsible assumptions about the discount rate and the marginal tax rate,\nthe present value of immediate deductions equal to the amount of for-\ngone earnings exceeds the present value of a series of deferred deduc-\ntions covering total educational costs. But in my judgment this does\nnot justify the failure to amortize explicit educational costs. The omis-\nsion of forgone earnings from taxable income is not peculiar to educa-\ntion. Individuals and business managers frequently choose to give up\nimmediate income in order to obtain more income later; yet no one\ncontends that this creates a tax advantage or calls in question the\ndeductibility of ordinary costs of earning the later income.\n\nAdministrative expediency and convenience in compliance strongly\nsuggest that the usual amortization period for educational capital\nmight be arbitrarily set at ten to twenty years rather than the stu-\ndent's entire working life. This would also be in accord with the recent\ntendency to accelerate depreciation allowances for physical capital and\nthe liberal treatment of research and development costs.\n\nWhile a number of other problems would have to be solved in order\nto devise a workable plan, I think that the effort would be well\n\n*On earnings, age, and education see Becker, op. cit., pp. 136-52; and T.

A more conservative ap-\nproach would take in only vocational and professional education. A\nmore liberal plan would extend to secondary education.\n\nThe items to be recognized as current or capital costs would include\nexpenditures for tuition and fees, books and supplies, and travel. Ordi-\nnary living expenses should not be included since they would have to\nbe incurred in any case; any special living expenses should in principle\nbe deducted or amortized, but in practice it might be better to exclude\nliving expenses because of the difficulty of identifying special expenses.\nForgone earnings, which are the largest element in private educational\ncosts, would not need to be deducted or amortized since they are al-\nready excluded from taxable income. Educational costs financed by\ntaxes and philanthropy would not be covered.\n\nBy analogy with the present treatment of business expenses and de-\npreciable assets, the deduction or amortization allowance should be\ntaken against the income of the student even when the expenses are\nmet by parents. The expenditures by parents could be treated as gifts\nto their children just as is the cost of physical capital that is gratui-\ntously transferred to children. This is a fundamental point because in\nour society expenditures by a parent for the education of his children\ncannot realistically be viewed as a means of increasing the parent's in-\ncome; hence the rationalization of the deduction as a cost of earning\nincome is inapplicable to parents.\n\nBasically, the distinction between capital outlays and current ex-\npenses for education turns on the question whether new earning capac-\nity is created or existing capacity is maintained. Though this test can-\nnot be rigorously applied, it offers some guidance for income taxation.\nUnder a revised tax treatment, the kind of educational expenditures\nthat are deductible under present regulations might continue to be cur-\nrently deducted as maintenance expenses while other eligible expendi-\ntures were capitalized. As an alternative or supplementary standard,\nexpenditures might be currently deducted or capitalized depending on\nwhether they are small or large relative to income.\n\nEducational capital in the form of acquired earning capacity is an\nasset that normally lasts throughout a person's working life.

The innovation would appear to be consistent with in-\ncome tax principles and equity and to be good public policy in view of\nthe great contribution that education makes to economic progress.\n\nConceptual and practical difficulties would be involved in revising\nthe treatment of educational expenditures. Perhaps the most serious\ndifficulty would be to distinguish between costs of earning income, in-\ncluding both maintenance and capital costs, and the consumption ele-\nment of education. Generally, in determining business and professional\nincome, an outlay is regarded as a cost if the purpose is to produce in-\ncome, even though no direct connection can be traced between the out-\nlay and an income receipt. This principle suggests that it would not be\nnecessary to require a showing that income actually resulted from a\nparticular educational expenditure in order to support its deduction or\ncapitalization but only that the outlay might reasonably have been ex-\npected to produce income. To minimize subjectivity in the clas-\nsification of educational expenditures, criteria might be established in\nthe statutes, regulations, and rulings partly on the basis of statistical\nstudies of the relation between education and earnings.\n\nThere is little doubt that attendance at professional schools and at\ntrade and vocational schools is motivated primarily by the desire to\nincrease earning capacity. The possibility that students may derive di-\nrect satisfactions or cultural values from their studies does not change\nthe fundamental nature of expenditures for such education any more\nthan incidental enjoyment of business or professional activities bars\nthe deduction of ordinary and necessary business costs. Graduate\nstudies in arts and sciences also seem to be career-oriented in the great\nmajority of cases.\n\nThe classification of liberal arts studies at the undergraduate level is\nmore debatable. There is a strong tradition that regards liberal educa-\ntion as preparation for living rather than for earning and that would\nimply that expenditures for this education should be classified as con-\nsumption. Casual observation and opinion surveys, however, suggest\nthat most college students and their parents take a more mercenary\nattitude, and there is good evidence that on the whole college education\nsubstantially increases earning power. The available studies indicate\nthat male students earn a good return even if their college expendi-\ntures are viewed entirely as investment and any consumption element\nignored?

The question of the\nuse of the tax device is, however, essentiallp one of means or\napproaches.\n\nAssuming a basic need for government intervention, the general case\nfor the tax approach as against the direct assistance approach is that it\navoids red tape, the waste motion of collecting taxes and disbursing\nthem back to beneficiaries, the bureaucracy of subsidy administrators\nor worse; that it provides a speedy, semiautomatic access to public\nfunds on a matching basis which depends on the credit or deduction\ntechnique used; that it relies primarily on the decentralized decision\nmaking of the businessman within the framework of the tax system.\n\nWhat is often overlooked is that the tax device does not offer a free\nand easy escape from the practical burdens of the subsidy process: \"it\nsubstitutes tax administrators, tax planners and a tradition of extended\nadministrative controversy and litigation.\"'?

In the case\nof a special form of investment such as R and D, the cash flow effect is\nlikely to be scattered and dissipated through leakages or uses unre-\nlated to the special goal.\n\nIgnorance and uncertainty about the investment function generally\nare impressive, but with respect to the R and D function they are even\nmore imposing.

Without undertaking a systematic\nreview of the pros and cons of tax stimulants for R and D, I would\nnevertheless like to highlight some of the relevant considerations.\nFirst, a few specifics.\n\n1. Basic Research and the Market Mechanism. 'The greatest social\npay-off to an effective stimulus would probably be in the area towards\nthe basic end of the research spectrum where market mechanisms are\nleast satisfactory. However, it is doubtful that a large number of busi-\nnesses would respond to even a substantial tax stimulus by diverting\ntheir best people to an area where results are likely to be non-proprie-\ntary.\n\n2. Definitional Problems. Definitional problems are especially\ndifficult with respect to basic research but they permeate the research\nfield. The full scope of the practical and conceptual problems which\nwould arise under a special credit is not disclosed by the experience\nunder the section 174 option which offers little or no inducement to re-\nclassify an ordinary expense as research. Tax stimulants would run the\nrisk of qualifying all sorts of outlays not remotely resembling what the\namiable tax dirigist intended, including some already financed directly\nor indirectly by government funds.\n\nCareful definition and real pinpointing of benefits requires adminis-\ntrators who are able to distinguish research when they see it. This may\ncall for talents other than those of a revenue agent\u2014a consideration\nwhich highlights the difficulty in calling upon the tax system to carry\nout a sophisticated program to attain research supply and allocation\nobjectives.\n\n3. Revenuc Costs versus Results. Suppose we shirked the problems\nof defining basic research, and allowed a general tax credit on industri-\nal R and D. With company-financed R and D about $6 billion annual-\nly, a 10 percent credit would lose $600 million revenue and a 25 per-\ncent credit $1.5 billion before even an additional dollar of research\nemerged. A 10 percent credit would have to increase the R and D\neffort by $667 million or about 11 percent in order to match each dol-\nlar of revenue cost with an additional dollar of R and D.

Tax Credit to Stimulate Industrial Support of Academic Institu-\ntions. A special tax incentive proposal urged by some experts would\nprovide a tax credit of, say, 75 percent applicable to funds spent by\nbusinesses under research agreements with universities. This approach\nis designed both to improve the development of research manpower\nand capabilities of the universities in the civilian industry sector and\nto shift the balance between civilian industry and space or defense\nmission-oriented research, thus producing important innovational\nbenefits for industry as a whole. A related objective is to help small\nfirms with limited in-house technical resources to support industrial\nresearch of interest to them.\n\nTo qualify, the research activity would be under the control of the\nuniversity and would conform to criteria already established by uni-\nversities for acceptance and administration of government research\ncontracts and grants. The credit would not apply to arrangements as-\nsigning proprietary rights to the sponsoring business. The substance of\nthe proposal in a sense is therefore to grant a special tax reward for\nindustrial research on condition that the findings be in the public do-\nmain.\n\n?'

Therefore, in systems develop-\nments there should be strong concern paid to the possibilities of hedg-\ning against best early guesses proving wrong. Hedging can take a wide\nvariety of forms. On the overall systems design side, an attempt can be\nmade to design the system as a whole so that there is not too much\nsensitivity to variations in particular components. For components or\ndesign problems about which there is considerable uncertainty, parallel\napproaches can be undertaken, or a \"back-up\" project run at a low\nlevel of effort.

Implicit here is a two-stage notion of the\ndecision-making mechanism. In the first stage, a rough cut is made\neliminating a large number of alternatives (say in consideration of\ndominance by a particular other possible action). In the second stage,\na finer, more detailed comparative evaluation is made of the remaining\nalternatives. It is clear that in systems development, risk, due to tech-\nnological ignorance, should and does result in a major screening down\nof the alternatives in the first stage. It does this in part because gener-\nally the decision-maker tends to be a risk-averter (although one might\nargue that the U.S. government or the Department of Defense should\noptimize over a large enough portfolio of projects to provide insur-\nance). More important, the major reason why technological uncertain-\nty should and does eliminate many projects from consideration is that\nthe expected cost of the research undertaken and errors made in re-\nsolving the uncertainty is very great; given these expected learning\ncosts, the project simply is not an attractive gamble at the particular\ntime in question. The conjectures about efficient R. and D strategy\nmade in the preceding section can be put this way: in light of the high\nexpected learning costs involved in developing systems which will re-\nquire significant research and component development work before\nan operational design is achieved, these projects should generally not be\nentertained; instead research and component development should be\nused to try to assure that at any time there are attractive systems de-\nvelopment possibilities that can be based largely on existing or relatively\ncertain components and knowledge.\n\nOne important corrolary of this view is that the decision to under-\ntake a particular research or component development project need be\nviewed neither as a once-and-for-all decision, nor based on assessment\nof chances of success and the expected net return, if successful. Rath-\ner, in considerable measure the decision to initiate a project can be\nviewed as the decision to explore a possibility, aimed at finding out\nmore about the chances of success and the costs and benefits of the\nproject, if it were to be completed. With a large portfolio of projects\nand avoidance of having future systems developments hinge on the\nsuccess of any particular one, it may be desirable to run many risky\nprojects\u2014projects which, accounting full development cost, may have\na quite low expected return because the chance of success is small but\nwith some chance of very high return\u2014if it is possible for a limited\nexpenditure to improve assessment as to whether the project will prove\na success.\n\nThe Running of Systems Developments: The Importance of Hedg-\n"], "8": ["PUBLIC FINANCE 239\n\nproblem directly involved, but also other components and aspects of the\ndesign which were sensitive to the design of the problem component or\npart. Sometimes the entire effort had to be abandoned or resulted in a\nproduct of dubious value. Undertaking a systems development effort\nwhen there still are major uncertainties inherently greatly raises the\ncosts if anything goes wrong. Thus when the sought-for advance is\ngreat and there are major uncertainties regarding the details of a good\nsystem or even what system should be developed, there clearly are\nmajor advantages in delaying systems development decisions until\nmore is known and components are better explored. On the other\nhand, to delay research and component development until a system has\nbeen decided upon is to lose a principal benefit of this work: to guide\nchoices as to what systems to develop and how best to develop them.\nThe cases where the successful development of a new component or a\nresearch finding resulted in sharp appraisal regarding what systems\nwere worth developing are legion.\n\nTogether these arguments suggest that a strong research and compo-\nnent development effort not tied to particular systems developments\nmay be the key to good systems development choices and to systems\ndevelopment efforts which, to reach a given performance objective, do\nnot need to stretch so far.

To my\nknowledge no one yet has posed the R and D efficiency problem in\nterms of a formal programming model, except superficially. However,\nthe following view of the problem has evolved over the years in the lit-\nerature cited above.\n\nIn the theory of optimal production decision making the two key\nclasses of decision are choosing the quantities of different kinds of out-\nput to try to procure and selecting the mix of inputs used to produce\ngiven outputs. In the conventional formulation these decisions are\nmade optimally through the maximization of a payoff function (involv-\ning both benefits and costs) subject to constraints imposed by\nresource availabilities and the set of relevant production functions.\nWhile the conventional formulation admits a time sequencing of in-\nputs and outputs, for all practical purposes the full set of decisions\nis made on the basis of the information existing in the initial period.\nIn R and D there are similar classes of decision problems\u2014what\nR and D projects to undertake and how best to go about undertaking\nthem\u2014and a similar payoff function and set of constraints can be de-\nfined. However, the very great uncertainties regarding both payoffs and\nconstraints, the fact that the R and D process inherently involves learn-\ning, and the fact that today's R and D contributes to the ability to\nmake better R and D decisions tomorrow, suggest that the essence of\ngood policy is not making detailed decisions regarding future alloca-\ntions on the basis of present information. This implies that the ex-\npected benefits from any possible R and D allocation should be viewed\nas involving the creation of knowledge facilitating future choice, as\nwell as direct payoff in terms of systems performance. Further, the al-\nternative costs of undertaking an R and D project at any time should\nbe viewed as including consideration that if the same project were ini-\ntiated later both the uncertainties regarding costs and benefits, and the\nexpected cost and time of achieving a given performance, are likely to\nbe smaller.\n\nThe Role of Conventional Benefit-Cost.

Yet in R and D uncertainty is a key element of\nthe decision-making environment, learning is the essence of the R and\nD process, and external economies are of paramount importance.\n\nThe R and D process involves determining how to do something that\ncould not be done before, or at least not so well. In a far-reaching sys-\ntem or component development project there is bound to be consider-\nable uncertainty at the start. There certainly will be uncertainty re-\ngarding the time and cost needed to achieve a given broadly defined\nfinal design, and the performance characteristics of that final design\nalso are likely to be subject to considerable uncertainty. In part the\ncost, time, and performance outcome of a development project will be\nsensitive to the choice of components and the development approach,\nand it may be far from clear in advance (or even after the fact) which\ncomponents and approaches are best. In addition to uncertainties re-\ngarding cost and performance outcome, and about the best way to go\nabout development, there may be very great uncertainties regarding\nthe value of the final product, even if performance and cost objectives\nare met; in part this uncertainty is akin to any demand uncertainty\nbut it is highly accentuated in R and D because a radical new product\noften has a large part of its payoff in doing things that were not or\ncould not be done before.\n\nThe R and D process essentially is the process through which\nenough of these uncertainties are resolved so that an operational capa-\nbility is achieved. Much of the work involves research and experimen-\ntation to resolve the key technological uncertainties. Naturally, to ex-\nploit what is learned in the course of research and experimentation re-\nquires that a considerable amount of flexibility be maintained re-\ngarding the next round of decisions. Efficient decision making in R and\nD is inherently sequential, and involves both the acquisition of infor-\nmation and the maintenance of decision flexibility to give the informa-\ntion value.\n\nWhile much of what needs to be known for a successful development\nproject must be learned in the course of that project, earlier discussion\nof input-output relationships points out that today's research and de-\nvelopment builds on the results of yesterday's research and develop-\nment.

However, if major ad-\nvances in performance over existing products are sought, it becomes\nless likely that changing only a component or two will do the trick and\nless likely that there will be suitable new components (created for\nother purposes) which simply can be purchased from catalogues. \"Thus,\nin the absence of prior work to create the needed components, there\nsimply will be more components to design. It also is less likely that, in\nthe absence of prior work to create the relevant knowledge, existing\nknowledge will shed strong light on all the design and development\nproblems. This will increase input requirements in part because more\nresearch will be needed integral to the program to create the knowl-\nedge necessary to solve certain problems, and in part because, despite\nthe research, almost inevitably certain things will not work out as ex-\npected or hoped and a portion of the job will need to be redone, or per-\nhaps done many times, before a satisfactory solution is achieved. Thus\ncosts tend to rise with the magnitude of the advance sought largely be-\ncause the objective then requires going beyond the capabilities of ex-\nisting components and knowledge.\n\nIt is for this reason that the richness of the available stock of com-\nponents and the strength and scope of existing knowledge are impor-\ntant variables determining the inputs required to achieve a particular\nadvance. These are the variables that determine the ease or difficulty\nof moving significantly from the design of existing products. When the\ncatalogue is rich with components that have promising characteristics\nand the scope of knowledge far transcends the details of existing prod-\nucts, inventor-developers can work with design concepts considerably\ndifferent from existing products without being forced to create new\ncomponents and with considerable ability to predict how the designs\nwill work.

The cost of the program is the alternative cost of these re-\nsources.\n\nIt is convenient to think of these resources as being allocated among\nthree different kinds of projects. The final output of the program is\ncreated through \"systems\" development projects, where the term sys-\ntems refers to the complexes of interdependent components that make\nup the final products in the field under consideration.

Furthermore, particularly in defense\nand space R and D, but also in a few other areas, the objective is a\npace of technological progress seldom achieved in purely private sector\nproduct fields. While we may search in vain through the economic text-\nbooks on public finance for an appreciation of the fact, the efficient\nachievement of rapid technological advance now is a major problem of\npublic finance.*\n\nSuccess in achieving this objective depends on how well the charac-\nteristics of the underlying process\u2014the outputs, inputs, and their rela-\ntionships\u2014are understood. Understanding of these characteristics de-\ntermines the decision-maker's grasp of the range of and limits on the\nmeaningful strategies and actions open to him, and his ability to per-\nceive the implications of choosing one or another. While in broad prin-\nciple all constrained maximization problems have the same abstract\nform, the nature of the efficient strategies and relevant subdecisions,\nand the criterion which should be used to choose among alternative\ncourses of action can differ sharply from case to case.\n\nWhen dealing with allocation and decision problems regarding a\nprocess with which they are unfamiliar, economists rather naturally\ntend to carry over a view of the decision problems from the area with\nwhich they are most familiar\u2014production.

By my measurements,\n34,430 scientists and engineers were required to produce the\ncommodities exported compared to 9,762 who would have been re-\nquired to replace the imports. This leaves a net balance of 24,668.\n\nBy a similar application of American requirements to the trade of\nseveral countries, I obtain the results shown in Table 4. The value of\nthe trade balance shown in this table is influenced by the natural-\nresource content of the products being traded, whereas the skill bal-\nance is limited to direct requirements of the manufacturing activities\ninvolved. The table reveals that, in highly skilled categories, the\nUnited States provides almost one-half the apparent net \"flow\" of skills\nfrom the industrial countries.) Three industrial countries in combina-\ntion meet about nine-tenths of the net total requirements of the skill-\ndeficit countries for hard-to-acquire skills: the United States, West\nGermany, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe totals give some indication of the net flow of the services of\nskilled labor in trade from the industrial countries shown to the skill-\ndeficit countries not included in the table. The apparent flow to the\ncountries not shown in Table 4 has the following skill requirements,\nexpressed as a percent of the total labor requirements: Class I, 4.19;\nII, 2.63; III, 2.49; IV, 4.51; V, 8.66; VI, 16.05; VII, 14.46; VIII,\n47.00. By the standards of the first two tables, this is a skill-intensive\npattern.\n\nI expect that other interesting findings can be gleaned from this ap-\nproach. As a longer-term undertaking, these results seem to me to\npoint to a need for a major effort to compare disaggregated skill re-\nquirements in the production processes of different countries. Existing\ndata are woefully deficient for this task, and the cooperation of gov-\nernments will be required.\n\n\"Only the United States, of the countries shown, reports imports f.o.b.; the others report\n\nthem cif.

Important cultural differences would\ninclude a difference in time preferences and, acting in the same way,\nspecial tastes for education and training. Culturally-induced or physi-\ncally-induced differences might also occur in aptitude for technical\ntraining.\n\nRelaxing other assumptions, time preference\u2014and thus the propen-\nsity to \"save\" through additional training\u2014might be a function of in-\ncome. If so, high-income nations would have an especially strong de-\nmand for education. Migration might operate to reduce skill\ndifferences between populations\u2014international movements of trainees\nwould be especially important\u2014but, conceivably, migration might\nsharpen skill differences instead. A country enjoying not only a rela-\ntive abundance of skills but\u2014to readmit other factors into considera-\ntion\u2014abundant property per capita and economies of scale might\nenjoy especially high absolute wages and incomes. Such a country\nmight prefer skilled people, and operate its immigration restrictions\naccordingly. Even if it did not discriminate, skilled people, having\nhigher incomes in their first homes, would be better able to afford the\ncosts of migration.\n\nIn view of the possibilities of learning by doing and the need for\neducational aids in the training process, a high-income country able to\nafford an abundance of mechanical equipment and other training aids\nmay also enjoy advantages in training as a result of its material\nwealth.\n\nTo summarize, skill differences sufficient to produce persistent pat-\nterns of trade among nations may be caused by: (1) the lingering\ninfluence of historical differences in skill supplies, propagated down to\nthe present moment by a need for skilled workers to train skilled\nworkers; (2) cultural (or conceivably, physical) differences leading to\ncontrasts in desire and aptitude for skill-acquisition; (3) unequal in-\ncomes, perhaps relating to the skill situation, combined with a func-\ntional relationship between income and education and also between\nmaterial equipment and the learning process; (4) selective migration;\nand (5) an arbitrary division of labor that is sustained by trade.\n\nBecause skilled people are needed to train skilled people, national\nadvantages in skills may cumulate and may be reinforced by techno-\nlogical change even if differences in the desire and income to acquire\nskill are offset as much as possible by national policies.

Presumably a high wage\ndifferential, indicating a shortage of engineers, would cause an in-\ncreased rate of training.\n\nOne possibility is to assume that an equal fraction of the engineers\nwould be diverted into teaching in all countries having the same abso-\nlute wage differential, this fraction rising or falling with the wage\ndifferential. In this case, if the initial distribution of skills resulted in\nimmediate factor price equalization through trade, each country would\ntrain engineers in proportion to their initial numbers, the world total\nswelling or contracting according to the demand for engineers. If, in-\nstead, the initial skill endowments were so unevenly distributed as to\ncause specialization and factor price divergence, training would take\nplace more rapidly, relative to the initial numbers of engineers, in the\ncountries with the greatest shortages; but this process would continue\nonly until factor price equalization was achieved, which would occur\nlong before the initial asymmetrical distribution of skills had been\novercome. In either event, in the absence of further disturbances a sta-\ntionary state would be reached, in which trade would continue\nindefinitely along lines related to the initial skill distribution. Even if,\nas a matter of government policy, countries with a low proportion of\nengineers in their labor force were to subsidize training and divert an\nextra large fraction of their engineers into training, they could do so\nonly by temporarily increasing imports of engineer-intensive products\nand driving up the wages of engineers everywhere, or by artificially\nrestricting consumption of engineer-intensive products.\n\nIn short, if skilled workers were needed to train skilled workers, un-\nless we permitted an international movement of trainees or of trained\nworkers, the original skill endowment situation would exert a pro-\nlonged influence on trade patterns and would greatly benefit any coun-\ntry that started with a generous supply of much needed skill. Substan-\ntially the same results would occur if we assumed more complex re-\nquirements for training skilled workers, as long as there was a recur-\nsive nature to the process, with skills figuring in their own and each\nother's training requirements.\n\nTo suggest another variant, suppose training requirements of the\ntype just discussed were combined with changes of demand and tech-\nnology over time, in ways not well understood in advance, which,\nviewed in retrospect, turned out to consistently benefit certain skills in\nwhich the initial international distribution had been very uneven. In\nsuch a model we would observe increasing income gaps between skill-\nrich and skill-poor nations.\n\nThese possibilities underline a need to explain the assumption that\nat time zero each country was endowed with different skill supplies.\n", "252\n"], "3": ["INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS 251\n\ninterest, the earnings that they would forego by not working as un-\nskilled labor during their training period. Initially, the wage dif-\nferential of skilled labor over unskilled labor and the pattern of\ntrade would be governed by the supply and demand situation set up by\nthe arbitrary initial distribution of skills. In the long run, if time pref-\nerences were the same everywhere, the wage of unskilled labor would\nbe equalized everywhere through trade, training costs would dictate a\ncommon wage structure for all countries, and the initial locational cost\nadvantages would disappear. The results would be the same if other\nworkers besides the trainee were required in the training process, as\nlong as only unskilled labor was required.\n\nIn each of these three cases, how labor skill supplies in each country\nwould react to changing wage differentials and how trade would adjust\nto the elimination of its original locational cost basis are matters for\nfuther specification. Under appropriate assumptions, some form of in-\nertia would maintain an international division of labor related to the\ninitial skill situation; under other assumptions, trade would disappear.\nFrom these variants, we see that transformation of the factor supply\nthrough training could serve to eliminate a need for trade, though\ntrade could equally sustain an arbitrary, asymmetrical distribution of\nskills and training.\n\nA modification in the original assumptions, of course, might create\nlocational cost differences around which trade would appear. An inter-\nesting case would arise from frequent changes in technology and de-\nmand. Skill requirements would change continually, perhaps in unfore-\nseen ways. Trade would emerge based on disequilibria between current\nneeds and past training. Countries (and individuals within them)\nwould reap wind\u00edall gains by having been trained in the skill that\nproved to be most needed as technology shifted. The length of the\ntraining period as we!l as the cost would help to determine the extent\nof these gains. Under conditions of stable technology and demand, by\ncontrast, the introduction of transport costs into the model, while cre-\nating numerous theoretical complications, would almost certainly re-\nsult in a tendency toward each country or region producing for its own\nconsumption.\n\nNow consider a case where the training of skilled workers could\nonly be done by skilled workers of the same type. The country that\nstarted at time zero with a relative abundance of engineers would also\npossess a relatively great capacity for training engineers. How a coun-\ntry's supply of engineers would react to any level or change of the\nwage differential of skilled over unskilled workers calls for special as-\nsumptions. After all, if the rewards of joining a professions were to in-\ncrease or decrease, part of the training cost (the pay of the teachers)\nwould shift in the same way, though the other part, the opportunity\n", "251\n"], "2": ["250 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nal countries at a similar level of development.

How fast can we expect skill differences\namong populations\u2014and the consequent basis for trade\u2014to shift?\n\nTo assist exploration of these questions, I shall introduce a simple\nmodel in which I shall specify alternate forms of the training process\nand examine their intluence on trade.

Tastes are everywhere the same, independent of the level and\ndistribution of income. Production functions are the same in all coun-\ntries and are linear and homogeneous in the first degree. The only fac-\ntors of production are unskilled labor and one or more types of skilled\nlabor.\n\nI shall further assume that this world starts at time zero when each\ncountry is endowed with different skill supplies, expressed as fractions\nof the national labor force. I shall return to this assumption later.\nAfter time zero, populations are constant and international migration\nis not allowed, though workers move freely within each country.\nSkilled workers die off\u2014with the initial skilled and unskilled workers\nexhibiting the same mortality rate\u2014and people who are born inherit\nno skills. Skills are replaced, acquired, or changed by learning process-\nes specified differently in each variant of the model.?\n\nTo start with, consider three variants that all involve essentially the\nsame outcome. First, suppose the learning of skills were a costless and\ninstantaneous process. Identical wages would immediately become es-\ntablished for all skills. This would eliminate any locational cost advan-\ntage based on the initial distribution of skills. As a second variant,\nsuppose that the learning of new skills were costless, disturbing neither\nproduction nor consumption, but merely required a greater or shorter\nperiod of time. At first, trade patterns would relate to the initial dis-\ntribution of skills; skills that were scarce, relative to the demand,\nmight command a wage premium. After sufficient time had elapsed for\nnew workers to be trained in every skill, a!l skills would command the\nsame wage as unskilled labor, eliminating the original locational cost\nadvantages. As a third variant, suppose that acquisition of skills in-\nvolved a cost, but a cost payable entirely in terms of unskilled labor.\nFor example, the simplest form of training cost would occur if workers\nhad to stay out of the labor force in order to teach themselves. In this\ncase, let us assume that workers would train themselves in skills wher-\never they expected, over their lifetime, to be repaid, with appropriate\n\n* Here and later, my approach borrows heavily from the work on \"human capital\" of\n\nTheodore W.

This argument is\nvalid either if we take the nationalistic view of the country or if the\nperson's work would have been associated with large external effects.\nIn this case, also, the nationalistic view is to be rejected for the rea-\nsons presented earlier. While it is popular to argue that external effects\nare frequent in market economies, we have ben unable to discover\neconomically significant instances where individuals provide social ser-\nvices associated with their person rather than profession for which\nthey are not paid\u2014including in work fostering economic development.\n\nAnother frequently heard allegation is that the emigration of the\nhighly educated is equivalent to a Darwinian process of selecting the\nbest, which causes a reduction in the genetic \"quality\" of the country's\nhuman stock and influences national welfare in the long run. This is\nprobably a valid argument in principle but its empirical significance is\nlikely to be quite small, given the small relative size of the migratory\nflows and the population stocks.

What is relevant for our purposes of analysis is that the av-\nerage burden of financing education falling on the emigrant's genera-\ntion is not changed by his departure, because he takes along not only\nhis contribution to tax revenue but also his children, on whom this\nshare of revenue would have been spent.\n\nAnalogous arguments can be made for the financing of other govern-\nment services such as defense, police protection, judicial services, etc.\nHowever, in all of these instances, including education, the conclusion\nthat no adverse welfare effects result from a person's emigration is\nvalid only if the incidence of taxes is equal to the incidence of benefits\nfrom government services.\n\nThere is evidence that the enjoyment of the quantitatively most\nsignificant services provided by governments is largely proportional to\nthe taxpayers' income, which includes return on human capital.

Second, the more rapidly a re-\nplacement for the emigrant can be trained, the smaller the losses. It is\ndif\u00fccult to generalize about the characteristics of individual profes-\nsions or national education systems in regard to these qualities, but it\nseems reasonable to expect that the emigration of a well-established,\nexperienced professional will cause greater frictional losses than would\nthe emigration of a common laborer or the decision of a student not to\nreturn home. Also, we would expect that bursts of heavy emigration\nalternating with periods of low emigration rates present more difficult\nadjustment problems than do steady flows, even if the latter represent\na greater long-run average than do the former, because of the econo-\nmy's likely structural adjustments to predictable changes.\n\nOf greater analytical interest than these short-run costs of adjust-\nment to emigration are the long-run effects on welfare associated with\nfailures of the free market to allocate resources efficiently. There are\ntwo main sources of such inefficiencies which appear to underlie most\nof the arguments about losses from the emigration of highly skilled\npersons.\n\nThe first category of losses has to do with genuine externalities,\nwhere the market fails properly to compensate the individual for the\ncontributions he makes to society. It is important to note that these\nexternalities must be directly associated with the personal character-\nistics of the emigrant and not his profession. Thus, if a typical doctor's\nwork contains a large measure of social benefits for which he does not\nget compensated, these benefits are lost to society only for the length\nof time required to train another person to take his place as a doctor.\nIt therefore follows that in many of the well-known instances of genu-\nine external effects in consumption or production, emigration imposes\nonly short-run frictional costs to society which disappear in the long\nrun.\n\nWhile it is difficult enough to find genuine cases of economically\nsignificant externalities in the real world, it is even more difficult to\nfind cases which have the added limitation of being associated with a\nspecific person. Examples coming to mind are the external disecono-\nmies from alcoholism or the nonmarket benefits accruing to others\nfrom a person's propensity to engage in political or charity work with-\nout monetary compensation. The difficulty of finding meaningful ex-\namples may legitimately be taken as an indication of the relative un-\nimportance of most externalities given the size of the resources allocat-\ned through properly functioning markets.\n\nThe second category of losses stems from market failure remedied\nthrough activities of the government. It is alleged that the emigration\n"], "3": ["270 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nhuman welfare in the long run is the standard of living; that is, the\nquantity of goods and services available for consumption. Therefore,\nin the following analysis we will focus our attention on the changes in\nincome brought about by the emigration of highly skilled individuals.\n\nlf a country wishes to maximize the income available to all its peo-\nple, then emigration should be welcomed whenever two conditions are\nmet. These are, first, that the emigrant improves his own income and,\nsecond, that the migrant's departure does not reduce the income of\nthose remaining behind. The first condition is normally met when emi-\ngration is voluntary. Specification of the circumstances under which\nthe second holds true will occupy the rest of this paper.\n\nIII\n\nAccording to the traditional analysis of the migration of labor, the\ndeparture of a person normally raises the long-run average income of\nthe people remaining, because it results in an increase in the nation's\ncapital-labor ratio. In the case of the migration of a highly skilled per-\nson, however, this conclusion does not hold if the human capital em-\nbodied in the emigrant is greater than the country's total per capita\nendowment of human and physical capital, assuming perfect substituta-\nbility of the two forms of capital in the long run. In this case the emi-\ngration of a highly skilled person reduces the total income to be dis-\ntributed among the residents of a country and it follows that in soci-\neties where this distribution occurs through planning or other nonmar-\nket means the remaining population suffers a reduction in welfare.\n\nIn a market economy where persons are paid their marginal prod-\nuct, however, such a reduction in per capita income is only a statistical\nphenomenon which has no influence on the welfare of the remaining\npeople: the emigrant removes both his contribution to national out-\nput and the income that gives him a claim to this share, so that other\nincomes remain unchanged. There may be income redistribution effects\nthrough changes in the marginal products of the remaining people, but\nsince the brain drain involves rather small numbers of people, these\neffects are likely to be small enough to be safely considered negligible.\n\nThus it follows that in a market economy any effects that the emi-\ngration of a highly skilled person is likely to have on the welfare on\nthose remaining behind must be sought either in short-run adjustment\ncosts or in market failures.\n\nThe short-run costs are due to production losses\u2014specifically those\ncreated by the unemployment or inefficient employment of factors of\nproduction whose effectiveness depends on cooperation with the skills\nthe departing person takes along. The size of these costs depends on\ntwo elements.

From this point of view, a person's\nemigration absolutely reduces his country's mobilizable manpower,\nand its national output is lowered by the amount the emigrant con-\ntributed to it.\n\nWhile this view of national losses is held quite widely, it is sorely\noutmoded in our age. The identification of military power with the\nnumber of a country's inhabitants, even if they are highly skilled, is\nvery vague and precarious. Wealth, science, and technology dominate\nmodern warfare, and it is quite easy for most nations to purchase mili-\ntary equipment on the world market at costs much below those that\nwould have to be incurred in the development of individual national\nweapons systems.

In this respect, the in-\nputs of the patent system into the process of innovation are clearly\nlimited. As the number of patents is increased further, this deficiency\nwill become a more serious obstacle to potential innovation.\n\nInternational Implications\n\nOur increasing involvement in international trade and in the eco-\nnomic welfare of other countries adds a new dimension to the public\npolicies which a\u00edfect patents and competition. Both sets of policies\ninfluence free trade in an important way. Both sets can exert\nsignificant influences on international economic integration and on the\nfurther development of many countries.\n\nDespite any considerable progress in reducing tariffs and eliminating\nquota systems, international trade may be held back by effective non-\ntariff barriers. Prominent among these barriers are national patent sys-\ntems and restrictive business practices.\n\nNational patent systems, as well as trademarks, provide an effective\nmechanism for implementing tacit agreements to maintain exclusive\nmarkets. The owner or exclusive licensee of a United States patent can\nprevent the imports of the patented product; his German counterpart\ncan keep out the United States goods, as well as the French product.\n\nSimilar results may obtain through international business agree-\nments to restrict output, prices, or markets. Such arrangements may\nreduce imports and exports. They may serve to raise prices collected\nby the members of the cartel or to reduce the prices they pay for mate-\nrials. They may be employed to restrict product and process innova-\ntion in order to protect the values of fixed plant and equipment or to\nsafeguard market positions.\n\nRegardless of which methods are employed to restrict the flow of\ninternational trade, they can suppress potential innovation either by\ndirect control or by eliminating competitive pressures. A free move-\nment of imports can compel producers to seek ways and means of re-\nducing costs in order to meet import prices. The limitation on imports\npermits the continuation of domestic production methods without\nseeking greater efficiency and lower costs.\n\nThe growing international trade, together with the development of\ntransnational corporations, has produced an interesting challenge to\nthe patent system.

Today we have\nseveral patent systems in the United States. While one government\noffice issues letters patent, the enforcement of patent rights is adminis-\ntered by the courts. Yet, the lack of uniformity in judicial interpreta-\ntion of patents has created not one but a number of systems. An illus-\ntration of this diversity may be found in the rulings of two federal ju-\ndicial circuits. During the period 1948 to 1954, the Fourth Circuit\nupheld 37 percent of the patents that were litigated. In contrast, the\nSecond Circuit upheld 2.6 percent of the patents it considered.\n\n'The federal government's tremendous involvement in research and\ndevelopment has produced a new set of problems affecting patents on\ninventions produced through federally sponsored projects. There\nare many alternative solutions: royalty-free patent licenses for the\ngovernment; dedication of the patents in the public domain; federal\nownership; royalty-free licenses for the contractor; ownership by the\ncontractor; federal licenses issued to one company or to all. Many\npublic debates have been heard. Yet none has been based on substan-\ntial empirical analysis. Indeed, it seems fair to say that the discussion\nhas been notable for considerable cant about patent tradition, property\nrights, and the \"public interest\" with little analytical substance.

The tremendous growth of interde-\npendence in the economy has driven us into a proliferation of federal\nactivities in the last several decades. Interdependence affects all ele-\nments in the economy: automobile production in Detroit affects fruit\nfarmers in California; total wages paid have an influence on corporate\nprofits and investment; prices and wage levels in key industries affect\ninflationary pressures; government expenditures and budget balances\nhave a bearing on the level of industrial activity and farm prices.\n\nAt the same time, the process of innovation has undergone profound\nchanges in important industrial sectors. Such fields as atomic energy\nand space have required organizational frameworks and expenditures\nwhich surpass the capacities of any industrial complexes. Instead of an\ninventive process which depends on the work of others, many current\ndevelopments require coordinated progress on many fronts. The suc-\ncess of the Wright brothers rested on the invention of an internal com-\nbustion engine which generated enough power relative to its weight. In\ncontrast, the success of the Gemini program required a planned group\nof many projects in metallurgy, propellants, electronics, computers,\nand medical science. Such balanced progress must depend on the\nresources of the federal government.\n\nIn response to the profound changes in our economy and technology\nduring the last several decades, there has developed a pattern of feder-\nal activities which cannot be reconciled with the relative simplicity of\nthe problems which affected congressional action in 1790 and 1890.\n'The first antitrust statute, passed in 1890, did not provide for an en-\nforcement agency. Today we find important antitrust provisions in\nabout forty-five statutes (not including amendments) and over twenty\nfederal agencies with enforcement functions.

The Sherman Act of 1890\nwas derived from existing common law principles and was passed in\nresponse to pressures to alleviate a fairly direct industrial problem. In-\ndeed, there is evidence that the Congress did not envisage the far-\nreaching implications of the statute. Neither act required the consid-\neration of problems which were as serious or complicated as those\nwhich we must face today.\n\nChanges in Conditions\n\nThe complexities of today's public policy problems could not be vi-\nsualized in 1790 and 1890. A realization of the profound interde-\npendence of the various sectors of the economy had only begun to\nemerge at the end of the nineteenth century. There seemed to be little\nneed to consider those governmental functions which could stimulate\nand support the operations of a relatively free market.\n\nIn 1790 the Jeffersonian philosophy of laissez faire, ably supported\nby Adam Smith's intellectual contribution, produced the tenet that the\ngovernment which governs least will govern best. Although this atti-\ntude affected federal activities only, it dominated the political orienta-\ntion of the day.\n\nTherefore, the grant of a patent right was regarded merely as a logi-\ncal extension of conventional rights in industrial property. There ex-\nisted no need to devote serious consideration to the needs of the econo-\nmy, to federal stimulation of invention, or to the relations between\npatents and competition. Nor was there any concern about the rela-\ntions between private patent rights and government-financed develop-\nment.\n\nIn 1890 public consideration of the antitrust problem rose out of the\nGranger movement. Farmers were concerned about the influences of\nthe big trusts on prices they received and the prices they paid. They\npushed for the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 to\nregulate railroad rates and the Sherman Act. In line with the spirit of\nthe 1880's, the legislative objectives were confined to limitations on the\npower of the railroads and the trusts.\n\nThe objective of the Sherman Act was direct: to break up the trusts.\nIts passage was not wrapped in concern about the implications of the\nemerging industrial economy. Trust-busting merely reflected the farm-\ners? protest against the concentrated industrial power which affected\nthem as producers. The Sherman Act was intended to eliminate abuses\nin a simple agrarian economy. It constituted only a minor departure\nfrom the Jeffersonian thinking.

The courts have also tended increas-\ningly to deny the patentee exclusive use where it results in significant\nmonopoly power. According to one patent law and antitrust authority,\nbetween 1941 and 1957 over 100 judgments, involving more than 300\nantitrust defendants, provided for compulsory licensing or outright\ndedication of as many as 35,000 patents [9]. The welfare effects of\nthis development, however, are not so evident. As Professor Frederic\nScherer and his associates discovered, once corporations have been\nsubjected to patent dedication or compulsory licensing decrees they\ntend to patent less [10]. This result could be attributable to a reduc-\ntion in their inventive and innovational effort or to their placing greater\nreliance on secrecy and less reliance on the patent system for pro-\ntection. Since there is no evidence that the large corporations operating\nunder the decrees have, as a group, decreased their outlays on R and D\nrelative to all corporations, the presumption is that they have substi-\ntuted some secrecy for patenting. One consequence of this is a reduc-\ntion in the total stock of knowledge available to the scientific commu-\nnity generally and, ultimately, a reduction in the rate of technological\nprogress.

To illustrate, a simultaneous development of a new product\nX and a new product Y (see figure), both monopolized and sold at\nprices having the same ratio as their previous competitive prices, may\nlead to the ideal output Es.\n\nThe welfare model is a way of defining how antitrust and patent pol-\nicies affect innovation; it provides very little in the way of insights as\nto what these effects have in fact been. While the noticeable lack of\nconclusive factual evidence on precisely how two such time-honored\nand important domestic economic policies have affected the course of\nindustrial technology may be regrettable, this factual void explains in\nlarge measure why the historical courses of the two policies have been\ngoverned by the a priori case for them. Once the legislation establish-\ning them was enacted, no persuasive factual grounds for eliminating or\nsubstantially altering them materialized.\n\nIt seems to be generally agreed that in the hundred years that sepa-\nrated the first patent statute and the enactment of the Sherman Act\nthe original safeguards that surrounded the patent grant were substan-\ntially weakened through legislative revision, judicial interpretation,\nand unchecked abuses of the system by private parties: Congress ex-\ntended the period of exclusive use from fourteen to seventeen years in\n1861; other statutory revisions over the years and actions by the\ncourts and the Patent Office enlarged the area of patent coverage.\nBusiness firms took advantage of the liberal legal boundaries, often\noverstepped them [14, p. 450]. In the absence of a national policy\nconstraining monopoly generally, these developments were not particu-\nlarly anomalous; unprincipled use of a patent right to fix prices was\nprobably no more nor no less inimical to economic welfare than simple\nunprincipled price fixing.\n\nAs antitrust policy slowly developed to its present strength, conflicts\narose between the liberal patent system of the past and the relatively\nvigorous antitrust policy of the present. Increasingly, these conflicts\nappear to have been resolved in favor of antitrust [6]. The courts\nhave proscribed price-fixing clauses in patent license agreements [10]\nand they have begun to set higher standards of patentability [2]. It\nwas argued earlier that, a priori, a strong patent policy and a strong\nantitrust policy should stimulate innovation.

The Empirical Evidence\n\nAs pointed out earlier, neither the appropriate techniques of mea-\nsurement nor the requisite data for factual verification of this proposi-\ntion are available, but what crude tools and data as are available tend\ngenerally to support the hypothesis.\n\nFirst, as antitrust policy in the two decades since World War II has\nbeen extended to encompass a wider range of business practices (e.g.,\nmerger through asset acquisition, joint venture, etc.) and administered\nagainst those it has traditionally encompassed with increased vigor,\nbusiness firms have greatly stepped up their commitment to inventive\neffort. By any yardstick of measurement antitrust policy has become a\nmore much important force on the contemporary United States scene\nthan it once was [1] [7].

It\nwould follow from this that in the absence of the relevant quantitative\ndata, the net effect of patent and antitrust policies on welfare-improv-\ning innovations is speculative. The inconclusiveness of the received\nopinions on this issue, however, stems in large part from our failure to\nhave distinguished between the operative mechanics of static welfare\nmodels and dynamic processes of the economic system.\n\nTo return to the first of the three components of the problem enum-\nerated above, it can be persuasively argued a priori that the patent\nlaws and antitrust policy interact to stimulate the rate of innovation;\nthat is, the two policies reenforce rather than offset each other. This\nfollows from the simple and presumably valid assumption that in a\nmarket economy business firms willingly incur costs to establish a mo-\nnopoly position commensurate with the difference between anticipated\nmonopoly and competitive profits. A retrospective view of the long\nand varied history of monopolistic practices in Western-type market\neconomies surely confirms the validity of the assumption that there is\na high propensity to monopolize. Even in the United States, where the\nmost flagrant forms of monopoly and monopolistic practices have been\nproscribed by law, business firms have pursued the prize of monopoly\ngains in a wide variety of ways. Presumably had there been no legal\nrestraints of any kind imposed on the means firms employed for ob-\ntaining such gains, the variety would have been even more impressive.\n\nIt should follow logically from this that as certain means of seeking\nthe rewards of monopoly are foreclosed by law, there will be a shift in\nefforts to monopolize from those now illegal to the remaining legal\nmeans. In a society generally conceded to be law-abiding this shift\nwould be expected simply out of considerations of morality. But even\nif the \"morality effect\" were ignored, the economic incentives alone\nwould assure a shift from the illegal to the legal means of monopoly.\nAs most manufacturers now must know, when a given means toward\nmonopoly reward is transferred by appropriate statutes from the legal\nto the illegal classification, the costs of using it are increased. In fact,\nif all the possible routes toward monopoly reward except one were\neffectively blocked by legal barriers, the single remaining open route\nshould be traveled much more heavily than were all routes left open.\n\nIn the United States the patent laws, at least in theory, have for 175\nyears made invention and its attendant innovational activity an open\nroad to monopoly gain; contrariwise, antitrust statutes enacted over\nthe past 75 years have gradually foreclosed most of the remaining more\nobvious means for attaining such gains.

While Schmookler goes on to argue that\nrecently developed evidence indicates that the endogenous component\nin technological change is probably dominant in modern economies, the\nparametric value representing the degree of dominance has not yet\nbeen computed, nor is it likely to be computed in the forseeable fu-\nture. And even if it were, the linkage between technological change and\nthe patent system and antitrust policy\u2014only two of the several environ-\nmental factors affecting it\u2014would still have to be determined. Again,\nthe prospects of establishing these linkages in precise terms seem re-\nmote [5]. In short, it may be stated that innovational activity is a\nfunction of certain variables, some specified and some as yet unspec-\nified, but the parameters of this equation are unknown. For this rea-\nson the analysis that follows of necessity leans heavily upon a priori\npostulations which, while they may be examined for consistency with\ncertain historical facts, can be neither verified nor disproved.\n\nSince so much has been written on the broad subject of public policy\nand innovational activity, it should be emphasized that this paper is\nconcerned with the joint effects of the patent and antitrust laws. Each\nset of laws unquestionably also has its independent effects, although\nexactly what these effects are may not be apparent. For example, anti-\ntrust policy has surely prevented firms from attaining the size they\notherwise might obtain, but has nevertheless permitted the creation of\nvery large firms. If there is a relationship between firm size and inno-\nvational activity [9], antitrust policy has affected the level of such ac-\ntivity through its effect on the size of the firm. Similarly, since patent\nsystems have existed for many years in societies that have virtually no\nantimonopoly policy, there is a presumption that the patent incentive\nalso exerts its own independent effects.\n\nIL. The Hypothesis\n\nWe start then by hypothesizing what the joint effect of our antitrust\npolicy and patent laws on innovation logically should be. The problem\nmay be broken down into three components: (1) are the effects of the\ntwo public policies on innovation complementary or offsetting, (2) is\ntheir total (or net) effect on innovation positive or negative, and (3) if\nthe net effect on innovation is positive, is the contribution of the pol-\nicy-induced innovations to public welfare greater or less than the price\nsociety pays for them in the form of inefficient resource allocation re-\nsulting from the monopoly the patent system legalizes?\n\nWhile I have not examined all\u2014or even a large fraction\u2014of the lit-\nerature concerned with these three components, I rather suspect that\nmost of it weakly subscribes to the view that the patent system, in le-\n"], "1": ["I. The Problem\n\nQuantitative analysis has now been in its ascendancy in economics\nfor several decades. It would therefore be highly appropriate on this\noccasion to marshall conclusive factual evidence showing the measur-\nable impact United States antitrust and patent laws have had on inno-\nvation. The reasons why this approach can be pursued on altogether\ntoo limited a scale are painfully apparent, but perhaps they merit brief\nmention.\n\nInnovation, or, more precisely, the economic value of innovations, is\nnot readily measurable. Even for simple cost-reducing innovations the\nproblem of measurement has not been satisfactorily solved, and any-\none who has followed the growing (and imposing) attempts at mea-\nsuring quality-improving innovations is still left with that nagging\nfeeling that a 1965 and a 1930 automobile not only perform the same\nfunctions differently, they also perform different functions. A compari-\nson between the new and the old often is in part a matter of more or\nless, but in larger measure it is a matter of incomparable differences.\nAnd for truly new products there is no appropriate analogy to be\nfound in the preceding time period.\n\nHowever, this is only the beginning of the problem. Innovation as\nused in economics is dependent in no small measure on invention in a\nscientific sense. Scientific discoveries are obviously determined in part,\npossibly in large part, by the scientific effort devoted to inventive\nactivity. But it is not equally as apparent that inventive effort is\nentirely, or even largely, determined by the economic incentives in-\ncorporated in social policies designed to encourage technical progress.\nIn fact, as Professor Schmookler argued persuasively at the Seventy-\nseventh Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association one\nyear ago, the linkage between \"the economy\" and technological change\nhas received very little attention because for the most part several gen-\n\n* This is one of several papers on which I have received financial assistance from the\nFord Foundation's Inter-University Research Program on the Micro-Economics of Tech-\nnical Change and Economic Growth.

It is perfectly clear, however, that\nthe legislative changes necessary to inaugurate a discriminatory policy\nwould be difficult to draft. The position is defensible that until enough\nis known of the particular circumstances in which patents retard rather\nthan encourage technical progress no policy changes should be made.\nThe same argument, however, could be used to stall virtually all legisla-\ntion affecting the operation of markets.

Such propositions seem incorrect\nwhen a progressing science is closely allied to the technology of an in-\ndustry and largely irrelevant to technical progress\u2014though not to\ncompetition\u2014when no science is closely related.\n\nIf science affords continuing opportunities for firms to improve exist-\ning products, to introduce new products as substitutes or complements\nto existing products, or to lower costs of production, the firms can\nhardly fail to search the horizons of science for these opportunities ex-\ncept in an environment which is otherwise noncompetitive. While there\nare risks associated with investment in research and innovation, failure\non the part of an individual firm to undertake these risks entails the\nmore substantial risk that another will succeed. That is, in a rapidly\nchanging technical environment, the choice not to search for new pro-\nducts and processes almost certainly entails declining profits and market\nshares if the other firms are not known to be making the same choice.\nEven a collective decision by all firms not to search has such an expected\npayoft if there are no substantial barriers to entry.\n\n'The previous arguments have indicated that a competitive market is\nnot likely to result in the context of a rapidly changing technology. This\nis true with or without patents in the hands of leading firms. But the\nsocial results appear better if the patent positions of these firms are not\nallowed to accumulate to a point that so much of the past developments\nare encompassed that entry is effectively barred. Without a strong\npatent position for existing firms\u2014individually or collectively\u2014and\nwithout other, nontechnical barriers to entry, the changing scientific\nbase will encourage the entry of new firms except as the existing firms\nthemselves prevent it by adopting the economically preferable alterna-\ntives which science affords.

Whether such a restrained policy is in\nfact sufficient to allow the growth of UHF stations and to offset the\neffects of CATV's on the local programming available to subscribers\nand also to nonsubscribers is difficult to say at the present time.\n\nOne further point. It is clear that the encouragement of local diver-\nsity in television is a legitimate aim of public policy. This is particular-\nly evident if we recall the noneconomic benefits of such a policy in a\nfree society. Regulation of CATV may be necessary to preserve that\ndiversity in the presence of the economically inefficient methods now\nused to sustain it. Yet one cannot but feel that such regulation is but\nanother patch on a set of arrangements not particularly well suited to\npublic ends.

By their nature, CATV's are largely restricted to towns\nand cities where a relatively short cable can serve many viewers. The\nlocal stations whose programming may be affected, however, do not\nmerely serve the CATV subscribers. Rather, they broadcast over a\nconsiderably greater area. If local programming is changed as a result\nof CATV competition, therefore, there is an external effect on the tele-\nvision services available to nonsubscribers. The resulting possible dis-\nutility to such viewers is obviously not included in the CATV costs paid\nby subscribers.!?\n\nFinally, aside from these arguments, the technological situation is\nchanging in a way that may mean that CATV's if temporarily inhib-\nited would not be profitable in a few years in many of the markets\nwhich they have entered and are entering. The effect of the All-Chan-\nnel Law is clearly to remove one of the limitations to local-market entry\nby new broadcast stations as the existing stock of television sets de-\npreciates. A market which currently has not a full network lineup of\nVHF stations because it has not been assigned three VHF channels\n(for reasons of signal overlap) may very well support additional\nUHF stations, both network-affiliated and independent, when most\nsets can receive them. Were such stations in existence, CATV ser-\nvices would be far less attractive to subscribers. With unregulated\nCATV's in the principal towns of a given area, however, entry of such\nUHPF stations is likely to be substantially inhibited. Moreover, such\nUHF entry will serve the surrounding area and local diversity of pro-\ngramming is obviously less likely to be inhibited by local competition\nthan by competition from large-city stations brought in on CATV's.\n\nIn short, given the economically highly inefficient institutional ar-\nrangements in local television broadcasting and given the changing\ntechnological situation, the FCC's policy of mild regulation of CATV's\nmay be a reasonable one. Indeed, it may clearly be the case that non-\ncarriage and duplication protection of local stations does not go far\nenough. Yet it is well to be cautious. The effects of the All-Channel\nLaw are as yet in the uncertain future and the diversity of program-\nming provided by big city independent stations which are carried on\n\n?[t should be noted that the argument does not depend for the most part on local\nprograms being the ones which are sacrificed when revenues fall (or fail to rise).

The nonduplication rule is less clear-\nly so, especially when simultaneous duplication is not involved. The\nFCC clearly wishes to protect local stations, but the protection of com-\npetition does not generally mean the protection of particular competi-\ntors. We must therefore consider whether the FCC's favoring of local\nstations is a well-grounded policy. We shall do this by considering the\ngeneral arguments as to whether CATV entry into local markets\nshould be unimpeded by regulatory action rather than by discussing\nthe wisdom of the nonduplication rule in particular.\n\nThe argument in favor of unregulated CATV expansion is simple\nand apparently strong. CATV's provide a service the cost of which the\nusers are apparently willing to pay. To argue that regulation is desir-\nable in such a situation, one must argue that the general presumption\nthat such a service is worth providing is invalid in the instant case for\nreasons special to the CATV broadcasting industry.\n\n\"There are indeed such reasons. We saw above that FCC policy, the\nline-of-sight limitation, and barriers to entry into local television mar-\nkets have led to a situation in which local programming is subsidized\nby the profits earned by broadcast stations on other types of programs.\nWe argued that for reasons of public interest such local programming\nmay be desirable or that it may be that viewers, if charged directly,\nwould support such programming. Yet CATV competition drawn by\nthose very profits tends to lessen or eliminate them. It follows that\nsuch competition may very well lead to a substantial alteration in local\nprogramming\u2014to an end to such local diversity as the FCC has been\nable to foster under the line-of-sight limitation.\n\nYet this is not a result which can reasonably be said to be presented\nto the individual CATV subscriber when he subscribes. If local pro-\ngrams are valued by him, then the amount which he is willing to pay\nfor CATV services is greater than would be the case if he knew that\nlocal programs would be changed by his action. Even if this were ex-\nplained to him in detail, it would make no difference, since the public\ngood character of television financing makes it not in the interest of\nany individual subscriber to take into account the effect of CATV\non local stations even if it would be in the collective interest of\nall such individuals to do so.

Further, most stations are affiliated\nwith one or more of the three major networks and thus show principal-\nly network programs in prime evening time. Thus, a CATV which lo-\ncates in the market area of an existing station and which carries that\nstation's signal is quite likely also to carry the prime time programs of\nthat station from another source, either simultaneously or on a some-\nwhat different schedule depending on the scheduling of network pro-\ngrams by different stations. Such a CATV does not merely provide its\nsubscribers with programs competing with those shown by the local\nstation; it provides the identical product except for the dial position\nor, possibly, the time the programs are scheduled.\n\nFinally, there is evidence that the average CATV subscriber in one-\nand two-station markets watches the television considerably more than\nthe average off-the-air viewer able to receive a similar set of signals.*\nIn part this may be due to the better average signal quality which may\nbe afforded the average CATV viewer as opposed to the signal quality\nof off-the-air reception available to the average viewer in a small mar-\nket able to receive a similarly large number of signals from overlap-\nping distant sources. In part at least it is probably due to the self-se-\nlection of subscribers. It is the avid television fan who is most likely to\npay for the services of a CATV system. To the extent that this is the\ncase, a CATV does not merely affect a station in whose area it locates\nby affecting the viewing habits of a part of that station's market cho-\nsen, as it were, at random; it affects the habits of a part of that sta-\ntion'Ss market which accounts for a disproportionately large share of\nthat station's audience measured in terms of actual viewing.\n\nAll these things mean that CATV's, while aiding the stations whose\nsignals they bring to viewers otherwise unable to receive them, have a\nsubstantial long-run impact on the revenues and profits of stations in\nwhose market areas they locate.?

This it\ndoes primarily through offering viewers a substantial range of alterna-\ntive signals, so that its effect (so far as subscribers are concerned) is\nrather like that of the entry of several new broadcast stations into the\ngiven area. There are, however, three reasons which (where applica-\nble) make a CATV's impact on the audience and revenues of an ex-\nisting local station more pronounced than is suggested by the view that\nit simply involves the provision of alternative signals to a given num-\nber of viewers.\n\nIn the first place, a CATV subscriber generally does not retain his\nability to view programs off the air after his set is connected to the\nCATV cable. Even in the minority of cases in which this is not so, he\nmust activate a special switching device to change from CATV to off-\nthe-air reception.

As is\nthe case (under present institutional arrangements) with the construc-\ntion and operation of a television station itself, the profits from the\nconstruction of a booster or a satellite station must therefore come\nfrom the additional demand for advertising time on the parent station\ngenerated by the existence of the additional audience which the new\nfacility will allow advertisers to reach when their commercials appear\non the parent station. While such a return has frequently been (and\nstill is) present in sufficient measure to justify the construction and\noperation of a booster, particularly in communities with little or no\npreexisting television service, it clearly depends ex ante on forecasts of\nthe size of the extra audience which will actually view the station's re-\nbroadcast signal. It is further dependent on the desire of advertisers\nto reach the entered market via the given station rather than in some\nother way (which may already be in use).*\n\n\"Thus, especially as a means of entry into markets with some existing\ntelevision service, boosters and satellite stations may not always seem\nso attractive a proposition as some device which can gain revenues di-\nrectly from the users without nonuser benefits and which is attractive\nto users because it brings in several different television signals rather\nthan one. Such a device is the CATV.\n\nThe original CATV's were simply giant television antennas. Such an\nantenna set up on a mountain can receive signals that are blocked by\nthe terrain from reception in the valley below. The signals are then fed\nby cable to the television sets of subscribers to the system rather than\nbeing rebroadcast and picked up off the air as is the case with signals\npassed through boosters. While most CATV's still operate in this way,\na growing number of large systems use microwave relay to beam the\ndesired signals from a point near their origin to the CATV master an-\ntenna in the community served. In this way, CATV's are able to bring\nin the signals of television stations over very considerable distances.\n\n?* Incidentally, even this may leave rural viewers subsidized. Many boosters are indeed\nfinanced by local cooperatives or local television set retailers and repairmen rather than\nby broadcast stations.\n\n*]t is at least possible that such forecasts may be misleading if based on surveys of\nthe potential audience.

One might expect this given the existence of entry-inducing\nprofits in local television markets, particularly if such innovations per-\nmit relatively low-cost extension of existing services into markets\nwhich could not fully support an additional broadcast station. There\nare now two principal means of overcoming the line-of-sight limitation\non the reception of the signal of a given station. These are boosters\nand satellite stations, on the one hand, and community antenna televi-\nsion systems (CATV's), on the other.?\n\nA booster is a device to pick up a given television signal and instan-\ntaneously rebroadcast it with increased power. It is particularly useful in\nmountainous terrain where it enables a television station to reach com-\nmunities and areas which are separated from it by mountains.\n\nFor our purposes, a satellite station may be considered a large\nbooster. It is a television station which originates no (or almost no)\nprogramming but rebroadcasts the programs of its parent station. In\nso doing it gives the parent station coverage of a much wider area\nthan that station could reach by itself. Typically, advertising time on\nparent and satellite stations is sold as a single unit.\n\nThere are three features of the booster or satellite station arrange-\nment which are important for our purposes. First, such arrangements\ntypically involve only the signal of a single station; second, the re-\nbroadcast signal can be received (as can any ordinary television sig-\nnal) by any receiver within range. This leads to the third point. Boos-\nters and satellites are generally not financed directly by viewers as\nsuch in the communities to which they bring the given signal. AIl these\npoints distinguish boosters and satellite stations from CATV's and all\nof them help to explain why CATV's have had a far higher rate of\ngrowth and are believed to present a much more pressing regulatory\nproblem than boosters and satellite stations.\n\nThe influence of the first feature is evident.

This has led (at least in principle) to the possibility of a\nsystem of local control over programming and of diversity from mar-\nket to market, a possibility greatly fostered by the deliberate policy of\nthe Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The wish to pro-\nmote such diversity as a matter of public policy, the considerations of\nequity between neighboring communities, and the fact that communi-\nties are sufficiently close that the \"natural television reception area\" of\neach generally overlaps that of others, has led the FCC naturally to\nrestrict licensing of television stations in a given locality not merely to\nthe twelve VHF channels but to those channels not assigned to neigh-\nboring communities. The result has been that only the largest cities\nhave as many as seven VHF channels available (and one of these is\ngenerally reserved for educational television) while most communities\nhave three at most.\n\nIn this situation, it is not reasonable to rely on atomistic competition\nto produce optimal results even given the limitations of the arrange-\nments for recouping costs already discussed.

Even after\nUltra High Frequency (UHF) broadcasting opened the technical pos-\nsibility of an additional seventy channels (14-83), in most communi-\nties, the fact that most existing receivers were able to receive only\nVHF limited entry to the 12 channels of the VHF band. While this sit-\nuation is slowly changing due to the All-Channel Law (which went into\neffect in 1964) requiring all new sets to be capable of UHF reception,\nVHF broadcasting has been and still is the most profitable if not the\nonly economically viable means of television broadcasting in most\nmajor television markets.\n\nIn addition, television signals cannot be received off the air without\nspecial relaying apparatus, unless the receiver and the transmitting\ntower are in a direct line of sight. In particular, signals cannot be di-\nrectly received beyond the horizon or through mountainous terrain.\n\n! Tt should be noted that the argument of this paper does not turn on the question of\nwhether consumer tastes would be \"uplifted\" if programs were differently priced. Nor does\nit depend on knowing how to price programs in an industry in which the marginal cost of.\nan additional viewer is zero.

Furthermore, the implications of tech-\nnological destiny for overall industry performance may receive greater\nweight in the formulation of policy. But the initiatives of government\nand industry are likely to bring only piecemeal change to a policy\nframework that has not been comprehensively examined since the New\nDeal.

Rather, we\nare here concerned with demonstrating the opportunities of full utilization of our tech-\nnology and our fuel, capital and management resources, and how they can improve the\nlives of all Americans in the years ahead.\n\nWe are aware that many contrcversial areas of public policy are related in one way\nor another to the industry's success in lowering power costs. These policy areas include\nthe territorial integrity of the retail marketing areas of competing systems, the usefulness\nof public power programs as a yardstick to supplement regulation of privately owned\nsystems, the differential revenue requirements because of variations in the tax, financing\nand earnings requirements of individual systems, the obligations of the large systems\nin their relationships with the small in power supply arrangements and in competitive\nsituations, the proper role of statutory preferences to public and cooperative power dis-\ntributors for the sale of power from Federal systems, and many others. We believe that\nthe National Power Survey Report is not the appropriate medium for attempting to\nreconcile the conflicting views on these issues of public policy, if that were feasible, or\nto formulate or express our own views on these issues. The question of the proper scope\nof government in regulating or conducting economic affairs is one of the root problems\nin a democracy. We do not attempt to resolve it in this report.'\n\nJust as institutional problems are acknowledged but generally\nplayed down throughout the survey, there is also a sustained emphasis\non the fact that coordination at its best has shown great adaptability\nin coping with institutionally and legally messy situations. There is\ncontinuous stress on the idea that the major ownership segments are\nhere to stay and that their relative positions are not likely to change\nrapidly. Moreover, the virtues of pluralism and variety are alluded to\nwithout being specified.

To the extent that the FPC can tap the industry's resources with-\nout impairing integrity and perspective, it can formulate more solidly\nbased plans. Further, periodic exposure to a variety of expert critical\nreaction during the planning process weeds out mistakes and opens up\nnew lines of inquiry. Equally important is the opportunity for commu-\nnicating and refining the survey's persuasive messages. Public commu-\nnication, valuable as it is, lacks the flexibility, intensity, and frankness\nof informal give and take in an atmosphere of mutual respect. \u00c0 deci-\nsion-maker will take recommendations most seriously if he knows the\nCommission has made an honest effort both to understand his sugges-\ntions and reactions and to evaluate them on their merits.\n\nWherever possible, the FPC used planning criteria and technical as-\nsumptions endorsed by advisory committees. Consequently the sur-\nvey's technical assumptions approximate expert consensus where it ex-\nists, and the FPC has demonstrated its good faith in resolving ambi-\nguities on such disputable assumptions as service lives of new equip-\nment. Similarly, the FPC, before making up its own broad network\nplans, organized Regional Advisory Committees which submitted re-\ngion-wide plans of their own. Frequently, these were little more than\npatched-together versions of plans already developed, valuable to FPC\nprimarily as an information source and as a vehicle for asking ques-\ntions. But in at least one region\u2014the midcontinent area\u2014a single or-\nganic plan was submitted for a hitherto loosely coordinated area, and\nthe positive influence of the FPC request was acknowledged by the\nplanners involved.\n\nWhen the survey was announced in January, 1962, industry reaction\nwas variously hostile, suspicious, and fearful. The subtly changing\ntone of the trade press as the survey progressed testifies to Swidler's\nsuccess in creating greatly increased respect for the survey's integrity\nand usefulness. This change reflects such factors as judicious selection\nof advisory committee members, a generally open-minded and respect-\nful response to industry advice, and Swidler's remarkable sense of the\nappropriate in his personal industry contacts. Furthermore, industry\nparticipation in the survey was far more substantial and constructive\nthan the routine advisory committee performance that might have de-\nveloped. Surprisingly, some of the survey's most detailed and compli-\ncated planning exercises were suggested by industry advisory commit-\ntee members. The outstanding example is the Commission's extensive\ncomputer study of reserve capacity savings from increased intercon-\nnection.\n", "AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n", "336\n"], "6": ["PUBLIC REGULATION 335\n\nFPC planning exercises (e.g., its studies of load diversity) have led to\nindustry efforts to assemble detailed information previously not avail-\nable.\n\nThe industry's comparative advantage in operational planning is re-\ninforced by the necessity for continuous adjustments in plans, the need\nfor very specific cost and design information in choosing between alter-\nnatives, and the importance of information feedbacks from operating\nexperience and from such tentative attempts to implement decisions as\nbargaining with suppliers. The idea of looking as far ahead as twenty\nyears on a system or network basis is to gain an improved understand-\ning of the long-term consequences of specific near-term choices. The\n1980 patterns published by the FPC are only as good as the informa-\ntion available before the report went to press; moreover, since: they\ncover the entire country they must rely on short-cut planning proce-\ndures and a very approximate, thin information base. Hence the fre-\nquent caveats in the report.\n\nInevitably, heuristic planning can be expected to have some perverse\neffects. Overliteral or premature adoption of recommendations is a real\ndanger. If, for instance, the climate of persuasion creates fears of im-\nminent increases in federal control or expansion of federally-owned\nnetworks, investor-owned utilities may try to forestall these develop-\nments with massive, highly visible commitments of their own. The pol-\nitics of electric power are such that any FPC recommendation has side\neffects on intra-industry disputes and industry expectation of FPC pol-\nicy changes. Furthermore, the FPC would lose much of its persuasive\nmuscle and hamper its independence of action in recommending future\nlegislative changes if it tried to give unequivocal assurances that it\nwould oppose extension of federal controls and federal ownership.\nEqually serious is the possibility that Power Survey recommendations\nmight be used as spurious support for actions which conflict with their\nintent, as in the case of giving a \"coordination\" image to excessive\ntransmission capacity intended to help build up the owner's rate base\nin a period of rising rates of return. Another problem is that recom-\nmendations which make their best sense when considered as part of an\ninterrelated package may be bought piecemeal. Interconnections and\nlarge units may be added without adequate provision for dealing with\nsuch side effects on the larger network as the need for better protective\nequipment, faster communications, emergency procedures, and delin-\neation of operating responsibilities. All of these problems set severe\nlimits to how far persuasion can reasonably be pushed. They empha-\nsize the essentially incremental, trend-modifying nature of the Power\nSurvey and suggest the importance of injecting its end-goals as impor-\ntant considerations in every area of regulatory contact between the\nCommission and the industry.\n"], "5": ["334 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nradical departures from existing \"best practice\" if they continue in the\ngenerating business. My own opinion is that most of these systems will\nhave to become distributors if they are to survive as part of an efficient\npower supply arrangement. Because of their minute share in industry\ngenerating capacity, these small systems are relatively unimportant\nfrom the standpoint of industry-wide resource allocation. But the\nsharp cleavages of interest between the \"public\" and private camps\nmake the small system problem very important to policy-makers.\n\nIn this context of intensified technological and economic pressures\nfor network integration, the National Power Survey was begun to en-\ncourage increased coordination within the confines of a relatively sta-\nble industry structure. In pursuit of this goal the Commission em-\nployed a distinctive strategy, the defining characteristics of which are\nheuristic planning, industry involvement, and a deliberate exclusion of\nbasic institutional questions from explicit consideration.\n\nHeuristic Planning\n\nFirst, the FPC's planning and recommendations had to be heuristic\nrather than operational. This is not only, or even primarily, because of\nthe absence of legal authority to compel adoption of its recommenda-\ntions. Far more important are (1) the fact that the FPC's comparative\nadvantage lies not in its technical planning capabilities but in its per-\nspective and (2) the fact that operational planning is a continuous\nprocess within which any given comprehensive \"plan\" has a very short\nlife and frequently looks very different on a map or a drawing board\nfrom the specific investment alternatives which are finally chosen.\n\nWith respect to comparative advantage it is clear that the FPC can-\nnot come close to matching the professional skills, specific experience,\nand other resources of the industry's hundreds of full-time system\nplanners. But although raising the quality of regulatory planning cer-\ntainly increases its worth, it appears that planning of modest complexi-\nty and quality can still have great heuristic value\u2014an important point\nin view of the severe staff limitations under which FPC and other\nagencies must operate. By raising pertinent questions and by suggest-\ning alternatives neglected by the industry, the regulators can stretch\nthe horizons of industry planners. Some Power Survey *planning\" does\nno more than state systematically what any knowledgeable observer of\nthe industry knows to be an improvement over the imperfectly coordi-\nnated choices presently made\u2014as in the case of increasing the scale of\ngenerating units where constraints on unit size to date have been clear-\nly institutional.

Consequently, growth in unit size per se did not apply increased\npressure on individual systems to coordinate with their neighbors.\n\"Today, a 1,000 MW unit has already been installed, larger units are on\norder, and orders for new units in the 500-1,000 range are no longer\nunusual. This represents a rate of growth in unit scale since 1950 of\ntwo to three times that of system peaks. Today only the four or five\nlargest of the industry's 3,600 systems can, even with strong intercon-\nnections, justify installing most economical large units now available if\nnew capacity were to be used only to meet their own loads. Other par-\nallel developments in transmission voltages and in possibilities for\nlong-distance transmission can also be cited. Add to this such develop-\nments as the increasing economic attractiveness of nuclear and\npumped storage plants, both of which are most advantageous when\nemployed on a very large scale, and it is easy to see that optimizing\ndecisions in the electric power industry, as presently structured, will be\nincreasingly multi-system to the extent that they are efficiently made.\n\nMoreover, the industry's ownership pattern has been comparatively\nstable since the early 1950's, both within the investor-owned segment\nas a result of the post-Holding Company Act slowdown in consolida-\ntions and between the segments as a result of the comparative maturi-\nty of the public and cooperative segments which has accompanied such\ndevelopments as the saturation of rural electric service, the post-Dixon\nYates stabilization of TVA service territory and financing, and the\ngrowing scarcity of attractive new hydro sites for federal development.\nDramatic changes in this pattern are unlikely.\n\n\"This stability of the ownership pattern implies a shift away from the\nconsolidation route to efficient network integration and toward greater\nreliance on intersystem coordination. While such primitive forms of co-\nordination as interconnections for emergency assistance are at least\nsixty years old, and most of the basic practices we associate with the\nterm \"power pooling\" had lost their novelty before 1930, the scale and\ncomplexity of their application have undergone such greatly accelerat-\ned development since World War II that the difference in degree is al-\nmost one of kind.

If we use the physical definition of a net-\nwork as a set of facilities normally operated on a continuously inter-\nconnected basis, then we are already close to being a virtual two-net-\nwork country. Nearly all of the U.S. east of the Rockies (over 70 per-\ncent of U.S. generating capacity) has been operating in parallel since\n1962, and completion of lines already committed west of the Rockies\nwill tie together nearly all of the capacity in that area. The Texas In-\nterconnection, with only about 6 percent of the nation's generating ca-\npacity, is the lone significant holdout, for the purely institutional rea-\nson of avoiding federal regulation. Spanning the Rockies is largely a\nquestion of when and how. The near-term economics of large-scale ties\nare unfavorable, but growth in the absolute scale of potential time-zone\ndiversity transfers, possible reductions in reserve capacity west of the\nRockies, and falling costs of long-distance transmission are likely to\ntip the balance eventually, perhaps in the early 1980's. This event is\nphysically impressive and raises important questions of ownership, con-\ntrol, and cost-benefit sharing with respect to the long-distance lines that\nwould have to be built. Perhaps for these reasons, the future geographi-\ncal extension of networks tends to attract attention out of proportion to\nthe very small percentage by which it should eventually reduce the\ntotal cost of power.\n\nLess visible but economically much more significant are the implica-\ntions of technological destiny for the \"internal\" development of the\nnetwork: the increasingly complex, multi-system nature of efficient\nchoice of location, scale, and design of new generating facilities, lines,\ncontrol equipment and other network components and of their efficient\noperation. Underlying technological and economic trends have been\nsomewhat uneven in their historical pace, and we are currently in the\nmidst of an acceleration in these trends which began to appear in new\ncapacity installations during the 1950's. The simplest illustration I can\ngive is the current explosive increase in the capacity of the largest\nsteam-electric generating units available.

The first is self-education.\nThe resources at stake are so vast\u2014perhaps $100 billion in new capital\noutlays alone over the survey's twenty-year planning period, not to\nmention operating costs and externalities\u2014and our dependence on a\nreliable energy supply so great that the FPC would be remiss in the\nexercise of its responsibilities if it did not seek a much more systematic\nunderstanding of future patterns of network development than the\nusual \"keeping up with the current industry activities\" approach\naffords. This in itself argues for FPC involvement in planning no mat-\nter how good a job the industry might appear to be doing and even if\nno other public action were needed. The blackout of November 9 is a\ncase in point. The FPC's ability to move expertly and constructively in\nleading the post-blackout investigation has been greatly enhanced by\nthe learning experience and working relationships with industry ex-\nperts gained by both Commissioners and staff as a result of their im-\nmersion in the survey. Second, there is good reason to believe that a\nknowledgeable FPC will also have a geographically broader, temporal-\nly longer, and more public-interested perspective than the typical in-\ndustry planner. Given the great size of the industry, its institutional\nvariety, its fragmented and somewhat haphazard ownership pattern,\nthe complex, sometimes inconsistent legal framework within which it\nmust function and the lack of strong pressures for major institutional\nchange, it should be no surprise that the initiatives of utility system\nmanagers\u2014public, investor-owned, or cooperative\u2014have often failed\nto produce the highly coordinated planning and operating decisions\nneeded to approach the ideal of efficient resource use very closely.\n", "331\n"], "1": ["The image of regulatory institutions as tardy, reluctant, and imper-\nfect adjusters to changing technology finds considerable historical\njustification.

Nor are they necessarily more\nefficient for this purpose than alternative investments in teachers! sala-\nries and school buildings.

But it could also pro-\n"], "9": ["PUBLIC REGULATION 347\n\nthem to \"clean up\" their old equipment in a more socially efficient\nmanner. For in the absence of alternative users, lax, sloppy spectrum\nusage is economic: the incumbent merely economizes on his high-cost\ninputs by substituting low-cost frequency space. Rising opportunity\ncosts of spectrum occupancy, on the other hand, when translated into\nrental charges equal to the costs imposed on newcomers, will raise the\nneed for reallocation or for technical improvements which did not exist\nbefore. For it is economically rational to invest in new equipment so\nlong as the last dollar invested reduces one's bill (for imposing extra\ncosts on newcomers) by an amount greater than this investment.\n\nAs envisioned here, then, incumbents would find it worth while to\nextend the intensive or even the extensive margin of frequency space\nwhenever the extra costs imposed on newcomers through exclusion be-\ncame sufficiently large, whereas newcomers would choose to develop\nnew systems only where these cost less than sharing, borrowing, or\npreempting occupied frequencies; viz., where the extra costs imposed\non them through exclusion just exceeded the extra costs which incum-\nbents would otherwise incur to accommodate them.\n\nTowards a Proper Role for Frequency Stockpiling. So much then for\nthe accommodation of new users. A second, corollary problem is to\ndetermine the proper role for frequency stockpiling. For just as the\nborrowing of idle space may be a cost-saving option for newcomers\nfaced with harsher alternatives, so the national policy of interim nonuse\nwill inadvertently act to distort the spectrum users! incentives to inno-\nvative effort. At least radio grantees favored with lush frequency as-\nsignments will, on that account, probably feel less compelled to de-\nvelop their frequency space or its substitutes than will radio grantees\nwho are relatively more deprived. Indeed the varying frequency shares\nallocated to different user groups would seem to provide differential\nincentives for frequency development comparable to those provided by\nrelative resource scarcity and differential prices in other natural\nresource fields. Moreover, insofar as the spectrum managers' prefer-\nences and not the consumers! will presumably govern the distribution\nof these frequency-developing incentives, any distortion due to stock-\npiling must be justified explicitly as essential for policy objectives that\ncould not otherwise be attained or attained as efficiently.\n\nThere are in any case at least two major ways in which large tracts\nof frequency space have come to lie idle\u2014notwithstanding the clamor\nof excluded claimants who would gladly snap them up.\n\nFirst, old users may be allowed to introduce new techniques without\nrelinquishing space where their older techniques could in fact be acti-\nvated in an emergency.

In addition, the deep-rooted political\nresistance to any such scheme at home, the radical institutional\nchanges needed to institute it domestically, and surely internationally,\nall point up the need to consider still other alternatives. One possibility\nthat may merit more careful scrutiny than it has so far received would\nbe to impose rental charges on spectrum occupancy.\n\nA Modest Proposal. At present, newcomers are free to choose be-\ntween developing a new system, using a wide array of substitutes for\nradio, and risking the hazards of administrative proceedings to win\nrights to share, borrow, or preempt the incumbents' frequency space.\nIncumbents, on the other hand, now oppose accommodating a newcom-\ner wherever the cost of this opposition falls short of the costs they\nwould otherwise incur. This is true both for government and nongov-\nernment incumbents.\n\nBut let us now introduce some such two-part rule as this: Newcom-\ners must reimburse incumbents for any costs incurred in vacating,\nsharing, or lending space to accommodate them. However, should in-\ncumbents prefer not to accommodate, then they in turn must reim-\nburse the newcomers for any extra costs imposed on them through ex-\nclusion. Had the FCC or the DTM been empowered to authorize such\nreimbursements over the years, one wonders how many more incum-\nbents might have agreed to make adjustments which they in fact op-\nposed as unwieldy or uneconomic. Even within the government family\nof users itself (the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee), tech-\nnical *facts\" on the feasibility of sharing, vacating, or lending fre-\nquency space are probably as much the subject of bargaining and ne-\ngotiation as are the more elusive economic or social facts. In other\nwords, the economic incentives of all parties are intimately related to\nthe determination of technical as well as to the nontechnical facts\nneeded for effective spectrum management.\n\nSome such rule as that proposed here then would have forced the in-\ncumbents to choose between accepting full-cost reimbursement to ac-\ncommodate a newcomer and refusing to accommodate him but then\npaying \"rent\" instead\u2014equal to the extra costs imposed by forcing the\nnewcomer to his next-best alternative\u2014whereas newcomers could now\nchoose between the direct purchase of sharing, lending, or preemption\nrights and the development of a new system or the use of some substi-\ntute. While surely not ideal, such an arrangement could help articulate\nopportunity cost for managers and users alike, both in the government\nand nongovernment spectrum.\n\nFinally, the imposition of such charges on incumbents might induce\n", "346\n"], "7": ["REGULATION\n\n$598 8\nSo*8 E\ne.g E] I\"\novtgu G4\n\u00a3g\u00bb $\n4$28 8\nSess \u00e0\nuuo B\nE 8\nS838 8\ns?8 (8\n9993\nBg B\ni38 8\nZSEZ; \u00a38\nS.P\n2s352 2\nFEE E\nvo\nBASS\nDOR.\n\n2\nEnaoo\n\n'RESSDSoBRC\nBLSRIRDOBS\n[oct Ec EE CT\n\n\u00bbL3 ms\u00f3654 ^92\nS\u00f3ga R$S54 39\n3388 $4353 L3\nS$&.2gS 5: 3.83 Z&\nES \u20acSognn3 S8\nRE 2852 S83\ng4\n23$5E ^SESS X.\nEEES wia93\nBER BET-O\nESTS  Sdgoda\n$sE8g \u00ab9995 R^.\nBINEEE SEB\u00d3S Eg\nS7 d\n29385 Segaa 28\n\nE ERA E E\n25525 Uos.3 BB\n\"SS nUSBT DB\ns2359*5 mHaBsp S\nSaRgSB T2939 gu\n$9999 V.$Lwu 9258\nSEE Fo A3.\n$9529 ST255 Ds\nRN GOS UsRLA MES\nB\nE] E 9: 5 E 2\n8 & 5s 3 E P\u00bb &B\nE 2 nid E z E! 3\nE: P. m\n\u00bb pu 9D I^ z\nz82 TE 239 8 R- *& *&E\n2&8 iB 33: $ ES EE\n4 m- zS z D: lai m-\n\u00c9\ng \" n E EF, $8 3\ne e z\nFr 5 3 $5 \u00a35 3\niei s 5S 5 83\nS237 do kH $* ER Su El\n\u00c9SES8 M8 \u2014d$ z8 m\u00e0 z 3\nBi. f  :. di T\n- EUN EE 28\n$ z38 3$ Seg $8 $8\nL4 s^5 EI \u00a328 SEG \u00abc 5\nEJ 2\u00bb29\u2014 \u2014 -4\u2014 4Rs \u00ab35 $ 9\n248. 48 l5 479 & m$\n85 9 Sg FE S iod \"Bo\n$os 88 $98. v BS\nE 2z9 $8 $929 $8.5 Z EM\n3 2: 22 3599 288 $8\n* Dam  ZS zu4-2 Z5 z Za\n"], "6": ["AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\n3EB325838 225828  B59gLSIOES E iy284i\n\u00abm 50 .\u2014 \u00abgH mRERNPS ROS mos FEE3 &Sna.a8\nwESSS 5 Lh Bub MA ES EMO\nS5989998 \u00ab23589 oDftE.a.oc2 Sd SB.5 5\n88554222 $8\u00bb $0 DEISERSLS Da] E EFFI\nB39EITARBR  S.2Uo58 09958225 PS \u2014 $USDETS\nSam?

But\nthe accommodation of radio users who introduce the bolder new tech-\nnologies still raises serious problems of its own, and it is to two such\nproblems that I shall now turn. First, the problem of newcomers, in-\ncumbents, and innovative change; and, second, the problems posed by\nfrequency stockpiling.\n\nNewcomers, Incumbents, and Innovative Change. Yn Table 1 below\nare several illustrative episodes where new spectrum users (or old\nusers with new frequency demands) sought accommodation from incum-\nbents either through sharing, borrowing, or outright preemption; and\nwhere these preferred options were presumably more attractive to the\nnewcomers than such alternatives as developing new systems, turning\nto a wireline substitute or to transportation, etc. Now in each case ex-\namined investment in new improved hardware was an issue either be-\ncause the newcomer himself sought to introduce a new technique (or\neven some major new invention) or because the incumbent's accommo-\ndating behavior would require such investment. Presumably, newcom-\ners would secure costless accommodation only where they sought to\nborrow idle frequency space. Although here, too, there could conceiv-\nably be dislodgement costs later when the original incumbents sought to\nreenter, and we have already noted the need for special equipment to\nvacate on short notice.\n\nCareful study of such episodes as these suggests at least five prelimi-\nnary and tentative conclusions: (1) Newcomers would presumably\nprefer to buy rights to share, borrow, or preempt frequency space di-\nrectly, so long as these cost less than it would to develop a new system,\nor to use some substitute for radio. (2) There is, however, no way at\npresent for them to do so. (3) Incumbents normally have little eco-\nnomic incentive to accommodate newcomers now unless regulators\ncompel or otherwise cajole them to do so. (4) De facto squatters rights\noften strengthen the incumbents' hands immeasurably in exacting a\nmonopoly rent before accommodating any newcomer. (5) The ques-\ntion is therefore how to articulate the opportunity costs of spectrum\noccupancy lest incumbent's equities in his frequency space and his po-\nlitical leverage, plus the regulator's inertia, combine to make de facto\nsquatters rights determinative whatever the economic or social merits\nof a new technique.\n\nIn short, can radio spectrum managers devise techniques to help\nthem do what market incentives would otherwise do? Of course, one\napproach would be simply to auction off renewable rights\u2014leaving\nthem freely transferable and subject to periodic reauctioning. This is\none way to create at least limited property rights in the U.S. portion of\nthe spectrum. But whatever the intriguing theoretical case for trying\n"], "4": ["342 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nof administrative regulation based upon the asserted scarcity of ra-\ndiofrequency space. Indeed the greatest onslaught on this age-old prem-\nise may well be mounted with the eventual introduction of the circular\nwaveguide tube (cousin of the overland cable), and the communica-\ntions laser (key to communication through guided lightwaves, no less).\nThe capabilities of both these techniques incidentally are so fantastic\nas virtually to dwarf all communications capacity used globally today.\n\nHow ought the frequency manager respond to these facts of new\ntechnology?\n\nIL The Task of Radio Spectrum Management\n\nThe traditional task of spectrum management has long been to dis-\ntribute use rights to competing claimants. For this the manager has\nsometimes employed an impressive array of social priorities, although\nmore often than not he has simply acquiesced to the brute standard of\nfirst come, first served. And yet, however the occupancy rights are dis-\ntributed\u2014whether by priority-of-application, by high-flown social\npriority, by auction, or by lot\u2014technological advances that extend the\nrange of usable frequency space should obviously ease the accommoda-\ntion of competing claimants. Indeed, frequency managers\u2014especially\nat the ODTM\u2014\u2014have become increasingly aware of this fact. So much so\nthat a new-fangled \"frequency development\" goal may one day share\nequally on the regulatory agenda with the old-fashioned \"frequency\nallocation\" goal.\n\nTo see why this is so one has only to recall two hard facts of tele-\ncommunications life today:\n\n1. New spectrum users, or the new frequency demands of old users,\ncan ordinarily be accommodated only through dislodging or preempt-\ning space already occupied by others; or by sharing occupied space; or\nby borrowing unused space; or by using their own space more inten\nsively; or by developing new capabilities for utilizing unused space\nhigher in the spectrum.\n\n2. Each of these five accommodating processes involves new hard-\nware or technical improvements of varying magnitudes. The incum-\nbent will normally not cooperate and move unless he has somewhere to\ngo, and this may require new R and D and capabilities to use higher\nfrequencies. Frequency sharing and more intensive use of present as-\nsignments both by incumbents and newcomers alike may also require\nimproved equipment, or new techniques. Even the borrowing of unused\nspace may require the development of new devices to vacate on short\nnotice.\n\nBy making the spectrum pie bigger in some sense, then, the ac-\ncumulation of even minor technical improvements can potentially ease\n"], "3": ["PUBLIC REGULATION 341\n\nnology. Rather may we use also the more abundant microwave fre-\nquencies, higher in the spectrum, for international communications of\na striking variety, volume, and reliability. Frequencies hitherto unus-\nable, for certain purposes at least, have now become technically and\neconomically usable for these purposes.\n\nIntensive spectrum development, on the other hand, refers simply to\nthe ability to transmit the same volume and quality of information in\nless frequency space than before or at a higher rate in the same band\nwidth. One illustrative advance here is the breakthrough in improved\ndirectionality of communication through new directional antennas and\nline-of-sight beaming. Another illustration is the dramatic new spectrum-\nsaving techniques which have virtually doubled potentially usable space\nin the high frequency band (through the move to single sideband modu-\nlation); and multiplied the space for mobile radio users manyfold since\n1940\u2014some 2,500 percent, I believe\u2014through a sustained reduction in\nchannel spacing.\n\nIntensive like extensive development may result from government or\nfrom private R. and D and innovation. Extensions of the intensive\nmargin have in fact tended to reflect private initiatives, whereas the\nmore crucial advances at the extensive margin are government precipi-\ntated. The private advances also result from deliberate spectrum-de-\nveloping research programs of such companies as Motorola, A.T.&T.,\nG.T.&E., RCA Communication and the Hughes Aircraft Corporation.\nWhereas some of the more spectacular government contributions have\nbeen inadvertent\u2014unexpected by-products of \"crash\" programs\ngeared to quite different ends\u2014to weaponry, rocketry, and radar de-\nvelopment.\n\nAmong the best-known substitutes for radiocommunication are open\nwire, landlines, coaxial cable, and submarine cable. However, trans-\nportation is also a substitute and so, conceptually, are the other factor\ninputs which the use of radio displaces in transport, public utility, and\nmanufacturing enterprises (viz., labor, storage facilities, vehicles,\netc.). Even in the broadcast field, some say that a nationwide grid of\nwired CATV systems, interconnected by microwave frequencies and\nfinanced by subscriber fees, may one day offer a viable economic alter-\nnative to the advertiser-supported broadcast service.

Moreover, the spectrum user, like the user of highways, airways,\nor national airspace, must be constrained in his use to assure safe, reli-\nable, effective occupancy.

Summary and Conclusions\n\nThis paper has developed and applied to several bodies of evidence\na theory of the distribution of earnings. The principal attraction of the\ntheory is that, unlike most other approaches to income distribution, it\ndoes not consist mainly of mechanical curve fitting or ad /oc probability\nmechanisms, but rather relies fundamentally on maximizing behavior,\nthe basic assumption of general economic theory. Each person is\nassumed in effect to maximize his economic welfare by investing an\nappropriate amount in human capital, and the distribution of earnings\nis determined by the distribution of investments and their rates of re-\nturn. These determinants are in turn related to various \"institutional\"\nfactors which also play an important part in our theory: inheritance of\nproperty income, equality of opportunity, distribution of abilities, sub-\nsidies to education, and other human capital, etc.\n\nLimitations of the data available have reduced the scope of the\nempirical analysis to investment in formal education as measured by\nyears of schooling. Evidence from states and regions within the United\nStates and from several countries indicates that schooling usually ex-\nplains a not negligible part of the inequality in earnings within a geo-\ngraphical area and a much larger part of differences in inequality be-\ntween areas. These and other findings are generally quite consistent\nwith the implications of the theory.\n", "are all negatively related to the average level of schooling and income.\nWhereas only about 18 percent of the inequality in income within a\nstate is explained, on the average, by schooling, the remaining 82 per-\ncent explained by the residual, about one-third of the differences in\ninequality between states is directly explained by schooling, one-third\ndirectly by the residual and the remaining one-third by both together\nthrough the positive correlation between them.\n\nSimilar calculations have also been made for several countries having\nreadily available data: United States, Canada, Mexico, Israel and\nPuerto Rico (treated as a country). Again there is a strong tendency for\nareas with greater income inequality to have higher rates of return,\ngreater schooling inequality, higher coefficients of determination, and\ngreater residual inequality. While there is also a tendency for poorer\ncountries to have lower average years of schooling, greater inequality\nin income, etc., there are a couple of notable exceptions. For example,\nIsrael, for reasons rather clearly related to the immigration of educated\nEuropeans during the 1920's and 1930's, had unusually high schooling\nlevels and low inequality in earnings until the immigration of unedu-\ncated Africans and Asians after 1948 began to lower average education\nlevels and raise the inequality in earnings.\n", "AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n", "368\n"], "10": ["differences in schooling and rates exceed the difference in earnings, for\nas column 9 shows, the coefficient of determination, or the fraction of\nthe variance in the log of earnings \"explained\" by schooling, is con-\nsiderably higher in the South. The regional difference in earnings does\nnot entirely result from schooling, however, for column 10 shows that\nthe \"residual\" inequality in earnings is also larger in the South.\n\n\"These results can be given an interesting interpretation within the\nframework of the theory presented in section II. The greater inequality\nin the distribution of schooling in the South is presumably a consequence\nof the less equal opportunity even for whites there and would only be\nstrengthened by considering the differences in schooling between\nwhites and nonwhites. The higher adjusted rates of return in the South\"?\nare probably related to the lower education levels there, shown in\ncolumn 4, which in turn might be the result of fewer educational oppor-\ntunities.\n\n\"The residual v' is heavily influenced by the distributions of luck and\nability, which usually do not vary much between large regions. There-\nfore, greater rates of return and inequality in the distribution of school-\ning would go hand in hand not only with a greater absolute but also\nwith a greater relative contribution of schooling to the inequality in\nearnings. The residual is also influenced, however, by investment in\nother human capital. Since the rates of return to and distribution of\nthese investments would be influenced by the same forces influencing\nschooling, the absolute, but not relative, contribution of the residual to\nthe inequality in earnings would tend to be greater when the absolute\ncontribution of schooling was greater. Consequently, our theory can\nexplain why both the coefficient of determination and the residual vari-\nance in earnings are greater in the South.\n\nIn order to determine whether these relations hold not only for the\nmost extreme regional difference in the United States but also for more\nmoderate differences, similar regressions were calculated for all fifty\nstates. To avoid going into details at this time let us simply report that\nthe results strongly confirm those found at the extremes: there is a very\nsizable positive correlation across states between inequality in adult\nmale incomes, adjusted rates of return, inequality in schooling, coeffi-\ncients of determination, and residual inequality in incomes, while they\n\n1? Higher rates of return to whites in the South have been found when estimated by the\n\"present value\" method from data giving earnings classified by age, education, and other\nvariables (see Hanoch, of. cit., Chap. IV). Although estimates based on the present value\nmethod are also biased upward by a positive correlation between ability and schooling and\ndownward by errors in measuring school years, they are less sensitive to the omission of other\nhuman capital (see Becker, op. cit., pp. 88-90). Consequently, the fact that Hanoch's es-\ntimates are almost uniformly higher than ours (after adjustment for the &;) suggests, if any-\nthing, a negative correlation between school years and the years invested in other human\ncapital. This could also explain why Hanoch's rates tend to decline with increases in years of\nSchooling while ours tend to rise.\n", "THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION\n", "367\n"], "9": ["AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\no -\nE g\nSB de 3 P\u00bb\nBe E] \"d\nSSsBwse S * 3 R\nS789 5- : . \u00a3t\nmE And s: $\n8\n\"S\nNES \"d 9 L3\n3:85. | E\nwo2zScelS3s2|!z5 rz $$\ne - - CQ o\n$8A:* i inisd : 1 3 \u00d3\nX\u00d3u B 3 8\n[3 2 DE -\ns -\n$8\nE 5$ 2\n* &3- co 9.5 S BE 8\nB Hz oo e [2] eo IA] i\n8 BIA : 27 82|s58 8\n2 kl 8e rm\n3 EL 9aBH -\nP\u00e1 vi e9sg zs\n- [1 S2\n[:] g8 g BEVS u\u00e0\nu I [8-1\nr su o o \u20acG \u00a3& vo29 3\n38| $882 |8 8 8 S | 78 3\nL4 S3 8 \u2014 -|5 RB\n9 [5] 8 EE *\nE z 55$ c\n3 Bg X RE E]\nE\nS A og -\nx ES 285 &G 838 '\n88e $852,505 &\nnb: - - 1 8gB \"\nBm \"a8 n5\naa ind\nVEU 2\nd \u00a3o 2 $E\u00c05 $\nS25 258 5|835 83\ngo PIE ^oc|s\u00ed9 kl\nTO OB S\nHSB S\n398 9\n5. 2\na a F3\nEu] o0 o B8B &\nSam - I1 AB e\nE E s |Z$8 5\ng&\nAS 29- 3\nnl Quum\nge23 s\n\"E Sag ^\nSS n 53 -\nBB5LHG $ $3 |v3z\n58Ewasc ; : $39 5$\nLBSQL - - So -\n\u00abzs DEEP\nILT38E\n$3934\no & 2538335\no B \"3 \"O3\nSaxa S] S3 S353\nSACS 1 : \"S4 85\n&osg9c E E p\nad 2 - - [\"bcR^!\n2 8 29$92w\nE QESRS\nSSB8g\n\"TH I\n9g\n9 x38 esos5\nEPIS ex ue \u00fcuB8vO\n*?

Although information on investment\nin human capital has grown significantly during the last few years, it is\nstill limited to aggregate relations for a small number of countries.

If for conven-\nience z;; in equation (1) is replaced by 7;--7*;; where 7; is the average\nrate of return on the jth investment and 7*;; is the (positive or negative)\npermium to the ith person resulting from his (superior or inferior) per-\nsonal characteristics, then it can be shown that equation (1) could be\nrewritten as\n\nQ) E; 2 X1 4- ba(^ 7] [E Res F9] 5 e Esos 78]\n\nwhere zn; is the total investment period of the ith person.??

Free public schools are not a perfect example, since foregone earnings, often an important\ncost of schooling, are not subsidized. The GI Bill, on the other hand, does cover at least some\nforegone earnings by providing living allowances as well as tuition. Legislation making school-\ning compulsory is still another and quite different example, for some persons may be forced\nto continue in school longer than they would like (or even than is good for them). Incidentally,\nbecause of space limitations our discussion in this paper must abstract from forces, such as\ncompulsory school legislation or the rationing of school places, that make the actual amount\ninvested differ from the desired amount.\n", "In the usual case where supply and demand curves both vary, the\ndifferent equilibrium positions could still be found at the intersections of\nthe relevant curves, but knowledge of these positions would no longer be\nsufficient to \"identify\" either set of curves. In addition to the factors\nalready discussed, the distribution of earnings would now also depend\non the correlation between supply and demand conditions. These condi-\ntions might well be positively correlated, say because of a positive cor-\nrelation between ability or the psychic earnings received from human\ncapital with either parental wealth or scholarships; in the figure the de-\nmand curve D; could be associated with the supply curve S;, D, with S;,\nand D with S. The resulting equilibrium positions $:;, ?, and ,; indicate\nsizable dispersions in rates of return and amounts invested, and a strong\npositive relation between them. If S; was associated with D; and S; with\nD;, supply and demand conditions would now be negatively correlated,\nand the resulting equilibrium positions would be $;; 5, and $,;. The\ninequality and skewness in earnings would be reduced because the\nnegative correlation between these conditions would reduce the invest-\nment and earnings of persons with favorable demand conditions, say\nD;, and increase that of persons with unfavorable conditions, say D;.\n\nBefore passing on to a quantitative implementation of this model, we\nmight dwell a little on one interesting implication. The often discussed\nbut seldom defined concept of \"equality of opportunity\" can be rigor-\nously defined in our framework as a situation in which low parental\nwealth and other supply disadvantages were sufficiently offset so that\nthe effective supply curve of funds was the same to everyone.!! One way\nto achieve this would be to make investment in human capital a free\ngood through subsidies from public or private agencies; all supply\ncurves, in effect, would then lie along the horizontal axis.? Our definition\nof equality of opportunity would imply not equal investment but equal\nopportunity to invest, the actual amount depending on ability and other\npersonal characteristics (see the points f, f, and fiin the figure). The\nelimination of unequal supply conditions would reduce the inequality in\ninvestments unless supply and demand conditions had been sufficiently\nnegatively related. On the other hand, it would increase the positive\ncorrelation between the amount invested and its rate of return unless\nsupply and demand conditions had been sufficiently positively related.\n", "AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n", "362\n"], "4": ["increase over different investment intervals. Although, therefore, the\ncurve D might not always decline,\" our analysis requires only a decline\nrelative to S, especially around the point of intersection 5, and that\nseems plausible enough.\n\nLet us turn to the distribution of these curves and thus to the distribu-\ntion of earnings. Since the income and wealth of parents, the willingness\nto forego consumption, and the availability of scholarships and loans\nvary from person to person, the supply of funds would also vary, as\nillustrated by the curves S;, S and S; in the figure.

For example, if the\nmarginal rate of return was constant so that D was horizontal, earnings\nwould have the same inequality and skewness as the amount invested.\nIf, however, marginal rates decreased, the inequality and positive\nSskewness in earnings would be less than that in investments because\nlarge investors would receive lower rates of return; conversely if mar-\nginal rates increased.?\n\nMore usually the demand for funds would also vary, probably sig-\nnificantly, because of differences in ability,\" attitudes toward risk, and\nother personal characteristics. The figure shows three demand curves\nD;, D, and Di, with D;, reflecting the most \"ability,\" and D, the least.\nIf the supply curve S was the same for everyone, the equilibrium posi-\ntions would lie along S at the points of intersection, given in the figure\nby \u00a31, 5, and $,, and knowledge of the various positions would permit an\n*dentification\" of S.

Introduction\n\n\"The history of interest among economists in the distribution of income\nis as long as the history of modern economics itself. Smith, Mill, Mar-\nshall, and others recognized that many areas of considerable economic\nimportance were affected by it. Although poverty, for example, was\npartly defined in absolute terms, they recognized that each generation's\n\"poor\" are mainly those significantly below the average income level. In\naddition to poverty, the degree of opportunity, aggregate savings and\ninvestment, the distribution of family size, and the concentration of\nprivate economic power were thought to be affected.\n\nHow does one explain then that in spite of the rapid accumulation of\nempirical information and the persisting and even increasing interest in\nsome of these question, such as poverty, economists have somewhat\nneglected personal income distribution during the last generation?! In\nour judgment the fundamental reason is the absence, notwithstanding\nsome ingenious and valiant efforts, of a theory of income distribution\nthat both articulates well with general economic theory and is useful in\nexplaining differences among regions, countries and time periods. Some\nearlier work? by one of us led to the belief that an analysis of investment\nin human capital provides a theory of income distribution that satisfies\nboth desiderata.\n\n\"This is a report on a National Bureau of Economic Research study in\nprogress? that is developing such a theory and applying it to a variety of\nevidence. Not only is the report preliminary, but brevity of space re-\nquires that many details and proofs be skipped and the discussion con-\ncentrated on a few highlights. We expect to publish the full study before\ntoo long, which would permit our methods and conclusions to be ex-\namined more closely.\n\n!

Increased Schooling as an Antipoverty Policy\n\nIn the past, the proportion of families in poverty has declined when\nthe incentive to invest in education has been the weakest; i.e., when\nthe opportunity cost of education was high and rising while skill\ndifferentials and therefore returns to education were declining. In gen-\neral, if the prior section is correct, full employment encourages the\nsubstitution of on-the-job training and work for formal education. Can\na federal program of financial incentives invert the relationship be-\ntween poverty reduction and years of schooling that is generated by\nindividual profit maximizing behavior? The possibility certainly exists,\nfor the probability of being impoverished is above the national rate at\neach education level below high school graduation. As years of school-\ning rise, the proportion of urban male white workers in the prime work-\ning years earning less than $3,000 falls toward 20 percent, finally\nreaching it at high school graduation [17]. While the possibility exists,\nit has a low probability.\n\nSince the Korean war, unemployment levels have been high, espe-\ncially for young people, so that the opportunity cost of education for a\nvery large proportion of high school drop-outs has been close to zero.*\nYet the unemployment rate has not been so high that large numbers of\nskilled workers are being forced into disguised unemployment. The\neconomic incentive to stay in school is very great, therefore; yet the\ndrop-out rate is high. And if anything, the proportion of impoverished\nyoung people has risen and the penalty for failing to complete high\nschool has been increasing even for those who find employment [4].\n\nThe two most basic reasons for a federal policy to add financial in-\ncentives to education are made largely irrelevant by these considera-\ntions. One justification for an education policy could be that the mar-\nginal social benefit of schooling exceeds the marginal private benefit.\nThis argument would be pertinent, however, only if the marginal pri-\nvate benefit equaled marginal private cost at present. Yet the large\nnumber of drop-outs at this time suggests that the drop-outs are not\nnow staying in school long enough for marginal private benefits to\n\n\"Several additional points could be made here. First, in trying to maximize a joint\nproduct (skilled and apprenticed), the employer could, as part of profit maximizing,\nchoose to run a loss on the training function. Second, it is clear that once full employ-\nment is reached, the government must tolerate some further inflation (it already must\nhave faced inflation from diminishing returns) if it is to get increased output, but a\nsevere wage price spiral must be prevented. That is, the unions must be banned, as they\nwere with wage controls, from attempting to raise the real wage of the skilled and the\ntrainees, but the government cannot prevent a rise in the money wage of the skilled and\n\nmaintain the participation rate. The fall in the real rate of interest (money rates pegged)\nmay also play a small part in contributing to the demand for training.\n", "377\n"], "7": ["376 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nwage of the unskilled and trainee wages plus any direct training costs)\njust equal to the interest rate. The wage of trainees and apprentices\nwould be below the wage rate of the unskilled, and the employer would\ntrain anyone who chose to be trained since the employee would pay the\nfull cost of his training.\n\nApprentice and other trainee wages are not lower than the real wage\nrate of the unskilled, however. They are set, to a very large extent, by\nunions as part of the effort to restrict entry into the skilled\noccupations. The wage rates of trainees, like the wage rates of the\nskilled, are fixed and inflexible downward, so that the adjusting mecha-\nnism, here, as in the rest of the system, is from wages to employment\nand marginal products. With the trainee wage rate fixed at a level\nhigher than the wage of the unskilled and inflexible downward, em-\nployers must now restrict the number of trainees (the return to train-\ning is virtually infinite) to equilibrate the marginal products of\ntrainees and the trainee wage rate. With a sustained outward shift in\naggregate demand, employers can now increase the number of trainees,\njust as they increase the number of skilled (with unions tolerating the\nincrease) and they choose to do so as a part of the process of lifting\nthe unskilled up the occupational ladder to maintain the skilled wage\nrate.!5 There is, therefore, considerable scope for the real wage of the\nunskilled to rise before the flow into training is curtailed.\n\nEmbracing trickling-down from growth to poverty reduction as an\navowed public policy implies a most unappetizing program politically.\nEither it must be accompanied by a vigorous \"incomes policy\" or there\nwill be substantial inflation. Since there is reason to believe that the\nrate of reduction in poverty for a 1 percent increase in prices will be\nsmaller now than in the past [1], either the inflation will have to be se-\nvere or the incomes policy will have to be much more than a melt-the-\nmetals policy for it to have an effect other than moving the unem-\nployed and domestics to the unskilled category. With a consensus\ndefinition of poverty, there is likely to be no decline in poverty up to\nthe point where the unskilled wage rises relative to the skilled wage.\n\nSince a vigorous full employment policy has been ruled out because\nof its inflationary side effects, emphasis has been put on less aggrega-\ntive policies. The hope is to make use of a detailed description of those\nsocioeconomic characteristics which distinguish the poor from the rest\nof the population.

This is not necessarily in\nconflict with the hypothesis that unions are restricting entry into training, thereby\ncreating a wage differential, since some rationing device into training is required.\n\n\"^ This is something of an overstatement. However, only 41 percent of 1964 high school\n\ndrop-outs were employed in October, 1964. Of those employed in nonagricultural ac-\ntivities, 25 percent were employed only part time [3].\n", "376\n"], "6": ["THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION 375\n\nis not reversed when unemployment increases (as will be explained\nbelow). With the narrowing of wage differentials, income inequality\nwill also decline, ceteris paribus.\n\nSome discussion of the role of inflation in the model must be added\nto this brief summary of Reder's arguments. An analysis of the inci-\ndence of training costs must also be undertaken. First, note that rais-\ning the real wage rate of the unskilled above the initial social minimum\nrequires moving from one full employment level to a higher full em-\nployment level. That is, the demand curve for unskilled labor must\nslide up the supply curve of unskilled labor, and the latter schedule is\nan increasing function of the real wage. The rise in the real wage re-\nquires income redistribution via inflation, with the rising consumer\nprice level acting to transfer real income from rentiers and skilled\nworkers to unskilled labor [5]. As the incomes of the unskilled rise,\nthe money equivalent of the higher real wage rate becomes the new so-\ncial minimum, and since it is rigid downward, the old skill differential\ncannot be reestablished even in periods of less than full employment.\nThe level of employment must be the variable which brings the real\nwage and marginal value products into equality.\"\n\nSince the wage differential begins to narrow after full employment,\nthe incentive to undertake training declines.? If the number of\ntrainees declined with the fall in skill differentials, the real wage of the\nskilled would have to be raised to maintain the increased flow of\nskilled workers which would, in turn, tend to reestablish the original\nwage differentials. I do not believe that this, in fact, occurs.\n\nThe wage differential between skilled and unskilled workers reflects\nthe return to investment in training [2]. In a purely competitive mar-\nket, workers would shift from unskilled to trainee occupations, lower-\ning the marginal value product and hence the wage rate of trainees.\nEventually, equilibrium would be reached. The wage differential be-\ntween skilled and trainees would yield a return on the investment in\ntraining (foregone income in the form of the differential between the\n\ngreater pressure from the adoption of laborsaving innovations. Finally, it may be noted,\nthat convergence in the face of inflation involves rising money wages of both skill\ngroups, but rising real wages only among the unskilled; technology held constant.\n\n\" Reder dismissed the role of inflation, believing its effects were confined to money\nillusion [12]. There is no money illusion in what follows.\n\n7]lf with the newer higher wage floors, there are higher levels of unemployment than\nbefore, then there may be more poverty than before. Hopefully, this result is ruled\nout by the political pressures to sustain aggregate demand. Also, the inflation requires\nraising money transfers to forestall a rise in poverty among those outside the labor force\nas the proportions in poverty within the labor force fall.\n\n\"A general price increase widens absolute skill differentials (the marginal physical\nproducts serve as weights), but the relative skill differential is not changed. Since the\nprice level change raises the differential and the foregone income proportionately, the\nreturn to training is virtually unaffected.\n"], "5": ["III. Full Employment and Declining Wage Differentials:\nThe Trickle-Down Mechanism\"\n\nIn a series of articles, Reder has developed a model to explain rela-\ntive convergence in occupational wage differentials [11] [12] [13].\nIn the following paragraphs his argument is restated and, I believe,\nstrengthened.\n\nNormally employers believe that they can hire all the workers (of\neach grade) that they wish at prevailing wage rates, although they rec-\nognize that to do so will be to raise other costs (e.g., search costs). For\neach skill level above the unskilled, the labor supply is perceived to be\ninfinitely elastic at the prevailing wage rate (but not prevailing unit\nlabor costs), because increased demand can be responded to most\nprofitably by drawing from among the disguised unemployed, or by\nupgrading less skilled workers through training, or by the dilution of\njob specifications, or by extending the time during which job vacancies\ngo unfilled.? An increased demand for unskilled workers can normally\nbe met, the real wage unchanged, by drawing upon the involuntarily\nunemployed and domestic workers. The money-wage rate for unskilled\nlabor does not fall and involuntary unemployment persists because\nthere exists a wage floor below which corporations and governments\nwill not pay. Reder calls this wage floor *the social minimum.\"?\n\nDuring periods of prolonged expansions of aggregate demand (e.g.,\nthe two world wars), involuntary and disguised unemployment among\nthe unskilled is eliminated, despite a substantial rise in the labor force\nparticipation rate. Once full employment is reached, further increases\nin labor demand can be satisfied only if the real wage of the unskilled\nis raised. Since the real wage of skilled workers will not rise, the rise in\nthe real wage of the unskilled will reduce relative wage skill\ndifferentials.'^ This narrowing of wage differentials among skill groups\n\n\"Locke Anderson first used this term to describe \"the relationship between economic\ngrowth and the extent of poverty among . . . families\" [1].\n\n*Allowing job vacancies to go unfilled is an aspect of allowing orders to go unfilled.\nZarnowitz has shown that choosing to backlog orders rather than raising product prices\nis consistant with pure competition [18].\n\n?'This floor may be viewed as a perfectly elastic segrnent of the supply function of\nunskilled labor due to either unions or minimum wage legisiation. Alternatively the ef-\nfective demand curve for labor may be viewed as terminating at the social minimum\nwage, so that the marginal worker receives a wage above his supply price, and yet,\ninvoluntary unemployment persists.\n\n?'\"The model has been stated quite rigidly for heuristic reasons, but some cyclical and\nrandom fluctuations in the wage structure can and have been admitted into the argu-\nment by Reder without damaging the thrust of his argument, which is oriented to-\nward explaining the trend, or more accurately, the once-over structural changes in skill\ndifferential. A drift toward the old skill differentials over the long haul is likely, how-\never, as gains in marginal physical product due to technological advance lead to a sharing\nbetween increases in wages and increases in employment. The greater unemployment\n\namong the unskilled suggests that they will take a greater proportion of the productivity\ngains in increased employment than will the skilled.

The policy-makers would have a\nmeaningful signal, however, for, given a consensus definition of pover-\nty, a rise in the proportion of families in poverty would imply that\nwith the same rise in income differently distributed, everyone could\nhave been made better off, without anyone being made worse off and it\nwould then be appropriate to consider community action.*\n\nWhat are the circumstances under which the market economy will\ngenerate a fall in the proportion of families in poverty, if the concen-\nsus approach were accepted? More specifically, when is a general rise\nin income distributed in a way that avoids the threat to Pareto opti-\nmality at issue here? If my hunch about the magnitudes of the rele-\nvant elasticities is correct, a necessary, but not necessarily sufficient,\ncondition is for income inequality to decline. In the next section I turn\nto a major aspect of declining income inequality: the circumstances in\nwhich the wages of the poor rise relative to the average wage.\n\nIL. The Historical Record Points Toward Full Employment\n\nWe know from many sources (e.g., Kuznets [9], Goldsmith [7], and\nKravis [8]) that most measures of income inequality in the United\nStates exhibit long and short swings around a trend toward conver-\ngence during this century. The trend, in turn, is mainly attributable to\na sharp decline in income inequality during the second World War\nwhich has survived subsequent cycles. Between 1935 and 1962, to re-\nport a somewhat more pertinent fact, the proportion of families in pov-\nerty (using the needs definition) fell by 43 percent with two-thirds of\nthat decline occurring between 1935 and 1947. Over the same period,\nhowever, the needs poverty line fell relative to per capita income. If\nthe poverty line had risen proportionately with per capita income, only\nthe decline from 1935 to 1947 would have been observed [16] [6].\n\nA large part of the convergence during the second World War is\nproximately attributable to convergence within wage income [15]. At\nthe same time, occupational wage differentials narrowed relatively, and\nthe theory most often invoked to explain that fact, suitably amended,\nexplains, to a considerable extent, the significant interrelationships be-\ntween a wartime economy and declining wage differentials. That analy-\nsis emphasizes only one aspect of a wartime economy\u2014the historically\nlow levels of unemployment which are achieved\u2014but an important\npolicy role for wage and interest rate controls is also implicit in the ex-\nplanation.\n\n*Since the consensus poverty line has no direct implication for policy, it would prob-\nably be best to confine its use to policy discussion within the government.\n"], "3": ["372 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\ntary market actions, satisfy the evolving desires of the community due\nto changes in its income level for those things in which there are exter-\nnalities in consumption; e.g., housing.\n\nIt is feasible to implement this alternative (\"consensus\") approach,\nbut there are many problems of concept and of estimation.* Were these\nissues resolved and a new poverty line drawn, it would, I suspect, ra-\ntionalize the recent increase in public concern over poverty.\n\nThe needs approach is something of an anachronism, for surely the\nmaterial needs of the poor are being more adequately met then before.\nFor public concern to increase at a time when a social problem is de-\ncreasing in significance appears to be irrational [14]. If poverty is not\na declining social problem, then, of course, the increased public con-\ncern is understandable. Although the needs poverty line has fallen rel-\native to per capita income over the past three decades [16], it is my\nhunch that if the consensus poverty line had been estimated, it would\nhave risen relative to average income over the same period, and that\nconsequently, there would not, in recent years, have been a decline in\nthe incidence of poverty.\n\nLet me return to my housing example. There is some evidence to\nsuggest that the income elasticity of demand for better neighborhoods\nat the median of the personal income distribution is greater than\nthe elasticity of demand for standard housing among the poor.*\nDifferences in the relevant income elasticities can be offset by compen-\nsating differences in the income change which they modify, however.\nIn my example, therefore, the preferences of the majority for better\nneighborhoods could be satisfied by voluntary action if the incomes of\nthe poor were to rise more rapidly (by the ratio of the elasticities)\nthan median income.\n\nOne caveat: Even if the elasticities are as I suspect, it does not fol-\n\n'In one instance, for example, Muth [10] obtained the following estimate:\n5y(107) 2\u201425 1n s - ...\nwhere: y the median income of a census tract in\nSouth Chicago in 1950\ns\u2014 the percent of substandard houses in the tract.\n\nSuppose, to take some arbitrary numbers, the median income of the poor to be $2,725\nand the median income of the sample to be $3,870.

For the poor to volun-\ntarily reduce the proportion of substandard houses by 15.4 percent, however, the median\nincome of the poor would have to have advanced by 14 percent.

The primary objective may very well be efficiency\nin the Pareto sense. If this be so, a poverty line which considers only\nthe needs of the poor may not be the most pertinent guide to federal\npolicy. Perhaps the most relevant requirement of a poverty line is that\nit serve as an index of the disutility to the community of the persis-\ntence of poverty.\n\nTake as an example the externality in consumption due to slums.\nSatisfactions flow from two separate aspects of a house. One is the\nquality of service the house itself provides to its occupants. The other\naspect is that the quality of the neighborhood in which the house\nstands may affect the satisfactions the dwelling unit provides to its oc-\ncupants. The existence of substandard housing can, therefore, reduce\nthe satisfactions of some who do not live in them. It follows, therefore,\nthat since poverty is generally a precondition for slums, the elimina-\ntion of poverty, and with it slums, will raise the real incomes of some\nwho are not poor. These externality considerations suggest an ap-\nproach quite different from the \"needs\" approach to the measurement\nof poverty. They suggest that the poverty line take into consideration\nthe external benefits of raising families above the poverty line.\n\nImagine a community in which none may change address, but in\nwhich the quality of each house can be improved (at constant cost),\nincluding raising substandard housing to standard quality. As incomes\nrise, all individuals will want both the quality of their own housing to\nbe improved and the proportion of substandard dwellings occupied by\nothers in the community to decline. Only the former, however, can be\ndirectly affected through the market by each family, for the latter de-\npends upon the actions of others. The change in the quantity of sub-\nstandard housing will therefore depend in large part upon the income\nelasticity of those who live in substandard housing and upon the\nchange in their income.

As one would expect, the partial effects of increased\nexpenditures per pupil become positive when the teacher-pupil ratio is\nheld constant (regression equation (3)). In this case increased expendi-\ntures are associated with increased salaries. Note the similarity be-\ntween regression equations (2), (3), and (5).

The authors of the Rural School Survey make the following\ncomment:\n\nferior (or superior) to the original population. Since my analysis is based upon the residual\npopulation, the resultant measure of quality of schooling would be possibly biased. In an\nattempt to control for **quality drain,\" I used three variables which would affect the propen-\nsity of a population to migrate. They were: (1) the ratio of the median income of rural farm\npeople to urban people, (2) the percent of a state's population living in urban areas, and (3)\nthe percent of a state's income derived from value added by manufacturing. No combination\nof these variables indicated any significant explanation of the returns to schooling. As a further\nexample, \u00cd controlled\" for the schooling of the parental population as a proxy for taste for\nschooling. This variable was highly correlated with a dummy specification of race and could\nnot be analyzed separately. Within each racial group, there was no relationship between the\nreturn to schooling and the schooling of the parental population.\n\nV The proper school system inputs would be an average, weighted according to the time\nin which members of the population were in school.

In the absence of freely mobile labor, an analysis of\nfactors affecting quality must be accompanied by an analysis of factors\naffecting the demand for education. But before considering such a joint\ndetermination of the value of a unit of schooling, it is necessary to indi-\ncate a method for estimating the number of units of schooling a person\npossesses. The method employed is discussed in the following section.\n\nSchooling is a productive factor and differences in the amount of\nschooling possessed by persons create differences in their productivity.\nAn individual is, by assumption, a composite factor consisting of one\nbundle of physical labor (a warm body\u2014the original but not indestruct-\nible properties) and a bundle of education. The properties of the physical\nbundle are those associated with a person who has not attended school.\nAccording to our limited definition of education, persons who have not\nattended school have no education and the income of such a person is\nthe return to his physical properties. Since persons who have attended\nschool also have a bundle of the same physical properties, their income\nincludes the return to these physical properties. Hence by subtracting\nthe expected income of a person who has not attended school from the\nexpected income of someone who has, an estimate of the return to the\nsecond person's education is obtained.\n\nNow, the return to education, as defined previously, is the number\nof units of schooling multiplied by the product of quality of schooling\nand the value of the marginal product of education. I assume further\nthat the number of units of schooling a person possesses is determined\nby the amount of time he has spent in school, and that the transforma-\ntion function of time in attendance into schooling is the same in all\nstates. The rate of transformation of schooling into education\u2014a rate\nwhich is assumed to be constant within each state\u2014is given by the\nquality of schooling. Thus persons throughout the country who have\nattended school for the same number of years, say eight, receive the\nsame amount of the productive factor, schooling, but not the same\namount of education. The amount of education obtained by a given\nindividual is the amount of his schooling times its quality. Since the\nscale of measurement is arbitrary, I assume that a person who has at-\ntended school for eight years has one unit of schooling. If a person who\nhas not attended school has no schooling and if a person who has at-\ntended for eight years has one unit of schooling, then we might ask\nhow much schooling has a person who has completed, say, twelve years\nof school? This question can be answered only if we assume that the\nprice per unit of education is constant within (but not necessarily be-\ntween) states. Assuming quality of schooling to be constant within\nstates, the number of units of schooling possessed by a person with\n", "THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION\n", "383\n"], "4": ["If labor were freely mobile, one would expect a tendency toward\nequality in the wages of similar types of laborers. But, is the variation\nin average income observed in the estimates of Table 1 consistent with\na highly mobile population? Suppose that income is the wage of the\npurely physical attributes of a person plus the return to his education.\nSuppose further that the physical attributes of the individual are those\nof \u00e0 person who has never attended school. Then average productive\nproperties, adjusted for differences in age, etc., of persons without\nschooling would most likely be similar in all states. Thus we would\nexpect to observe a tendency toward income equality for persons with-\nout schooling. Furthermore, this tendency toward equality would be\nobserved in the return per unit of education. By definition, the return\nto a unit of schooling is the unit return to education multiplied by the\nquality of schooling. And, in this world of labor mobility, the return to\neducation would be approximately equal so that the return per unit of\nschooling would be an hedonic index of quality. On the other hand, if\nthere are interregional differences in the return to education, the return\nto schooling cannot be so easily interpreted.\n\nFor this reason, to examine whether or not mobility has resulted in\napproximate equality of marginal products, we can rely only upon the\nestimated incomes of the unschooled since comparisons of returns to\nschooling are obscured by potential differences in quality of schooling\nand in the price per unit of education. Inspection of the adjusted in-\ncomes of those without schooling in Table 1 indicates a degree of varia-\ntion which should at least raise doubt about the validity of the mobility\nhypothesis. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the income dif-\nferences indicated in the adjusted incomes of the unschooled have per-\nsisted for several decades.

In a competitive market, the\nreturn to education is the value of the marginal product of education\ntimes the amount of education employed. Accordingly, there are two\nways in which an increase in education affects the return to education.\nFirst, it increases the number of units of education that are income re-\ncipients. Second, other things equal, it changes factor proportions\nthrough substitution and, assuming diminishing marginal productivity,\nreduces the return per unit of education. Both these effects can be im-\nportant in the measurement of the quality of schooling.\n\nQuality shall be defined in terms of a simple adjustment relating the\nheterogeneous input, schooling, to the homogeneous factor, education.\nThus, the quantity times the quality of schooling is defined as educa-\ntion. This definition mitigates the problem posed by regional differences\nin the quality of schooling that make the consideration of schooling as\na standardized input impossible. According to this definition of educa-\ntion, if the quality of schooling in one area were twice that of another,\nceleris paribus? the amount of education would be twice as great, and\nhence its marginal product lower. Conceptually, then, quality differen-\ntials are reflected in differential returns, but the differences in returns\nmust be adjusted for differences in marginal products.\n\nThe Empirical Framework\n\nIn order to derive an estimate of the return to schooling from income\ndata, it was necessary to adjust incomes for differences in variables\nwhich may otherwise introduce bias. The adjustment procedure adopted\nwas, first, to estimate an income generating function, and, second, to\nuse that function for predicting income when the age distribution, the\naverage value of land and buildings owned, and the proportion of non-\nwhites in each state-schooling class are held constant.

The academic investment in pure reason has\noften led to a defensive contempt for these books. They are not taken\nvery seriously in the review sections of the scholarly journals, and they\nare at best disregarded and at worst disdained in judging the profes-\nsional competence of their authors.

This is\nwhat every textbook writer should hope and try to achieve, even while\nhe is counting his advance royalties, and for this reason every such\neffort should be taken seriously.\n\nWe have a great tradition of books that have served this purpose for\nstudents of economics, from Smith and Ricardo through Mill and\nMarshall to Taussig and Samuelson.

They\nbuy synthetic textbooks, of course, but they may also buy classical and\nmodern treatises that are used in lieu of textbooks. They may buy the\nstandard works in their major subjects, and they may even buy the\nmonographs that are important in their special fields of research.\nThese are the buyers who each year add increasing amounts to the\ntotal sales of Professor Friedman's book and the others discussed ear-\nlier.\n\nBut note again Dr. Becker's book. My generalizations about the\ngraduate student market may apply to all books in economics, but\ntheir effect is significant in commercial terms only for books of a rea-\nsonable degree of generality in fields that are central to the contempo-\nrary graduate curriculum. For such books, the graduate students may\ncontribute several thousand copies to sales; and when these are added\nto sales in the core market of institutions and professionals and in the\nforeign market, the total becomes interesting to profit-seeking publish-\ners. Accordingly, in recent years commercial firms have begun not\nmerely to publish royalty-bearing books of this kind but even to com-\nmission them.\n\nUp to this point I have been discussing economic writing\u2014whether\ncommercial or noncommercial\u2014that is addressed to professional and\nwould-be-professional audiences. I turn now to the largest and most\nimportant category of strictly commercial professional writing: the\npreparation of undergraduate textbooks.\n\nThe size of the market for these books is not clearly known, since\nwe have no figures for the number of undergraduates majoring in eco-\nnomics. However, we do know that nearly 10,000 bachelor's degrees in\nthis field were conferred in 1962-63,? and if we assume that this figure\nbears the same relation to enrollment in economics that the total num-\nber of degrees bears to total enrollment in that year, some 79,000 un-\ndergraduates were then majoring in the field. And if we further assume\nthat this figure will rise at the same rate as total undergraduate enroll-\nment, by now there must be some 100,000 economics majors, and by\n1973 there will be around 130,000.

Before they will spend\nmoney on a book, they have to be convinced that it is in some way nec-\nessary to them, either because it will play an immediate part in their\nown work or because it is generally important to the maintenance of\ntheir professional status.\n\nIt is these two groups together\u2014the libraries and the economists\nwho are highly trained and oriented toward research\u2014that comprise\nthe basic market for professional writing in economics. It is here that\nwe find the subscribers to the professional journals and the buyers of\nBecker's Economics of Discrimination and similarly specialized books.\nIt is, as you see, a rather small market in absolute size, and the pro-\nportion of the total that can be expected to buy any but the most ex-\nceptional publication is much smaller still. Output that reaches this\nmarket alone does not ordinarily result in publishing profits, and it is\nthis kind of writing that today remains noncommercial in the strict\nsense.\n\n\"Third, there are perhaps 10,000 professional economists who are en-\ngaged mainly in government, business, or industrial work and who\nhave at most a master's degree.* Judging by my experience in trying to\nsell books to these people, their interest in theoretical work is low and\ntheir pragmatic needs are high. The business economists especially\nseem to buy few books that are not in some direct way related to the\nperformance of their specific duties, and they are a diffuse and uncer-\ntain market for professional economic writing.\n\nFourth, economic writing is a commodity that can be exported with\nsome ease, and there exists a substantial international market, at least\nfor work that is not parochial in emphasis and data. The export mar-\nket (including Canada) for American economics books that are rea-\nsonably general in content may amount to 50 percent or more of their\ntotal long-run sales. Most of these sales are in Canada, Great Britain,\nand other English-speaking countries; the remainder is scattered\nthroughout the world, with a notable concentration in Japan. The Brit-\nish market can often be joined to the American by arrangements for\ncombined printings made well in advance of publication, and this\nsometimes makes possible the profitable commercial publication of\nwork that otherwise would remain in noncommercial hands. Such ar-\nrangements are more common for specialized work than for straight-\nforward textbooks, which ordinarily are geared to curricular patterns\nthat differ considerably from country to country.\n\nFifth, there are the apprentices to the guild, the graduate students,\nand the size and growth of this market was noted at the outset of this\npaper. Unless graduate students have changed greatly since my day,\n\n* Ibid.\n"], "8": ["408 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nhave been welcomed by a commercial publisher as recently as twenty\nyears ago.\n\n'These sales figures are still more meaningful if we look at them in\nterms of the size of the potential market for the products of your in-\ndustry. Who buys the output of published economic writing and for\nwhat purposes?\n\nFirst, there are the libraries. Publishers are always told by authors\nthat *all the libraries will buy my book,\" and while this may be true, it\nis not generally recognized that the numbers involved are usually\nsmall. Fewer than 1,500 colleges in the United States granted bache-\nlor's degrees in 1962-63, and of these, only 569 granted degrees in eco-\nnomics; only 223 universities granted Ph.D.'s, and of these, only 62\ngranted them in economics.* Only the least specialized book finds its\nway into general undergraduate collections; for all other books, the\nacademic library market is confined to institutions where research\ntakes place. If we add the few public libraries with research collections\nand the specialized government, business, and other research libraries,\nthe total market does not exceed 500 or so copies for the ordinary\nprofessional book in this country.\n\nSmall though it may be, this market is especially important to pub-\nlishers because it is relatively certain and not very discriminating. This\nis because librarians have been very properly trained into a passion for\ncompleteness, which they (and their consultants) can indulge at some-\none else's expense. I am reasonably confident that I could achieve the\nusual 500-copy sale to libraries of the Dubuque, Iowa, telephone direc-\ntory merely by putting it in a good cloth binding and calling it some-\nthing like *A Spatio-Economic Model of an Urban Communication\nNetwork.\" But that is all I would sell, to libraries or to anyone else.\n\nSecond, there are the core of professional economists who are con-\nsumers as well as producers of economic writing. Again this is not a\nvery large group, judging by 1964 data from the National Register of\nScientific and Technical Personnel. It is probable that most published\nprofessional work in economics is both produced and consumed by\nPh.D.s (5,061), or by those employed by educational or nonprofit in-\nstitutions other than government (5,526, of whom two-thirds had\nPh.D/s), or by those engaged primarily in teaching or research\n(5,396, of whom 60 percent had Ph.D s).' Once we remove overlap,\nand even if we add the non-Ph.D.'s employed by government and in-\ndustry who attempt to keep up with the growing literary output of eco-\nnomics, the total is not likely to exceed 6,000.

These presses were originally established within the\nacademic community to meet its special needs of internal communica-\ntion; their editorial judgments were to be based only on considerations\nof scholarly competence, and their financial losses\u2014which under these\ncircumstances were thought to be inevitable\u2014were to be borne by the\ncommunity they served. But now the university presses, or at least the\nlarger among them, have moved into the shadowy world of the demi-\nmondaine. 'The growing size of the academic market has acted both as\ncarrot and as stick: it has for the first time brought to the directors of\nthese presses the temptations of potential profits, and simultaneously it\nhas driven them into competition with commercial publishers for cer-\ntain manuscripts that were formerly theirs by default. As a result, they\nhave been led to emulate the skills of the commercial campus-walkers\nbut without abandoning their amateur status (and the advantages of\ncostless working capital and tax exemption that go with it). According-\nly, the publication of a book by a university press is these days less\nand less often accompanied by prestige alone and more and more often\naccompanied by the promise of royalties to its author.\n\nThe other side of this coin is that the commercial publishers have\nfound that scholarship pays. There are now a considerable number of\nfirms that bring out at their own expense specialized economic writing\nof a kind that was formerly left to the mercies of the subsidized pub-\nlishers. This sort of commitment of resources may be made because\nthe publisher is intellectually convinced of the merit of a book, or for\nprestige purposes, or because the firm wants to develop a list of text-\nbooks out of monographs by particular authors or in a particular field;\nbut in most instances it is undertaken simply in the hope and expecta-\ntion that enough copies of a book will be sold to make the venture\nprofitable.\n\n(The size of the market for these publications can be indicated in\nseveral ways. For example, take the circulation figures of the scholarly\njournals in economics.

Doctoral dissertations, for example,\nhave become a sort of professional muscle-building exercise that is in-\ntended to satisfy only a small board of examiners, and their essentially\nprivate nature sets the pattern for much subsequent work. Such exer-\ncises are not ordinarily suitable for larger audiences and should be put\non public view only when the performer is exceptional in grace or stat-\nure. But the pressure to publish does not encourage normative judg-\nments of this kind.\n\nThe consequent growth in the supply of professional writing has\nbeen largely noncommercial in nature, and it has been met mostly by\nthe creation and expansion of vehicles of publication established for\nthis specific purpose out of necessity by the professional community\nitself. For example, thirteen (40 percent) of the thirty leading eco-\nnomics journals published regularly in the United States were estab-\nlished after 1945. Similarly, of the seventy-four university- or founda-\ntion-sponsored publishing houses that will bring out economics books\nif given sufficient inducement, 26 percent were established after 1945.\nFurthermore, each of these presses has greatly expanded its output, for\nbooks in economics presumably as much as for books in other fields;\nthe total output of thirty-three of these presses that were in existence\nin 1938 had nearly doubled by 1964, rising from 707 books to 1,209.\n\nNoncommercial output today dominates professional writing in eco-\nnomics, but the distinction between commercial and noncommercial\nwork is in fact of fairly recent origin and is proving transitory in\neffect. Well into the twentieth century, all educated men were expected\nto be familiar with the principles of political economy, and the commu-\nnity of the educated was sufficiently large in relation to publishing\ncosts to support the commercial publication not only of Mill and Mar-\nshall but also of the more specialized work of Edgeworth and Fisher.\nProfessional economists communicated with each other noncommer-\ncially in the scholarly journals, as they still do; but their major output\nwas in the form of books intended to educate and edify the larger\nmembership of the intellectual elite. The dissolution of this elite and\nthe displacement of \"political economy\" by *'economic science\" were\nboth part of a general process of functional specialization in our soci-\nety, and the increasingly narrow focus of most economic writing, which\ncoincided with a rapid rise in publishing costs, compelled the expan-\nsion of the noncommercial outlets supported by the professional com-\nmunity.

Dr. Frank S. Kristof, in a Columbia dissertation, prepared an\nelaborate regression analysis relating number of pages published to\nsalaries of the faculty of three large midwestern universities just after\nthe war. He found that (in terms of 1948 prices and incomes) these\nsalaries rose by 50 cents per published page, regardless of the form of\npublication, up to a maximum of 1,400 pages.* This may be a spurious\ncorrelation; both published output and salaries may be related to other\nindependent variables, such as intelligence, or energy. Nonetheless, Dr.\nKristof's figures are illuminating, and the light they cast is made glar-\ning by Professor George Stigler's estimate that a major article in a\nmajor economics journal is worth to its author between $10,000 and\n$20,000 in increased lifetime earnings. It is surely doubtful that any\nother activity of professional economists\u2014teaching or consulting or\nwhatever\u2014 would have a comparable long-run effect on their basic sal-\nary level or perhaps even on their total income.\n\nThe economic benefits of professional writing are recognized and re-\ninforced by the \"publish or perish\" doctrine now prevalent in Ameri-\ncan academic life, and spilling over to affect the behavior of nonaca-\ndemic professionals as well. The doctrine has an autonomous and bru-\ntalizing force of its own: theirs not to reason why, theirs but to write\nor die. This generalized pressure to publish may emphasize only one of\nthe ways in which specialized knowledge can be put to use, but it ac-\ncurately reflects the preferences of those who actually pay for the\nworking time of economists. These buyers, like most purchasers of\nlabor services, are concerned first with the productivity of their labor\nforce, and publications are the only evidence of professional output\nthat is readily measurable. Accordingly, deans and foundation admin-\nistrators, grants and tenure committees, are obliged to concern them-\nselves not so much with the form or content of the published work as\nwith its tangible weight.\n\nThis lack of selectivity is transmitted in turn to the writers them-\nselves, who sensibly seek immediate publication for every kind and\nscrap of writing they produce in the course of their professional lives:\ndissertations, book reviews, reports originally made to government or\nindustrial employers, conference speeches, critical notes, commentaries\n\n* After 1,400 pages the relationship ceased to hold.

In fact, the practice of guaranteeing a specified level of\nsales, common in trade publishing, is now being used in the text field.\n\nThe general procedure, of course, is for authors to be paid on a roy-\nalty basis; that is, the author receives a specified percentage of the\nsales price of the book. The range of royalty rates is fairly wide\u2014run-\nning from 10 to 16 percent of list price\u2014but there is a strong central ten-\ndency.

A few recent books have\nbeen published on a profit-sharing basis; that is, author and publisher\nshare, on an agreed-upon basis, in the sales revenue remaining after\ncosts are deducted. The usual arrangement apparently is for publisher\nand author to share equally in the net receipts (total revenue less cer-\ntain costs).

The profit-sharing plan is of analytical impo-\ntance because it overcomes some author-publisher conflicts that are in-\nherent in the royalty arrangement.\n\nConf\u00fccts in Pricing\n\nIt is inherent in the royalty arrangement that pricing results in a\nconflict between the interests of author and publisher;* that is, the\nprice which maximizes profit for the publisher is higher than the price\nwhich maximizes royalty payments for the author. Profit is maximized\nwhere marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Since the author is paid\na percentage of total revenue, the optimal price from his point of view\nis where marginal revenue is zero.

An estimate is made\nof the direct costs of a first printing equal to estimated sales. This cost\ncan be estimated quite accurately.

First, without copyright protection,\nthe private economic return from literary creation (to author and pub-\nlisher) will necessarily be smaller than the economic benefit of this ac-\ntivity to society. As a result, it is argued, the quantity of literary crea-\ntion will be insufficient to maximize welfare. Second, literary produc-\ntion, like education, should be encouraged because it has greater in-\ntrinsic merit than its alternative product, perhaps because of its long-\nrun neighborhood effects.\n\n'The second of these assumptions is the more difficult to assess. It is\nin the nature of a primitive value judgment and is not amenable to an-\nalytical treatment. We can intuitively discern books which are less\nmeritorious than given alternative products under any conventional\nvalue standard. Even if literature is an intrinsically superior product,\nit still does not follow that copyright protection is the best device for\ninducing the optimal number of books. We are compelled to return to\nthe first assumption, that copyrights are necessary to close the gap be-\ntween private return and public benefit.\n\nAs an initial step towards measuring the welfare effects of literary\ncreation, we should try to distinguish the categories of books which are\nencouraged and the returns which are enhanced by copyright protec-\ntion. A convenient method of accomplishing this is to isolate the\ndifferent kinds of risks taken in the book industry. They may be di-\nvided analytically into three categories:\n\n1. Those ventures which are expected to and do cover costs even in\nthe absence of copyright protection. Copyrights are not necessary for\nthe encouragement of these risks. Rather, copyright protection\n\n?*' Mr. Tolkien's authorization states that \"this paperback edition, and no other, has been\npublished with my consent and co-operation.

The publisher's fixed\ncosts of production on each title are very high relative to total cost,\nand the combination of high fixed costs and declining marginal costs\nmeans a rapid decrease in average costs. The entrepreneurial function\nof the publisher includes the ability to gauge demand conditions cor-\nrectly and publish a first edition that will saturate demand at the pro-\njected price. Should a copying competitor publish a rival edition? The\ncopier's fixed costs would be lower, but with marginal costs for both\npublishers relatively low and declining, it would probably be necessary\nfor the copier to publish an edition in the same size range as the first\nedition in order to bring his average costs significantly below those of\nthe first publisher. The result obviously would be a doubling of the\ncopies offered for sale. If the first publisher had estimated the demand\ncorrectly, there will be a large volume of unsold books until the price\nis lowered sufficiently to reach a new market, since demand will not\nclear the market at the traditional price. Marginal costs for both pub-\nlishers being about the same, the first publisher is equally capable of\nslashing prices to dispose of his stock.\n\n'The mere threat of retributive behavior by the first publisher should\nbe sufficient to deter the copier until the first edition is sold out and the\nfirst publisher has made his profit. As a matter of fact, this was pre-\ncisely the method used by American publishers in the nineteenth cen-\ntury to protect their uncopyrighted works by British authors from the\ncopiers. If a pirated edition appeared, the first publisher responded\nwith *\u00fcghter\" or \"killer editions\"\u2014extremely cheap editions designed\nto drive prices below even the copier's costs, in the hope of establishing\na reputation for retributive conduct which, while sel\u00edf-defeating in the\nshort run, was highly effective in curbing the pirates in the long run.!*\n\nIn addition to being first on the market, there are other means avail-\nable to a publisher to secure his position without copyright protection.\nThe contract with the author may reserve exclusive rights to new in-\ntroductions, additions and revisions by the author to subsequent edi-\ntions issued by the first publisher. Moreover, the first publisher can\nobtain prepublication orders from interested groups and individuals, a\nbusiness method which is used today. Finally, the authorization of the\nfirst edition by the author may be a marketable asset, at least among\nthose readers who strongly believe in the right of an author to the\nfruits of his creation.

A publisher need not invest in\nphysical equipment, such as paper, printing presses, or bookbinding\nmachinery.

There are also\ncases where authors pay for the costs of publication in order to pro-\nmote some other pecuniary interest than sale of the writing itself, such\nas advertising copy and scholarly publication induced by the *publish-\nor-perish\" rule of most universities. Finally, there are authors who\nsubmit manuscripts without any hope of receiving financial remunera-\ntion.\n\nWhile the productions of the authors described above may include\nthe most unreadable and esoteric, it is more likely that they contain a\nlarge part of the very contributions to cultural and scientific progress\nwhich the proponents of copyright deem to be in need of monopoly\nprotection. Moreover, most articles in the scholarly journals are sub-\nmitted without pecuniary compensation. But there are types of crea-\ntive effort which require pecuniary reimbursement for the author be-\nfore the work will even be conceived; this occurs when the costs of\ncreation, as opposed to publication and distribution, constitute a\nsignificant proportion of total costs, and these costs need not be in-\ncurred by copiers. Prime examples of this kind of product are encyclo-\npedias, almanacs, mass circulation periodicals, technical subscription\nservices for professions (such as citators and digests for lawyers), and\nmotion pictures.

However, it does not necessarily follow that the grant\nof a copyright monopoly is the only such device possible, nor that it is\nthe most desirable device. If we wish to encourage works which require\nlong periods of research or high costs of creation before they reach the\npublishing stage, it may be preferable to support authors during the\nperiod of production rather than during the moment of potential in-\ncome protected by the copyright laws.

The private return to publishers and authors, in the ab-\nsence of copyright protection, is held to be smaller than the economic\nvalue of their literary products to society. The general welfare will\ntherefore be enhanced by enacting copyright legislation which encour-\nages the creation and publication of manuscripts that otherwise would\nnot have come into existence. This argument will be examined here by\nraising three questions:\n\n1. Does the copyright system induce the creation of new goods\nwhich would not have been created in the absence of copyrights?\n\n2. Assuming that new goods are produced, are these goods valued\nhigher by consumers than the goods which would have been produced\nif resources had not been diverted to literary production by the copy-\nright system? In other words, is social welfare enhanced?\n\n3. If there is a benefit from the copyright system, is it offset, at\nleast in part, by various administrative costs and frictions inherent in\nthe system?\n\nThe most important, although at times unstated, premise of copy-\nright apologetics is that literary effort and production will decrease or\nvirtually disappear if copyright protection is removed. In any discus-\nsion of this assertion, the incentives or motives of authors and publish-\ners should be distinguished. Both are beneficiaries of the copyright\nsystem, but their degree of dependence upon it is quite different. We\nshall discuss the position of the author first, and then that of the pub-\nlisher.\n\nThe massive literary and dramatic production during the centuries\nbefore copyright protection was enacted demonstrate that there are\nother motives for the creation of intellectual property than the expec-\ntation of monopoly profits. Many authors commit ideas to paper with-\nout any intention of having them published. Some, like Franz Kafka,\nexpress a wish that their creations be destroyed upon their death.\nOther authors actually pay for all or part of the costs of publication of\ntheir creations, in order to satisfy other desires than direct economic\nremuneration. These desires include the propagation of partisan ideas;\nnotions of altruism, as in the case of religious and moral tracts; desire\n"], "4": ["424 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nthor shall enjoy the right to the respect for his name, his authorship\nand his work. This right shall be attached to his person. It shall be\nperpetual, inalienable, and imprescriptable.\"\"\n\nThe emphasis of this conception of copyright is on the author's pri-\nvacy and reputation rather than his commercial interests, and as a\nconsequence under French law the rights granted are virtually inalien-\nable and in some cases perpetual. The three most important are: (1)\nthe paternity right\u2014the right to be identified as the creator of his\nworks and be protected from plagiarism; (2) the integrity right\u2014the\nright to protection against alteration or deformation of one's work, and\nthe right to make changes in it; (3) the publication right\u2014the right\nnot to publish at all.\n\nA lengthy discussion of these asserted rights is unnecessary here, be-\ncause they could be substantially protected without resort to a copy-\nright system. The enforcement of tort law protection of the paternity\nright would be rather simple, and the integrity right, although it would\nraise administrative problems, could also be enforced through the\ngrant of a private cause of action. The right to withhold from publica-\ntion, which is protected perpetually in France, is also covered by the\nperpetual common law copyright in the United States. The right of\nprivacy, recognized as a legal right in the United States and the Com-\nmonwealth and invoked in analogous situations, is probably broad\nenough to cover protection of unpublished manuscripts in the absence\nof a copyright system.\n\n3. Finally, as with patents, it is often argued that a temporary mo-\nnopoly grant is a convenient way of fulfilling society's obligation to re-\nward writers for their contributions to the general wel\u00edare.* This ap-\nproach was adopted and a property justification rejected in the report\nby the Register of Copyrights in support of the pending United States\ncopyright bill? However, copyright seems to be an inefficient device\nfor simply rewarding authors. The grant of tax relief to successful au-\nthors or direct payments for unremunerative literary creation would\nprobably be more convenient, and these alternative forms of reward\nare actually given today. The Internal Revenue code, $ 1302, allows\ncertain authors to *spread-back\" the income from the sale of a literary\nwork over a period up to thirty-six months, in order to mitigate the tax\nconsequences of receiving lump-sum compensation for work which re-\nquires long periods of unremunerative preparation. The multitude of\nbook prizes and literary awards constitutes an important private meth-\nod of rewarding authors for their contributions to society.\n\n\"Law of Mar. 11, 1957, art. 6 (France) ; see commentary in Bonnefoy, La nouvelle l\u00e9gisla-\nLion sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 litteraire et artistique (1959), pp. 79-80.\n\n* See e g., Phillips, of. cit. supra, n. 3, at p. 12.\n\n* 1 U.

The claim that an author has an inherent property right in his\nwritings, which right is merely recognized by the statute, has such\nwide acceptance that it seems at times to brook no opposition. Jurists,\npolitical philosophers, and economists have developed two divergent\nviews of property which illustrate the conflict among supporters of the\ncopyright system.\n\nFirst, property rights can be viewed as a device whereby scarce\nresources will be subject to exclusive control rather than exploitation\nat will by all comers, with the result that they will be used in an eco-\nnomically efficient manner. This theory was latent in the Roman law\ndevelopment of the rights of property, with its emphasis on dominium,\nor exclusive control over tangible objects. The origin of the claim to a\nproperty right\u2014working of the soil, gathering of the objects, gratui-\ntous grant by the government, plunder, or theft\u2014is not necessarily rel-\nevant; rather it is important that someone has control.\n\nSecond, property rights can be viewed as the right of each person to\nthe exclusive control of the products of his creation. If a man brings a\ngiven commodity into existence, one who appropriates this commodity\nwithout the consent of the creator is guilty of theft, a proposition\nwhich becomes self-evident with the use of right reason. This later\ntheory of property has its roots in scholastic jurisprudence and finds its\nmost famous expression in John Locke's Second Treatise. It is inextri-\ncably tangled with the first theory in Blackstone! and finds its strong-\nest refuge today in justifications for the expansion of patents and\ncopyrights.\n\nIf one finds some credence in this line of argument, copyright is an\nideal application. Locke derived a property right in the toiler from his\ncultivation of a small plot of land. However, most of the value was\n* found,\" not created, and the toiler's monopoly over the plot restricts\nall others from using the plot, a use to which everyone has a right in\ncommon in the absence of the toiler's activity and resultant exclusive\nlegal right. On the other hand, a copyright truly deprives others of\nnothing which they would have had in the absence of the owner's crea-\ntive activity. This line of reasoning was conclusive to Herbert Spen-\ncer: *.. .

I will quote another passage:\n\nThe broadcasting authorities have certainly a duty to keep sensitively aware of the\npublic's tastes and attitudes as they now are and in all their variety; and to care about\nthem.

With commercial broadcasting, the\nperson who pays for the broadcast of a program is the advertiser. It\nfollows that the programs broadcast are those which maximize the\nprofits to be derived from advertising. The market for broadcast pro-\ngrams is one from which the consumer is barred: what he would pay\nplays no part in the determination of programs. The result is that some\nsectors of the public feel that they are not being catered for. The FCC\nis uneasily aware that all is not well. And so it has exhorted the busi-\nnessmen to act in the public interest and, incidentally, against their\nown. It seems clear that in this case the highest motive was not the\nstrongest.\n\nThe obvious way of dealing with this problem is to introduce some\nform of pay-television. If this were done, consumers who were willing\nto pay more for resources used in the broadcasting industry than were\nthe advertisers could secure the kind of programs they wanted. This\nproposal has been strongly opposed by the broadcasting industry. This\nopposition comes, as Dr. Frank Stanton of CBS has told us, not be-\ncause the industry has any \"economic axe to grind,\" but because it\nwould not be in the best interests of the public.' It is I think a univer-\nsal rule that businessmen never act from higher motives than when\nthey are engaged in restricting potential competition. Of course, the\nopposition has been successful. Proposals for pay-television were first\nmade in the late 1940's, but in spite of determined attempts to secure\nthe approval of the Federal Communications Commission, all that has\nbeen granted is authorization for experimental pay-television services\noperating under restrictive conditions which make it impossible for\npay-television to realize its potentialities. So far only one such service\nhas been started, that in Hartford, Connecticut. I do not know what\nthe future will be. But there are no signs that the Federal Communica-\ntions Commission intends to change its policy of support for the com-\nmercial broadcasting system.\n\nWhat should be done? The task of charting a sensible future for the\nbroadcasting industry is not one which can be left to the industry,\nwhich has its own interests to protect. It cannot be left to the Federal\nCommunications Commission, which cannot conceive of any future\nwhich is not essentially a repetition of the past. Who, therefore, is to\nperform this task? I suggest that it has to be assumed by academic\neconomists. You may recall what Adam Smith said about university\neducation: \"The parts of education which are commonly taught in uni-\nversities, it may, perhaps, be said are not very well taught.

I have\nexplained my grounds for holding this view on other occasions and\nthere is no need for me to spend much time going over them now, par-\nticularly as there is really no dispute about the correctness of my posi-\ntion. If I may quote Dr. Goldin when he was with the FCC, but giving,\nI need hardly say, his personal views, the present procedure for choos-\ning among competing applicants for the radio frequency spectrum is\n\"ritualistic, formalistic, wasteful and inefficient.\"* I have proposed\nthat radio frequencies should be disposed of to the highest bidder be-\ncause it would avoid the costs of the present procedure, would tend to\nallocate these frequencies to those who could use them most efficiently,\nwould prevent the unjustifiable enrichment of those (commonly\nwealthy) private individuals who obtain these grants from the FCC,\nand would facilitate changes in the use of radio frequencies when this\nseemed to be called for.\n\nI would not argue that there should be no government regulation of\nthe broadcasting industry. But such regulation is not inconsistent with\nuse of the pricing system. There is no industry which is not in some\nway regulated. What is extraordinary if we contemplate the allocation\nof the radio frequency spectrum is that it makes no use at all of the\npricing system. Of course there would be difficulties in introducing a\npricing scheme. Dr. Goldin has said that \"after the initial shock of ra-\ntionally considering the use of the pricing mechanism in frequency al-\nlocations, the virtually unanimous view of communications specialists\"\nwould be that these practical difficulties were too great and he adds\nthat until I, or a friendly ally, make a study of how such a sys-\ntem would actually operate, my suggestion will not get into \"the\nmainstream.\"* I think that this is right. The FCC is rather like a\nwhale stranded on the seashore, waiting while the local inhabitants,\nignorant of whale anatomy, try to show it the direction in which it\nshould swim.

The broadcasting system in the\nUnited States is likely to continue as a decentralized system, operated\nin the main by private enterprise. What programs will be broadcast\nwill therefore be determined by the economics of the industry. Put\nshortly, the programs that will be broadcast will be those that it is\nmost profitable to broadcast. I would not wish to argue that all the\nbusinessmen consider is money. A television station operator earning\n200 percent per annum (after taxes), if he had been grasping and less\naware of the finer things, might no doubt have earned 210 percent per\nannum.

Quite\nthe contrary.

At that time he argued that\nthere is an inherent bias in the workings of the competitive market\nprocess against so-called **minority\" needs and tastes and that, in fact,\nthe increasing importance of scale economies has resulted in *a ten-\ndency of producers in an increasing number of fields to play safe and\nnot to risk imaginative innovations in the new products, services and\npublications they put on the market. . . .\"* Indeed, Scitovsky indicated\nthat, at worst, this tendency \"can lead to a serious misreading of the\npublic taste and the imposition of a mythical majority taste that in\nfact few people have.\"? He gave as a prime example of such an occur-\nrence the auto industry's presumed error in traditionally diagnosing\nthe public as having a yearning for larger and more powerful cars, a\nview discovered to be erroneous only through the miraculous interven-\ntion of foreign competition!\n\nIn fact, of course, as we know from the experience of the past four\nyears, Professor Scitovsky's view of the public's desires, colored no\ndoubt by his own attitude toward size and power of cars, has proved to\nbe largely erroneous, and any preference by the public for small cars\nhas proved to be mostly a passing fancy\u2014a view advanced by William\nBaumol at the same 1961 meeting.\n\nThere is overwhelming evidence that the view that television com-\n\n'' Tibor Scitovsky, \"On the Principle of Consumers!

It has been able to satisfy\nmany of them. But two demands have created what has become a\nperennial source of tension because they propose somewhat conflicting\nobjectives. One demand has been for \"more significant and more diver-\nsified\" programming. The second has simply been for the availability\nof more \"choice\" within the existing framework of program offerings.\n\nGenerally, the first demand has been based on the view that an\ninsufficient fraction of television programming has been of high quality\nor of high purpose, or conversely that too large a fraction has been of\nmediocre caliber aiming at the lowest common denominator among the\npublic in order to yield the largest size of audience. Put another way,\ntoo little television time has been devoted to serious drama, serious\nmusic, ballet, art, etc., and too much to light entertainment that simply\namuses or entertains\u2014but does not edify or challenge or uplift. These\ncriticisms, for shorthand purposes, have often been summed up as\ncharging a lack of diversity in television programming.\n\nThe conventional answer to this criticism has been that the public\nchooses its programs freely and that broadcasters simply respond to\nconsumer choice; that is, the public gets the kind of programming it\ndesires. But to this answer, three kinds of response have been made.\n\nFirst, and at the most naive level, has been the claim that television\nprogramming has simply not met the desires of the bulk of the Ameri-\ncan public; in other words, that the broadcasters have simply misun-\nderstood consumer demands.\n\nA second response is the assertion that while commercial television\nprogramming may satisfy a majority of the public, a large minority of\nthe American public is vastly dissatisfied.\n\nA third and more sophisticated level of criticism argues that, while a\nmajority of the public may be satisfied with television fare, they are\nnot really very satisfied. In fact, the peculiarities of this particular\nmarket, it has been argued, are such that competition leads not to opti-\nmum response to consumer desires but rather to the acceptance by the\nconsumer of a kind of second best. As a consequence, so the argument\ngoes, only a small minority of television viewers are really getting\nwhat they most want.\n", "By Davip M.

Second, the department would help to eliminate use-\nless duplication and to promote a better allocation of scientific man-\npower. Third, it would constitute a policy link between Congress and\nthe President. The proposal has been opposed by the scientific com-\nmunity, for what seem to be good reasons. The 1958 Parliament of\nScience (and numerous scientists who testified) opposed the proposal\nbecause they feared further centralization and because it seemed ad-\nministratively and politically unwise. Since the agencies that would be\nmerged have great status and importance, the department might well\nbe torn by intramural dissension.

Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, my assignment was to provide a general introduction\nto some of the major issues in national science policy. In attempting to\nfulfill this task, I have touched on a wide variety of questions concern-\ning the allocation of R. and D resources within the public sector, the\nsupport of civilian industrial technology, government procurement pol-\nicies, the patent system, military development strategy and organiza-\ntion, the spillover from military and space R and D to civilian technol-\nogy, the size, allocation, and effects of federal support of basic re-\nsearch, the geographical and institutional distribution of R and D ex-\npenditures, and the organization of federal science policy making.\n\nThese questions vary considerably with regard to the contribution\nthat economics presently can make to their solution. With regard to\nmany of the major issues concerning basic research, economics has\nvery little to say. As one moves toward the development end of the R\nand D spectrum, economics becomes more useful, but it still has only a\nlimited contribution to make. In another paper;?* I have indicated the\nspecific kinds of economic research that I believe are particularly\nneeded. Broadly speaking, work is needed to develop better measures\nof the rate of technical change, to develop better models to character-\nize technical change, to obtain more meaningful breakdowns of R and\nD, to investigate the sources of invention; to study the motivation\n\n?

With regard to feder-\nal expenditures on academic research, how should we go about this\nprocess of equalization? For a number of reasons, it would seem un-\nwise to allocate research funds on a quota system based on regional\nstudent enrollment (or something similar), or to spread most of the\navailable funds over a large number of minor universities, or to move\nfrom a system emphasizing project grants to one emphasizing institu-\ntional development grants.** Contrary to the expectations of some, it\nsimply is impossible to establish fifty or a hundred universities that are\nfirst-rate in most major scientific fields in the short run, and there is a\ndanger that in trying to do so, we may seriously weaken the relatively\nfew that presently are excellent in most such fields. The others should\nbe encouraged to attempt to excel in only a few areas and to broaden\ntheir scope gradually.*\n\nVI. A Department of Science\n\nFinally, I turn to an issue regarding the organization of scientific\npolicy making in the federal government. In recent years, there have\nbeen proposals of a cabinet-level Department of Science, which would\ninclude the AEC, NASA, NSF, the basic research activities of the\nDOD, the National Bureau of Standards, the Office of Technical Ser-\nvices, the Patent Office, and part of the Smithsonian Institution. Advo-\ncates of a Department of Science, led by then Senator Humphrey, ad-\nvanced the following arguments in its favor. First, the secretary of\nsuch a department, because of his cabinet rank, would assure greater\n\nSubcommittee on Science, Research, and Development of the Committee on Science and\nAstronautics, U.S. House of Representatives, 82nd Cong., 2nd sess.\n\n?In Congres, the Daddario Subcommittee, the Elliot Committee, and the Reuss\nSubcommittee have argued for a more even distribution of funds. See the House Com-\nmittee on Science and Astronautics [52], the House Select Committee on Government\nResearch [51], and the House Committee on Government Operations [50]. Previously,\nthe President's Science Advisory Committee and the National Academy of Sciences recom-\nmended a policy of increasing the number of academic centers of excellence. See [41]\nand [30]. It has become customary for people interested in science policy to distinguish\nbetween \"big science,\" where research is very expensive because of high equipment costs,\nand 'little science,\" where support is given individual investigators and does not involve\nlarge capital costs. The political attention focused on the location of big science facilities\nis evidenced by the tremendous competition among states and cities for the proposed\n200 BEV Accelerator.\n\n? See Science, Sept. 24, 1965, pp. 1483-85.\n\n? See Hornig [14]; the hearings before the Subcommittee on Science, Research, and\nDevelopment of the Committee on Science and Astronautics, U.S. House of Representa-\ntives, 82nd Cong., 2nd sess.; this Subcommittee's report, Higher Education in the United\nStates, 1965; and Leland Haworth's statement in the Fourteenth Annual Report of the\nNSF, 1965.

Unfortunately, as their authors are aware, these studies\nsuffer from the fact that the available data completely overlook the\ncrucial differences in quality among scientists and engineers, and that\nthe models oversimplify the relationships between teaching and R and\nD.^ Also, there has been a great deal of criticism leveled at the effects\nof federal research grants and contracts on the quality of undergradu-\nate education. For example, the Reuss Subcommittee [50] claims that\nfederal research programs *have harmed scientific higher education by\nexcessively diverting scientific manpower from teaching, and by over-\nemphasizing research to the detriment of teaching. . . .\" (1t claims,\ntoo, that an important imbalance has developed between the natural\nSciences, on the one hand, and the social sciences and humanities, on\nthe other.'^) Because it is so difficult to measure the quality of under-\ngraduate education, it is difficult to know how seriously to take these\ncriticisms. Although the Subcommittee seems to think that the adverse\neffects of government research are borne out by the published testimo-\nny of university professors and administrators, a close examination of\nthis testimony shows that a great many of the respondents do not\nagree with this conclusion. The Subcommittee report seems to oversim-\nplify the situation.\"\n\nStill another set of policy issues that has attracted considerable at-\ntention concerns the distribution of federal R. and D spending.

Judging from the June, 1965, report, Responses from the Academic and Other Interested\nCommunities to an. Inquiry by the Research and. Technical Programs Subcommittee of\nthe Committce on. Goverament Operations, the number of respondents that felt that\nfederal research programs have not had a deleterious effect was about equal to the num-\nber that felt that they have. For some other discussions of the effects of government re-\nsearch grants and contracts on higher education, see the National Academy of Sciences\n[30], Orlans [39], and Kidd [17]. Of course, one important consideration in this area has\nbeen fear of federal control of education. At this point, we should also note that there\nhas been considerable discussion of the adequacy of the allowances for the indirect costs\narising from government research grants to universities, Many observers claim that\nthe imposition of a flat percentage limitation on the payment of indirect costs has been\ninequitable and has resulted in a drain on university funds. See Government and Science,\nStudy No. 5 of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics [52], as well as the\ncorresponding hearings before the Committee. Finally, problems in government-university\nrelationships have sometimes arisen because of loyalty requirements, security measures, and\nclassified research on campus.\n\nP See Government and Science, Study No. 4 of the House Committee on Science and\nAstronautics [52], as well as the hearings before the Daddario Subcommittee; ie. the\n"], "8": ["V. Basic Research and Higher Education\n\nConsider next the important area of basic research, where the Na-\ntional Science Foundation plays a key role, although its expenditures\non basic research are \u00edar less than the major mission-oriented agencies.\nIt is generally agreed that the government should support basic re-\nsearch, but there is considerable uncertainty in Congress and elsewhere\nregarding the optimal amount of this support and its allocation among\nscientific fields. These are perhaps the most difficult science-policy\nproblems. Formally, the government should push its expenditures to\nthe point where the marginal social benefits from various kinds of\nbasic research equal the marginal social benefits from the relevant\nresources in alternative uses. However, this rule, which is hard enough\nto apply in the case of applied research and development, is practically\nuseless in the case of basic research, because its benefits are so difficult\nto predict. Faced with this enormously complex problem, the House\nCommittee on Science and Astronautics recently asked the advice of a\ndistinguished panel of the National Academy of Sciences. As one\nwould expect, the panel's recommendations generally are based on cri-\nteria, like scientific merit, that are no more quantifiable than marginal\nsocial benefits. Where they are quantifiable, they usually amount to a\nplea for the maintenance of the s/a?4s qwo\u2014or a simple upward ex-\ntrapolation of expenditures for basic research.??\n\nA related set of issues is concerned with the effects of federal R and\nD expenditures on higher education. These expenditures, as well as\nother policies of federal agencies, clearly influence the allocation of\nscientific and engineering effort between teaching, on the one hand, and\napplied research and development, on the other.* Machlup [21] and\nothers have pointed out that applied programs, like NASA's, compete\nwith teaching for scarce scientific and engineering talent, and that in-\ncreases in these applied programs can be dangerous if, by curtailing\nthe supply of teachers, they reduce excessively the rate of increase of\nthe supply of scientists and engineers. Studies have been made of the\n\n?'The controversy over the treatment of these patent rights has received considerable\nattention. What little evidence we have suggests that this issue may not be as important\nas some, like Senator Long, would have us believe, but it is not entirely negligible. See\nLeontief [20], Preston [42], and Watson, Bright, and Burns [56].\n\n? See National Academy of Sciences [29], particularly the papers by Brooks, Johnson,\nKaysen, Kistiakowsky, and Weinberg. This volume, which reflects the thinking of some\nof the country's most distinguished scientists, contains a great deal of important and\nuseful material. However, the assignment is close to an impossible one. For other rele-\nvant studies, see the Wooldridge report [37] and the recent National Academy study\nof chemistry.\n\n^ For simplicity, I lump basic research with teaching. Of course, there is a strong com-\nplementary between basic research and teaching, the importance of which is pointed out\nby Machlup [21] and the President's Science Advisory Committee [41].\n", "THE ECONOMICS OF SCIENCE POLICY 483\n\nthe treatment of patent rights to inventions made under government pro-\ncurement contracts.\"*\n"], "7": ["482 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nThird, there has been considerable discussion concerning the types\nof contractual arrangements used in military R and D. Until a few\nyears ago, these contracts were cost plus fixed fee, this kind of contract\nbeing defended on the ground that the *product\" was so unpredictable\nthat the risks to the seller would require a very high fixed price if it\nwere feasible at all. Recognizing that there is little incentive to reduce\ncosts in CPFF contracts, the DOD has begun to switch to incentive\ncontracts in the past few years. Since they reward cost reduction by\ngiving the firm a certain percentage of the difference between its actual\ncosts and the negotiated target costs, incentive contracts are likely to\nlead to greater efficiency than CPFF contracts, if the target costs are\nthe same. However, many observers challenge the assumption that the\ntarget costs are the same, pointing out that the contractor, with consid-\nerable advantages in the negotiation of target costs, has more incentive\nto increase these costs under incentive contracts.^?\n\nFourth, there has been considerable controversy over the extent of\nthe \"spillover\" from military and space R and D to civilian technol-\nogy, this topic being of considerable importance because of its implica-\ntions regarding the extent to which civilian technology has been\ndrained of scientists and engineers by the defense and space programs.\nAlthough it is very difficult to measure, there seems to be a widespread\nfeeling that the spillover per dollar of R and D is unlikely to be as great\nas in the past, because the capabilities that are being developed and the\nenvironment that is being probed are less intimately connected with\ncivilian activities than formerly was the case. Consequently, there has\nbeen some discussion of ways in which spillover can be increased, and\nNASA in particular has established a number of programs to try to\nmatch up its inventions with civilian industrial uses. The extent to which\nthese programs have been successful is by no means clear.?' Of course,\nthis spillover question is related in various ways to the controversy over\n\n? Note four things. First, the use of CPFF contracts tended to encourage the stockpil-\ning of engineers and scientists by contractors. Second, the Secretary of Defense has\nclaimed that at least ten cents is saved for each dollar shifted from CPFF to incentive\ncontracts. (See DOD Cost Reduction Program\u2014Second Annual Progress Report.) Third,\nat least one observer claims that incentive contracts may increase the likelihood of con-\ntracts being given to relatively inefficient firms.

Programs have been started by NASA at the Midwest Research Institute, the Univer-\nsity of Indiana, the University of Maryland, and elsewhere. The Midwest Research Insti-\ntute receives information on technical developments that have been used in the space\nprogram, evaluates them in terms of industrial applicability and then holds industrial\nbriefings to communicate the results to industry. The Aerospace Research Applications\nCenter at the University of Indiana stores all technical reports of the Space Agency in\na computer facility, and provides this computerized data to the thirty industrial firms par-\nticipating in its program. Members of the Center's staff learn what a participant's tech-\nnical needs are by having him provide a \"profile of technical interests,\" then attempting\nto retrieve pertinent information.

First, there has been a debate over military develop-\nment strategy, Cherington [4] and others defending the so-called *sys-\ntems approach\" to development, Klein [18], Kaysen [16] and others\nattacking it. The systems approach, which in the past has been central\nto the way the services conducted the procurement of new weapons, is\ncharacterized by great emphasis on integrating initially the design of\nvarious components and on planning from the beginning the various\nsteps that must be carried out and the sequencing of these steps which\nwill minimize delay. Its critics argue that this approach is inefficient\nbecause, although something like the scheduled completion dates may\nbe met, costs tend to be very high and performance characteristics\ntend to be sacrificed. They believe that requirements for systems\nshould be stated initially in broad terms, that flexibility should be\nmaintained, that parallel approaches should be taken to difficult prob-\nlems, that components should be tested as soon as possible, and that\nthe integration of the system should be postponed until the major un-\ncertainties have been reduced substantially. There is evidence that the\nDOD and the services underestimated the relevant uncertainties dur-\ning the 1950's. Recently they seem to have recognized more fully the\ndangers involved in proceeding with the full system design before the\ninitial uncertainties are reduced.'\n\nSecond, there has been a debate over the organization of military R\nand D. Some have argued that, to a greater extent, research and de-\nvelopment should be divorced from production and performed in non-\nprofit research institutes and government laboratories, which in their\nview are better suited than business firms to carry out this task. If de-\nvelopment can be separated from production, it would be possible to\nreap the benefits from competition at the development stage and from\n& freer choice of suppliers and contract instruments at the production\nstage. \u00c0 fundamental consideration in judging this proposal is the cost\ninvolved in separating development from production. It is sometimes\nargued that these costs are high, because there is considerable overlap\nand similarity between these two functions and because learning is\ntransferred between them. We need much better extimates of these\ncosts.\"\n\n?' See Cherington [5], Dupre [7], Kaysen [16], Moore [28], and Peck and Scherer [40].\n\n? Also, see Klein [19], Dupre [7], Glennan [11], and Peck and Scherer [40]. Note\nthat both Klein and Kaysen favor more R and D that is outside the major weapons-\nsystems programs.\n\n?See Kaysen [16] and Cherington [4].

Research and Development in the\nDepartment of Defense\n\nConsider next the Department of Defense, which accounts for over\nhalf of the federal R and D budget. To understand many of the issues\nregarding the organization and management of military R and D, one\nmust recognize that the relationships between the federal government\nand the weapons producers differ considerably from those in an ordi-\nnary market. In many cases, the seller's products\u2014aircraft, missiles,\netc.\u2014are sold almost entirely to the government and have no civilian\nmarkets, much of the seller's capital is provided by the government,\nand the government has agents involved in the managerial and oper-\nating structure of the seller's organization.

Also, state and local govern-\nments may be stimulated to apply new technologies by demonstrations\nof their successful use in federal programs.\"\n\nThird, turning to the patent system, delayed examination has some\nimportant advantages. Under a delayed examination system, an appli-\ncation is first examined only as to formal matters. After a prior art\nsearch, the application together with the results of the search is pub-\nlished as a provisional patent. A further examination is made as to\nnovelty and invention only if certain fees are paid by an interested\nparty within a certain period of time; and if full examination is not\nrequested within this period, the patent will lapse. Since the invention\nis published more rapidly than under the present system, the technical\ninformation embodied in the patent will be disseminated more quickly.\nThis is socially desirable, though not always beneficial to the inventor.\nMoreover, since a provisional patent should be enough for defensive\npurposes, the delayed examination system should relieve the Patent\nOffice of the burden of giving these applications a full examination,\nthus helping to reduce the long delay in issuing patents.!*\n"], "4": ["THE ECONOMICS OF SCIENCE POLICY 479\n\nindustries composed of many small firms have invested \u00edar too little in\nR and D, that the areas between basic research\" and \"product de-\nvelopment\" have been neglected, and that too little has been spent on\nlarge \"systems\" development projects because of the narrowness of the\ntechnical interests of particular firms.'? Also, there are questions re-\ngarding the patent system. Although no serious attempt is being made\nto abolish the system or to change it radically, there is considerable\ninterest in such technical issues as whether or not it would be desirable\nto adopt a delayed examination system, like that instituted recently by\nthe Dutch. Interest in changes of this sort helped lead to the creation\nthis year of a Presidential Commission on the Patent System.'?\n\nWithout pretending to answer these questions, I think that the fol-\nlowing points should be noted. First, the arguments presented in Sec-\ntion II do not tell us whether current government R and D expendi-\ntures in particular areas are too large or too small. Although they sug-\ngest that the government or some other organization not motivated by\nprofit should support some R and D, the optimal amount may be\nsmaller or larger than that currently supported by the government.\nSince we cannot estimate the social returns from additional R and D\nof various sorts at all accurately, it seems sensible to view the relevant\npolicy problems in the context of the theory of sequential decision\nmaking under uncertainty. To the extent possible, programs designed\nto change the amount of R and D in particular parts of the public or\nprivate sectors, if initiated at all, should be begun on a small scale and\norganized so as to provide data regarding the returns from a larger\nprogram. Of course, this approach does not eliminate the need for bet-\nter measures of the returns from R and D. On the contrary, without\nsuch measures, the sequential approach will be of little use because\nthere will be no reliable way of measuring the returns from small-scale\nprograms. Until better measures are developed, the crude measures\nthat are currently available will have to be used instead.!*\n\nSecond, an alternative way in which the federal government might\ntry to encourage innovation in civilian markets is through its procure-\nment policies, one possible device being performance-based federal\nprocurement. Its proponents claim that, by formulating performance\ncriteria rather than physical specifications for the items it purchases,\nthe federal government will free industry to innovate, limited only by\n\npeacetime atomic energy, and perhaps public health, it is likely that we are relying too\nmuch on private incentives as stimulated by the market to generate R and D relevant\nto the public sector. . . .\" In connection with urban transportation, note that the High\nSpeed Ground Transportation Act of 1965 authorized $64 million for research on high-\nspeed ground transportation.\n\n?

Federal Support of Nondefense Technology\n\nTo carry out existing programs, the federal government spends\nabout $15 billions per year on research and development.* Excluding\nthe Defense Department, over 80 percent of the expenditures are made\nby NASA, AEC, and NIH, each of which attempts to provide strong\nsupport for a particular area of technology: space exploration, atomic\nenergy, and health. These areas tend to lie close to the public sector,\natomic energy and space exploration having military and cold-war\nsignificance and requiring sums that would not possibly be forthcom-\ning from the private sector. Besides these huge programs, there are\nsmaller ones that support R and D in agricultural techniques, weather\nforecasting, coal utilization, desalinization methods, and many other\nareas.' In addition, there have been proposals to aid civilian industrial\ntechnology which, according to some, is hampered by an underinvest-\nment by some industries in R and D.? In 1963, the Department of\nCommerce submitted a civilian industrial technology program to Con-\ngress, but met with little success. Industrial groups opposed the bill\nbecause they feared that government sponsorship of industrial R and\nD could upset existing competitive relationships. In 1965, one element\nof the program, the State Technical Services Act, was passed by Con-\ngress.

Then, after discussing various issues concerning nondefense tech-\nnology, it takes up the management and organization of military re-\nsearch and development. Finally, it discusses some issues concerning\nbasic research and higher education, as well as the organization of\nscientific policy making in the federal government.\n\nIL Research and Development in a Competitive Economy\n\nTo begin with, three elementary, but important, points should be\nnoted regarding the allocation of resources to the production of knowl-\nedge in a perfectly competitive economy. First, unless some R and D is\nsupported by the government or some other organization not motivat-\ned by profit, less R and D is likely to be generated than is socially de-\nsirable, the deficiency being particularly acute in the case of basic re-\nsearch. There are considerable discrepancies between the private and\nsocial benefits of R. and D, the results of research often being of little\ndirect value to the sponsoring firm but of great value to other firms.\nMoreover, if firms are risk averters, the investment in risky activities\nlike R and D is likely to fall short of the social optimum.? Second, the\nincentive to keep research findings secret produces results that are eco-\nnomically inefficient in a static sense. Since knowledge, once produced,\nhas a dissemination cost of essentially zero, it is socially optimal for it\nto be disseminated free of charge. However, if it is disseminated free\nof charge, there is no reward for the knowledge producer, even though\nthe social benefits of the new knowledge are more than sufficient to\ncover his costs. Thus, the incentive for firms to create new knowledge\nis reduced, and there may be a conflict between static and dynamic\nefficiency. The patent system is an attempt to deal with this situation.*\n\"Third, although a free enterprise system may not result in an optimal\nallocation of resources to R. and D, some aspects of the competitive\nprocess are still desirable. In particular, if the uncertainties involved in\na project are very great initially and if they diminish substantially as a\nproject proceeds, the optimal strategy may be to run in parallel several\n\"competitive\" projects designed to serve the same end. Although this\nmay seem to involve needless and wasteful duplication, it is often the\ncheapest way to proceed.*\n\n* For elaboration of these points, see Nelson [32] and Arrow [3]. Note that this argu-\nment assumes perfect competition and no support of R and D by private foundations\nand governments. If these assumptions do not hold, there is no assurance that the con-\nclusion does either. See Sections III and V.\n\n*See Leontief [20], Usher [55], Nelson [32], Arrow [3], and Mansfield [25].\n\n*See Nelson [34] and Hitch [13].

Introduction\n\nIn the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the\namount of attention devoted to national science policy.' Congressional\ncommittees, scientific panels, and other groups have spent a consider-\nable amount of time trying to determine the proper role of the federal\ngovernment in the support and management of the nation's scientific\nenterprise, the strengthening of its basic science, and the evaluation\nand selection of substantive scientific programs. Several factors ac-\ncount for the increased concern. First, because of higher costs of scien-\ntific research and considerable growth in the amount of research car-\nried out, federal R. and D expenditures are now large enough to be po-\nlitically visible. Second, the rapid expansion in the federal science bud-\nget seems to be coming to an end, and problems of choice are harder to\navoid than in the past.

And the question is particu-\nlarly pertinent when the Wall Street Journal reports, as of last week,\nthat the private share in U.S. research and development spending,\nthough still less than 40 percent, has increased slightly over the last\nyear.

The range of modification is limited only by our own imagina-\ntion. The first lesson, therefore, is that we cannot afford to leave the\nimagining to the scientists alone. We have to do it ourselves. Just as\ndefense planners have allowed their imagination to range from weapons\nsystems to family housing units, so nondefense planners must allow\ntheir imagination to range from nuclear power plants to better educa-\ntional systems.\n\nSecond, we are accustomed to asking scientists whether they can\nperform particular tasks for us\u2014to build an intercontinental ballistic\nmissile or to land on the moon. Increasingly, the question now is not\nwhether, but how much will it cost, and what else can we buy for the\nsame amount of money.

The effects of the serious erosion of\ncompetence in our in-house laboratories which we faced in the 1950's\nhave not yet been completely overcome. But the trend has been re-\nversed.\n\nIt is not the expectation of the Defense Department planners that\nthe in-house laboratories will occupy more than a minority role in\ndoing the actual work of research and development for the Depart-\nment. It is rather the view that they will provide continuing special\ncompetence in particularly military specialties.\n\nIt is also felt that contracting for research and development cannot\nbe intelligently administered unless the administrators understand\nwhat they are contracting for.

This\ndetailed breakdown is a further application of the functional budgeting\nand program packaging procedures introduced in the Department in\n1961, and has been essential to the articulation of every aspect of science\npolicy. The analysis that emerges emphasizes that by far the heaviest\nexpenditures are incurred towards the development end of the research\nand development spectrum. In fact, out of the almost $16 billion\nbudgeted by the federal government for research and development in\nfiscal 1966, almost $10 billion goes for development items, and the ratio\nis substantially the same for expenditures by the Department of De-\nfense alone.\n\n'The detailed breakdown also points up the geometric increase in\ncost of any given program as it moves away from the drawing board\ninto the shop. This analysis has in fact encouraged the development of\ndevices like the program definition phase which consciously postpones\nfinal commitment to the procurement of a specific item, in order to\nminimize the cost of later stages. It is a good deal less expensive to\nexplore blind alleys in the laboratory than in the field, and the program\ndefinition phase allows the Department to maintain its options in the\nchoice of weapons at least until those uncertainties that can be resolved\nhave been resolved. In this way we also maintain competition for as long\nas possible throughout the initial phases of a project.\n\nAnother major advance was embodied in the 1962 Report to the\nPresident on Government Contracting for Research and Development,\nfamiliarly known as the Bell Report, after its principal author, your\ncolleague, David Bell. The Bell Report took off from the fact that\nmore than 80 percent of federally financed research and development\n\"is conducted today through nonfederal institutions rather than\nthrough direct federal operations,\" and urged the need to continue to\nrely heavily on the entire range of private institutions, universities,\nnonprofit entities and profit-making industrial corporations available\nto perform this work. It argued that the character of the private insti-\ntution, whether profit or nonprofit, should not affect the choice of a\nparticular contractor to perform a particular task. And it identified the\ntroublesome conflict of interest problems that arise when a research\nand development contractor also undertakes production responsibil-\nities, so that he may be preparing specifications for a proposal on which\nhe will later want to bid for production.

The sum total of productive scientific effort was thus reduced\nas a result of unnecessarily duplicative entrepreneurship.\n\nOn the in-house side, technical ability was too often wasted. In at\nleast one instance, scientists employed in in-house laboratories of the\nDepartment had their minds taken off their complaints that the most\nchallenging research tasks were assigned away from them, by the dis-\ntraction of having to do the janitor work in their own laboratories\u2014\nand their efforts to communicate with their colleagues in the outer\nworld were frustrated by the fact that the local base commander would\nnot deliver their mail unless they informed their correspondents in ad-\nvance of the internal code numbers required by the base post office.\n\nAt the same time the Department was engaged in a largely theologi-\ncal argument with defense industry about the nature of certain\nnonprofit entities, created with substantial initial injections of public\nfunds (not unlike their profit-making counterparts), and whether these\nentities were uniquely qualified to do certain kinds of research and de-\nvelopment work, and disqualified from doing other kinds.\n\nI do not mean to suggest by using the imperfect tense in the preced-\ning paragraphs that all is now perfection, or that more than a fair be-\nginning has been made in resolving these paradoxes in our official be-\nhavior.\n\nBut we have made a beginning.

We have broadened the range of\noutside organizations from which we can buy these services. And we\nare improving the quality of our own people on whom we depend for\nadvice about what to buy and how to buy it.\n\nAn awareness of a scarcity of scientific and engineering manpower\nresources has been a major factor in revamping contract procedures\nfor the procurement of new weapons systems. The program definition\nphase has been instituted, during which the rival claims of competing\ncontractors can be tested by more rigorous means than an examination\nof their sales presentations. During this phase, competing contractors\npursue alternative paths towards defining the development effort to be\nundertaken in the next phase and identifying more precisely the design\nspecifications for the end product. Finally, they submit a bid contain-\ning cost estimates for development and procurement. The cost-plus in-\ncentive fee contract has been adapted for use even in exploratory con-\ntracts where assembly line production is a long way off.

But only that proportion of the investigator's\nsalary which is equivalent to the proportion of time spent working on the research proj-\nect is considered an allowable direct cost. The effect of this requirement is offset to some\nextent by the fact that many graduate students are employed as research assistants on\nNIH-supported research projects and the portion of the investigator's time devoted to\ndirecting the efforts of these students is chargeable as a research cost.

Similarly the decline in the feedback into higher education\nafter 1959 probably arose in part from the expansion of research pro-\ngrams in industry and the federal government resulting from the space\nprogram. It would seem desirable for the federal science agencies to\nexercise this influence in a more systematic fashion, paying closer at-\ntention to the interrelations of their separate policies and to the long-\nterm consequences of their policies. There are a number of policy ad-\njustments which could contribute to this end without either basically\naltering the pluralist pattern of science support, disrupting the intri-\ncate doctorate producing system, or leading to unacceptable govern-\nment controls over science.\n\nOne possibility is a program of teaching and research fellowships\nwhich would either supplement or supplant present postdoctoral fel-\nlowship programs.\" The relative numbers of teaching and research\nawards could be varied according to an assessment of the desirability\nof increasing the number of teaching or research scientists at that\ntime.?

The\nevidence is not sufficiently clear to permit a very satisfactory evalua-\ntion of such arguments. Extensive government support of research in\nsome ways has undoubtedly strengthened higher education. Federal\nresearch funds to colleges and universities have likely enhanced the\nattractiveness of a teaching career and in many cases probably have\nimproved the quality of graduate education by providing graduate stu-\ndents an opportunity to gain research experience.\n\nYet there may be some reason to fear the long-term consequences of\npresent policies. As the moon venture comes to maturity, for example,\na strain may be put on the supply of scientific talent available for em-\nployment in colleges and universities.? While the prestigious national\nuniversity centers will probably have little difficulty in attracting\npromising new scientists as teachers, the liberal arts colleges and the\nlesser-known universities, especially those in certain sections of the\ncountry, could encounter substantial difficulties in attracting teaching\nscientists. This could have an adverse effect on the educational process\non the theory that the national university centers depend on infusions\nof talent from the secondary institutions, and a weakening of any part\nof the system could ultimately offset the health of the system as a whole.\nOf course, it is not only federal research support programs that might\nhave an importance influence on the quality of education. Some univer-\nsities, in an effort to upgrade their academic status, may overemphasize\nresearch relative to teaching. These factors, in any case, point toward\nthe need to consider seriously how our society can assure the continued\nvitality of the educational system at a time when ever increasing de-\nmands are placed on scarce scientific manpower resources.\n\nPolicy Initiatives. Present policies of federal agencies primarily re-\nsponsible for science policy clearly have some influence over both the\ninitial career choices of scientists and the distribution of scientific effort\nbetween teaching and research in academic institutions.

Another interesting\nimplication of the analysis is the importance to be inferred for the edu-\ncational function.

Some Possible Implications for Science Policy\n\nThe Switching Character of the Analytic Results. A first point that\nmerits reflection is the switching nature of the analytic results. The de-\nsired objectives are best achieved by allocating either a maximum or a\nminimum proportion of new scientists to teaching, possibly switching\none or more times between extreme values. This notion will hardly be\nsurprising to economists familiar with unbalanced growth and turnpike\ntheorems. It might, however, appear rather novel to policy-makers and\nobservers of science policy who have often considered balance and gra-\ndualism important components of science policy. But the notion of\npronounced shifts in policy actually has some intuitive appeal. Science,\nlike national economies, often advances in an unbalanced pattern,\nmaking rapid strides first in some sectors and then in others. A high\ndegree of flexibility and responsiveness to changing needs may there-\nfore be an important requirement for science policy.\n\nIn particular, we may need a high degree of flexibility among the in-\nstitutions chiefly responsible for the nation's scientific effort. Adminis-\ntrative agencies must be flexible enough to \"shift gears\" quickly and to\nmake appropriate changes in their policies and procedures. A research\norganization established for a specific mission, for example, might have\nto be disestablished promptly once its mission was fulfilled. Such a\nflexibility does not generally exist in the conduct and management of\nthe nation's scientific effort: organizations and programs once estab-\nlished tenaciously cling to life even though their original mission may\nhave been completed; institutional policies and procedures tend to\ngenerate an inertia which makes innovation difficult; and institutional\npolicies make career patterns in many fields of science somewhat\ninflexible.

Such midcareer changes may be of considerable importance\nfor certain disciplines in which scientists reach their creative peaks at\nan early age, leading in some cases to initial careers in research fol-\nlowed by careers in teaching.

It would be desirable to consider\nfiner distinctions and other sectors, such as undergraduate versus grad-\nuate teaching, basic versus applied research, and administration.

These considerations suggest that the private rewards for\nteachers relative to those for researchers may fail to represent the so-\ncial benefit of teaching relative to research. Thus the free market may\nfail to allocate skills properly between teaching and research.*\n\nSecond, it is assumed that the amount of effort devoted to teaching\nand research can be measured by the number of (full-time equivalent)\nteaching and research scientists, respectively. Because of wide dispari-\nties in teaching and research abilities, this assumption must be viewed\nas no more than a first approximation.?\n\nThird, it is assumed that the policy objective can be represented as\nthe maximization of welfare and that the welfare function is composed\nof two terms, indicating its dependence both on the number of research\nand teaching scientists at some future date and on research and teaching\nscientists and on time during the intermediate period of time between\nthe present and future date. Mathematically the welfare function is of\nthe form:\n", "496\n"], "2": ["II. Objectives of Science Policy\n\nA critical and most difficult aspect of analyzing science policy is the\nspecification of operational policy objectives. The National Science\n\n*In 1960 there were 130,000 scientists primarily employed by colleges and universities\nbut only 62,000 full-time equivalent teaching scientists according to the National Science\nFoundation, Profiles of Manpower in Science and Technology (NSF 63-23, Washington,\nD.C., 1963), p. 23.\n\n5 As a recent picturesque formulation put it: \"Teaching and research are like sin and\nconfession\u2014if you don't do some of the one you don't have anything to talk about in\nthe other.\" Soviet planners seem to have learned this lesson the hard way. An extreme\ncompartmentalization of teaching and research, instituted after the Bolshevik revolution,\nwas gradually seen to be detrimental to both the quality of higher education and to the\nproductivity of the research effort.

Introduction\n\nThe allocation of scientific effort has recently become a subject of\nconcern to both policy-makers and economists. For the policy-maker\nthe substantial public expenditures on *big science\" have led to\ndifficult choices in the allocation of scientific effort.! For the economist\nit has become clear that there is an important relationship between\nscientific and technological progress and economic growth.* The result\nfor the scientific community is that it can no longer be regarded as an\nautonomous enclave, insulated from the larger social and economic con-\ntext, but must operate within a general framework of public account-\nability.\n\nThe allocation of resources to science presents the policy-maker and\neconomist with a multitude of problems of choice, including the alloca-\ntion of public funds among various fields of scientific activity and var-\nious projects and the choice of which institutions to support, in what\nways, and with what regard for various patterns of interaction among\ndifferent institutions. Of central importance, also, are questions of the\nallocation of trained scientists among di\u00edferent scientific careers and\nvarious projects and institutions.\n\n\"This paper analyzes one aspect of the problem of scientific choice:\nthe allocation of new scientists between teaching and research careers.\nIn particular we are concerned with the \"feedback\" of science docto-\nrates into higher education. There may be a danger of either seriously\nweakening the educational process or \"starving\" nonacademic scien-\ntific endeavor by an improper allocation between scientific careers.\nThe aim of this study is to provide a conceptual framework for analyz-\ning this problem: by considering some simplified objectives of a\nscience policy, developing a model for the allocation of new scientists,\nidentifying preferred allocations in the light of the objectives and the\n\n?

Additional refinement of categories is desirable and would\nbe particularly fruitful in the $9.54 million category described as *'uni-\nversity-based economic resarch not listed elsewhere.\"\n\nThe paper should not omit at least passing mention of the impor-\ntance of other foundations in the support of economic research. Foun-\ndation News through 1965 records sixty-one foundations that made at\nleast one grant to economics or business. Of these each of eleven made\ngrants totaling $100,000 or more. This is probably a minimum esti-\nmate because, as shown above, grant listings are not complete.\n\nWhile I won't attempt to demonstrate it empirically, I would predict\nthat grants from the other large foundations that support economics\nand business have relatively greater research content than was found\nfor Ford. If so, then their share of the support of economic research is\nhigher than their one-third or lower share of general economics and\nbusiness grants reported earlier.\n\nThe distribution of large foundation support for the National Bu-\nreau of Economic Research tends to support this view. In the period\n1957-64 it received $4.92 million in grants from seven large founda-\ntions. Of this grants from the six foundations other than Ford amount-\ned to $2.05 million, or 42 percent of the total. Were a parallel exami-\nnation made of Brookings! economic studies I suspect that one might\nfind a similar pattern.\n\nI suppose that if this paper has shown anything, it is that we as yet\nhave only the most imprecise notions of the size and direction of foun-\ndation support for economic research. It has also shown that decisions\nhave been made and will continue to be made which cannot help but\nhave significant effects on foundation spending on economics in a peri-\nod of rapid growth in foundation activities in all fields.

Further, I fully admit that\nmy ratings must reflect my own preconceptions. I have tried to avoid\ndefining economic research as being \"that which researching econo-\nmists do.\" Beyond this, however, the classification has been guided by\nno very consistent application of taxonomic principles.\n\nThe table is largely self-explanatory and suggests that only a minor-\nity of grants went to the direct support of 'hard-core economic re-\nsearch,\" however one may wish to define it. Even on a relatively broad\ndefinition, however, I would not be inclined to put the economic re-\nsearch content at more than 30-35 percent.\n\nRather than summarize the table in detail, I shall discuss my rea-\nsons for making several of what were in my mind the more uncertain\nassignments. In this I hope that my biases may be made more appar-\nent.\n\nFirst, the assignment of the $12.4 million in grants to Resources for\nthe Future for \"Research and Education in Natural Resources\" to the\n\"moderate proportion\" group. While economics provides its central or-\nientation RFF is necessarily heavily engaged with noneconomic re-\nsearch, particularly with natural resource technology, geology, forestry,\nwater resource development, and the like. A separate large grant for\nresearch and training in urban economics was assigned to the *sub-\nstantial proportion\" group.\n\nThe assignment of the $6.3 million in Brookings grants for \"re-\nsearch, education, and information on public policy issues\" to the\n\"moderate proportion\" group was equally uncertain. In addition to\neconomic studies, Brookings engages in large-scale government and\nforeign policy studies and has a large educational program (albeit one\nwith heavy research orientation). An admittedly hasty review of its\nannual reports left me with the impression that a significant part of its\neconomic studies program was supported by foundations other than\nFord. The large Ford grant for its studies of government finance was\nassigned to the \"high proportion\" group.\n\nThe assignment of \"Research on Finance, Management, Marketing,\nand Organizational Behavior\" to the \"substantial proportion\" group\ninvolved two unequally offsetting judgments. The first and weaker one\nwas that business research only partly carries over into economics. The\nsecond and stronger was based on the fact that the grants were large\ngrants for long-range research to Berkeley, Carnegie Tech, Chicago,\nHarvard, M.I.T., and Stanford, averaging about $900,000 per school.\nThe recipients are among the leaders in the application of mathemat-\nics, economics, and the other behavioral sciences to business. It was\nfelt, therefore, that the grants could have a significant influence on the\ndevelopment of economics.\n", "528\n"], "9": ["TABLE 4\nEcououic ResEARCH CoxTENT or Fogp FouupAzioN EDA Gzaurs, 1957-65\n(Dollar Values in Millions)\n\nAmount o6\n$87.34 100.0\n\nGrants with No Significant Proportion of Economic Research\n\nGraduate Business School Development...................... 7.53 8.6\nStanford Training of Business Teachers from Less Developed\nCountries 3.50 4.0\nGeneral Business Training Not Listed Elsewhere. . 2.67 3.1\nBusiness and Vocational Careers for Negroes 2.30 2.6\nJoint Council on Economic Education\u2014Economic Understanding 2.03 2.3\nEconomic Education for Labor Union Members, Clergy, Foreign\nBusinessmen, and others. ...... lees 0.88 1.0\nNationwide Radio and Television Course in Economics......... 0.83 1.0\n19.74 22.6\nGrants with Moderate Proportion of Economic Research\nResources for the Future\u2014Research and Education in Natural\nResources 12.40 14.2\nBrookings\u2014Research, Education, and Information on Public\nPolicy Issues..........eseeeeee e 6.31 7.2\nGeneral Business Research Not Listed Elsewhere. . . 2.43 2.8\nTraining of Economists from Less Developed Countries. ....... 2.40 2.7\n23.54 27.0\nGrants with Substantial Proportion of Economic Research\nResearch on Finance, Management, Marketing, and Organization-\nal Behavior........s esee enean 5.65 6.5\nBusiness Predoctoral, Di:\nships.......eseeeeesese e emen 5.60 6.4\nWestern Management Science Center 1.30 1.5\nCommission on Money and Credit.. 1.30 1.5\nResources for the Future\u2014Research and Training in Urban\nEconomics......... lessen 0.90 1.0\nApplication of Mathematics to Business 0.88 1.0\nResearch Seminars for Economics Teachers from Liberal Arts\nColleges........ sees nne 0.88 1.0\n16.51 18.9\nGranis with High Proporlion of Economic Research\nUniversity Based Economic Research Not Listed Elsewhere..... 9.54 10.9\nEconomics Predoctoral, Dissertation, and Faculty Research\nFellowships..........sessesseeseee me 3.30 3.8\nNational Bureau of Economic Research. . . 2.87 3.3\nBrookings\u2014National Research Program in Taxation and Public\nExpenditures. ........ssseeeeel essen 2.40 2.7\nEconomic Research T tes Not Listed Elsewhere.... 2.21 2.5\nYale Center for Quantitative Study of National Economies... . 2.00 2.3\nGraduate Workshops and Research Seminars in Economics 1.33 1.5\nRotating Research Professorship in Economics. ............ss. 0.50 0.6\n24.15 27.7\n\nINot Allocated 3.40 8.9\n\n", "23.94\n\n5.65\n5.60\n1.30\n1.30\n\n0.90\n0.88\n\n0.88\n", "$01.95\n\n7.53\n\n3.50\n2.67\n2.30\n2.03\n\n0.88\n0.83\n", "PRODUCTION AND USE OF ECONOMIC KNOWLEDGE\n", "527\n"], "8": ["526 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nessarily the same as the categories under which payments on the grants\nare reported, in cases where payments are scheduled over a number of\nyears. Categories have changed from one year to the next, the changes\nusually reflecting the particular focus of the current year's grants.\nNew classifications frequently were established and the combination of\nold ones was common. \u00c0n example is provided by the five grants, total-\ning $723,000 to Chicago, M.I.T., Princeton, RAND, and Yale for the\nanalysis of economic growth and technology. In 1963, the year the\ngrants were made, they were listed under Economic Growth and\nResources. The 1964 and 1965 payments on the grants, however, were\nreported under Research on Economic Problems. One might speculate\nthat the bumper crop of production functions that these grants nour-\nished caused the Foundation to reclassify the grants. A more likely ex-\nplanation is that new grants in 1964 and 1965 had little economic\ngrowth content and so this was not made a separate category.\n\nIn another direction, the EDA section of the report does not include\nmany significant grants for foreign economic research and reported\nunder Overseas Development. Two examples are the 1960 grant of\n$740,000 to the National Council of Applied Economic Research of\nIndia for \"applied research on economics and management,\" and the\n1958 grant of $269,500 to the University of Bombay for \"teaching and\nresearch in monetary and international economics.\" Unfortunately\ntime did not permit me to examine the extent to which the Overseas\nDevelopment programs may have replaced the \"domestic\" EDA pro-\ngram in the Foundation's total support of economics.\n\nFor these and other reasons the trends in the broad categories at\nbest provide only a very general indication of the changing content of\nthe EDA program. The classification of grants for the year in which\nthey were made was consistent, however, and so Table 3 can be used to\nsummarize trends in the major components of the program.\n\nTo get more directly at the economic research content of the EDA\nprogram, the lists of grants were examined in some detail and an at-\ntempt was made to classify grants by economic research content. Time\ndid not permit a grant-by-grant examination. However, even with more\ntime many of the classifications would have been equivocal. Grant de-\nscriptions in the reports are usually brief and provide only a general\nand often conflicting impression of the economic-vs.-noneconomic,\nbasic-vs.-applied, empirical-vs.-theoretical, and research-vs.-action pro-\ngram content of the grant.\n\nThe range of objectives in the EDA program is wide, however, and\nthis permitted broad classifications of grants on a \"wholesale-lot\"\nbasis. The results of this classification are presented in Table 4, which\nI hasten to label as tentative.

More-\nover, within this category the report mentions six fields of activity,\nonly one of which has predominantly economic content. The six are\nDemocratic Institutions, Problems of Urban Growth, Youth Develop-\nment, Economic Growth, Population Problems, and Private Philan-\nthropy.\n\nFinally, there appears to be some change in the direction of interest\nwithin its economics program. The 1962 statement is less detailed and\nspecific than that of 1950, with no repeat mention made of specific ob-\njectives except the one of stable economic growth with high employ-\nment. Two specific new objectives are mentioned, however:\n\nEconomic Growth: The Foundation will help foster the achievement of a growing\neconomy characterized by high output, the highest possible level of constructive employ-\nment, and a minimum of economic instability. It will help advance fuller utilization of\nhuman resources and the adaptation of technical education and retraining programs to\nmeet the requirements of automation, structural unemployment, migration, and other\nchange. It will seek to assist effort designed to keep the United States economy com-\npetitive and in a position to provide worldwide leadership. It will continue to support\nresearch in economics and business administration.\n\nThe statement suggests that the emphasis might be somewhat more on\napplied and policy research than in the past.\n\nFord's clear de-emphasis of business and economics in words and in\ndeeds raises questions to which economists might give serious thought.\nSome consolation may be derived from the indications that support for\nbasic research and fellowships is to be sustained in some fashion and\nthat the change in policy represents mainly a shaking-down of the\nEDA program. However, the Foundation's statements go well beyond\nthis, and appear to reflect a major demotion of economics in its scale\nof priorities. At the very least this development should stimulate some\nstocktaking by the profession, to which additional clarification by the\nFoundation could constructively contribute.\n\nWhatever the degree to which there will be a Ford in our future, the\nFoundation's support for business and economics in the recent past has\nbeen unprecedented and in some areas possibly decisive. To provide\nsome indication of its direction and effect, I shall examine the content\nof Ford's EDA program from 1957 to the present. The annual reports\ndid not classify grants by subject area until 1957, and time did not\npermit a grant-by-grant classification for earlier years. However, the\nnine years 1957-65 include $87 of the $107 million in grants from 1951\nthrough 1965 and cover the most recent nine of the Foundation's\nfifteen years of activity in these areas.\n\n'The trend in the distribution of EDA grants is given in Table 3.

However, two basic\npolicy reports issued by the Foundation may provide some clues.\n\nIn the Report of the Trustees issued in 1950 the first detailed state-\nment of basic policies and programs was made. Five major areas for\naction were blocked out and economic problems was one of them. The\napproach in economics was described as follows: *The Ford Foundation\nwill support activities designed to advance the economic well-being of\npeople everywhere and to improve economic institutions for the better\nrealization of democratic goals.\" The details of this major program were\nspelled out and their economic content was substantial. Seven specific\nkinds of activity were itemized, and were inclusive enough to warm the\nheart of almost any economist.

About twenty of the fifty largest\nfoundations received their endowments more recently than did Ford.\n\nThe second reason for the rapid increase in grants is the growth in\nthe large foundations! investment income. About four-fifths of the\ncombined portfolios of the fifty largest foundations is common stock\nand of companies which, in the 1950's and 1960's, have usually done\nbetter than the general stock indexes. Prohibited from an unreasonable\naccumulation of income, the growth in dividends has been translated\ninto proportionate or more than proportionate growth in grants. The\nTreasury has estimated that, in 1962, all foundations made grants and\nrelated outlays of $1 billion. This compares with probably $175-$200\nmillion in 1950 and $70 million in 1930. Investment income for the\nFord Foundation alone rose from $32 million in 1951 to $147 million\nin 1964; its expenditures rose from $32 to $216 million.\n\nTo what degree has economics participated in the increasing\naffluence of foundation grantees? The systematic collection and clas-\nsification of foundation grants is still in its early stages and incomplete\nand tabulations go back only through the 1960's. The most compre-\nhensive continuing tabulations are those of grants indexed by the\nFoundation Library Center. These indicate that for the period 1962-65\neconomics and business received about 1 percent of total indexed\ngrants (Table 1). The grants index understates the flow of money into\nall fields, and the understatement for business-economics is probably\nhigher than average. If so, Table 1 probably understates business-eco-\nnomics' share of total grants. It is doubtful, however, that business-\neconomics has captured more than, say, 2 percent of recent grants.\n\nWhile every red-blooded economist would contend that this is less\nthan its rightful share, business-economics appear to have done about\nas well as the other social sciences. Indexed grants to government-law\nin this period were slightly more than those to business-economics\nwhile grants to anthropology-sociology-psychology were about the\nsame. In the face of massive support from various government founda-\ntions and agencies as well as from broad public donations, the physical\nand life sciences attracted two and one-half times the private founda-\ntion grants that went to the social sciences. Surprisingly, indexed grants\nto the humanities were more than twice those to the social sciences.\n\nTt is probable that business and economics would have fared even\nless well in total grants had it not been for the special interest of the\nFord Foundation. In the four-year period 1962-65, 3.8 percent of the\nFoundation's total grants were to economics and business, and the per-\ncentage was higher in the period preceding it. Most of these were listed\nunder Economic Development and Administration (hereafter referred\nto as EDA)\u2014that part of the Foundation's annual catalogue so closely\nstudied by economics professors and business school deans.\n"], "1": ["The importance of private foundations in the production of econom-\nic knowledge is generally conceded. Examples abound of foundations\nthat have played Maecenas to neoclassical and Keynesian theory\nbuilders, to linear programmers and games players, to data-makers\nand data-takers, and to other laborers in the economic vineyards.\nWhether given to research institutes for large-scale, long-range proj-\nects, to groups of university scholars, or to individuals for the leisure\nto think, foundation grants often have meant the difference between\nunfinished exploration and discovery.\n\nI make this assertion with confidence, not only because I believe it\nto be correct, but also because it presently can be neither precisely re-\nfuted nor confirmed. As the paper will repeatedly demonstrate, we as\nyet do not have the data, much less the tools of analysis, for precise\nmeasurement of effects.

In the ten\nyears since 1955, foundations spent between $8 and $9 billion on their\nprograms; in dollar value this probably includes between two-thirds\nand three-fourths of all the grants ever made by foundations.\n\n\"The recency of foundation spending derives from two developments.\nThe first is the \"population explosion\" in foundations. Most of the ex-\nplosion relates to the thousands of small foundations spawned in the\n1950's and 1960's. However, there has also been a considerable in-\ncrease in the number of the large ones that account for the bulk of\ngrants. The history of the Ford Foundation is typical.

For the decision-maker these interpretations are essential in\nappraising probabilities and contingencies to which action must be\nadapted and timed.\n\nFinally, in the formulation of economic policy the economist plays\nhis role as interpreter, as analyst, and as advocate. He defines\nproblems, clarifies objectives, develops alternatives, analyzes their\neffects and side effects, and seeks ways to provide for contingencies.\nHe deals with multiple objectives, constraints, and uncertainties. He\nconfers and considers the reactions and interests of other agencies, and\nseeks support. Again much of this work is conducted orally or through\nstaff papers and memoranda. But throughout, the economic practitioner\nis using his knowledge of economics.\n\nIt has been indicated that economists and economics have come to\nplay a far more important role in public policy making than they did a\ngeneration or more ago. The probability is that this influence will in-\ncrease rather than diminish with the expanding influence of govern-\nment on economic affairs and the quest for more effective policies. The\nproblems of stability and growth, poverty, education, health, urban-\nism, social investment, foreign aid, taxation, resource use, foreign eco-\nnomic policy, international finance, agriculture, for example, will con-\ntinue to require the attention of economists, government, and the pub-\nlic. The worldwide problems of economic development, population, food\nsupply, and institution building will continue to tax the economist's\nknowledge and his ingenuity in policy formation.\n\nThe need for research and education has never been greater, and yet\nthere are in this author's view a number of improvements that would\nfacilitate both the advance of economic knowledge and its more effec-\ntive use. Clearly we need to know more about the economic process as\nwell as more about the process of applying economic knowledge both\nin practice and as a rational ideal. There is need for more rigorous\nstandards of conduct among practitioners offering professional analysis\nand advice. The practice of analyzing alternatives and consequences\nwould benefit from more rigor and less influence from personal value\njudgments. More graduate seminars devoted to policy analysis would\nadvance these objectives. But it seems clear that additional centers for\neconomic research, including policy research, must be developed if the\neffort is to keep abreast of the expanding need for knowledge. The social\nsciences now expend only about 3 percent of the funds for basic re-\nsearch, and the figure is probably no higher if applied research is in-\ncluded. The fraction for economics is approximately 1 percent.

The economists outside\ngovernment can often contribute such research more effectively than\nthose in government can under the pressures of daily duties. In fact,\neconomists in government look to the profession for these contribu-\ntions, for the critical appraisal policies, for alternative policy propos-\nals, and for creative ideas. The range of policy problems on which re-\nsearch is needed has grown steadily: (1) in policy areas for which more\nrefined knowledge is needed, for example; growth, unemployment,\ncost-price relationships, etc.; and (2) large new areas such as poverty,\neducation, health, and scientific research, where the analysis of the\neconomist is urgently required.\n\nThe notion that the literature is not read or used is largely an illu-\nsion. If it has relevance, it is considered by the practitioners who can\nuse it. The fact that the professional literature is not read by the pub-\nlic or large numbers of influential people has little more significance\nthan that the professional literature of doctors, lawyers, or many other\nprofessional groups is not read by a mass audience. The number of\neconomic practitioners has grown sufficiently to provide a link between\nresearch and policy. To these practitioners falls the growing task of\ntranslating technical knowledge for the decision-makers.\n\nThe economist outside of government is not limited, however, to a\n\"come and get it\" approach. Increasingly those with contributions to\nmake in policy matters serve on committees and task forces and as ad-\nvisers. Some of the most effective have been those who have served in\ngovernment where they could exercise an influence directly on policy\nformation.\n\nJust as there are types of research that can better be performed out-\nside of government, so there are other functions which must be carried\non in government, often with help of outside advisers. The first of\nthese functions is interpretation of conditions and events. By interpre-\ntation is meant more than an explanation of how or why a situation de-\nveloped or an event occurred. To the decision-maker it is equally or\nmore important to know the import for the future\u2014what is likely to\nfollow as a consequence, and what could occur under one set of contin-\ngencies or another. Information on the balance of payments, price in-\ncreases, the threatened independence of Rhodesia, and contemplated\ncountermoves, for example, raise questions not as explicit as what will\nhappen, but what is probable and what is possible under various feasi-\nble contingencies? This sort of interpretation is far more an activity\nfor oral discussion or internal memoranda than for public print.

Problems are often only an ill-\ndefined discontent with an existing or prospective state of affairs. Ends\nare not given; in fact both the ends and means of policy must be de-\nvised and offered for acceptance. He describes a strategy of disjointed\nincrementalism as one way in which policy evaluations and decisions\nare in fact made. This is a procedure whereby only incremental\ndifferences in conditions or consequences among a limited number of\nalternative policies are made the basis of choice. The effort is to im-\nprove, not necessarily to maximize. Policy proposals originate in many\ncenters and are subject to public criticism and modification. Political\nchoice is, as always, a compromise [12, pp. 81-142]. It is an untidy\nprocedure, but, like democracy, it works after a fashion.\n\nThe political process itself involves not only the formulation of pol-\nicy recommendations but the achievement of legislative approval, and\nthis requires both support from organizations and individuals and\ncampaigns to inform and enlist public backing. There are probably\nmore middlemen between those who initiate a public policy proposal\nand the enactment of a vaguely similar policy than in any other pro-\nductive endeavor. Bailey, in his revealing account of the passage of the\nemployment act of 1946, describes the process as *a kaleidoscopic and\nlargely irresponsible interplay of idea, interests, institutions, and indi-\nviduals\" [13, p. 240]. The passage of the tax bill of 1964 offers no\nnotable improvement upon that record. As Flash has shown [14], the\nCouncil of Economic Advisers not only offers advice, but to make that\nadvice effective it plays both an educational and a political role.\n\nMost uses of economic knowledge have some eventual and indirect\ninfluence on policy. Through education the economist perpetuates the\nflow of professional economists for teaching, research, and practice\nwho in time exercise their influence. He also exposes a number of non-\nprofessional students to some familiarity with economic concepts and\nmethods. How well this fragmentary knowledge permits students in\nlater life to comprehend economic developments, policy issues, and the\noperation of the system is questionable, especially with the erosion and\nobsolescence of knowledge in later years. But some knowledge is\ndoubtless better for the nation than none, though it is increasingly ap-\nparent that some substantial form of adult instruction is necessary as a\nmeans of reducing the social lag.\n\nThrough research the economist plays a vital role by contributing\nnew concepts, methods, and theories. He also plays an important role\nin providing empirical research and policy studies.

Systems analysis at the national level, therefore, involves a\ncontinuous cycle of defining military objectives, designing alternative systems to achieve\nthese objectives, evaluating these alternatives in terms of their effectiveness and cost,\nquestioning the objectives and other assumptions underlying the analysis, opening new\nalternatives and establishing new military objectives, . . . .\n\nThus, the problem of allocating resources within the Department of Defense itself\ninvolves the choosing of doctrines, weapons, equipment, and so forth, so as to get the\nmost defense out of any given level of available resources or, what is logically equivalent,\nto achieve a given level of defense at the least cost.

With\neconomists more prevalent in the Bureau of the Budget in the past few\nyears, such methods are spreading, and cost benefit analysis, though\nstill ill-developed and roughly applied, is becoming a useful tool in the\nappraisal of programs [9].\n\nThe process of decision making according to Simon generally in-\nvolves defining the problem, clarifying objectives, developing alterna-\ntive courses of action, analyzing their consequences, and appraising\nthem in light of the objectives and constraints [10]. Imperfect\nthough the method is, and though \"satisficing\" more than maximizing\nmay be the outcome, the approach has the merit of introducing more\ndeliberate analysis and appraisal than the customary intuitive meth-\nods. Lindblom is critical of such synoptic approaches, including the\nmore formal social welfare function approach of Tinbergen [11] on\nthe ground that they cannot logically achieve the rational ideal they\naspire to [11, pp. 27-57]. Among other defects they cannot consider\nall alternatives and consequences or provide an evaluative method ei-\nther from a rational deductive system or a welfare function [11, pp.\n48-51]. Nevertheless, with all its limitations in a world of imperfect\nknowledge, economic, political and social change, and uncertainty both\nwith respect to the present and the future, the method, in less preten-\ntious form than the description of it might suggest, has acquired sub-\nstantial use, and it allows the economist to employ a number of his an-\nalytical tools.\n\nLindblom finds a wide discrepancy between what social scientists\nand policy analysts say they do and what they do in fact under the\nforegoing conditions [12].

In those areas Hitch sees economic\nchoice as a way of looking at such problems. He comments that:\n"], "3": ["532 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\ntainable. Instead he proposed an \"applied economics\" that would make\nthe significance of economic theorems known to the legislator and so-\ncial reformer. He doubted whether the normative science of ideals\ncould properly be called even the \"ethics of political economy,\" be-\ncause it drew so heavily on other fields of knowledge [4, pp. 50-83].\n\nAs Hutchison indicates, Keynes's concept of a positive, neutral\nscience clearly distinguished from policy recommendations requiring\nethical or political judgments was widely, though by no means wholly,\naccepted by English and American economists [5, p. 38]. In suggest-\ning the application of economic theorems to particular problems, rath-\ner than try to formulate a body of economic precepts, Keynes was per-\nhaps anticipating more than influencing the course of development.\n\n'The increasing specialization of economics with the growth of litera-\nture in the so-called *applied\" fields\u2014a literature describing institu-\ntions, practices, policy, and history, along with a review of theory and\npractical problems\u2014doubtless contributed toward a more specialized\napproach to policy. Specific problems and reforms\u2014in antitrust, bank-\ning, taxation, and tariffs, for example\u2014came to be studied more than\nthe big issues such as the institutions most conducive to the produc-\ntion and distribution of wealth and those concerned with the scope and\nrole of government action.\n\nMeanwhile the quest for economic criteria for policy purposes con-\ntinued. From utility theory and welfare economics came concepts of\noptimum utility, the social optimum, maximum social welfare, and eco-\nnomic welfare as ideals or criteria. These concepts, in spite of their im-\nperfections for broad political and social decisions serving diverse so-\ncial objectives, have had a major influence on the criteria of choice\namong economists [5, pp. 40-50, 143-70]. They have yielded opera-\ntional concepts of optimizing in management situations and stimulated\nthe analysis of alternatives and methods of choice based on cost effec-\ntiveness. Such methods have been improved by operations research and\nsystems analysis to which statistics and mathematics were important\ncontributors. For the larger problems of social choice the \"new\" wel-\nfare economics of more recent years proposes a social welfare function\nas the criterion for choice among alternatives. But although the ap-\nproach provides useful concepts, it is still far from operationally feasi-\nble for most social policy decisions.\n\nThe recent dramatic changes in defense policy and management,\nhowever, are a direct outcome of applying economic concepts and\nmethods to defense problems. The application initially was developed\nlargely by RAND [6] [7], and the transfer of such economists as\nHitch and Enthoven to the Department of Defense was important to\nthe outcome.

For a century and a half the belabored dis-\ncussions of the application of economics to policy have been devoted\nmore to a clarification of economics as a positive science and its logical\nrelation to policy proposals than to a clarification of the process of ap-\nplication or of policy formation. Smith was scientist, analyst, and pol-\nicy advocate before these roles were distinguished. Malthus and Say\nwanted a political economy yielding rules for practical action, while\nMcCulloch wanted it to specify the most effective means of produc-\ntion, accumulation, and consumption [2, pp. 38-42].\n\nSenior and J. S. Mill more perceptively distinguished the science\nand the art of political economy. Senior looked to the science to ascer-\ntain the institutions most favorable to the production and distribution\nof wealth, but changed his mind a decade later and held that the appli-\ncation depended on so many other branches of knowledge that it be-\nlonged to the art of government, and that the political economist\nshould not \"recommend or dissuade,\" or add a \"single syllable of ad-\nvice\" [2, pp. 48-49]. But this conclusion exercised no visible re-\nstraint on Senior in giving advice, and a decade later he returned to a\nmodified version of his original position.\n\nMill elaborated the role of the science and the art in his 1836 essay\n[3, pp. 120ff.] and in the last chapter of his Logic (1843). Science\nwas the study of what is, while art is practice based on rules and pre-\ncepts provided as theorems by the corresponding science. In brief, art\nproposes an end and looks to science to specify the precept for most\neffectively achieving it. But the art depends on many sciences, and the\nends have to be specified according to some general premise as to the\nproper objects of approbation and precedence\u2014which, in his view,\nshould be the happiness of mankind. It is not clear how seriously Mill\nexpected a general body of rules, precepts, maxims, and principles to\nbe developed for application. In any event the task he assigned to the\nfuture was not carried out. Nor in his Principles (1848) did Mill fol-\nlow his own prescriptions, for he passed from science to application\nwith little regard to the differences he had enunciated.\n\nIn his Scope and Method of 1890 J. N. Keynes emphasized the sep-\naration of the positive science from the art based on precepts for the\nattainment of given ends, and the normative science which was con-\ncerned with ideals and criteria of what ought to be. He urged the new\nless normative term '*'economics\" for the science. He considered the\nprecepts for the art to be so conditional under varying economic, ethi-\ncal, social, and noneconomic considerations that he regarded the de-\nvelopment of a body of precepts or doctrine for practice to be unat-\n"], "1": ["This paper is intended to discuss only a fragment of the sweeping\nsubject suggested by the assigned title. It is limited to some observa-\ntions on the use of economic knowledge in the conduct o\u00ed public\naffairs.\n\nIn his presidential address last year, Stigler advanced rather inci-\ndentally the thesis that the influence of economists and theory upon\nthe formulation of policy had usually been small (1, p. 12]. Certain-\nly few of us can be satisfied with the knowledge we possess for policy\nguidance, or with the record of explicit policy achievements over the\nyears and across the wide range of policy problems confronting the na-\ntion. Yet somehow the ideas of economists have had a vast and in-\ncreasing influence on public affairs. That influence, often with a nota-\nble lag, has been felt on central banking, monetary policy, fiscal policy,\nSocial security, tax policies, wartime price and production controls,\ntrade policy, international monetary policies, defense policies, defense\nmanagement, foreign aid, economic development, and countless other\nprograms. Both economists and their theory have gained in influence\nsince the 1930's, especially since 1941, and even more since 1961. The\nenormous improvement of economic data available has been both a re-\nsult and a means of extending that influence. Advances in economic\nknowledge have not only placed economists in positions to influence\npolicy, but, because of it, the goals and methods of policy in many\nareas are far more precise and ambitious than they were a generation\nago. What then accounts for the seeming contradiction?\n\nThe fields I have mentioned are among those in which economists\nhave worked extensively. Although their studies may seldom have been\ndesigned directly for policy formulation, they have nevertheless\ninfluenced policy. Moreover, in these areas economists have exerted an\ninfluence in the councils shaping policy by taking an active part as ad-\nvisers or officials. Stigler refers particularly to policy areas in which\neconomists have done comparatively little work or work that is inade-\nquate to guide important policy judgments. In addition he may be\nlooking for a more direct line of influence than is ordinarily visible in\nthe intricate process of policy formation\u2014a process which has been\nlittle understood and often oversimplified.\n\n530\n", "By RonznT D.

But these fads\nare generally easier to diagnose than the others, and therefore less\nlikely to overstep reasonable bounds.\n\nLet us return to the major fads: the temporary or localized kernels\nof general economic interest. 'This interest, it sometimes seems, can be\nmore apparent than real, when it needs the support of massive public\nor private financing, novel hardware, or both. It also has in its favor\nattractive prospects of visiting the real world, even doing good to\ngrateful people in a pleasant climate with sanitary drinking water.\nThese appeals are obvious; few among us can claim immunity\nthroughout their working lives, or even discount fad following as an\nerror of their misspent youth.\n\nAnother point in defense of fad following: it is usually less risky\nthan its name perhaps implies, and so the risk-averter need not con-\ncern himself too greatly for the safety of his professional capital. To\nfollow a fad up the blindest of alleys gives the fad-follower \u00bb years of\nrespite from competition with the higher L.Q.'s of his profession, who\ntend to concentrate near main streams and principal tributaries. If the\nfad-follower has passable personal relations and administrative talents,\nand if his z fad-following years encompass one presidential adminis-\ntration or long-term foundation grant, year (2 4 1) will find him far\nabove the battle\u2014an academic distinguished professor, a public sector\nbureau chief, a corporate vice-president, or equivalent. *He has ten\ntelephones at once, so who can guess he is a dunce?\"\n\nThese envious and splenetic interjections cannot substantiate my\nsuspicion that, for example, much of the burgeoning \"regional econom-\nics\" of the Great Society will prove a fad, and likewise the behavioral\nsimulations of janitors selecting broom-pushing routes under uncer-\ntainty. Neither can they substantiate my parallel confidence that some\neconomic aspects of the poverty program will prove substantially more\nthan fads. These arguments involve *pervasiveness\" in its two mean-\nings of continuity over time and place, and likewise the need for some-\nthing more than routine applications of accepted analysis.\n\nThe economics of poverty has already involved us\u2014under other la-\nbels, it is true\u2014with the rival policy implications of micro- and macro-\neconomics, issues we have \"ignored, or given only ad koc recognition\"\nfor at least a generation.

We have fads in food, dress, social customs, and all the other\narts and sciences. Why should economics hope for immunity? What\nmany of us want, and what I wish I could supply, is a method of dis-\ntinguishing ex ante the fad from the *wave of the future,\" and so pro-\ntecting oneself and one's juniors from betting their limited intellectual\ncapitals on the wrong horses.\n\nHere again, I think I have found useful material in Stigler's new\nbook. In the passage I am using for my text, he is not talking about\nfads but about \"environmental\" interpretations of long-term trends, so\nI propose to turn his views upside down, inside out, and backwards,\nbefore commenting upon them. The relevant running quotation [17,\npp. 20-22] is longer than most:\n\n[rt isa sign of the maturity of a discipline that its main problems are not from im-\nmediate, changing events. [P]ersistent separation of scientific study from the real world\nleads to sterility, but sensitive response to current events stultiies the deepening and\nwidening of principles and techniques. The leading theoretical chemists are not working on\nheadache remedies, and the leading economic theorists need not be concerned with urban\nrenewal.\n\nThe vast majority of current social economic problems are routine from the standpoint\nof economic theory. It is more remarkable that most [events of major economic signifi-\ncance] leave economic theory unaffected. Minor changes hardly seem adequate to great\nnew problems, and extensive reconstructions are usually the result of the systematic\nelaboration of a basic idea which previously had been ignored or given only ad Joc recog-\nnition. This suggests the third and influential type of economic problem: that which is\npervasive. It is not enough that a problem be of vast importance, if that importance is\nmomentary; it is not enough that the problem be persistent, if it is local.\n\nThe dominant influence upon the working range of economic theorists is the set of\ninternal values and pressures of the discipline. The subjects for study are posed by the\nunfolding course of scientific development. This is not to say that the environment is\nwithout influence, for every great economist injects some portion of it into the developing\n\ntheoretical corpus. This element of realism, however, need have no simple or direct con-\nnection with the contemporary scene.\n\nIf Stigler is basically right about the economic mainstream, what is\nhe implying about economic fads? Let us stand his argument on its\nhead and hazard a guess. Are fads not primarily the short-term conse-\nquences of those environmental influences which Stigler had discount-\ned for the long run? Are they not predominantly the more or less rou-\ntine applications of economics\u2014orthodox or unorthodox, good or bad,\ndeveloped or undeveloped, rational or emotional\u2014to problems in\nwhich interest is either general but short-lived, or alternatively, long-\nterm but localized? These seem to me the most important and decep-\ntive of the fads.\n\nThe other sort of fad includes literature \"feeding upon itself,\" along\nwith epidemic applications of this or that novel technique or formula\nto routine empirical\" testings by \"Schumpeterian imitators.\" The\n"], "10": ["IV\n\nIt is difficult to say anything new about economic fads.

Rather than counting articles, I\nhave economized time by \"measuring\" them in column-centimeters, at\nthe cost of overstressing the longer-winded titles. (The actual mea-\nsurements were made by Paul Lavell and Yoichi Niwata.) This meth-\nodological difference explains, I assume, the discrepancies between my\nresults and Stigler's (ibid., p. 49).\n\nConsidering the Index's 23 categories without finer breakdowns,\nthere are significant uptrends in 6. The most pronounced in absolute\nterms is in economic theory (category 2), which includes macroeco-\nnomics and dynamics along with the traditional range of topics in mi-\ncrostatics. What has happened, one would expect, has been successive\nwaves of interest in the theory of the firm and the consumer, the theo-\nry of imperfect competition, the theory of income and employment,\nand the theory of economic growth. By the time one wave has ebbed,\nthe next has overtaken it. There is a similar upturn in economic histo-\nry (category 5), with some decline since 1960, and in two sets of tools:\nmathematics and statistics (category 7) and social accounting and\nstatistical data (category 8). Business organization and managerial\neconomics (category 14) and regional economics and housing (cat-\negory 22) follow the upward path of economic history, including some\nslight decline since 1960, which can hardly be more than temporary.\n\nOffsetting these steady, trend-like, increases, three categories show\ndownward drifts of professional interest. Two are \"theoretical\" fields,\nmethodology (category 1) and doctrinal history (category 4), at least\nsince 1940. A shift away from humanistic and philosophical concerns\namong economists may be responsible here. Of the \"substantive\"\nfields, the sharpest decline is in industrial organization and public pol-\nicy (category 15), which had furthest to fall.\n\nThere is a parabolic trend (or long swing) in monetary economics\n(category 9). Interest fell to a trough during and immediately after\nWorld War II and rose thereafter with postwar inflation and the\n\"rediscovery of money.\" Health, education, and welfare (category 19)\nand population economics (category 21) show similar patterns, with\nthe troughs coming later.

What happens normally to antitheses is that\nthey wither away at least temporarily, or else improve in quality to the\npoint of either replacing or supplementing the original thesis in some\nnew synthesis. This becomes in due course the thesis of the next gener-\nation and often also the orthodoxy of the generation after that.\n\nAs of the 1960's, the reigning economic thesis in the United States\ncombines in uneasy peace elements of the previous Marshallian syn-\nthesis of the cost and utility theories of value and competitive price\n(with a variable adornment of imperfect competition), elements of the\nKeynesian theory of income and employment (embellished in varying\ndegrees by the *neoclassical synthesis,\" alias *anemic counterrevolu-\ntion\") and elements of a neoclassical theory of economic growth and\ndevelopment.

In no\noccupation was the employment service more important than newspa-\nper advertising. Many employers prefer neighborhood to metropolitan\npapers. In some cases this is again a device for racial screening, but\nmore often it is intended to minimize transportation costs and thus to\ncut turnover and encourage attendance. Trade papers and foreign lan-\nguage papers are important in some industries, such as men's clothing.\n\nThe preceding discussion fails to suggest the rich variety of hiring\nchannels in a metropolitan labor market. Referrals from unions are\nimportant in trucking and in the printing trades, as well as in construc-\ntion, which was excluded from our sample. Referrals from one employ-\ner to another occur in cases of layoffs and plant shutdowns. Public util-\nities recruit clerical workers extensively from high schools; private vo-\ncational schools are important in the data processing occupations; and\ncollege recruiting is important for professional and managerial jobs.\nSome of the hiring channels we discovered do not fit any of the usual\ncategories. One manufacturer hires truck drivers through a large\ntrucking firm located across the street; another employer hires accoun-\ntants through the public accounting firm that audits its books. A large\ndistributor of furniture and home appliances hires warehousemen from\nmoving and storage companies, whose slack season coincides with this\nemployer's peak season.

Ullman re-\nports significant negative relationships between wages and the propor-\ntion of clerical workers hired through newspaper advertising and pri-\nvate agencies.\"\n\nThe literature on formal information networks is uniformly hostile\nto private employment agencies. One of the leading scholars in the\nfield, E. Wight Bakke, speaks of unemployed workers \"falling into the\nclutches of exploiting fee-charging agencies, who took from ignorant\npeople in desperate need of jobs a big toll from their pay for providing\na very poor labor broker service.\" Many employers also have little\nuse for private agencies, or \"flesh peddlers.\" Some complain of pirat-\ning\u2014attempts by agencies to hire away people they have previously\nplaced in order to earn another fee\u2014and many complain of being pest-\nered by phone calls from agency counselors. Some agencies do a poor\nscreening job because of the high turnover of counselors. Since there\nare many agencies and there is vigorous competition among them, em-\nployers who complain about the practices of a particular agency often\nshift their business to a competing agency rather than turning to an\nalternative type of hiring channel.\n\nDespite complaints from professors and employers, private agencies\nhave been growing rapidly. Between 1943 and 1958 the number of pri-\nvate employment agencies in the United States increased from 2,200 to\n3,900, their receipts tripled, and their payrolls quadrupled.* One is\nforced to at least grudging admiration of an industry that can thrive\non selling at substantial fees a service that the government provides\ngratis.\n\nIn fact, our employer interviews reveal that many employers are\nwell satisfied with private agencies.

Each of these rules has some\nrelevance to job performance, but lack of the qualities specified could\nbe compensated for by the presence of others. Such rules are often re-\nlaxed if there is a shortage of applicants who can meet them. This flex-\nibility is illustrated by a large Chicago area manufacturing establish-\nment whose newspaper ads for blue-collar workers when the market is\nloose specify, Must be high school graduate\"; when the market tight-\nens, this is replaced by, \"Average piece rate earnings $3.19 an hour.\"\nIn addition to formal hiring standards, employers have a still more\nflexible set of preferences among job applicants, such as the preference\nfor married men for unskilled work because they are thought to have\nlower quit rates.\n\nMost employers have a strong preference for using informal infor-\nmation networks, for a variety of reasons. Employee referrals\u2014the\nmost important informal channel\u2014usually provide good screening for\nemployers who are satisfied with their present workforce. Present em-\nployees tend to refer people like themselves, and they may feel that\ntheir own reputation is affected by the quality of the referrals. Infor-\nmal sources also tend to provide applicants from the neighborhood in\nwhich the establishment is located; this is particularly important for\nfemale employees in reducing turnover, absenteeism, and tardiness re-\nsulting from transportation difficulties. Moreover, informal channels\nare usually costless to the employer, though we have found a few cases\nin which bonuses are paid for employee referrals that result in hires.\nOf course, some formal channels such as the state employment service\nare also costless. The few employers who deliberately avoid informal\nsources are either those who are seeking to upgrade their work force or\nthose who have had bad experience with nepotism or cliques.\n\nThe informal sources also have important benefits to the applicant.\nHe can obtain much more information from a friend who does the kind\nof work in which he is interested than from an ad in the paper or a\ncounselor at an employment agency, and he places more trust in it. He\ncan ask the counselor about the fairness of supervision in a factory,\nbut he cannot often get an informed or reliable answer. If informal\nsources result in a placement in the applicant's home neighborhood, he\nminimizes transportation costs, both in time and in direct outlay.

Labor markets lie as far from this pole as used car\nmarkets, and a grain exchange for labor is about as possible as a con-\ntract on the Chicago Board of Trade for 1960 Chevrolet sedans.\n\nThe large variance of wages within narrowly defined occupations in\nparticular local markets affords some evidence of the variance in the\nquality of labor and in the attractiveness of jobs, though it has other\nsources as well. For example, in our sample of maintenance electricians\nin the Chicago area we found a range of hourly earnings in June, 1963,\nof from $1.75 to $4.75 an hour. Their formal educations ranged from\nless than four years of schooling to some college. They worked in\nplaces ranging from spotless modern plants in pleasant suburbs to old\nloft buildings in central city slums.\n\nVariation in the quality of applicants in many dimensions is one rea-\nson why employers invest so much in the selection of new employees.\nA second is that present seniority arrangements, both contractual and\ntraditional, mean that in a large number of occupations an employee\nwho survives the probationary period is likely to be with the firm for\nmany years.

Where the goods and services sold are highly standard-\nized, the extensive margin is the more important; when there is great\nvariation in quality, the intensive margin moves to the forefront. This\npoint can be illustrated by considering the markets for new and used\ncars. Since there is relatively little variation in the quality of new cars\nof the same make and model and since the costs of variation are re-\nduced by factory guarantees, the extensive margin of search is the im-\nportant one.

The remarkable regularity of this pattern\nis certainly the most striking characteristic of the three sets of partial\nregression coefficients (or adjusted means) shown in Table 1.\n\nIt is also evident, however, that the responsiveness of participation\nrates to education attainment varies appreciably among our three\ngroups. Roughly speaking, the completion of an extra year of schooling\nis associated with an average increase of about 3 to 374 percentage\npoints in the participation rate of our sample of married women and\nwith an average increase of about 275 percentage points in the partici-\npation rate of our group of older males. The education-participation\nrelation for prime-age males is so nonlinear that no similar single-num-\nber measure of sensitivity would be meaningful; but, as was to be ex-\npected, the participation for members of this group is much less re-\nsponsive to educational attainment than is the participation of married\nwomen and older males. Indeed, differences in participation among\nprime-age males in the educational attainment categories from 9-11\nyears of school! completed on up the scale are so small that they are\nprobably nonsignificant.\n", "578 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nincome has a pronounced negative effect on labor force participation,\nespecially above the $5,000 level.\n\nEducational attainment again has a definite positive ef\u00edect on labor\nforce participation, in both the simple and multiple runs, as the bottom\npanel of Table 1 and Figure 3 indicate. In the case of this group, how-\never, the curve showing the adjusted participation rates is considerably\nsteeper than the curve showing the simple association. The explanation\nis that the fraction of wives who are Negro and the fraction with impe-\ncunious husbands both tend to be higher among married women with\nlittle schooling than among those with much, and both of these factors\ntend to increase participation.\n\nThe rise in the adjusted mean participation rates associated with\nhigher educational attainments by this group is truly impressive. From\nan adjusted rate of 22 percent for women in the 0-4 years of school in-\nterval, expected participation rises to 33 percent for those with an ele-\nmentary education, to 50 percent for those with a high school degree,\nto 61 percent for those with a college education, and finally to 76 per-\ncent for women with one or more years of graduate school.

We used two control variables: (1) a race variable (white \u2014 1,\nNegro \u2014 0), which we expected to be negative in the case of this group\nbecause of the tradition of the Negro population in favor of the wife\nworking; and (2) a husband's income variable, which we expected to\nbe negatively related to labor force participation.

We find\nthat white married women have a participation rate appreciably lower\nthan Negro married women, other things equal, and that husband's\n", "LABOR ECONOMICS 577\n\nour control variables are in order. First, other family income has a\nvery considerable impact. All of the coefficients are negative and high-\nly significant, which means that, compared with the group having less\nthan $1,000 of other income, the participation of those having at least\n$1,000 is much reduced. Also, the general pattern of the coefficients\nindicates that the more other income an older person has, the less\nlikely he is to participate, although, as in the case of the prime-age\nmales, the relation is not perfectly regular.\n\nRace does not matter here, as it did in the case of the prime-age run,\nbut marital status really matters. Older males who were married had\nan average participation rate roughly 16 points higher than that for\nother males. Perhaps those who are still married by this age are unusu-\nally well endowed with those personality characteristics conducive to\nemployment; or perhaps they are especially anxious to get out of the\nhouse and into the labor market; or perhaps it is just that they have\ngreater financial obligations.\n\nTurning now to the educational attainment coefficients, there is very\nlittle to be said. The graph speaks for itself. Educational attainment\nhas a very powerful and amazingly regular effect on the labor force\nparticipation of this group. The adjusted participation rate for older\nmales with some graduate work is almost 277 times as high as the ad-\njusted rate for the 0-to-4-years-of-school-completed group.\n\nIt is surprising that the unadjusted and adjusted curves are nearly\nidentical, given the power of the control variables. The apparent expla-\nnation is that our control variables have almost exactly offsetting\neffects here. The low education group, for example, has less other in-\ncome, and hence a greater incentive to participate on this count; but it\nalso has a smaller proportion of its population in the married-with-\nwife-present category, and hence less of an incentive to participate on\nthis ground.\n"], "10": ["UNADJUSTED 7^,\n^ f ADIUSTED\n", "65.0\n\n60.0\n\n55.0\n\n50.0\n\nUNADJUSTED 7^,\n\n^ Jf ADIUSTED\n45.0\n40.0\n350\n30.0\n250\n20.0\n\n15.0\n\n10.0\n\n5.0\n\n0-4 5-7 8 9-11 12 13-15 16 174\nYEARS OF SCHOOL COMPLETED\n\nFriGURE 2\n\nRzraTIONSHIP BETWEEN EDUCATIONAL \u00c1TTAINMENT AND LaBoR FORCE\nPanriCIPATION, MaLEs 65-74, CENsUS WErk, 1960\n", "AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n", "576\n"], "9": ["LABOR ECONOMICS 575\n\nThe adjusted means are shown in the last column of Table 1 and on\nFigure 1. It is apparent that educational attainment still has a pro-\nnounced effect on the labor force participation of prime-age males even\nafter we allow for the influence of these other variables. But the curve\nis a bit flatter now, which signifies that the simple relation exaggerates\nslightly the quantitative effects of, say, the increment in educational\nattainment from the 0-to-4 years of schooling level to college gradua-\ntion. The reason is that lower education groups happen to have more\nthan their share of males who are unmarried and Negro. (The fact\nthat the lower education group also has lower other income does pull in\nthe other direction, but not sufficiently to offset the other associations.)*\n\nBefore leaving the prime-age male group, we wish to make one last\npoint. In selecting our group of prime-age males, we excluded those\nmen 25-34 who were still enrolled in school. If one does not do this, as\nwe did not the first time around, he finds that the mean participation\nrate curve dips at the 13-15 years-of-school-completed level and at the\n17-4 level. This might be thought to imply that there is something spe-\ncial about the labor force behavior of drop-outs, that they are in some\nsense inferior and therefore less likely to participate. But our subse-\nquent analysis indicates that this would have been a wrong interpreta-\ntion, since some of the people in these categories are not in the labor\nforce precisely because they are still in school. It is possible to exclude\nmales 25-34 who are still in school when one works with the 1/1000\nsample, but not when one works with the published census data. On\nthe basis of the effect of this exclusion on our results, we are now in-\nclined to question the meaningfulness of findings which seem to show\nthat the rate of return to educational investment for drop-outs from\nany level is appreciably lower than the rate of return for persons who\ncompleted that level, when such findings are based only on the pub-\nlished census data. At least part of the apparent differential may be\ndue to the fact that some of the group referred to as drop-outs are still\n\nin school and hence are unlikely to hold full-time jobs.\n\nOlder Males (65-74)\n\nIn studying the effects of educational attainment on the participa-\ntion of males between the ages of 65 and 74, we used exactly the same\nmethods and the same control variables as in the case of prime-age\nmales.

The coefficient for the race variable is\n--1.5, which means that we should expect a group of white males to\nhave a labor force participation rate 1.6 percentage points higher than\na group of Negroes who were equivalent in terms of the other variables\nincluded in this regression. In short, the fact that Negroes have a\nlower labor force participation rate is not attributable solely to their\nlower educational attainment, though this is clearly a large part of the\nexplanation.\n\nThe impact of marital status is much greater than the impact of\nrace. We find that a group of married men with wife present has an av-\nerage labor force participation rate 7.5 percentage points higher than a\ncomparable group with some other marital status (widowered, divorced,\nseparated, or single). This is a much greater impact than we had antic-\nipated, and it suggests that the relation between marital status and\nlabor force behavior deserves more attention than economists usually\ngive it.\n\n'The dummies for other family income have negative coefficients in\nall instances except one.

The participation rate marches up steadily with educational at-\ntainment, though the relationship is not linear.\n\nWe also show standard errors in Table 1. But, because our depen-\ndent variable is dichotomous, the usual measure of the standard error\nis not really appropriate. The actual values of our dependent variable\nmust be either zero or one, and so it is obvious that the residuals are\nnot going to be distributed in the manner assumed by classical statis-\ntics. In short, these data, by their very nature, have the disease known\nas heteroscedasticity. We are told by people who know much more\nthan we do about such matters that: (a) heteroscedasticity does not\nbias our regression coefficients; and (5) what it does do is produce ex-\naggerated estimates of the size of the standard error. Nonetheless, we\nshow these estimates to provide a rough basis for assessing the\nsignificance of regression coefficients; that is, the significance of the\ndifference between the estimated mean for any given educational group\nand the mean for the reference group (those with 0-4 years of school-\ning). In general these differences appear to be highly significant, since\nmost of them are more than four times as large as their (exaggerated)\nstandard errors.\n\nIt is of course always possible that this kind of simple relationship\nwill be misleading because of intercorrelations with other variables\nwhich are not taken into account. To protect against this possibility,\nwe introduced three control variables into our prime-age male regres-\nsion. The first is a set of dummies for other family income (total fami-\nly income less the earnings of the prime-age male). Here we expected\nto find a negative relation, on the grounds that the greater the amount\nof other family income, the less the financial pressure on the man to\nwork. Our second control variable is a marital status dummy which\nhas the value of one if the man is married with his wife present, and\nzero otherwise. We expected a positive relationship between the mari-\ntal status dummy and labor force participation for several reasons.\nPresumably the married man has greater responsibilities and hence a\ngreater incentive to work for that reason. It may also be that personal-\nity factors associated with being married with a wife present are asso-\nciated with labor force participation. A third consideration, suggested\nby one of our colleagues who had best remain nameless, is that married\nmen may be especially anxious to get out of the house and into the\nlabor market. Finally, we control for race by using a dummy which\nhas the value of one if the man is white and zero if he is Negro?

This was our\nsuspicion, but it turned out to be unfounded.\n\nOur findings for prime-age males are summarized in the top panel of\n\"Table 1, and under the heading \"simple relationship\" we first show the\nresults of a regression explaining the labor force participation rate\nsolely in terms of a set of educational attainment dummies.

Our a priori answers to such\nquestions, however, would consist only of commonsense observations\n\u2014at best\u2014and so, in the interests of space, we turn now to the presen-\ntation of our empirical findings.\n\nData and Methods\n\nMost of the results reported here are cross-sectional findings for the\ncensus week of 1960. Rather than lumping the entire working-age pop-\nulation together into one massive aggregate, we shall present separate\nresults for three subsets of the population: prime-age males (aged\n25-54), older males (aged 65-74), and married women (aged 18-64)\nwith husband present but no children under six. The advantages of this\ndisaggregated approach are obvious. Labor force behavior differs ap-\npreciably among these groups, and it is important to study the\ndifferential effects of educational attainment.\n\nOur source of data is the One-in-a-Thousand Sample from the 1960\nCensus.* All told, it provides information on over 180,000 individuals\nand has the great advantage of permitting us to classify them ac-\ncording to an enormous number of socioeconomic characteristics, rang-\ning from the person's own education, to the income of other members\nof his immediate family, to national origin, to number of TV sets in\nthe home! We have taken advantage of some of these classification\npossibilities to exclude from our subsample persons in institutions, per-\nsons in the armed forces, and persons living in rural areas. So, we deal\nonly with the civilian, urban, noninstitutional population. What we\ncannot do with these data is relate labor force participation to local\nlabor market conditions. For this purpose intercity analysis or time\nseries analysis is more appropriate. But for studying the effects on\nlabor force participation of individual characteristics\u2014such as educa-\ntional attainment\u2014the 1/1000 sample is magnificent.\n\nAs to statistical methods, we use ordinary single-equation, multiple-\nregression techniques, with dummy variables. The dummy variables\nare necessary because of the nature of the data: people are either in or\nout of the labor force, and so on. Thus, our basic model consists simply\nof a regression equation in which a dummy variable for the labor force\nparticipation rate is the dependent variable and the primary indepen-\n\n?

Neither the Census Bureau nor the Popu-\nlation Council assumes any responsibility for the validity of any of the figures or interpre-\ntations of the figures published herein based on this material.\n"], "2": ["A Priori Expectations\n\nWhat relationship would a reasonable man expect to find between\neducational attainment and labor force participation? The first answer\nis that there are some spurious positive relations to be expected\nwhich we cannot control. There are good reasons to think that educa-\ntional attainment is positively related to intelligence, to ambition, and\nprobably to physical and mental health as well\u2014Aand that these char-\nacteristics are in turn related to labor force participation. Unfortu-\nnately, our inability to measure these qualities in the data with which\nwe work prevents our sorting out the effect of education per se in any\nprecise way.\n\nThere is no reason, however, to think that these spurious associa-\ntions are all that is involved. There are also reasons to think that edu-\ncation changes individuals in ways which will affect their propensity to\nseek employment. The most obvious point is that education increases a\nperson's expected market earnings and thus increases the differential\nreturn between market and nonmarket activity; that is, the opportuni-\nty cost of staying out of the labor market is greater for a person with\nconsiderable education than for a person with relatively little educa-\ntion.\n\nEducational attainment also increases access to the cleaner, more\npleasant, more interesting jobs. This seems to us to be an important\nconsideration, because nonpecuniary considerations may be very im-\nportant to some people\u2014single women, for example.\n\nFinally, it seems plausible that educational attainment affects the\ntaste for work itself. Here we venture into unfamiliar terrain, but our\nbrand of amateur psychology and sociology suggests that more educa-\ntion may well lead people to want the social contacts and social inter-\nchange that employment often affords. The most casual empiricism\nsuggests that the educated housewife is less likely to be content stay-\ning home alone than her less well educated counterpart.\n\nSo, for all of these reasons, our speculations lead us to expect a posi-\ntive relation between educational attainment and labor force participa-\ntion. We could speculate further about expected differences in the\neffects of educational attainment on the labor force participation of\ndifferent groups within the population\u2014on the participation of males\nversus females, the old versus the young, and so on. We could also\noffer some conjectures about expected differences in the effects of var-\nious levels of educational attainment.

In short, what we are\ntrying to find out is how a person's probability of being in the labor\nforce is affected by the amount of formal schooling he has had.\n\nAside from pure intellectual interest, there are several justifications\nfor studying the relation between educational attainment and labor\nforce participation. First, it is evident that labor force participation\nrates have an important bearing on the long-term rate of growth of the\neconomy, and education may well be an important determinant of par-\nticipation. Second, the education-labor force participation relation is\nimportant from the standpoint of social policy, the questions here\nbeing whether lack of education is associated not only with the kinds\nof jobs a person can get and with his exposure to unemployment but\nalso with his ability and willingness to seek employment in the first\nplace.

However, to the extent that the elasticity of supplements with\nrespect to earnings exceeds unity, the effects of preferential tax treat-\nment and other factors having been accounted for, we may be observ-\ning a phenomenon reflecting, at least partly, the relation between earn-\nings and potential turnover costs.

Use of the standard deduc-\ntion induced a systematic upward bias in the estimation of taxable\nearnings, in both cross-sections and time series. Actual use of the stan-\ndard deduction varies negatively with income in a given year, and its\nprevalence has declined from some four-fifths of all returns at its in-\nception in 1944 to perhaps one-half now. Thus, my estimates consis-\ntently understated the true elasticity of wage supplement expenditures\nwith respect to taxable earnings, and this elasticity therefore might be\nsomewhat greater than one.\n\nFor an explanation of this phenomenon, I return to the expected\neffect of potential turnover cost on wage supplements. It is possible\nthat potential turnover cost is poorly correlated with the proxies for it\nused in the first stage of the analysis and that, consequently, the effects\nof such cost on supplements were not accounted for by these proxies.\nWalter Oi has presented some evidence that turnover cost varies posi-\ntively with earnings and, further, that the ratio of such cost to earn-\nings increases with earnings [10].

To take into account the first factor, the\nearnings elasticities of expenditures for all supplements from all cross-\nsections were converted into estimates of elasticity with respect to tax-\nable earnings by applying the standard deduction and assuming the\nnumber of exemptions to be the national mean number of persons per\nconsumer unit in the year of each cross-section.*\n\nAlmost all of these estimates of taxable earnings elasticities were\nclose to one.

The apparent general consistency of\nearnings elasticities with the tax hypothesis suggested that data be ex-\namined on an annual rather than an hourly basis, since, if preferential\ntax treatment is a determinant of supplement expenditures, annual in-\ncome, not hourly rate, is relevant.\n\nAccordingly, the BLS manufacturing industry data for 1959 were\nanalyzed on an annual basis. In addition, annual data from a number\nof other cross-sections were analyzed. These included: (a) production\nworkers in eighteen manufacturing industries in 1962 (BLS, [3]), (2)\nproduction workers in seventeen manufacturing industries common\nto both 1959 and 1962 surveys (BLS, [2] [3]), (c) employees in\ntwenty manufacturing and nonmanufacturing industries in seven bien-\nnial surveys, 1949 to 1961, in nineteen of these industries in 1963, and\nin eighteen of the industries in all surveys from 1949 to 1963 (Cham-\nber of Commerce [4]),* (d) employees in fourteen manufacturing\n\n* Statistical significance at the .05 level was the criterion used throughout.\n\n5'The hotel industry, not included in the 1963 survey, was excluded from data for other\nyears.

Thus,\nthe first stage of the analysis suggested that (1) wage supplements\ngenerally vary positively with money earnings independently of any of\nthe other factors considered, (2) variations in wage supplement expen-\nditures can be explained largely in terms of variations in money earn-\nings, and (3) the manner in which supplements vary with earnings ap-\npears to be generally consistent with the expected effect of preferential\ntax treatment.\n"], "5": ["LABOR ECONOMICS 587\n\nthe first, educational attainment (median years of schooling com-\npleted) was substituted for earnings in the Reder-type index.

The correlations with earnings rate of these skill measures were\nsomewhat lower than that of the \"richness of skill\" mix. For all three\nmeasures of skill, 2060 Census of Population data were used.\n\nA different approach to estimating indirectly the influence of turn-\nover costs on wage supplements utilizes turnover rates. Gary Becker\nhas shown that both quit and layoff rates will tend to be negatively\ncorrelated with specific training [1]. If turnover rates are negatively\nrelated to the amount of training and therefore are an indicator of po-\ntential turnover cost and if private wage supplements are an effective\nmeans of protecting employer investment in workers, then supplements\nshould be negatively related to the rate of turnover. For the turnover\nrate variable, the combined quit and layoff rate was used.\n\nIII\n\nSimple correlations showed supplements varying positively with\nearnings rate, firm size, and unionization, and varying in the expected\ndirection with the turnover cost proxies (positively in the case of skill\nand negatively in the case of turnover rate). However, the skill mea-\nsures were more highly correlated with insurances than with pensions,\nin terms of both expenditures and prevalence. Of the turnover cost\nproxies, only turnover rate was more closely related to pension than to\ninsurance expenditures, but the correlation between turnover rate and\nthe prevalence of insurance was slightly greater than that between\nturnover rate and the prevalence of pensions. 'This was an unexpected\nresult, since it seems reasonable to expect turnover costs to be more\nclosely related to pensions (which typically are nonvesting or provide\nfor considerably delayed or incomplete vesting) than to other supple-\nments.

Two measures of the\nprevalence of private wage supplements in these industries were also\nused: the proportion of workers employed in establishments reporting\nexpenditures for pensions and the corresponding proportion for health,\naccident, and life insurance.\n\nAverage earnings rates were derived from the published data on sup-\nplements and unpublished data furnished by BLS. For firm size, the\naverage number of employees per company in 1954 was used. The pro-\nportion of workers employed in establishments in which the majority\nwere covered by collective bargaining agreements in 1958 was used as\na measure of the degree of unionization.\n\nIn the absence of data on turnover costs, the influence of such costs\non wage supplements had to be estimated indirectly. One approach to\nestimating this influence is to use a measure of skill. Skill reflects gen-\neral as well as specific training, of course, but Jacob Mincer's findings\nsuggest a positive association between the two [8].\n\nAn index of skill was developed based upon the \"richness of skill\nmix\" used by Melvin Reder [11].

The growth of supplements has coincided with the\ndrive by unions to secure pension and welfare benefits for their mem-\nbers, and it has been observed that supplement expenditures are\nhigher, both absolutely and relative to money earnings, in plants where\nworkers are organized than where they are unorganized.

The oft observed positive variation of supplement expen-\nditures with firm size therefore might reflect a price-elastic demand,\nand the secular growth of supplements might be attributable in part to\ngrowing differentials between group and individual prices.\n\nTax preference and group prices might lead us to expect growth of\nsupplements because of price and income effects. The former influences\neffective prices paid by employees, but not observed prices paid by em-\nployers. The latter affects both, presumably to the same extent.\n\nStill another factor may have been operating upon employers! effec-\ntive supply prices of supplements, though not on observed prices. It\nhas often been argued that private wage supplements\u2014and especially\nsuch supplements as nonvesting pension plans\u2014are an effective means\nof reducing turnover rates, and therefore turnover costs. Jacob Min-\ncer's estimates [8, p. 57] indicate that aggregate annual investment\nin on-the-job training by employees more than doubled between 1939\nand 1958. It is conceivable that part of this increase reflected a shift in\ntraining costs from employers to employees. However, it seems reason-\nable to assume that employer investment in workers, and hence poten-\ntial turnover cost, has increased substantially over time, probably to\nan aggregate level of at least several billion dollars a year by the late\n1950's [8, pp. 62-63]. Consequently, expenditures by employers to\nreduce turnover rates might have been expected to rise. If supplements\nare more effective than higher wages in reducing turnover rates, the\nsecular increase of supplement expenditures relative to money earnings\nmay be attributable, in part, to rising potential turnover costs, due in\nturn to the growth of skills specific to the firm acquired on the job.\n\nThe role of unions in the development of pension and welfare\nbenefits has often been stressed. Albert Rees, for example, has suggest-\ned that the secular growth of private wage supplements may reflect the\ncombined effects of unionization, preferential tax treatment, and turn-\n\n?

Of course, the more price-elastic is the demand for the\ngoods for which supplements are substitutes, the greater will be the\nearnings elasticity of supplement expenditures relative to the income\nelasticity of the corresponding goods.\n\nRising productivity, and hence income growth, thus might have been\nexpected to lead to an increase over time in supplement expenditures,\nand, given a sufficiently high income elasticity of demand, to an in-\ncrease in the ratio of supplements to earnings. Fragmentary evidence\nsuggested that, in ordinary markets, income elasticities of the goods\nfor which the bulk of supplements are substitutes might be on the\norder of one.* Consequently, an observed earnings elasticity of supple-\nments substantially greater than one, as is apparent in time series\ndata, would appear to be consistent with the expected effect of prefer-\nential tax treatment.\n\nSpecial markets also have been created in employing firms because\nof differences between group and individual prices of employee\nbenefits. Beyond meeting whatever requirements may exist to qualify\nfor group prices, it is not obvious that these price differences provide\na strong incentive to have the benefits take the form of wage supple-\nment expenditures by employers rather than payroll deductions. How-\never, the observed tendency toward payment of the full cost of various\nemployee benefits by employers (ie., toward noncontributory plans)\nmay reflect the combined effects of group prices, preferential tax treat-\nment, and rising incomes.\n\nIn an analysis of private wage supplements, these price differentials\nobviously should be taken into account, since supplement expenditures\nare in terms of group prices, and group prices surely are not constant\neither absolutely or relative to prices in ordinary markets. There is\nquite a bit of evidence that, at least over a rather wide range of firm\nsizes at a point in time, group prices vary negatively with the size of\nthe group for which purchases are made. For this reason, firm size\nmight serve as a proxy for group relative to individual price, provided\nother influences were not strongly reflected in firm size variations.\n\n*A substantial proportion of individual saving is probably undertaken for the purpose\nof providing for maintenance of consumption during retirement and periods of nonem-\nployment or reduced earnings during working years. Unless the income elasticity of indi-\nvidual saving for other purposes differs greatly from that of total saving, the income\nelasticity of saving for which some supplements are substitutes would tend to be close\nto tnat of total saving, which Friedman's findings suggest may be unitary [6]. Estimates\nof the income elasticity of family payments for life insurance premiums, derived from\ntwo sets of data [7] [9] were close to one. Feldstein has estimated the income elasticity\nof family payments for health insurance to be somewhat less than one [5]. The life and\nhealth insurance data were in the form of expenditures and for this reason, as well as\n\nothers, yield questionable estimates of income elasticities. However, I found no evidence\nof elasticities much greater than unity.\n", "584\n"], "1": ["I\n\nAmong the factors most frequently cited in the literature as having\nhad important effects on the growth of supplements are (1) preferen-\ntial treatment under the federal personal income tax, (2) savings of\ngroup purchase, (3) turnover costs, and (4) unionization. I shall dis-\ncuss each of these in turn.\n\nTax preference has created special markets for annuities and insur-\nance\u2014markets to which individuals have had access only as employees\nand only to the extent that purchases are paid for directly by employ-\ners. A progressive tax affording preferential treatment for purchases of\nparticular goods in special markets and exempting some levels of\nmoney income from taxation creates levels of total compensation at\nand below which prices in the ordinary and special markets are the\nsame.
