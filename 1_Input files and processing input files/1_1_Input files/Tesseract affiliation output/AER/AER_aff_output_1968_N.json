Problems with Existing Theory\n\nOver the past decade a considerable literature has developed attempt-\ning to explain cross-country differences in output per worker in manu-\nfacturing industry. The differences to be explained are substantial. If\none believes the published figures, value added per worker in manufac-\nturing in India is only about one-tenth that in the United States; in\ncountries like Colombia, Japan, and Mexico, about one-quarter; in\nWestern Europe roughly sixty per cent. These kinds of differences exist\nindustry-by-industry, as well as for manufacturing as a whole.\n\nThe descriptive and qualitative literature has contained a wide vari-\nety of variables which may explain the differences, and has employed\n(implicitly) a wide variety of models. However, in the more quantitative\nliterature employing a formal model, the theoretical analysis almost in-\nvariably starts from two assumptions. The first is that within an indus-\ntry, all firms, both within a country and in different countries are, in\nsome basic sense, employing the same neoclassical production function.\nDifferences in output per worker therefore ought to be explainable by\n\n* 'The author is professor of economics at Yale University, formerly at RAND.

Marshall's Principles\n[11, p. 811, \u00a3.2], taking shape as the area between the competitive\nequilibrium price and the supply curve, a curve that slopes upward as a\nresult of placing the firms in order of diminishing efficiency. Thus the\nsupply curve may be taken as a curve of marginal cost! for the industry\nwith the producers! surplus derived therefrom being in the nature of a\nrent attributable ultimately to the specialized factors that initially\nconfer differential advantages on the firms employing them. Discussing\nthe term in connection with consumer's surplus in Appendix K [11, pp.\n830-31], Marshall appears to extend the term so as to comprehend all\nthe surpluses a man derives as producer, including a \"^worker's surplus\"\narising from the sale of his personal services and a *'saver's surplus\"\narising from the services of his capital.?\n\nIt is, of course, possible to introduce some refinement into these vari-\nous forms of producer's surplus by reference to their spatial and tem-\nporal dimensions. A producer's surplus arising from the differential earn-\nings of a special factor as between firms in a single industry is, in general,\nsmaller than the differential earnings of the factor if instead the compari-\nson is made between this industry and others, and this in turn is smaller\nthan the relevant differential as between regions. As for temporal com-\nparisons, the longer the period considered the smaller the rent\u2014a par-\n\n* The author is Reader in economics at The London School of Economics. He wishes to re-\ncord his indebtedness to D. M. Winch for many valuable comments on a first draft of the\npaper.\n\n1 With commendable analytic finesse Marshall separates the rising supply curve resulting\nfrom differential advantages as between firms, \"the particular expenses curve,\" from the possi-\nble external economies which may predominate and act, therefore, to lower the unit cost as the\ntotal output of industry is increased. The contribution of external economies are taken as fixed\nat the equilibrium output, OH, of his Figure 39 [11, p. 811]. This procedure is correct inasmuch\nas the area measures what the total number of firms take to be their rents or producers! sur-\npluses. Nonetheless, since competitive firms ignore their contributions in reducing cost for all\nother firms, the equilibrium output OH will be below the \"ideal\" output as would be indicated\nby the point of equality between the demand curve and a marginal curve taken from the down-\nward-sloping supply curve (resulting from the dominance of external economies).\n\n*? Marshall warns us that These two sets of surpluses (i.e., consumer's surplus and pro-\nducer's surplus) are not independent. . . . For when we have reduced the producer's surplus at\nthe value of the general purchasing power which he derives from his labour or savings we have\nreckoned implicitly his consumer's surplus too...\" [11, p. 831]. Regarding consumer's\nsurplus or producer's surplus as an absolute measure of the total surplus arising from his con-\njuncture, the statement is correct. If, in contrast, we are concerned with a money measure of\nthe change in his welfare brought about by a change in the set of prices confronting him, it be-\ncomes possible to separate the contributions to his welfare effected by changes in both factor\nand product prices. In this connection see Mishan [12, p. 394].\n"

The former implicitly predicts that as equilibrium is ap-\nproached the quit rate would tend toward zero. For March and Simon,\nequilibrium occurs when the sum of the individual worker's \"induce-\nment utilities\" equals his \"contribution utilities.\" \"Increases in the\nbalance of inducement utilities [i.e., remuneration, comprehensively de-\nfined] over contribution utilities [i.e., work expended] decrease the pro-\npensity of the individual participant to leave the organization, whereas de-\ncreases in that balance have an opposite effect\" [2, p. 93].\n\nThe balance is a function of two components: (i) the perceived de-\nsirability or undesirability of leaving the employer, and (ii) the per-\nceived ease or difficulty of movement from the employer. Simon and\nMarch's discussion of the factors affecting labor turnover is in terms of\nthe influences affecting these two components [2, pp. 93-106]. The dis-\ncussion is exhaustive and we do not repeat it here.\n\nWith respect to the framework afforded by the classical model, we as-\nsume that all workers seek to obtain the highest possible cash income\ngiven their individual preferences for money and leisure and the earnings\nopportunities available to them. Hence this assumption does imply that\nworkers will quit low-wage jobs in pursuit of high-wage jobs, and that\nthey will prefer quiet working conditions to noisy conditions, and so\nforth, but that they may vary among themselves with respect to their\nindividual terms of trade among all conditions describing the work\nsituation.\n\nIn order to subject this formulation to actual experience we delete\nthose variables for which data are unavailable and then advance a set of\nnine variables which give theoretical promise of explaining differences in\nthe quit rate among industries. Alas, industries\u2014not companies, not\nestablishments. Compromise imposed by the limitations of the data thus\nasserts itself at the outset. Ideally, the effort calls for establishment data.\n\n* Vladimir Stoikov is a member of the faculty of the Institute of Labor and Industrial Rela-\ntions, University of Illinois. Robert L.

                    "Incidence of the Corporation Income Tax in\nU.S. Manufacturing: Comment\n\nIn responding to previous critiques of our incidence study [4], we have\nconceded that our initial effort should eventually come to be replaced by a\nmore complex approach, involving a structural model in which price, wage,\nand shifting behavior are specified, and all equations are identified. While\nthe required data are exceedingly difficult to obtain, such a reformulation\nmay eventually be forthcoming. Such a model may not only provide better\ninformation on total shifting, but also show how shifting comes about and\nwhat ''direction\" it takes. It is with great anticipation, therefore, that one\nfollows beyond the opening pages of a recent article by R. J. Gordon, where\nsuch an approach appears to be taken.! But as the paper proceeds, it be-\ncomes apparent that no such improvement is offered.\n\nTax-less Model\n\nGordon begins with a model for a tax-less world. He defines profits as\nsales minus costs, with costs a function of quantity, wage rates, and ma-\nterial prices. Sales equals product price times quantity, where price is\ndetermined by a behavioral equation involving mark-up prices. This\nassumption is worth testing, although other behavior hypotheses might\nhave been used as well. In equation (7), Gordon attempts to present the\nsystem in reduced form. Some of the variables in (7) being unavailable, he\nproceeds to make certain substitutions, thus arriving at equation (12),\n\n1 See [2]. To simplify and to permit reference to our model, we consider the Gordon model\nonly in its rate of return formulation.\n",

                    "Lognormality and Concentration: Reply\n\nI appreciate Professor Quandt's kind comments regarding the spirit of\nthe technique I employed in testing for lognormality, as well as the reason-\nableness of my findings.\n\nQuandt's paper makes two major points. The first is that the hypothetical\nconcentration ratio (Quandt calls it Ry) is not a constant (as I have assumed),\nsince it is computed from a lognormal distribution whose parameters were\nestimated from the observed distribution. Therefore, he argues that I should\nhave concerned myself with the sampling distribution of (R\u2014 Ro)/o(- np\nrather than of (R\u2014 R))/cR.\n\nIam not at this time prepared either to affirm or to deny that my proce-\ndure biases the test against the rejection of lognormality. Colleagues with\nstatistical training support my position that treatment of Re as a constant is\npermissible since I only claimed to have performed a conditional test, i.e.,\nconsidered only samples from a population whose parameters are the ob-\nserved mean and variance of the logarithms of the size of firms and estab-\nlishments.\n\nI believe, however, that I can shed some light on Quandt's second major\npoint, i.e., that my argument would have been strengthened had I deter-\nmined whether the distribution of z can be approximated by IV(0, 1). I have\nsubsequently performed such an analysis employing the Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov test (as suggested by Quandt). The findings are quite clear\u2014in\nvirtually all cases, at the 5 per cent level of significance (two-tailed test), the\nnull hypothesis is rejected. Indeed, the distribution appears to be highly\nskewed, generally with 65-75 per cent of the sample values having negative\nsigns. In fact, under such circumstances it would not be unusual for a value\nof z- \u20142.5 to fall within the area of acceptance. Interestingly though, the\nshape of the distribution is such that only in rare cases would a value of\n21.96 fall within the region of rejection.\n\nThis observation goes a long way toward explaining the results of the\ndistribution-free test of significance reported on page 813 of my original\npaper. There I reported that for eighty-two 1958 value of shipments-com-\npany size distributions, the effect of employing the nonparametric test\nrather than the normal approximation was a net change in the classification\nof three industries from \"not lognormal\" to *lognormal.\"\n\nSpecifically, the null hypothesis was tested for 323 individual, observed\nratios using the distribution-free test of significance. In 291 cases, or 90 per\ncent of the cases tested, acceptance or rejection was identical with the de-\n",

                    "A special letter from the President of the American Economic Association to those mem-\nbers who have urged us to move the December 1968 meeting away from Chicago.\n\nDear Colleagues :\n\nThere are so many of you that I cannot reply individually. Many of you will feel,\nand I would not blame you for so feeling, that I have let you down, especially as,\nin our own jargon, our Utility Functions are so similar. I have no taste for elaborate\nself-justification. Nevertheless, this is one situation in which the reasons for an act\nwere more important than the act itself, and you deserve to know some further con-\nsiderations which affected my decision.\n\nThe problem, again in our economic language, is the nature of the moral produc-\ntion functions\u2014that is, what inputs produce what outputs? We all want to see a\nmassive change in human behavior and institutions, away from violence, cruelty,\nmalevolence and injustice towards a more gentle, benevolent, and just world. This is\nthe output we want, but if we are honest as social scientists we must admit that\nthere is much that we do not know about the inputs that are most likely to produce\nthis result.\n\nThe history of economic sanctions, for instance, which still largely needs to be writ-\nten, suggests at least that indirect sanctions\u2014hurting A in the hope that he will hurt\nB enough to change B's behavior\u2014are likely to be ineffective. I become skeptical,\ntherefore, on reflection about the benefits, in terms of an attempt to change political\nstructures and behavior, of the economic sanctions involved in changing the place of\nmeeting.\n\nSome costs of a move from Chicago also loomed larger in my mind as I moved to-\nwards a decision. The probability of legal action against the Association did not seem\ngreat, though, because of a lack of precedent the legal status of a letter of intention\nto hold a meeting at a certain time and place is obscure. Nevertheless there would\nbe a cost in terms of a destruction of trust in understandings given, a subtle but\nfragile structure on which much of our social organization depends. Another cost\npresented itself to me in terms of anxiety about the widening gap, in understanding\nand trust, between the academic community and the rest of society. This may have\nbeen brought about by a mainly random process involving the selection of occupants\nof powerful roles. It is a major task of the academic community, however, to reduce\nrandomness, even at some cost to itself. I feared that moving the meeting would have\ncontributed to widening this already dangerous gap.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, the decision to stay in Chicago may take a little pres-\nsure off those who are content with the present organization of violence, whether in-\nternal or external, and this I counted on the other side as a real cost of the decision.\nHere, the independent decision of other societies to move from Chicago made the\ndecision to stay morally easier, if psychologically harder. There are moral as well as\neconomic externalities. The decision to stay in Chicago should not be construed in\nany way as a criticism of those who decided to leave, and I hope it can be seen as\npart of a general pattern of creative protest.\n\nSome of you may legitimately feel that my decision was so much in error that you\nwill boycott the meeting. If so, I suggest that such individual action will be most\neffective if a personal letter is sent to the mayor's office, with a copy to me, so that\nwe can form some estimate of the number of people affected.\n\nThe value of the decision will depend very much on what happens at the meeting.\nWe will reserve rooms from 4:30-6:30 every afternoon, and from 9:30 on the Sunday\nevening of the meetings for special discussion sessions. These will not be programmed,\nand all members will be free to express themselves. Sessions on special topics may be\norganized by request.\n\nIn response to many petitions and communications a further vote of the executive com-\nmittee was taken in early October. The vote did not justify a change in the decision to\nremain in Chicago.\n\nKrwNNETH E. BourpiNG\nPresident\nAmerican. Economic Association\n",

                    "A HisTORICAL NOTE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\nFollowing the events which took place in Chicago during the week of the Democratic\nParty Convention I received large numbers of telephone calls, letters, and petitions from\nour members urging us to move the 1968 meeting, scheduled for Chicago, to another city.\nThere were a smaller number of communications on the other side. The question whether\nto stay in or move from Chicago therefore came to involve an active decision. The neces-\nsity for a decision was reinforced by the decisions of our sister associations\u2014the sociolo-\ngists to boycott Chicago for ten years, the psychologists to move their 1969 meeting, and\nfinally the historians' decision to move their meeting which was scheduled at the same\ntime as ours.\n\nI was in Montreal at the Congress of the International Economic Association from Sep-\ntember 2-6, and took the opportunity provided by the presence there of a considerable\nnumber of our members to call a special, informal meeting of members of the A.E.A. to\ndiscuss the matter. A variety of views were expressed, and a straw vote at the end of\nthe meeting resulted in the following ballot: 43 voted to move from Chicago, and 15\nvoted to stay; 34 said they would boycott the meeting if it was held in Chicago, and 24\nsaid they would not boycott the meeting. Even though this was only about 0.5 per cent\nof the membership, it was suggestive of the depth of feeling involved.\n\nHarold Williamson, our Secretary, and I therefore decided to meet in Evanston, at the\noffices of the Association, on September 7, with representatives of the Chicago Arrange-\nments Committee, the Convention Bureau and the hotels. In the meantime we had re-\nceived invitations from two other cities and we had polled all available members of the\nExecutive Committee by telephone or cable. The vote was evenly split.\n\nWe also consulted the other societies with which we have joint meetings; one society\nprobably would wish to move, and three to stay. In light of the split vote of the Execu-\ntive Committee the responsibility for the decision rested with me. Immediately after the\nmeeting, then, I made my decision and wrote the following letter, which was sent out to\nthe membership.\n\nDear Colleagues:\nThe events in Chicago during the Democratic Convention, and especially the police\naction as witnessed on television, have exploded a wave of shock through the minds\nof men, and created a sense of moral anguish, which I have shared, and which has not\nleft our Association unmoved. We have had to make a decision, therefore, on whether\nto move the December 1968 meeting, scheduled for Chicago, to some other city. The\nExecutive Committee of the Association has voted, by telephone canvass, 5 to move\nand 5 to stay; one member could not be reached. The decision therefore has become\nmy personal responsibility, as President of the Association. I have canvassed opinion\nas widely as possible. It would be feasible, though diffcult, to move to another city,\nend it is likely that a clear majority of our members would support such a move.\nFurthermore, a meeting in Chicago may be boycotted by a considerable number of\nour members, for reasons which I personally respect and share.\nNevertheless, my decision is to hold the meeting in Chicago, and not to move it,\nbecause I believe that the meeting can be used, more effectively, in Chicago, as a\nfulerum to help move the future rather than as a stick to belabor the past. I pro-\npose that we devote time, outside the formal program, to a searching discussion of\nthe agonizing discontents of our world, along with representatives of the city, with\nthe object of asking ourselves, both as professional economists and as citizens, what\nwe can do towards making the future better than the past. If we can turn the steam\nof our legitimate anger and anguish into some engine of solid proposals for social\nchange, the chance for a better future is enhanced. I hope my friends will forgive\nthis decision, and my foes will refrain from applauding it. I will welcome any com-\nmunications in the ensuing weeks which will help us in organizing constructive dis-\ncussions at the meetings. And I hope my successors will not have to make decisions\nas difficult as this one.\n\n\"The following supplemental letter was sent out later, and may help to clarify some of\n\nthe issues.\n",

            "found": "A COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVE THEORIES OF\nCORPORATE INVESTMENT BEHAVIOR\n\nBy Darre W. JoRGENSON AND CaLvIN D. SreBERT*\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to compare alternative theories of in-\nvestment behavior with regard to their ability to explain the investment\nactivity of corporations. The theories we consider have already under-\ngone substantial empirical testing and all of them deserve careful con-\nsideration as possible explanations of investment behavior. Unfortu-\nnately, the evidence already available is not sufficient to provide an\nadequate comparison of the alternative theories. Given a correct spe-\ncification of the lag structure underlying the investment process, time\nseries data for industry aggregates do not provide sharp discrimination\namong alternative explanations of investment behavior. Studies of\ncross section data on the investment activity of individual firms exhibit\nlittle stability over time so that any comparisons based on observations\nfor corporations must first provide a satisfactory explanation of the\nobservations for individual firms over time? In this study we concen-\ntrate on time series data for a small but representative sample of firms\nselected from the Foriwne Directory [14] of the 500 largest U.S.\nindustrial corporations for 1962. For each individual firm we determine\nan appropriate specification of the lag between changes in demand for\ncapital and investment expenditures under each of five alternative\ntheories of the demand for capital. We find that the results enable us to\ndiscriminate quite sharply among alternative theories of investment.\n\nThe point of departure for this study is the flexible accelerator model\nof investment behavior originated by Chenery [2] and Koyck [29]. In\nthis model attention is focused on the time pattern of investment be-\nhavior. The firm is taken to have a desired level of capital, determined\nby long-run considerations. The precise specification of the desired\nlevel of capital has been the subject of a wide variety of alternative\n\n* Dale W.

We shall then show that\nthis analysis is deficient in that it does not really assign a meaningful\nrole to money\u2014either as a consumer's or a producer's good.

Economists understand\nthoroughly just what this variable should measure: The opportunity\ncost of postponement of receipt of any benefit yielded by a public in-\nvestment. They agree also on the components that should be considered\nin making up this figure: Primarily the welfare foregone by not having\nthese benefits available for immediate consumption or reinvestment and\n(perhaps) a premium corresponding to the risk incurred in undertaking\ngovernment projects. Above all, economists are quite generally in ac-\ncord on the view that a very serious misallocation of resources can\nresult from the use of an incorrect estimate of the value of this variable\nin a cost-benefit calculation. Yet, while they agree that externalities\ncan play a significant role in the matter, there is some considerable\nquestion even about the direction of these effects. There is substantial\nobscurity and divergence of views in discussions of the implications of\ndifferences (if indeed there are any) in the degree of risk that is incurred\nwhen a given project is undertaken by a private firm on the one side\nand by government on the other. And as a result of these and other\nsources of shaky understanding of some basic principles, we are treated\nto what may with little exaggeration be described as a sorry spectacle\u2014\noutstanding members of our profession providing in print estimates of\nthe social discount rate ranging from four and one half to eight or nine\npercent.

            "found": "The purpose of this paper is to investigate some aspects of Soviet\npractices and policies with regard to export and import pricing and the\nruble exchange rate. The need for special investigation arises out of a\nnumber of peculiar institutional circumstances under which Soviet\nforeign trade is conducted: the existence of a foreign trade monopoly\nwhich transacts all imports and exports; the inconvertibility of the\nruble; the inconvertibility of the currencies of other Bloc nations with\nwhich the Soviet Union now transacts the bulk of its trade on a strictly\nbilateral-balance basis; and a highly manipulated internal price struc-\nture which differs markedly from that of any Western nation. The\npeculiar structure of internal prices is the result of: insensitivity to\nshort-run supply and demand forces; failure to include capital costs and\nrent in price; the inclusion of an item, profit, which probably has borne\nlittle or no quantitative relationship to profit in the Western sense; the\nemployment of very large and discriminatory sales taxes (turnover tax)\non consumers! goods often amounting to an average markup of 100 per\ncent; and the granting of large subsidies to producers' goods industries\nwhich have, at times, been required to support prices as much as 50\nper cent below cost.\n\nSoviet foreign trade pricing is by no means a complete mystery. On\nthe basis of elementary trade theory, it is obvious that, in Soviet trade\nwith Western nations, prices must be somewhere in the neighborhood\nof world prices since the Soviet Union is a small competitor on a large\nmarket and must generally play the role of price-taker. We also know\nthat in trade with the advanced Western nations, at least in the postwar\nperiod, the Soviets have been discriminated against, having to sell\nat lower than, and buy at higher than, world prices for a majority\nof commodities [11] [12] [19]. In intra-bloc trade, a large number of\npricing options are open in theory, and the Bloc nations have indeed\nbent constant effort since at least 1950 to find a pricing basis of their\n\"own.\" 'This to to be expected for reasons of prestige and because they\nconduct about two-thirds of their trade with each other.

Cnuv*\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to present an estimation technique which\nallows the economist to make a traditional interpretation of an em-\npirically estimated microproduction function where the underlying\nproduction process is assumed to be deterministic. To be specific, we\nmay estimate with mathematical programming a production function\nfor the firm which can be *so defined that it expresses the maximum\nproduct obtainable from the (input) combination at the existing state\nof technical knowledge\" [2a, pp. 14-15].\n\nWe shall argue here that the distinguishing features of firm produc-\ntion for a given industry may be embodied in attained values for certain\ntechnical parameters in an \"industry\" production function, differences\nin them reflecting relative scales of operation, varying organizational\nstructures, etc. In the spirit of M. J. Farrell [5] [6] who constructs an\nenvelope isoquant for the industry, the \"industry\" production function\nis conceptually a frontier of potential attainment for given input com-\nbinations. The production function for any particular firm may con-\nceptually be obtained from the industry function in terms of the firm's\nability to implement optimal values of parameters in the industry.\n\nOf course the frontier concept is not new, but heretofore our available\nquantitative tools have forced an unusual amount of effort to be directed\ntoward the interpretation of fitted functions\u2014their meaning in light of\nthe accepted theory, questions of identification of production functions\nversus factor demand equations and/or output supply equations, and\nthe like. A justification for this effort is that regression analysis and the\nestimation techniques available for multi-equation systems depend\nupon the specification of stochastic terms with zero means. For the goal\nof fitting a function through a series of observations on firms for output\nand several inputs, this implies that an *'average\" function is obtained.\n\nFrom the initial attempts of Reder [14] and Bronfenbrenner [2]\nthrough that of Marschak and Andrews [12] to the most recent liter-\nature (Hildebrand and Liu [9]), our theoretical notion of the \"average\"\nfunction and its meaning for the industry and its component firms has\nnot matured appreciably.\n\n* University of Wisconsin and University of Nevada.

                    "A Curious Solution to the Problem of\nOptimal Price Regulation\n\nSetting an optimal price for a decreasing-cost privately owned ''public\nutility? has been a persistent problem in welfare economics. On the one\nhand, if price is set equal to marginal cost of production, the utility must be\nsubsidized. This subsidy may entail undesired welfare redistribution. On\nthe other hand, the subsidy may be eliminated by setting price equal to\naverage cost, but then necessary conditions for efficiency in the sense of\nPareto may not be satisfied.!\n\nA curious but rather special solution to this problem was suggested by a\nrecent electric company advertisement. Where the utility had previously\nclaimed that \"electricity is penny cheap\u2014costs less than it did thirty years\nago,\" the new campaign offered an explanation; electricity is cheaper today\nbecause \"larger consumption means larger plants and more efficient produc-\ntion.\" If consumers take this message literally, they will know that there\nare economies of scale in electric generation and that an increase in their\ncollective consumption will bring about lower regulated electricity rates.\n\nThe advertisement raises two questions: Why would a regulated utility\nprovide its consumers with such information? What are welfare implica-\ntions of consumers possessing such information? In the process of answering\nthese questions, a third solution to the optimal regulated price problem\nwill appear, a solution in which it is possible for average cost price regula-\ntion to be Pareto efficient.\n\nI. Why It Pays the Utility to Inform Consumers\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, consider an economy which is in a stationary\nstate prior to the new advertising campaign. Periodically, say annually, a\npublic regulator sets a price 5 for the utility commodity Y equal to average\ncost (including normal profit) at the rate of output observed in the preced-\n\n1 See [1].\n",

Bach and Phillip Saunders, writing in this Review about two years\nago, presented data which showed that high school students who had com-\npleted an economics course scored significantly better on the SRA \"Test of\nEconomic Understanding\" than did students with no economics training.\nWhile such a result is perfectly consistent with notions most people hold\nthat students with training tend to score better on tests than students with-\nout training, Bach and Saunders cautioned the reader against concluding\nthat the higher scores were necessarily the result of the fact that students in\nthat group had taken a high school economics course while students in the\nother group had not. Rather, they said, **other variables (for example the\npossibility that brighter students tend to take separate courses in economics\nand the fact that economics courses are primarily offered in the \"better\nschools) may account for some of the difference [in mean scores]\" [1, p. 335].\n\nWhile Bach and Saunders indicated that they felt the course actually\ndid increase students' ability to answer questions like those on the Test of\nEconomic Understanding, their data did not allow them to make any more\npositive statements. This paper is an attempt to determine whether the\napparent relationship is truly causal or merely an artifact of the data. In\nthe process the study may help resolve the question of whether economists\nshould continue to recommend that high schools encourage college-bound\nstudents to take a course in economics.\n\nThe data in this paper, taken from a sample of university students and\nnot strictly analogous to those presented by Bach and Saunders, indicate\nthat neither ability, school size (as a proxy for quality), nor any of several\nother variables is sufficient to account for the advantage high school trained\nstudents showed on a test of economic knowledge given just before these\nstudents began their college principles course.\n\nOn the other hand, the data show that the initial advantage for these\ntrained students was much diminished during the period of a one-semester\nprinciples course.

Baumol describes two sectors\nin the economy: one \"technologically progressive\" and the other registering\nonly \"sporadic increases in productivity.\" The latter includes services ren-\ndered in municipal government, education, the performing arts, restaurants,\nand leisure time activities, as well as certain types of labor-intensive goods\nlike the \"fine pottery and glassware produced by the careful labor of skilled\ncraftsmen\" or \"large and stately homes\" [1, p. 41]. Baumol finds that inno-\nvation, capital accumulation, and economies of large scale are lacking in these\nactivities, and that in this sector of slow growth \"for all practical purposes the\nlabor is itself the end product\" [1, p. 416]. He also states that the actual\ngrowth of productivity in a given activity *is a manifestation of the activity's\ntechnological structure, which determines quite definitely whether the produc-\ntivity of its labor inputs will grow slowly or rapidly\" [1, p. 416]. I suggest\nthat the slow-growth activities with which Baumol is concerned reflect not the\ntechnological structure of their own production but the current technology of\nconsumption as well, and that the latter has been strikingly neglected in mea-\nsuring output. Consequently, the input-output ratio used to measure produc-\ntivity in goods industries is frequently inapplicable to the service industries.\n\nI\n\nBy their very nature, services entail little or no lapse of time between their\nproduction and consumption; goods, by contrast, are typically produced at\none point in time while distribution, purchase, and consumption in the sense\nof use occur later. Baumol's category of technologically unprogressive activity\nwhere *'the labor is an end in itself\" is also one where producer and consumer\nnormally have immediate, if not face-to-face, contact and where output com-\n",

                    "II\n\n\"Technological change affecting the nature of output has always posed prob-\nlems to the conventional definition of productivity in terms of the ratio of\nlabor input to output. How much more productive is today's skilled worker in\nthe appliance industry now that radios are transistorized, washing machines\nare automatic, televisions are colored, and refrigerators include freezer com-\npartments? Since *consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production\"\n[3, p. 625], the only proper way to evaluate any industry is to set up an\ninput-output ratio consisting of labor and consumption utility. The productiv-\nity of all labor inputs\u2014those embodied in goods as well as services, in \"tech-\nnologically progressive\" as well as backward industries\u2014should be measured\nby changes in this ratio, whether less labor is required to evoke a given level\nof satisfaction or the same labor produces more consumer satisfaction.\n\nWhile the obstacles to actual calculation of such measures are familiar and\ninsuperable, their implications for the problem at hand are perhaps not quite\nso familiar. Nobody attempts to measure the productivity of the home appli-\nance industry with a ratio of labor inputs to consumer satisfaction because the\nfirst term can be quantified and the second cannot, or at least not in compara-\nble fashion. But refrigerators can be counted and their cubic capacity mea-\nsured, their temperature levels and power consumption can be calculated, and\nthese various numerical quantities lead statisticians to report the output of an\nindustry in terms of physical production and to use these data for input-out-\nput ratios. And this \"production\" is taken to exist independently of consump-\ntion. Indeed the end result of consumer satisfaction is rarely considered. As\nBaumol points out in a footnote, we may have been deluding ourselves about\nthe automobile industry by measuring its growth in such quantitative terms.\nSuch numerical data do not exist, however, for the output of service indus-\ntries where \"the labor itself is the end product.\" All we can do is to count the\nnumber of appliance repairmen, noting that their services are required far less\nfrequently for today's refrigerators.\n\nAs we have seen in two activities\u2014barbershops and retailing\u2014the nature of\nservice output has altered quite as dramatically as in any goods-producing in-\ndustry. Others fit this judgment\u2014what is the correct definition of \"output\"\nfor measuring the productivity of appliance repairmen, or hospitals, or govern-\nment at any level? They all perform \"services\" that did not exist a generation\nago, and that exist today because the technologies of using goods, as well as\nmanufacturing them, have changed.\n\nThe essential characteristic of services is not that their technology is back-\nward but that there is an intimate relation between their production and con-\nsumption. Where this intimacy exists, little or no distinction can be drawn be-\ntween labor input and output and, more importantly, little or no separation\nexists between output and consumption. Consequently, if productivity is mea-\nsured along conventional lines using a ratio of labor input to output while out-\nput is defined in terms of labor, any growth in productivity is impossible,\nsince the input/output ratio so calculated is inescapably 1 or very close to it.\nIt is not, as Baumol claims, the \"technological structure\" of the activity that\n",

                    "that the retailer's information may be crucial to the consumer whether or not\nany purchase ensues. This activity cannot enter conventional figures for pro-\nductivity based on the volume of merchandise sold. Surely a selection from the\nthousands available in a department store or supermarket is more productive\nof consumer satisfaction than the same item purchased from a thinly stocked\ninventory offering little or no choice.\n\nThe retailer assists the producer in like fashion. Conventional economic\nanalysis, stressing the power of the market, implicitly assumes a feedback of\ninformation from the short-run supply-demand equilibrium to both suppliers\nand demanders, bringing about the adjustments to a longer-run equilibrium.\nBut there is little or no explanation of how, exactly, this feedback works. In\nfact, it is a major responsibility of the distribution system. Consumers shop-\nping in stores learn immediately about existing supplies and shape their de-\nmands accordingly. The stores! day-to-day operations enable producers to\nlearn about existing demands and to increase, cut back, modify or reprice\ntheir supplies. Retailers can supply information without any sales transactions\ntaking place\u2014indeed, presumably one of the most vital pieces of information\nto a supplier is that sales are not taking place, or that sales volume lags be-\nhind expectations. And these activities, or the efficiency with which they are\ncarried out, cannot, obviously, be estimated from conventional measures based\non the volume of merchandise sold.\n\nAside from providing information, retailing and marketing encompass much\nactivity that is not adequately represented by and indeed may not enter at all\nthe figures for physical volume of goods handled or for dollar sales. This mea-\nsure of output and productivity exists partly because of our current ways of\ndoing business. Imagine a change in the system. Suppose that every retail\nStore charged admission to its premises. Suppose that inside, near every mer-\nchandise display, there were a coin-operated tape recorder to give a prospec-\ntive buyer detailed information about the articles on display. Suppose that\nconsumers subscribed to the advertising now published by manufacturers and\nretailers. Envision push buttons for orders and conveyor belts for assembling\nmerchandise (already envisaged as the next technological breakthrough in re-\ntailing) with this operation also carrying a price tag. In such a system, the\ncosts of distribution, of getting the goods from producer to consumer,\" would\nsurely be very close to present figures for transportation. The output of retail\nstores would be revealed as the services\u2014to consumers\u2014of providing display\nand information, taking and filling orders, and so on. Efficiency could be mea-\nsured accordingly, and the total number of stores, their accessibility, the as-\nsortment of inventory and information they carried, would be important crite-\nria for distribution between producers and consumers.?\n\n*Between 1948 and 1963 sales per employee in supermarkets increased from $33.2\nthousand to $50.3 thousand [6, p. 1] [7, pp. 2-6, 2-7]. These figures in no way reflect\nchanges over the same period in service to consumers. The population per supermarket\ndropped from 76.3 thousand to 12.9 thousand while the average number of items stocked\ngrew from 3,750 (1950) to 6,800, the median hours of operation rose from 65 (1953) to\n72, and the percentage of stores open on Sunday went from 16 to 39 [5, pp. 17 and 275,\nquoting Progressive Grocer].\n",

A study conducted in Cleveland in 1964-65 [4] suggests that the typical family makes\nthree-quarters of its weekly food expenditures during one trip to a supermarket; the\naverage supermarket transaction includes twelve items. Most consumers choose a particular\nsupermarket for its cleanliness, the extent of variety, and the quality of its meats and\nproduce\u2014all \"services\" which do not enter retail sales figures.\n",

The physical transfer of what is bought must still occur, but\nit is frequently separated from the rest of the transaction. (Although the auto-\nmobile salesman may hand over the keys to a car, other consumer durables\nrequire installation after delivery, while the customer picks up soft goods di-\nrectly from shelves or at a wrapping desk, and takes delivery of goods in a\nsupermarket parking lot after paying for the purchase.) Here, too, capital ac-\ncumulation (the manufacturer's packaging machinery and the consumer's car)\nand technological change (everything from plastic materials to electric can\nopeners) epitomize today's means of moving goods from producer to con-\nsumer.\n\nManufacturers, retailers, and consumers all share in the distribution process\nand the functions that result in time and place utility. Hence it is misleading\nto measure the output of distribution and retailing as the quantity of goods\nmoved from producers to consumers. The definition errs by implying that dis-\ntribution consists of a one-way movement from manufacturer or grower to\nconsumer, and that it deals only with goods. In fact distribution involves in-\nformation and finance as well as goods, and a flow from consumer to producer\nas well as the reverse. Retailing performs important economic functions even\nwhen no goods at all are transferred. A more accurate picture of the output of\nretailing emerges from a look at what consumers buy. To say that 65 per cent\nof personal consumption expenditures was spent in retail stores omits a large\npart of what consumers do in retail stores.\n\nRetailers participate in consumer decisions as well as in their purchases. No\none decides to buy a 1965 Ford, and then that bundle of services\u2014installment\ncredit, used-car warranty, reputation for service and integrity, convenience of\nlocation\u2014he wishes to add to his Ford. Nor does any housewife decide to buy\na pound of butter, and then accompany it with the service of her choice\u2014a\nspeedy supermarket checkout, credit and delivery from a carriage trade gro-\ncer, late hours from a Ma and Pa operation.? Instead, the consumer's decision\nof what to buy is inextricably bound up with this decision of where to buy:\nthe housewife has a favorite supermarket and the car buyer selects his vehicle\nafter he has selected his dealer. For consumers, retailers exist as important\nspheres of economic activity quite apart from any specific item of merchandise\nthey carry.\n\n'The retailer operates as a display and information center. While manufac-\nturers' advertising and consumers! word-of-mouth evaluation may provide\n\"'pre-sold customers\" to many stores, retailers nevertheless allow the potential\nbuyer to preview a product. The shopper can look at the item, react and ask\nquestions about it, visualize it as part of his personal consumption pattern,\ncompare it with substitutes or alternatives, and then make his decision.

It is inaccurate, therefore, to equate distribution with the wholesale\nand retail industries, or to measure their productivity only in terms of the\nmerchandise handled there.\n\nPackaging is a case in point. The terminology of past generations explained\nthat the distribution system provided time and place utility, as form utility\nwas brought about by production. Wholesalers and retailers furnished storage,\nover time and in place; they provided the functions of sorting or \"breaking\nbulk\" and of physically transporting and transferring commodities from maker\nor grower to ultimate user. Each of these functions existed in the economic\nactivity of the general storekeeper, circa 1900. He purchased barrels of flour\nand cornmeal, sides of bacon, bolts of fabric, and cases of lye, literally provid-\ning \"stores\" of goods to the consumers who made frequent purchases of small\nquantities. The retail clerk dipped into barrels of grain or sugar, poured out\nthe syrup or kerosene, cut off the bacon or broadcloth to break up, for the\nconsumer, the bulk purchase of the store. The clerk measured, divided up,\nfilled a container or wrapped with paper and string, and transferred the com-\nmodity to its purchaser. The storekeeper and consumer were in personal con-\ntact, face-to-face if not hand-to-hand, over each item. These physical activities\nhave become obsolete with the packaging revolution of the mid-twentieth cen-\ntury, and the conventional measure of productivity finds the retailer handling\na larger quantity of goods. But he, independently, does not provide time and\nplace utility more efficiently than before. Instead, technological change at the\nproducing and consuming levels has reshaped the manner in which these func-\ntions of providing storage, assortment, breaking bulk, and physical transfer are\nperformed.\n\nBoth manufacturers and consumers now provide a considerable amount of\nstorage, through time and in place. Household equipment (refrigerators, freez-\ners or freezer compartments, cupboard and closet space) embodies, of course,\nboth capital accumulation and innovation on the part of consumers. So does\nthe larger fraction of (larger) incomes and wealth represented by consumer\ninventories, which obviate the need for frequent shopping. Innovation and\ncapital investment have also occurred among those firms which have their own\nwarehousing networks taking over the wholesaler's storage function. (Presum-\nably this change also reflects some scale economies.) The retailer's duties of\nmeasuring, dividing, and packaging have been almost completely shifted to\nmanufacturers, but only where consumers have acquiesced or participate will-\ningly in the new technology. (For example, prepackaging of meats and pro-\nduce has not yet become as common as for dry groceries, stockings, and razor\nblades where manufacturers have successfully standardized their output. The\nfreshness and quality of meats and produce vary markedly among individual\nitems, and consumers are less willing to substitute transparent wrappings for\nthe service of having these foods displayed for inspection and wrapped at\npoint of sale.) The personal contact between storekeeper and consumer has\ndiminished markedly with self-selection and the checkout counter.

                    "tion that dictates what services are still performed by barbers. Barbershops\ntoday chiefly supply haircuts, with styling (including tinting, waving, and de-\nsigning and fitting hairpieces) a recently introduced innovation which may or\nmay not become generally accepted. These services cannot be transferred to\nmanufacturers and consumers until technology develops a satisfactory substi-\ntute for the barber's skills, not merely his tools of clippers and scissors. But\nno a priori reason exists to suppose that the process of hair grooming must\nremain stagnant and impervious to technology; in the parallel field of wom-\nen's hairdressing, home permanents developed an effective substitute for much\nof the skilled services supplied by beauty operators. And if consumers! tastes\nare allowed the same role as productive technology (for they stand in the\nsame relation to any given demand function as does technology to any given\nsupply function), long hair may prove to be the decisive breakthrough for the\n\"unprogressive\" sector of hair cutting.\n\nThis short exercise leads, of course, to the more significant field of market-\ning, particularly retailing. Baumol refers to \"evidence that an ever increasing\nportion of the nation's labor force has been going into retailing and that a\nrising portion of the cost of commodities is accounted for by outlays on mar-\nketing . . . Ultimately, the activity involved is in the nature of a service and it\ndoes not allow for constant and cumulative increases in productivity through\ncapital accumulation, innovation, or economies of large-scale operation\" [1, p.\n420]. Again, one must examine the technologies of manufacturing and con-\nsumption to determine the exact nature of the output of retailers, and how far\nthey lag in productivity gains.\n\nGiven a model economy consisting of households and firms, with economic\nactivity divided into production and consumption, most analysts call retail\nstores firms and what goes on there, production. These decisions reflect the\neconomist's preoccupation with production rather than consumption, and his\nview of marketing as the service of getting goods from producers to consum-\ners. As in Baumol's description, marketing and retailing are seen as something\nadded to commodities, services which can be evaluated independently of the\ngoods involved. But actual cost estimates and the conclusions about produc-\ntivity that follow measure the output of marketing as the volume of goods to\nwhich these services are applied. Economists and marketing experts use the\nword \"channels\" to describe distribution: the capacity of the system, like that\nof any channel, is stated in terms of the volume handled. In this view, both\nretailer and consumer are passive, submissive to the manufacturer of commod-\nities, whose output of merchandise provides the measure of retailers! perfor-\nmance and of consumers! purchases. This emphasis on the volume of goods\nobscures the very great changes in technology that have occurred and leads to\nfaulty conclusions about relative economic growth.\n\nBaumol's mention of self-service, the supermarket, and prewrapping as hav-\ning \"increased the productivity per man hour of the retailing personnel\" [1,\np. 420] does not adequately recognize the significance of these and other inno-\nvations. Substantial changes in the technology of factories and households\nhave, in fact, radically altered the entire nature of retailing. Like barbers, re-\n",

Even\nfor the products of skilled craftsmen, whose wares presumably endure for\nsome time, consumption in the sense of effective demand frequently precedes\nproduction: cabinet-makers, tailors, and other artists typically work to order\nrather than to stock. To define the \"technological structure\" of any such ac-\ntivity requires, therefore, analysing consumption as well as production.\n\nA homely example may clarify this approach. Presumably barbershops fall\ninto Baumol's category of technologically unprogressive industries; certainly\nthe barber's labor is, for all practical purposes, the end product of the barber's\nshop. Census figures show that the number of barbershops has declined less\nthan employment: in 1933, some 117,832 establishments with 128,709 active\nproprietors reported 71,347 employees; in 1963, 105,516 barbershops had\n110,645 active proprietors and 73,503 employees [6, p. 1; 6, pp. 1-7]. Sales\nper worker amounted to $1,022 in 1933 and $4,923 in 1963; this threefold\nincrease should of course be deflated for any meaningful measure of growth.'\nIt is about as difficult to increase productivity (decrease labor input per unit\nof output) as in Baumol's example of a half-hour horn quintet; any attempt\nto do so is likely to be viewed not only with concern but with some horror by\nthe prospective customer. But is it correct to say that the inherent technologi-\ncal structure of this industry is such that innovation, capital accumulation,\nand the economies of large scale are lacking?\n\nTo answer the question requires considering the technology of consump-\ntion: since the barber's services cannot be stored by either producer or con-\nsumer, the customer uses up output while it is being produced. Most opera-\ntions require a one-to-one ratio, but other production functions are rare. And\nif one views what is consumed in barbershops then innovation, capital accu-\nmulation, and the economies of large scale have had enormous impact over the\npast half-century. I refer, of course, to the invention and development of the\nsafety razor.\n\nMany elementary textbooks cite the razor-blade industry to illustrate scale\neconomies; it has certainly also harbored capital accumulation and innova-\ntion. But these occurred within the household as well, as the barber's former\ncustomers became innovators mastering a new production function. Razors,\nwhich were formerly capital equipment to the barbershop industry, have be-\ncome consumer goods. A major shift of function from barbers to manufactur-\ners and consumers has occurred, and in the process the output of industry has\nradically changed. And clearly substantial economic growth has taken place in\nthe activity known as shaving, if not in the activity defined as barbershops. For\nconsumers to acquire the desired state of clean-shavenness requires less labor\ntoday than 60 years ago and probably represents a higher level of quality in\nterms of cleanliness and safety. This suggests that productivity has increased,\nbut does not credit any single *'technologically progressive\" sector with the\nincrease.\n\nIt is the current state of technology in both manufacturing and consump-\n\n!

                    "Macroeconomics of Unbalanced Growth: Comment\n\nIn a recent article in this Review [1], W. J. Baumol describes two sectors\nin the economy: one \"technologically progressive\" and the other registering\nonly \"sporadic increases in productivity.\" The latter includes services ren-\ndered in municipal government, education, the performing arts, restaurants,\nand leisure time activities, as well as certain types of labor-intensive goods\nlike the \"fine pottery and glassware produced by the careful labor of skilled\ncraftsmen\" or \"large and stately homes\" [1, p. 41]. Baumol finds that inno-\nvation, capital accumulation, and economies of large scale are lacking in these\nactivities, and that in this sector of slow growth \"for all practical purposes the\nlabor is itself the end product\" [1, p. 416]. He also states that the actual\ngrowth of productivity in a given activity *is a manifestation of the activity's\ntechnological structure, which determines quite definitely whether the produc-\ntivity of its labor inputs will grow slowly or rapidly\" [1, p. 416]. I suggest\nthat the slow-growth activities with which Baumol is concerned reflect not the\ntechnological structure of their own production but the current technology of\nconsumption as well, and that the latter has been strikingly neglected in mea-\nsuring output. Consequently, the input-output ratio used to measure produc-\ntivity in goods industries is frequently inapplicable to the service industries.\n\nI\n\nBy their very nature, services entail little or no lapse of time between their\nproduction and consumption; goods, by contrast, are typically produced at\none point in time while distribution, purchase, and consumption in the sense\nof use occur later.

Neverthe-\nless, if high population density is subject to substantial externalities the social\ncost of which rises at a cumulatively increasing rate, as Baumol persuasively\nargues, decentralization and suburbanization might reduce the diseconomies of\nhigh population density by more than the cost in lost economies.\n\nIn short, Baumol's article can be interpreted (although Baumol might not\ndo so himself) as a rationale for the use of central government power by such\nmeans as the Heller-Pechman proposal to preserve an aristocratic structure of\ntastes, existing structures of local government, and the concentration of popu-\nlation, the latter two of which are based on an outdated system of transporta-\ntion and communication. An alternative reading of Baumol's model suggests\nthat aristocratic tastes may be a function of income and not be in need of\nSpecial aids. The theoretical support given the use of federal finance to over-\ncome the effects of externalities in the cities' problems rests on an implied\nquestionable association of external economies with public goods which does\nnot always, and perhaps only seldom, exists. When public goods are subject to\nexternal diseconomies a priori welfare analysis points towards taxes or rents\ndesigned to modify the choices of individuals rather than subsidies from a cen-\ntral government financed from general revenues, and it points to the decen-\ntralization rather than the centralization of urban complexes.\n\nDraw A.

                    "A Paradox on Profits and Factor Prices: Comment\n\nAccording to an interesting paradox discovered by R. R. Nelson [2] and\nrediscovered (and extended) by P. A. Meyer [1], an increase in the price of\none factor of production can, in the short run, lead to an increase in the\nprofits of a competitive industry. The rise in costs can induce a reduction\nin output sufficient to raise product price by more than average variable\ncost.\n\nMeyer concludes that the paradox depends on a variety of complex con-\nditions. He states that profits respond positively to a factor-price change\n\"when the absolute value of the ratio of demand elasticity to supply elas-\nticity is less than the ratio of the share of all other productive factors to the\nshare of the higher-price factor. .. . It is more likely that profits willin-\ncrease (1) the smaller the share of the higher-priced input, (2) the more in-\nelastic is demand, or (3) the more elastic is supply\" [1, p. 539].\n\nHowever, if the industry total-variable-cost function has the form TVC\n\u2014g0\"(a\u00bb 1), the paradox will hold for any product-demand schedule of\nless than unitary elasticity, assuming the initial factor-price change causes\na proportional shift in the cost functions. The result appears to be quite in-\ndependent of the elasticity of the supply function (as represented by a) and\nof the share of the price-rising factor in total cost.\n\nA proof is relatively easy if factor supplies are infinitely elastic to the in-\ndustry. Marginal cost will be agQ^^. At an initial output Qi, with product\nprice equal to MC, total revenue will be agQ:*, total variable cost will be\n\u00a30s*, and gross profit ( \u00bb- TR \u2014 TVC) will be (a \u2014 1)gQy.\n\nNow we assume that an increase in a factor price causes the TVC func-\n",

                    "A Paradox on Profits and Factor Prices: Reply\n\nWhat I thought was a clearly stated corollary of the higher wage rate-\nprofits paradox may have been on reflection a somewhat cryptic concluding\nparagraph to my paper [4], particularly in view of Miller's and Trescott's\nComments. However, before discussing in Sections II and III the role of\nprofits as an entry and capital expansion signal, which is the main thrust\nof the Comments, let me briefly dispose of Trescott's Section I.\n\nI\nIt was shown that profits are positively related to the wage rate when\n(0) 25/25 \u00ab (1 \u2014 8)/8,\n\nwhere 7\u00bb is the elasticity of product demand; ss, the elasticity of short-run\nsupply; 1-8, the revenue share of capital; and f, labor's share! [4, p. 539].\n\"TTrescott correctly states that, if the industry total-variable-cost function\nhas the form TVC \u2014 gQ*(a\u00bb 1), the paradox holds when demand is inelastic.\nUnless I misunderstand the purpose of Trescott's Section I and the imper-\nspicuous statement that this result is independent of the elasticity of supply\nand factors! shares, Trescott offers the example to show (1) is incorrect.\nHis analysis is confounded, however, by mistaking the elasticity of total\nvariable costs for the elasticity of supply. Using usual notation, MC\n\u2014-dTVC/dQ-agQ*?, and by definition zs- MC dQ/Q4MC \u20141/(a\u2014 1),\nnot a as Trescott claims.? Since P \u2014 MC at equilibrium, TR\u2014 agQ\".

But entry\nis not necessary to meet the need for increased industry capital, any more\nthan to eliminate the short\u00edall in output. Existing firms will remedy the\none in the same process by which they remedy the other. Indeed, it is by\nadding to their capital that existing firms move their output toward the\npoint where LMC \u2014 P.\n\nThe point at which entry signals are being most visibly flashed is thus a\npoint of double disequilibrium. Industry output is deficient, and perhaps\nso is industry capital. But each existing firm's output is even more deficient,\nand so is its capital. Resolution of their particular disequilibrium by exist-\ning firms will be more than sufficient to eliminate the industry disequilib-\nrium, or rather convert it into one of an opposite sort.\n\nExistence of a homothetic production function, in which the (long-run)\nleast-average-cost output of the firm is not altered by shifts in factor prices,\nproduces misleading signals even in situations more conventional than those\nidentified by Meyer and Nelson.! The assumption of homotheticity implies\nthat all long-run equilibrium adjustments in industry output occur through\nchanges in the number of firms, while the output-size of each remains con-\nstant. Yet almost every stimulus to output change provides an incentive,\nhowever temporary, for the individual firm to change both its output and\nits stock of durable assets. However, the equilibrium stock of durable as-\nsets of the individual firm changes only when relative input prices change.\n\nThat paradoxical adjustments result from homotheticity can be il-\nlustrated by a possible response to an initial decrease in the wage rate. As-\nsume the cost-and-demand conditions for the Nelson-Meyer paradox are\nnot present, so the lower costs increase both output and industry profits.\nExisting firms may have an incentive to add to their capital in order to\nexpand output. Yet such additions are misguided. Entry of new firms will\neventually drive product price down to equality with average cost and re-\nstore each \"old\" firm to its original output. And at the original output for\nthe individual firm the appropriate quantity of fixed assets is less than the\noriginal endowment. The initial signals head the existing firms toward an\nexcessive increase in capital, and perhaps toward inappropriate forms of\ncapital as well.\n\nCorrespondingly, demand shifts may lead each existing firm to change its\nstock of durable assets in order to increase or decrease output. As long\nas relative factor prices remain unchanged, however, such changes are inap-\npropriate.\n\nThe signals are misleading in failing to discriminate between adjustments\nbetter made by changes in the number of firms and those better made by\n\n1 Such a case may not seem plausible a priori, but it can be constructed mathematically. For\npedagogical purposes, a specific production function having such properties is expressed by\nXi yu? -\u2014 Qus \u2014 0.2 Qiu? T 0.01 Q?\n\nwhere X and Y are the quantities of two inputs and Q represents the quantity of output. The\nleast-cost output of approximately 10.7 units is invariant with changes in input prices.\n"

Assuming no further changes in input prices, the long-run\ncompetitive equilibrium price for the industry is equal to the value of each\nfirm's LAC at output Q5, and that value is below Ps. Thus the industry's\nlong-run equilibrium output is greater than the short-run output (5g)\nbeing produced at price Ps.\n\nThus a signal to attract entry arises in a situation where industry output\nis too small. But entry is not necessary to correct the shortfall. For each of\nthe existing firms is also producing below its long-run desired output, that\nat which LMC \u2014 P. Adjustment of output by existing firms would be suf-\nficient to eliminate the shortfall in industry output and to drive price below\nminimum LAC. Entry will exacerbate this tendency.\n\nThe temporary rise in industry profits is also a signal that in some sense\nmore capital is needed in the industry. The increase in price of a variable\nfactor has increased the optimum amount of capital per unit of output for\nthe industry. If the long-run optimum-output-size of firm is constant, the\nappropriate amount of capital per firm is also increased. Neither of these\nadjustments requires entry, but the signal which reflects the need for these\nadjustments tends to stimulate entry.\n\nIt is entirely possible that the appropriate stock of capital for the in-\ndustry as a whole is increased, even though industry long-run-equilibrium\noutput is reduced.

                    "A Paradox on Profits and Factor Prices: Comment\n\nAccording to an interesting paradox discovered by R. R. Nelson [2] and\nrediscovered (and extended) by P. A. Meyer [1], an increase in the price of\none factor of production can, in the short run, lead to an increase in the\nprofits of a competitive industry. The rise in costs can induce a reduction\nin output sufficient to raise product price by more than average variable\ncost.\n\nMeyer concludes that the paradox depends on a variety of complex con-\nditions. He states that profits respond positively to a factor-price change\n\"when the absolute value of the ratio of demand elasticity to supply elas-\nticity is less than the ratio of the share of all other productive factors to the\nshare of the higher-price factor. .. . It is more likely that profits willin-\ncrease (1) the smaller the share of the higher-priced input, (2) the more in-\nelastic is demand, or (3) the more elastic is supply\" [1, p. 539].\n\nHowever, if the industry total-variable-cost function has the form TVC\n\u2014g0\"(a\u00bb 1), the paradox will hold for any product-demand schedule of\nless than unitary elasticity, assuming the initial factor-price change causes\na proportional shift in the cost functions. The result appears to be quite in-\ndependent of the elasticity of the supply function (as represented by a) and\nof the share of the price-rising factor in total cost.\n\nA proof is relatively easy if factor supplies are infinitely elastic to the in-\ndustry. Marginal cost will be agQ^^. At an initial output Qi, with product\nprice equal to MC, total revenue will be agQ:*, total variable cost will be\n\u00a30s*, and gross profit ( \u00bb- TR \u2014 TVC) will be (a \u2014 1)gQy.\n\nNow we assume that an increase in a factor price causes the TVC func-\n",

                    "Full Employment Policy and Economic Growth: Comment\n\nIn a recent paper in this Review [4], R. R. Nelson examined the influ-\nence of an economy's potential growth rate, that is, the rate of labor force\ngrowth plus the rate of (labor-augmenting) technical progress, on the fiscal\nand monetary policies required for sustaining full employment growth.\nThe question he posed was: \"Is it true that if labor force growth or techni-\ncal progress is more rapid, a more expansionary governmen\u00ed policy is\nneeded?\" [4, p. 1181]. He answered that \"'the faster are technical progress\nor labor force growth, the tighter must be stabilization policy\" [4, p. 1187].\nIn other words, the interest rate will be higher and/or the government\nsurplus will be greater or the deficit smaller.\n\nI wish to demonstrate in this note that Nelson's conclusion with regard\nto the stabilization role of fiscal policy requires an important qualification\nif savers' behavior is somewhat more *'realistic\" than the assumption of the\nconstant saving-income ratio implies.! This assumption is a convenient one\nthat has seen almost universal and sometimes indiscriminate adoptions in\ngrowth model analysis. I do not disparage its justifiable uses. However, I\nwant to emphasize that the assumption might be inappropriate when wealth\nis recognized as an important variable. This is certainly the case when\ngovernment deficits and, hence, public debt are explicitly considered.\n\nFiscal policy is applied in the long run to counterbalance the gap between\ninvestment and saving at full employment. The continuous saving-invest-\nment imbalance on the private accounts must reflect a more fundamental\nlong-term disequilibrium between demand for and supply of assets in the\nprivate sector. This takes place when the adjustment mechanism fails either\nbecause the interest rate is inflexible or because the required rate of return\nis unresponsive to changes in the interest rate. While investment depends\n\n! He was not unaware of such a possibility. There would have been no serious problem if a\nmodification like this leads to no essential change in conclusions.\n",

Anne Scitovsky [1], in\ncomparing the costs of treating certain medical problems in 1964-65 with\nthose in 1951-52, arrives at results conceptually superior to those currently\nemployed for the CPI, since the latter are based on prices of medical inputs\n\n* We briefly consider important neglected factors that may affect our conclusion. An in-\ncreased government deficit leads to an increase in public debt relative to output, which may\ndepress the market rate of interest (on this, see [8]). It will then raise the capital-output ratio.\n\"Then the cutoff rate of growth 5* will be lowered. For this influence to be noticeable, however,\n(1) the market rate of interest must be sensitive to the relative volume of outstanding public\ndebt and (2) the desired rate of return on capital must be responsive to the rate of interest.\nThere are some grounds for doubting them. More important in this context is the incidence of\ntax policy. When firms are decision-making units independent of households (as they actually\nare) with part of tax collected at the source of income (i.e., in the form of the profits tax), the\ndesired rate of return on capital determining the capital-output ratio is gross of the profits\ntax. When the profits tax rate is raised, the capital-output ratio will be lowered if the firms\nwish to realize a given net rate of return on capital. (On some empirical evidence supporting\nthis thesis, see Sato [5]). Hence, a lowering of the tax rate (esp. the profits tax rate) in the face\nof a rise of \u00bby* will raise x so that a lowering of 5* will result. Finally, it is also necessary to con-\nsider how the private demand for wealth is influenced by changes in the interest and tax rates.\n",

                    "Costs of Medical Treatment: Reply\n\n1. Barzel argues that the substitution of treatment by specialists for treat-\nment by nonspecialists has been the result of demand and hence cannot be\ntermed \"forced.\" He cites as evidence my own data on the treatment of fore-\narm fractures which, while showing an increase in the use of specialists, give\nthe appearance that the two forms of treatment (by specialists and nonspecial-\nists) continued to exist side by side in 1965. I say \"appearance\" because in\nfact they existed side by side only in the simplest cases requiring a splint only\n(where treatment by specialists rose from zero to 31 per cent between 1051\nand 1965), while in the more complicated cases requiring a reduction (with or\nwithout a general anesthetic), all cases were treated by specialists in 1965 as\nagainst only 40 per cent, resp. 30 per cent, in 1951. Furthermore, even in the\nsplint-only cases, it was not so much the patient who chose the specialist as\nthe nonspecialist who was no longer willing to treat the case. Specialization in\nmedicine has become necessary as a result of the tremendous proliferation of\nmedical knowledge, which makes it impossible for any one physician to master\nthe whole field, much less keep up with the constant advances. In addition,\nlegal considerations\u2014i.e., the fear of malpractice suits\u2014have played an ex-\ntremely important role both in the increased use of specialists and in the in-\ncreased use of diagnostic tests of all kinds. While I would not rule out demand\nas a factor since there are undoubtedly patients who choose a specialist of\ntheir own volition, I believe the primary reason for the increased use of spe-\ncialists is physicians! reluctance, not to say unwillingness, to treat cases out-\nSide their special field.' In this sense, I believe I am justified in speaking of\n\n\"This view is supported by a recent study of medical care patterns under Group Health\nInsurance in the New York-New Jersey area [1, pp. 114-15]: \"In evaluating patterns of\nspecialist use by various population segments, it should be remembered that differences of\napparent significance are not necessarily indicative of consumer choice. The fact that the\nuse of surgical specialists increased sharply with age is less likely to be asociated with the\npreference of older people than with types of surgery predominating at various age levels.\nSimilarly, higher rates of specialist use in certain areas probably reflect local medical cus-\ntoms and facilities as much as individual residents' attitudes toward specialists. The occu-\npation category of the subscriber was associated with the most consistent variations in\nuse of specialists. Differences here frobably reflect the exercise of consumer choice.\" (Italics\nadded.)\n",

Sidrauski [1] claimed that: *in a growth model in which utility\nmaximizing families are the basic economic unit of the system, the long-\nrun capital stock of the economy is independent of the rate of monetary\nexpansion. A rise in the rate of monetary expansion . . . does not affect\nsteady state consumption.\" This conclusion seems to be at variance with\nthe implications of my growth model [2] that: \"the proportionate rate of\ngrowth of the money supply affects the long-run equilibrium capital in-\ntensity. A rise in the former will produce a permanent increase in the latter.\nIn this manner the long-run marginal product of capital is negatively re-\nlated, and the long-run real wage is positively related, to the proportionate\nrate of growth of the money supply.\" What accounts for the difference\nbetween us?\n\nOur models differ in several respects. First, mine contains three assets:\nmoney, capital, and bonds whereas his contains two assets: money and\ncapital. Second, I postulated independent saving and investment functions\nand assumed that investment plans are always realized. He followed the\nneoclassical nonmonetary tradition and assumed that saving and invest-\nment plans always coincide at every moment of time. Third, I assumed that\nthe rate of price change is positively related to the excess demand for goods.\nHe assumed that prices change so quickly as to produce a zero excess flow\nsupply of money, or excess demand for goods, at every moment in time.\n\nIn this Comment I prove that the assumption of instantaneous adjust-\nment is necessary for the conclusions of his model. The at/empt by utility\nmaximizing families to optimize over infinite horizons is not sufficient to\nproduce monetary neutrality in long-run equilibrium. Were he to relax the\nassumption of instantaneous adjustment in the money market (or its dual,\nthe commodity market) and allow the existence of forced saving,\nthen nonneutrality would follow. This is not the only way to produce\nmonetary nonneutrality in the long run. In my article [2, p. 462, note 12] I\nproved that one of two conditions is sufficient to produce monetary non-\n",

                    "344 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n\n'The method of income redistribution suggested by neoclassical\neconomics consists of a neutral personal tax-subsidy scheme, i.e., a\ndirect transfer of purchasing power among individuals. But even apart\nfrom the problem of neutrality, such schemes cannot be relevant if no\ninstitutional means exist for their implementation as is typically the\ncase in underdeveloped surplus labor economies. There the most im-\nportant if not the only means of redistribution may consist of increasing\nthe rate of employment.\n\nIf a positive wage rate is fixed in an unemployment economy but\nmarkets are otherwise free to adjust, competitive free market hiring\nwill be carried to the point where the value of labor's marginal product is\nequal to the given wage rate. Then, if profit maximization is undertaken\nfor the purpose of generating the largest feasible investable surpluses,\nthe competitive free market process leads to the fastest attainable rate\nof economic growth. In the process unemployment is absorbed as fast as\npossible, but current employment is restricted to just that level needed\nto stay on the maximal growth path.? In this case consumption is only an\nintermediate activity with the function of physically sustaining the\nlabor engaged in producing for the future. It can be shown, however,\nthat if society values redistributed current consumption also per se,\ncompetitive free market processes result in a lower rate of employment\nand a higher rate of investment relative to current consumption than\njustifiable on social welfare grounds. Furthermore, if it is the rate of\ninvestment which is being held constant and the institutional wage\nrate is a policy parameter, a higher rate of employment and consump-\ntion may be attained by a planned and controlled allocation of resources\nthan by market competition.\n\n'Two points need to be mentioned. First, for the attainment of a\nwelfare optimum, intervention in the market process may be necessary.\n'This is so because in the short run, when the stock of other resources is\nfixed, raising employment above its competitive free market level\nnecessarily lowers labor's marginal product from equality to below the\nfixed wage rate. Hence, profit maximizing entrepreneurs can be induced\nto exceed the free rate of hiring only if the difference is made up to them\nby a suitable payroll subsidy. Second, since an induced increase in the\ncurrent level of redistributed consumption may result in lowering the\nrate of investment and, consequently, the rate of growth of employ-\nment and consumption, each form of intervention\u2014as well as non-\nintervention\u2014implies a social judgment about the desired balance\nbetween current and future welfare.\n\n\"These observations give a clue as to what types of models are suitable\nfor planning in surplus labor economies. First, since the current level\n\n? See Lefeber and Chakravarty [5].\n",

Since the times of Edgeworth it has been known that\nthe outcome of a two-person bargain is substantially unpredictable,\nexcept for the fact that it will occur within the so-called \"trading area,\"\nand that, in order for a solution to have some features of stability, it\nshould be \"efficient,\" i.e., it should be located on a tangency point of the\ntwo bargainers' indifference lines (the locus of such points is the so-\ncalled contract curve, or set of **Pareto-optimal\" contracts).\n\nEdgeworth's model, as well as several of its extensions, are essentially\nof a static nature except for a recent contribution by J. G. Cross [4].\nTime plays no role in spite of the fact that it is precisely the cost of time,\nboth in terms of money and utility, that often motivates the bargaining\nprocess.\n\nCross has suggested that the influence of time upon bargaining may\nassume different forms. First, it appears in a discounting function if the\nplayers discount future benefits (as a reflection of one's impatience).\nSecond, the utility of agreement itself may change with the calendar\ndate (nuclear disarmament is probably more important today with\nmany countries that can potentially produce nuclear weapons than it\nwas fifteen years ago when there were only two such countries). Third,\nthere usually is a fixed cost of bargaining that recurs at each stage of\nthe negotiations. This cost may vary from the simple personal incon-\nvenience of having to spend time in this rather than other occupations,\nto the immense cost in terms of foregone profit and fixed cost of a tem-\nporarily unproductive plant which is borne by a strike-bound firm.\n\nIn another paper [2] I have shown that the introduction of time as an\nexplicit variable in the utility function of each bargainer leads to a\nrefinement of the classical conclusions, namely, (1) the outcome of a\nbargaining process may be \"stable\" even though it may not be efficient;\nand (2) the evaluation of time is an important determinant of the so-\ncalled bargaining power and the lower the evaluation of time of any\n\n* The author is associate professor of economics at the Fondazione L.

The interest in tariff theory has also been kept alive with-\nin a modern, neoclassical framework. Few are the years that have not\nseen some kind of contribution to the theory of tariffs.\n\nBefore burdening the public with a new article on the subject, an\nexplanation might therefore be warranted. Even though much has\nbeen published, and even though the problem in its essence should not\nbe difficult to deal with, we think that we are justified in saying that\nno simple yet general treatment of the problem has been given. This\nbeing the case, an attempt at solving the question of the effects of tariffs\nwithin the context of the standard trade model seems justifiable.\n\nNow, what one means by the theory of tariffs is not completely clear.\nIn fact, it consists of at least two quite distinct branches. The first\nbranch deals with the effects of tariffs on prices, economic welfare, etc.,\nunder fully competitive conditions. The second branch discusses tariffs\nin the presence of market imperfections and distortions, and has so far\ndealt only with the fairly limited question of whether the tariff is a\nlegitimate policy measure for dealing with a distortion, and with com-\nparing tariffs with other means for correcting the distortions. We are,\nin this paper, concerned with the first type of tariff theory.\n\nEven within this first type there typically exists a distinct cleavage\nbetween what might be called the positive theory of tariffs and the wel-\nfare side of the theory, between the effects of tariffs on prices and in-\ncome distribution on the one hand, and the question of the optimum\ntariff on the other. Most economists would probably agree that such a\ncleavage has to exist because of the nature of the problems involved.\n\nThis point of view, while not being directly mistaken, is nonetheless\nsuperficial and has been one of the reasons why economists have tended\nto treat the theory of tariffs in a partial and incomplete fashion, rele-\ngating to different compartments variables that should have been\ntreated at one and the same time. We will treat our problem within the\nconfines of the standard two-by-two-by-two trade model, i.e., a model\n\n* Theauthors are, respectively, docent in international economics at the University of Lund,\nSweden, and acting professor of economics at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark.\nThe research for this paper was made while both authors were visiting associate professors\nof economics at the University of California, Berkeley.

Introduction\n\nThis paper attempts to provide a unified theory of production from\nnatural resources. A single model of an industry is used to describe a\ndynamic process of recovery from such technologically diverse resources\nas fish, timber, petroleum, and minerals. Recovery from each of these\nresources is seen as a special case of a general model, depending upon\nwhether the resource is replenishable, and on whether production ex-\nhibits significant externalities. A model of centralized management,\nwith particular reference to *common property\" resources, such as\nfisheries, under stationary conditions, is also discussed and compared\nwith competitive recovery in the stationary state.\n\nThe paper builds directly upon, and has been much influenced by,\nthe basic contributions of Gordon [6] and Scott [11] [12].\n\nII. Environmental Technology\n\nThe economy of man consumes two fundamental kinds of naturally\noccurring resources: (1) Replenishable resources, such as fish, timber,\nbison, and the whooping crane, and (2) nonreplenishable resources,\nsuch as petroleum, natural gas, and the products of mines. The second\ncategory is often called ' exhaustible resources,\" which is something\nof a misnomer since both types of resources are capable of exhaustion.\nThe American bison, once of value to the American economy, is such\na case, as also were the native trout of Lake Michigan.! This particular\ndichotomy is important analytically in that the first category of re-\nsources is capable of regeneration, as man consumes a flow of the re-\nsource, while the second represents a fixed stock whose inventory can\nonly be diminished over time.\n\nFor purposes of production analysis, one of the most important tech-\nnological features of a replenishable commercial resource like a fish or\n\n* 'The author is professor of economics, Brown University.

The biotic potential of fish is so large that complete extinction may be very\ndifficult. With the Lake Michigan trout it was invasion by another predator\u2014the sea lamprey\n\u2014that destroyed the trout harvest. The lamprey have since been brought under control, and\nwith restocking, the lake may again become an important fishery resource if pollution does not\nwin the battle.\n"

                    "Chicago Economists, Deficit Budgets, and the Early 1930s\n\n\"There is clearly great similarity between the views expressed by [Henry\nC.] Simons and by [John Maynard] Keynes\u2014as to the causes of the Great\nDepression, the impotence of monetary policy, and the need to rely exten-\nsively on fiscal policy\" [2, p. 7]. Coming from an authority no less than Pro-\nfessor Milton Friedman, this statement undoubtedly surprised economists who\nare unaccustomed to hearing Simons and Keynes mentioned in the same\nbreath. The more familiar impression of the views of these two giants was\nstruck five years before Friedman's remarks: in a much-celebrated contro-\nversy [9, 5, 1], Professor Lawrence Miller charged that a School of econom-\nics crystallized at the University of Chicago during the tenure of Professors\nKnight, Simons, and Viner and that this School was \"consistently less enam-\nored with Keynesian ideas and terminology than the rest of the profession\"\n[5, p. 68]. This apparent conflict is heightened by Friedman's lengthy com-\nparison of the Keynes and Simons interpretations of 1929-33: they both argued\nthat it is collapse of confidence which sets off a demand for liquidity, that this\ndemand cannot be met but the attempts to meet it force liquidation, and that\nthis liquidation includes bank loans with a resultant decline in the quantity of\nmoney [2, p. 6]. In short, Friedman argues that both Simons and Keynes\nemphasized the state of business expectations and the desire for liquidity. Ac-\ncordingly, Simons and Keynes each turned to fiscal policy\u2014changes in gov-\nernment expenditures and taxes\u2014as their primary tool for promoting eco-\nnomic stability [2, p. 9]. Friedman suggests that the views which Keynes\nand Simons held in common were also widely shared by Simons! contemporar-\nies [2, p. 4], thereby making Chicago students *much less susceptible to the\nKeynesian virus than their contemporaries in London, England, and Cam-\nbridge, Massachusetts, who were taught that the Great Depression was a nec-\nessary and ultimately healthy purgative\" [2, pp. 8-9].\n\nFriedman's appraisal of his predecessors surprises many observers because\nthey have become accustomed to associating Chicago economists with the advo-\ncacy of limited government and the distrust of discretionary authority in gov-\nernment [5, p. 65]. While these themes might indeed characterize much of\ntheir work, they should not be allowed to obscure the facts that Frank H.\nKnight, Henry C. Simons, Jacob Viner, and their Chicago colleagues argued\nthroughout the early 1930s for the use of large and continuous deficit budgets\nto combat the mass unemployment and deflation of the times, that they\n",

                    "The Average Level of Schooling and the Intra-Regional\nInequality of Income: A Clarification\n\nI. Introduction\n\nIn the March 1967 issue of this Review, A. Al-Samarrie and H. P. Miller\n[2] and D. J. Aigner and A. J. Heins [1] attempt to explain state-to-state\nvariations in income concentration by means of cross-sectional multiple\nregression analysis for the United States. Aigner and Heins indicate that\ntheir purpose is \"to report further evidence of the tendency for the personal\nincome of a region to be more equally divided the more maturely developed\nis the region\" [1, p. 175]. Al-Samarrie and Miller conclude that the level of\neducation is \"highly [inversely] correlated with income concentration\"\n[2, pp. 61 and 71]. Simon Kuznets examined international and interregional\ndata and reported that countries and regions at a lower level of income tend\nto have a greater income inequality [5] [9]. The conclusions of these and\nother writers support the commonly held view that the distribution of in-\ncome is more equal the higher the level of income or schooling in a region.!\n\nAigner and Heins state that *'there is no formal theory available which\nsatisfactorily concerns itself with the relationship between development\nand the inequality of incomes\" [1, p. 176]. They also indicate that they have\nnothing more than a \"'naive theory\" for relating their variable for level of\nschooling (which they use to \"describe the basic skill level of each state\npopulation\") to income inequality [1, pp. 177-78]?\n\nI have two purposes in writing this note. I wish to show that a specific\ntheory, the theory of investment in human capital, may be used to demon-\nstrate that, across regions, the level of schooling can be related to income\n\n1 This view is so common among economists that it is frequently expressed in textbooks on\neconomic principles without qualifications. For example, see P. Samuelson [11, p. 111, note to\nfigure 6-3(a) ].\n\n? Kuznets indicates that we lack **a firm set of links between the observable changes in the\nproduction structure that constitute economic growth and the observable associaled changes in\nthe income distribution\" [9, p. 2]. In his discussion of the relationship between the level and\ninequality of income there is an absence of an explicit consideration of the effect of training or\nschooling on the distribution of income (8] [9].\n",

It is not surprising, therefore, that the average level of schooling\nand the inequality of income have a negative simple and a positive partial\ncorrelation across the states of the United States.

It might be\nuseful to perform an international analysis if the relevant data were avail-\nable.\n\nThe changes in the distribution of schooling associated with economic\ngrowth are likely to result in an increase in income inequality, since the\naverage level of schooling increases, and even if schooling inequality were\nto decline, its decline would tend to be small.\n\n"

This tends to produce a\nnegative relation between the average level of schooling and the average\nrate of return.? Although the sign of the net effect is indeterminate, the\nalgebraic value of the correlation coefficient between the average level of\nSchooling and the average rate of return would be lower the greater the rela-\ntive interregional mobility of skilled labor.'? Indeed, migration may gen-\nerally result in a negative correlation across the regions of a country.\n\nThe effect of changes in either the supply or the demand conditions for\nhuman capital on schooling inequality depends on which parts of the\ndistribution of schooling increase their level of schooling. The coefficient\nof variation of years of schooling, [Var(S)/5?]!?, seems to decline with the\nrise in the level of schooling associated with economic growth, but it is not\nclear whether the variance of years of schooling increases or decreases.!!\n\nThus, there appear to be no a priori reasons, nor consistent empirical\nfindings, for expecting the average level of schooling to be negatively related\nto the inequality of schooling, nor for expecting a positive relation between\nthe latter parameter and the average rate of return. The average level of\nschooling and the average rate of return may tend to be negatively cor-\nrelated among regions for which there is much mobility of skilled labor.\n\nSince it appears that the rate of return is more powerful than the level\nof schooling in explaining income inequality [5, Chs. 3 and 4], a negative\ncorrelation between the level of schooling and the rate of return would result\nin a negative simple correlation between the level of schooling and the\ninequality of income. Thus, it is consistent with economic analysis for the\nlevel of schooling and the inequality of income to have a positive partial\nbut a negative simple correlation across the regions of a country. The level\nof schooling and the rate of return are less likely to be negatively correlated\nacross countries than across sections of a country, and, therefore, it is less\nlikely that a negative simple correlation between the level of schooling and\nincome inequality would appear in an international analysis.\n\nV. Conclusions\n\nCeleris paribus, the higher the average level of schooling in a region, the\ngreater the inequality of income in that region. If simple correlation co-\nefficients are examined, other variables (in particular, the average rate of\nreturn) may produce a negative simple correlation.\n\n? Empirical studies for the United States indicate that rates of migration across states tend\nto increase with higher levels of schooling [3, p. 89 note] [6]. The greater relative mobility of\neducated workers is due, in part, to the components of the information and migration costs\nwhich are largely independent of the level of schooling.\n\nA higher rate of migration for educated workers depresses the average rate of return from\ntraining in the area of in-migration (an area with high levels of income and schooling) and in-\nCreases the average rate of return in the area of out-migration (an area with low levels of in-\ncome and schooling).\n\n1?'This may explain the significant negative correlation between the average rate of return\nand the average level of schooling in Table 1.\n\n3! Although the correlation between level and inequality of schooling is negative in the United\nStates, it is positive for the provinces of Canada and the regions of the Netherlands [5, Ch.\n3 and Table F-1].\n"

The partial slope coefficient of each\nof the three variables is significantly positive at a one per cent level. These\nresults are consistent with the hypothesis derived from the model in section\nII which relates income inequality to schooling.\n\nIV. Relationships Among the Parameters\n\nThe signs of the correlation coefficients among the average level of school-\ning, the average rate of return, and the inequality of schooling are not clear\na priori. The average rate of return is largely determined by average supply\nand demand conditions for funds for investment in human capital.? The\ninequality of schooling depends primarily on the inequality in these condi-\ntions within the region.\" It is not clear that the level and inequality of the\nsupply and demand conditions for funds need be related.$\n\nIf economic growth resulted in changes in only the demand conditions for\nhuman capital, there would be a rise in the rate of return and the level of\nschooling. However, the increases in wealth and the improved capital\nmarkets associated with economic growth would lower the cost of funds for\ninvestment in human capital, and this would raise the average level of\nschooling but decrease the average rate of return from schooling. Thus, the\neffect of economic growth on the rate of return is ambiguous.\n\nThe low level of income and the less perfect capital markets of less devel-\noped regions increase the rate of return. If inter-area migration did not\nexist, the smaller demand for human capital by less developed regions\n\n5'The level and the elasticity of the average supply curve for funds for investment in human\ncapital largely depend on the level of wealth in the economy and the stage of development of\nthe capital market. The level and the elasticity of the average demand curve for funds are, in\npart, derived from the demand by the economy for human capital and the average level and\nelasticity of ability.\n\n? The inequality in the supply conditions for funds depends primarily on differences in in-\ndividual wealth and access to funds, while the inequality in demand conditions depends\nlargely on differences in ability.\n\n* Although the average rate of return and schooling inequality are significantly positively\ncorrelated for all of the states (for all males and white males only), they are uncorrelated for\nthe states of the South and white non-South and significantly negatively correlated for the\nstates of the non-South and white South [5, Ch. 3 and Table F-1].\n",

The Model\n\nOn the basis of an earlier article (with different notation) in this Review\n[4], it can be shown that if, for the ith person, Ys,; were income after S;\nyears of investment in schooling, Y were the average zero schooling level of\nincome, r; were the adjusted rate of return from schooling,* and U; were the\nresidual, then approximately,\n\n(1) Ln (Ys,) ^ Ln Yo t ri$; d- U;.\n\nFor simplicity, let us neglect the residual U; and assume that all income a-\nbove Y, is due to investments in training. Then, if we calculate the vari-\nances of both sides of equation (1), we obtain\n\n(2) Var (Ln Y;) \u2014 Var (r;$3),\n\nwhere Var means variance. The relative variance of income depends on the\nabsolute variance of the product of the adjusted rate of return and the\nnumber of years of schooling. The variance of the natural logarithm of\nincome is a commonly used measure of income inequality.\n\nThe variance of a product of two independent random variables, r; and\nSi, can be expressed as [7]\n\n(3) Var (r;$;) \u2014 ?? Var (S;) 4- S? Var (rj) -- Var (5;) Var (r;).\n\nThus, if r; and S; were independent, the relative variance of income would\nbe positively related to the average level and the variance of each variable.\n\nIt is not likely that, in a region, the rate of return to individuals and their\nlevel of schooling are independent [4]. The variance of a product of two vari-\nables that are not independent can be evaluated [7], but this is not needed\nfor the present purpose.

                    "The Average Level of Schooling and the Intra-Regional\nInequality of Income: A Clarification\n\nI. Introduction\n\nIn the March 1967 issue of this Review, A. Al-Samarrie and H. P. Miller\n[2] and D. J. Aigner and A. J. Heins [1] attempt to explain state-to-state\nvariations in income concentration by means of cross-sectional multiple\nregression analysis for the United States. Aigner and Heins indicate that\ntheir purpose is \"to report further evidence of the tendency for the personal\nincome of a region to be more equally divided the more maturely developed\nis the region\" [1, p. 175]. Al-Samarrie and Miller conclude that the level of\neducation is \"highly [inversely] correlated with income concentration\"\n[2, pp. 61 and 71]. Simon Kuznets examined international and interregional\ndata and reported that countries and regions at a lower level of income tend\nto have a greater income inequality [5] [9]. The conclusions of these and\nother writers support the commonly held view that the distribution of in-\ncome is more equal the higher the level of income or schooling in a region.!\n\nAigner and Heins state that *'there is no formal theory available which\nsatisfactorily concerns itself with the relationship between development\nand the inequality of incomes\" [1, p. 176]. They also indicate that they have\nnothing more than a \"'naive theory\" for relating their variable for level of\nschooling (which they use to \"describe the basic skill level of each state\npopulation\") to income inequality [1, pp. 177-78]?\n\nI have two purposes in writing this note. I wish to show that a specific\ntheory, the theory of investment in human capital, may be used to demon-\nstrate that, across regions, the level of schooling can be related to income\n\n1 This view is so common among economists that it is frequently expressed in textbooks on\neconomic principles without qualifications. For example, see P. Samuelson [11, p. 111, note to\nfigure 6-3(a) ].\n\n? Kuznets indicates that we lack **a firm set of links between the observable changes in the\nproduction structure that constitute economic growth and the observable associaled changes in\nthe income distribution\" [9, p. 2]. In his discussion of the relationship between the level and\ninequality of income there is an absence of an explicit consideration of the effect of training or\nschooling on the distribution of income (8] [9].\n",

Brandis argues that Ricardo supposes by\narithmetic example that an \"absolute advantage\" country produces a pair of\ngoods with the aid of two factors, capital and labor, more productively than\ndoes its trading partner. But Ricardo also states that, if capital and labor\nwere mobile, then both factors would not only move to the *'absolute advan-\ntage\" country but would produce in the new environment with \"absolute ad-\nvantage\" performance. Brandis points out that this implies that the productiv-\nity advantage cannot be ascribed to the quality of the two factors in the ex-\nample but must be ascribed to the intercession of another factor. Brandis adds\ncorrectly that the only factor which could explain this productivity advantage\nand which conforms to Ricardo's framework is resource endowment or \"land.\"\nBut then Brandis concludes that this uncovers an inconsistency in Ricardo's\nreasoning since reference to land as a third factor is precluded because *'in\nRicardo's thought rent was not a price-determining factor\" [1, p. 170].\n\nThis is an erroneous conclusion.

Only the most naive labor theory of value would hold otherwise.\nHowever, I would not deny that the labor theory of value has hung on in ex-\npositions of international trade theory long after it has been discarded else-\nwhere in the discipline. Perhaps this is the price we pay for our fascination\nwith the notion of absolute advantage. I would deny the heuristic value of any\nmodel, homely or otherwise, which violates the most elementary rules of logic\nand the most basic assumptions of economics. Our inheritance from the past\nof a felt need to have an absolute standard of measurement is something we\nshould try to free ourselves from rather than defend. And when books have\npassed through several editions I doubt that the logical errors which remain\ndeserve to be excused as \"slips of the tongue.\"\n\nSome writers treat absolute advantage and comparative advantage as mu-\ntually exclusive cases. Some treat absolute advantage as a subdivision of the\ngeneral case of comparative advantage. In the latter treatment, as far as I\nknow, the residue (that part which is ot in the absolute advantage category)\nis unnamed or called *comparative advantage\" also. In fact, these categories\nhave no bearing on the basis for trade. Rather, the two cases are the one in\nwhich we can determine which nation has the higher per worker or per capita\nincome (the \"absolute advantage\" case) and the case in which the higher per\nworker or per capita income nation cannot be determined (the \"residue\").?\nBut this has nothing to do with the basis for trade which purports to be the\nsubject of discussion in all the treatments of absolute advantage.\n\nI would close by saying that my attack on the concept of absolute advan-\ntage does not spring from *. . . complete acceptance of the Hecksher-Ohlin\ntheory . . .\" (Ingram). It springs rather from my belief that illogic and irrele-\n\nvance have no place in economic theory.\n\"D-ac-- Damme c\n",

If this be so, the notion of absolute advantage should never have en-\ntered the literature of economics in the first place. We are then left with the\npuzzle of why a piece of political propaganda on Ricardo's part became a per-\nmanent fixture in the literature of international trade theory.\n\nI think Anspach may be closer to the true explanation with his second\nsuggestion that Ricardo believed that in labor time he had found a measure of\nvalue which was exogenous to the price system. For it does appear that Ri-\ncardo, unlike many who came after him, realized that no absolute standard of\nvalue could be found within the economic system. What he did not realize was\nthat a standard exogenous to the system was irrelevant for economic analysis.\nNor did he see that an absolute standard was not even necessary since eco-\nnomic theory is concerned only with relations.\n\nProfessor Ingram's criticisms involve both theoretical and empirical consid-\nerations and the two can best be discussed separately. Little need be said\nabout the empirical questions since my original note was not concerned with\nthem. The difficulty (if not impossibility) of finding the precise real-world\ncounterparts of the constructs of a theoretical model is a commonplace in eco-\nnomics (and, indeed, in any other scientific discipline). No one supposes the\n*national income\" of macrotheory to be the same thing as the \"national in-\ncome\" of the natural accounts. But one cannot sustain an attack on the logic\nof the theory by pointing this out or require the theorist to furnish empirical\nproof that they are identical\u2014as Ingram would have me do with production\nfunctions. The relation between theoretical model and real world is an episte-\nmological question and was not the question raised in my note which was a\nmore modest question of logic.\n\nThe stance on theory which Ingram takes reflects a different problem\u2014the\nrefusal of some economists to accept the fact that only relative economic con-\ncepts have meaning in any scientifically acceptable sense. The price of a prod-\nuct or of a productive resource is a relative price whether measured in money\nterms or real terms. For this reason, to describe anything as being \"cheaper\"\nis to describe something else as being more expensive. And it is elementary\nlogic that, thus, everything cannot be \"cheaper.\"! In like fashion, the use of\nthe term \"more efficient\" can only mean, in economics, lower cost of produc-\ntion and, in turn, this has meaning only if related implicitly or explicitly to\nsomething else which is \"'less efficient\" or higher cost. I would hazard the guess\nthat Ricardo did not see the nature of his problem because he believed his\nlabor theory of value provided an absolute standard of measurement of value.\n\nThe lawyer-typist, engineer-draftsman, shoemaker-hatmaker examples of ab-\nsolute advantage always contain a word like better\" (Ingram) or \"superior\"\n\n(Ricardo) which implies some absolute standard of measurement which can-\nnot be economically relevant as a basis for trade. The Ricardian shoemaker-\nhatmaker example cited by Ingram tells us only that the \"superior\" individual\nwill have a higher income than the \"inferior\" individual whether he makes\n\n17. S. Mill [1, p. 540-41] saw this point clearly a century ago in his analysis of value,\nbut that is not to say that he was consistent in applying it throughout his system of thought.\n",

                    "Mr. Pauly's paper [3] has enriched our understanding of the phenomenon\nof so called *moral hazard\" and has convincingly shown that the optimality of\ncomplete insurance is no longer valid when the method of insurance influences\nthe demand for the services provided by the insurance policy. This point is\nworth making strongly. In the theory of optimal allocation of resources under\nrisk bearing it can be shown that competitive insurance markets will yield op-\ntimal allocation when the events insured are not controllable by individual be-\nhavior. If the amount of insurance payment is in any way dependent on a\ndecision of the insured as well as on a state of nature, then the effect is very\nmuch the same as that of any excise tax and optimality will not be achieved\neither by the competitive system or by an attempt by the government to sim-\nulate a perfectly competitive system. For some earlier, less detailed, discus-\nsions of this point see [1, pp. 55-56], [2, pp. 961-62].\n\nIn this note, I would like to stress a point which Mr. Pauly overlooks in his\nexclusive emphasis on market incentives.

Using this criterion the authors reason\nthat *. . . emigration should be welcome . . .\" whenever the following two con-\nditions are met: *. . . first that the emigrant improves his own income and,\nsecond, that the migrant's departure does not reduce the income of those re-\nmaining behind\" [2, p. 270]. The first condition is assumed to be met when\nthe individual emigrates of his own free will. The second condition is deemed\nto be met in the case of a *. . . market economy where persons are paid their\nmarginal product . . .? and hence where *. . . the emigrant removes both his\ncontribution to national output and the income that gives him a claim to this\nshare so that other incomes remain unchanged\" [2, p. 270]. The authors ac-\nknowledge that emigration may cause a redistribution of income by changing\nthe marginal products of the remaining people, but they argue that *'. . . since\nthe brain drain involves rather small numbers of people, these effects are\nlikely to be small enough to be safely considered negligible\" [2, p. 270]. Gru-\nbel and Scott then conclude that a reduction in the welfare of the remaining\npopulation could only arise out of short-run adjustment costs or failures of the\n\u00cdree market to allocate resources efficiently (ie., the case of external econo-\nmies or the case of market failure remedied through activities of the govern-\nment). In the case of externalities, Grubel and Scott distinguish between ex-\nternal economies which are associated with the personal characteristics of the\nemigrant and external economies which are associated with his profession. In\nregard to external economies associated with the emigrant's profession, the au-\nthors state that:\n\n. . if a typical doctor's work contains a large measure of social benefits\nfor which he does not get compensated, these benefits are lost to society\nonly for the length of time required to train another person to take his\nplace as a doctor. It therefore follows that in many of the well-known\ninstances of genuine external effects in consumption or production, emigra-\ntion imposes only short-run frictional costs to society which disappear in\nthe long run.

Whether such an extension is a useful exercise and\nwhether it is sufficient to establish that \"there is significant opportunity cost\nin terms of both present and future income for the remaining population of a\ncountry in allowing highly skilled individuals to emigrate\" as Aitken claims\ndepends on four factors.\n\nFirst, can the skilled-person migrations of recent years be described as mar-\nginal? Since our and Aitken's analyses are comparative statics, it is necessary\nto consider periodic flow data, such as annual statistics, and not the cumu-\nlated amount of former migration. The basic data on which such judgments\nmust be based have been made available by the U.S. Immigration and Natu-\nralization Service [7]. Even if one takes these data as valid, there remain the\ndifficulties of estimating the stock or current output of highly skilled people in\nindividual countries, for which very few meaningful data are available, and\nthen deciding at what magnitude of emigration a marginal change becomes\nnonmarginal, that is at .1, 1.0, 10.0, or 25.0 per cent of current output.

Combination here could lead to efficiencies but might also have some\nmarket power effects (reducing competition between the two but possibly enhancing their\ncompetitive position with respect to their rivals). A significant, persistent decline in demand\nmight produce a condition of excess capacity in which combination would permit economies\nbut would also have market power consequences. As discussed in Section III, an increase in\ndemand might induce a change from job shop to assembly line type operations with vertical\nintegration consequences. Technological developments may similarly provide opportunities for\na significant reorganization of resources into more efficient configurations\u2014the electronic\ndigital computer being a recent example. Finally, merger may be the most expeditious way of\ndisplacing an inefficient by a more efficient management\u2014but the benefits here may only be of\na short-run variety. A manifestly inefficient management would, hopefully, be displaced by\nother means if, by reason of the market power consequences of a combination, the merger route\nwere closed.\n\nA merger can, of course, produce diseconomies as well. What I have previously characterized\nas the *'control! loss\" phenomenon appears to be an increasing function of firm size [31]. See\nalso Parts 7 and 8, Section II, infra.\n"

Collective responses to\nchanges in product prices and rents can be separated into substitution\nand scale effects in a manner analogous to the Slutsky equations. The\nway in which centrally planned quotas constrain the outputs and income\nof a kolkhoz is examined in Part II.

As is\nwell known this Rule characterizes the situation in which society maxi-\nmizes the steady-state level of consumption per capita. As has been\nshown in more recent writings, this situation has under certain condi-\ntions some optimality properties in programs of capital accumulation\nwith an infinite horizon [3].\n\nThe concept of the GR can be extended to two-sector models, where\none sector produces a capital good while the other produces a consump-\ntion good. This, however, does not bring any new elements into the\nproblem. A more basic generalization, which is the subject of this paper,\nis to extend the concept of the GR to a growth model based on two or\nmore consumption goods and two or more capital goods. It will be seen\nthat this extension introduces some new aspects. First, instead of the\nsingle GR level of per capita consumption we shall now have many alter-\nnative GR compositions of consumption related by what we shall call\na GR transformation function. Under certain circumstances this may\nbe associated with a choice problem between alternative points on the\nfunction. Another new aspect of the GR is brought into the problem by\nthe fact that we are considering more than one capital good. This raises\nthe problem of efficient capital accumulation and its relation to the gen-\neralized GR.\n\nThe two new aspects of the GR, i.e., the alternative compositions of\nconsumption and the intertemporal efficiency in production (or accumu-\nlation), are fully characterized by the case of two goods (which can be\nused as consumption or as capital). We shall therefore concentrate\nmainly on this case. The extension to more than two goods will be\noutlined briefly in the last section.\n\nVarious aspects of the GR in a multicommodity world have been\ndiscussed by Hahn and Mathews in their well-known survey article?\nHowever, their approach to the problem is quite different from ours.\nIn particular they base their discussion on linear economic models, using\nactivity analysis formulation, while our analysis follows more closely\n\n* 'The Hebrew University, Jerusalem.\n!

The link between the tax preference and the expenditure prefer-\nence need not be so direct, however. For instance, advocates of a progressive\nincome tax and higher educational expenditures might logroll with advocates of\na sales tax and higher welfare expenditures. The outcome could then be either\na sales tax largely earmarked for education or an income tax largely earmarked\nfor welfare expenditures.\n\nThe welfare implications of this analysis should be interpreted with extreme\ncaution. Nevertheless, earmarking can be recognized as a perfectly rational\nstrategic tool for majority coalitions, a conclusion sufficient to explain its fre-\nquent empirical practice. Earmarking may even meet the Paretian welfare crite-\nria if it is evaluated as a long-run process. Of course, the logrolling rationale\noutlined above applies only to the extent that strategic dilemmas of the type\ndescribed are empirically probable descriptions of the conflicts between legisla-\ntive interest groups.\n\n(Cnr vc T (nevmem*\n",

                    "IV. Conclusions\n\nThis paper suggests an alternative or supplement to Buchanan's explanation\nof earmarking. Under certain conditions, the only possible budgetary adjust-\nments which yield majority gains may require logrolling between members of\nthe majority coalition on tax adjustment. General funds budgeting is a subop-\ntimization process wherein incentive to chisel and lack of enforceability render\ncooperation between factions unlikely. By contrast, earmarking provides an en-\nforceable *tie-in\" between the tax concessions and expenditure concessions\nnecessary to achieve a majority gain under certain circumstances.\n\n* This possibility that distributional effects will wash out in the long run merely re-echoes\na point made bv many in the welfare economics debate between the actual compensationists\nand the hypothetical compensationists. See, for instance, J. R. Hicks [5, p. 111]. Of more\ndirect relevance to the distinction between Pareto-optimal rules and Pareto-optimal out-\ncome is Buchanan's essay on the relevance of Pareto optimality [3].\n",
                    "earmarking result is positive for each of them and, hence, preferable to the\nzero payoff from general funds budgetary adjustments. The illustrative data\nmay be used as a case in point. Based on Table 2, the expected value of the\nsolution is positive for both I and III if each result is regarded as equally\nprobable.\n\nChanging the context to a multi-trial game where the Table 2 matrix is only\nthe current state of a varying payoff function, the earmarking scheme may ac-\ntually win unanimous support and meet the Paretian welfare criterion. This\nwould occur if, for instance, the passage of time shuffles the identities of rela-\ntively intense **winners\" and relatively indifferent \"losers\" in a fashion which\nis sufficiently random for the distributional aspects to wash out. Again, Table 2\nmay be used as an illustration. If future circumstance were expected to assign\nthe I, II, and III-type payoff matrices randomly on future budgetary \"plays,\"\nthe game\" can be converted to one with positive payoffs for each participant\nwhen earmarking is permitted. If earmarking increases net gains to the group\nat each point in time, it would then become the more efficient means of maxim-\nizing each individual's long-run gains from operation of the public budget.?\n\nModification of this model to allow a high degree of uncertainty about the\npreferences of other voters cuts two ways. On the one hand, earmarking may\nbecome more appealing because it can eliminate the uncertainty of the tax deci-\nsionmaker about the subsequent disposition of the funds he contemplates mak-\ning available. On the other hand, the resultant fixity of the expenditure pattern\nmakes it more difficult to readjust if the economic conditions foreseen at the\ntime of the original earmarking \"contract\" alter. This problem of erroneous ex-\npectations is, however, common to any type of agreement which must be dis-\ncharged in the future.\n\nThus, while the consequences of permitting earmarking are dependent on a\nhost of empirical factors, it is possible to indicate circumstances where the gen-\neral funds method of adjustment may actually be inferior, either for a majority\nof the group or even by unanimity. There is certainly no a priori reason for\neconomists to reject earmarking out-of-hand as an \"inefficient\" device within\nthe context of a majority-rule decision process.\n",

So long as X, is the expected expenditure,\ntherefore, the majority will choose T and reject any budget expansion.\n\nA key to the use of earmarking is suggested if we observe that a positive pay-\noff does exist for a majority (I and III) at X;T;. Why are these majority gains\nnot exploitable under general funds budgeting? The answer is that an analogue\nto the Prisoner's Dilemma prevents Preference I from voting with Preference\nIII for tax T; in exchange for III's voting with I on the expenditure choice of\nX;. The dilemma is that Preference III may be expected to renege on his part\nof his logrolling operation since, once the tax column is fixed, III's gains are\nalways maximized by choosing the X, row in alliance with Preference II. What\nis required here is an enforcement mechanism to insure a Preference I voter that\nhis attempt at cooperation will not result in III's chiselling and the negative\npayoff X,T, in lieu of the gains achievable at X.T..\n\nA binding exchange of proxies would, for instance, permit the necessary\ncross-dimensional trade of votes between I and III. However, explicit vote-\ntrading frequently appears to be regarded as impractical either because it is\ncostly, time-consuming, or not sanctioned by some persons. In these cases,\ndespite the existence of potential majority gains, the budgetary process be-\ncomes \"stuck\" at the status quo unless an alternative trading mechanism can\nbe used.\n\nClearly, any impasse resulting from general funds budgeting in the Table 2\nsituation is avoidable if integrated budgetary decisions are substituted for the\nfragmented suboptimization process. If the tax and expenditure mixes are\ndetermined jointly, the coalition between I and III can be erforced by earmark-\ning tax T for use on expenditure X;. While the enforcement problem was not\ndealt with explicitly by Wicksell, earmarking is obviously closely related to\nhis suggested simultaneous detemination of taxes and expenditures [10].\n\nCoalition solution X,T. is not, of course, necessarily a stable result. For in-\nstance, II should be willing to minimize losses by joining a counter-coalition for\neither I's maximum at X;T' or III's maximum at X,T., giving rise to the pos-\nsibility of majority cycles. No attempt.to deal with the r-person game-theoretic\nimplications will be undertaken here. This paper purports to show only that\ncircumstances exist where earmarking actually increases the achievable range\nof solutions for the group.\n\nThe \"efficiency\" of earmarking as a practice is then most easily evaluated if\none imagines the illustrative group to be confronted by the choice between a\nbudgetary constitution which permits earmarking and an alternative decision\nrule which prohibits it.5 If the rule is considered one for a one-shot budgeting\n\"game\" with payoff matrices similar to those of Table 2, a Preference II voter\nshould always seek to prohibit earmarking since it implies potential losses. For\nthis reason, earmarking cannot qualify as a welfare improvement in the sense\nof a Pareto-move. By contrast, either I or III can insure themselves against\nlosses by joining with II to constitute a majority for prohibition of earmark-\ning. If they do \"ot do so, the implication is that the expected value of the\n\n*'This is by no means a purely academic question. Constitutional prohibitions against\nearmarking are frequently advocated.

Thus, the present approach may be\nregarded either as a supplement to or as an alternative for his original model,\ndepending on one's assessment of the limitations outlined above.\n\nThe simplest model appropriate for the analysis is one which permits an ex-\npenditure choice between two public goods, X, and X;, and a financing choice\nbetween two tax systems, T, and T\u00bb. These variables may be thought of as pairs\nof single goods and single taxes, respectively, or as composite goods and com-\nposite financing media defined with reference to specified *mixes.\" For sim-\nplicity, the prices of X, and X; are assumed to be equal and also identical with\nthe amount of revenue provided via unit increments in either tax system T, or\nT;.

In the original Buchanan model this assumption merely ren-\ndered the analysis less complex. Elimination of assumptions (1) and (3) above\nmakes variation of the tax system a pivotal point in the alternative model\nwhich this paper presents.\n\nFinally, relaxation of the *median voter\" convention is perhaps the most im-\nportant step to be taken. Applied to a multidimensional series of decisions, this\ndevice is a much more restrictive one than is immediately evident, since it as-\nsumes that the sa;e voter has the median preference in a// of the relevant di-\nmensions of budgetary adjustment. The small likelihood of this condition ac-\ntually being met is better appreciated if the various dimensions of budgetary\nadjustment are explicitly enumerated. The set of suboptimization decisions in-\ncludes:\n\n1. Choice among general fund alternatives: (a) The comfosition of the gen-\neral funds budget for any given budget size; (b) The size of the general funds\nbudget, given the composition and the tax costs to each voter; and (c) The tax\ndistribution used to finance alternative sizes of general funds budgets.\n\n2. Choice among earmarking alternatives: (a) 'The levels of provision for\neach good provided through earmarking, given the earmarked financing method\nfor each good. (b) The earmarked taxes for each good provided via earmark-\ning.\n\n3. The institutional choice between earmarking and general funds budgetary\nprocedures.\n\nBuchanan's model excludes 1(c) and 2(b) above since the taxes are deter-\nmined exogenously. The neatness of his conclusion, however, depends on the\nimportant implicit assumption that the representative individual being exam-\nined has the median preference\u2014and therefore casts the controlling vote\u2014for\nall movements in the remaining dimensions 1(a), 1(b), 2(a), and 3. Satisfac-\ntion of this condition imposes extremely strong restrictions on the set of indi-\nvidual preference functions in the collectivity.\n\nWhat difference does it make if, in fact, there exists no reference individual\nwho possesses the median preference in each of the listed dimensions? In a\nmodel with a universally pivotal voter such as Buchanan's median man, any\ndeparture from the adjustment attained under unconstrained voting is neces-\nsarily a movement away from the perfect personal optimum which the pivotal\nreference voter could otherwise select. By contrast, the absence of an individ-\nual who is decisive in each budgetary dimension implies that there does not\nexist azy reference individual who will achieve his full optimum when the col-\nlective decision-making process operates in unconstrained fashion. In the latter\ncase, while the imposition of a new constraint (such as one on the budgetary\nmix) will normally *distort\" the original result, it becomes impossible to say\nwhether this \"distortion\" moves the solution toward or away from any particu-\nlar individual's budgetary optimum.* This is an important qualification of the\n\n*'This observation has a basis parallel to the \"Second Best\" theorem of K.

                    "IL Amalysis of Assumptions\n\nAn initial question may be raised concerning the assumed predetermination\nof the general funds expenditure allocation by a governmental authority which\napparently is unresponsive to individual preferences exerted via the voting pro-\ncess. If the *median voter\" successfully imposes his preference in the (legisla-\ntive) budget-size decision, should his influence over the (executive-bureau-\ncratic) budget decision be less? And since the median voter's preferences do\ngovern in the legislative assembly, what circumstances render the legislature\nincapable of modifying unsuitable budget guidelines formulated by the bureau-\ncracy? Buchanan's brief footnoted allusion to such factors is, unfortunately,\nsomewhat cryptic.? Moreover, it is essential that this line of objection be met\nsince only imperfect response can explain why the general funds budgetary\ncomposition would diverge from the special case wherein the earmarking and\ngeneral funds results coincide.\n\nLack of political responsiveness on the budgetary composition decision may\nor may not be a realistic hypothesis. Since, however, a modified model can es-\ntablish a rationale for earmarking even in the absence of bureaucratic unre-\nsponsiveness, the analysis developed below employs the weaker assumption\nthat the same decisionmakers determine both the budget mix and the budget\nsize.

It should be obvious that a pivotal individual,\nwho by assumption casts the decisive vote for all budgeting decisions within\nthe earmarked system, will regard the fixed general-fund mix of expenditures\nas an additional constraint on his previously unconstrained choice. This addi-\ntional constraint therefore normally forces him into an inferior budgetary deci-\nsion. As Buchanan points out, there is but one special case when the additional\nconstraint becomes, in effect, inoperative: when the general fund ratio between\nthe public goods happens to be the same as the ratio which would be freely\nchosen under the earmarking scheme. \"Tie-ins\" linking the expansion of one\ngood to that of another may thus have the effect of distorting the collective\ndecision.\n\nWithin its framework as set out above, Buchanan's line of reasoning does\nnot seem subject to serious exception.

By contrast, general fund\nbudgeting permits an individual decisionmaker, whether citizen or legislator, to\n*vote\" only on the aggregate outlay for *bundles\" of public services whose\ncomposition is predetermined by the budgetary authority. Thus, the general\nfund case is represented as an analogue to the private-sector practice of ''tie-in\nsales\" where sale units consisting of heterogeneous products are employed to\nextract part of the buyer's consumer surplus\" by forcing him into an \"all-or-\nnothing\" type of choice.\n\nAmong the basic assumptions of the supporting analysis are the following:\n\n1. The ratio allocating any general fund budget between the public goods in\nBuchanan's simple two-good model is predetermined by a *budgetary author-\nity.\"\n\n2.

This universality of competitiveness\nsufficed to guarantee equivalence, as defined. It was further argued that a de-\nparture from these assumptions could, in general, destroy this equivalence and\nseveral such departures were analyzed: (1) perfect competition in domestic\nproduction replaced by pure monopoly in production; (2) perfect competition\namong quota-holders replaced by monopolist-holding of quota; and (3) simul-\ntaneous presence of monopoly in quota-holding and in domestic production\n[1, p. 54].\n\nRecent communications, however, from Hirofumi Shibata [2] who has ana-\nlyzed the case where there is monopolistic supply of imports, and from G.\nYadav [5] who has analyzed the case where there is monopolistic import\nunder both tariffs and quotas, have suggested the following clarifications and\nextensions of some importance.\n\n1.

Implications for Commercial Policies\n\nThe demonstration presented here is not merely interesting as a qualification\nadded to Bhagwati's argument, but it also has important implications in analy-\nsis of a significant recent development in the area of international commercial\npolicies, namely the so-called Voluntary Export Restrictions.\" This system is\ncurrently employed by Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea in their exports,\nchiefly of textile products, to the United States, Canada, and other European\ncountries.\n\nIn the system of Voluntary Export Restrictions, in essence, the exporting\nand importing countries bargain bilaterally the volume of specific commodities\nallowed to enter the importing country usually under a threat of imminent new\ntariffs by the latter on the commodities in question. When they agree on the\nvolume of imports, the importing country concedes non-use of tariffs to the\nexporting country in return for the latter's assurance that she will administer\nvoluntarily the former's de facto import quotas thus agreed on.\n\nFrom the point of view of our analysis just developed, this type of bargain\nseems to have its own rationality. Firstly, interests of the protectionists of the\nimporting country chiefly lie in higher domestic prices (or protective effects)\nand for protection purposes quotas and tariffs are equally good. The protec-\ntionists are essentially indifferent between quotas and tariffs.\" Secondly, the\nproducers of exporting countries definitely prefer quotas to tariffs if some res-\ntrictions on their exports appear to be inevitable. Because under quotas, if they\nsucceed in forming a cartel with respect to exports to the quota imposing coun-\ntry, they can retain a part of the revenue which would normally go to the trea-\nsury of the importing country if the restrictions were in the form of tariffs.\nFinally, from the point of view of the governments of the importing countries,\nthe Voluntary Export Restrictions are preferable to either forms (tariffs or\nquotas) of explicit import restrictions.

The last states the maximizing\n(equilibrium) condition for the monopolist when a quota is set; the equality\nsign holds if the monopolist sells less than the quota (i.e., the quota becomes\nineffective), and the inequality if he sells the maximum amount set by the\nquota. There are thus six equations and six unknowns: Sp, D, D\u00bb, Se, C, and\nPy. The import level which will maximize the foreign monopolist's profits is\nthus determined. This import level will, however, be subject to an upper bound\nset by the quota.\n\nIn the case where an effective import quota is set, the second system yields\nsome domestic price, Pp, corresponding to every import level (Sr) chosen as\nthe quota. At the same time, if a tariff rate (/) that will produce the same\nimport level (Sz) is chosen, the first system must yield a domestic price, Pp,\nidentical to that of the second system. In other words, so long as a tariff or a\nquota permits the same level of imports, the prevailing domestic price will be\nidentical.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the equilibrium in the two systems. In the figure we set\nfirst a tariff rate that generates an import level; then we set the same import\nlevel as a quota and show that the same domestic price is generated but a dif-\nferent (and higher) c.i.f. price for the foreign monopolist prevails.\n\nIn Figure 1, the demand schedule for the foreign monopolist is EFD, which\nis obtained by subtracting the domestic supply, Sp, from the domestic de-\nmand, D. The tariff rate (\u2014MK/KQ) shifts the net demand schedule for the\nmonopolist downwards to GJ and his marginal revenue schedule to GL.\nEquilibrium exists where the latter cuts the marginal cost schedule for the\nmonopolist, so that the monopolist's export (Sr) is at OQ, the domestic price\nis at OA, the monopolist's c.i.f. price is at OB.\n\nWe then use the same import level OQ as the quota in Figure 1. The net\ndemand schedule for the foreign monopolist is now EMQ which has a kink at\nM. The corresponding marginal revenue schedule, E/, must become discontin-\nuous at 7. Equilibrium exists where the marginal cost schedule for the mo-\nnopolist cuts the demand curve below 7 so that the monopolist exports exactly\nthe same volume set by the quota and the domestic price is at OA which, in\nturn, becomes the monopolist's c.i.f. price. If the marginal cost schedule cuts\nthe marginal revenue curve between E and 7, the monopolist would not use all\nof the quota set, and the domestic price would be higher than O4. However, so\nlong as the quota is set at the same import level that will prevail under a posi-\ntive tariff, the marginal cost schedule will never cut the marginal revenue\nschedule between E and 7, because at the monopolist's equilibrium export level\nreached under a positive tariff (OO in Figure 1), the monopolist's marginal\ncost (QJ) must necessarily be smaller than the monopolist's marginal revenue\nthat would exist if there were no tariff (QI).\n\nThus we have shown that the equivalence of tariffs and quotas, as far as pro-\n"

In the following, I\nshall attempt, first, to set out a concrete case of such a conflict of results per-\ntaining to equivalence, and by so doing I hope to supplement Bhagwati's arti-\ncle, since this attempt involves an analysis of a case which he left specifically\nunexamined, namely the one involving monopolistic sale from foreign sources\n[1, p. 54].

With this definition, if the reader refers back to Figure 2, he will\nnotice that equivalence follows except that the pair-wise criterion (that a quota\nwill give rise to a level of importable production and an implicit tariff rate\nwhich, if set alternatively as a tariff, will generate the same level of importable\nproduction) will not yet be satisfied.! A similar conclusion holds for the Yadav\ncase, as the reader can check by referring back to Figure 1.\n\nBut now follow this shift in definition to its logical end and define equiva-\nlence quite simply as follows: if a tariff leads to a specified level of imports and\ndomestic production, there will be a specific quota which can be alternatively\nset which will lead to an identical level of imports and domestic production.\nNote that, on this definition, both the cases discussed above will go through as\nexceptions to the presumption that the introduction of monopoly elements\nwill, in general, disrupt equivalence.\n\n4. The question which immediately arises then is how equivalence should be\ndefined. As with all definitional questions, this cannot be resolved except with\nreference to the kinds of questions on which light is sought by analysis deploy-\ning the chosen definition.\n\nThe advantage of the definition that was used in my original paper is that it\nenables one to answer directly the question whether under a quota regime the\nobserved implicit tariff rates can be treated as equivalent to identical tariff\nrates (levied instead of the quota) in the sense of generating the same level of\nimports and domestic production. This is a question that comes up frequently\nand the general practice is indeed to treat the observed, implicit tariff rate\nunder a QR regime as the \"effective tariff rate.\" It is also customary to treat a\ntariff as *redundant\" if the implicit tariff rate, in a QR-plus-tariff regime, ex-\nceeds the actual tariff rate. Examination of the equivalence proposition, in\nterms of the original definition, throws up the limitations of these deductions\nwhen monopoly elements are present.\n\nThus, for example, in the case when foreign supply is monopolistic, the im-\nplicit tariff rate is zero under the quota\u2014refer back to Figure 2\u2014 but setting\nthe actual tariff rate at zero and removing the quota restriction will not yield\nthe same level of imports and domestic production; the truly equivalent tariff\nrate is higher. Similarly, in the case where there is domestic, import monopoly\ninstead, the truly equivalent tariff is lower than the implicit tariff rate in the\nquota alternative\u2014refer back to Figure 1. Similar conclusions apply to the\ncases analyzed in the original paper: (i) where there is monopolistic-holding of\nquotas, but competition elsewhere, again the implicit tariff rate will exceed the\nexplicit tariff rate, thus overstating the truly equivalent tariff rate, when the\nquota is underutilized; (ii) where there is monopoly in domestic production as\nwell as in the holding of quotas, again the underutilization of the quota would\nimply an implicit tariff rate that exceeds the explicit tariff rate and hence ov-\nerstate the truly equivalent, effective tariff [1, p. 63]; and (iii) where there is\nmonopoly in domestic production but competition everywhere else, the im-\n\n!

A similar conclusion holds for the case analyzed by Shibata, where foreign\nsupply is monopolistic under both tariff and quota. In Figure 2 the monopolist\nsupplier of imports is faced with the net import demand schedule AR which,\nin case of a tariff at rate GF/FJ, will shift to AR'. The marginal revenue curve\nto AR' is MR'. The intersection of the monopolist's marginal cost curve MC\nwith M R' at E determines his maximum-profit point, giving OJ as the volume\nof imports, JG as the domestic price, and hence FJ as the c.i.f. price. The shift\nto the alternative situation, where the tariff GF/FJ is removed and replaced\nby a quota of OJ, leads on the other hand to the same domestic price GJ, but\nthe c.i.f. price now shifts also to GJ, so that the implicit tariff rate is zero.\n\nThe equivalence proposition thus breaks down unequivocally: an explicit\ntariff will not lead to an import level which, if set alternatively as a quota, will\ngenerate an implicit tariff equal to the explicit tariff; nor will a quota lead to\nan implicit tariff which, if set alternatively as an explicit tariff, will generate\nthe same level of imports.

While Machlup no doubt does not disagree with this strategy,\nhe fails to recognize that the behavioral approach has already resulted in out-\ncomes different from the nonbehavioral approach and promises to result in ad-\nditional such outcomes, even regarding the behavior of the firm.\n\nClearly, a realistic theory does not necessarily represent an improvement.\nThe crucial question is not the one Milton Friedman [2] raised several years\nago, \"Can a hypothesis be tested by the realism of its assumptions?\" (to which\nquestion the answer is No,\" as stated by Friedman), nor is it How should\ntraditional economic theory be tested?\" It is this: \"Traditional economic\ntheory has not proved to be a complete success (many of its implications and\npredictions have not proved to be correct) ; how can the theory be improved?\"\nOne possible way is by making the underlying assumptions more realistic.5 The\nintroduction of principles of social learning and of expectational dynamics into\neconomic theory promises progress in this direction.\n\n(CCeneon I AimmnwsrAX\n",

The findings help to explain the relatively\nhigh rate of liquid saving by consumers during the last few years in face of the\nwidespread introduction of private pension plans.\n\nExample 2 [4, Ch. 14]: It follows from assumptions about rational behav-\nior as well as from principles of expectational dynamics that the expectation of\nsizable price increases will induce some consumers to buy in advance and in\nexcess of needs. However, from psychological principles about the generaliza-\ntion of unfavorable news and of uncertainty, a different outcome of the expec-\ntation of small and gradual price increases may be deduced regarding discre-\ntionary expenditures. Empirical research disclosed the circumstances under\nwhich inflationary expectations induced U.S. consumers to postpone, rather\nthan step up, their discretionary expenditures. In 1966 and 1967 the bad\nnews about rising cost of living and the expectation of having to spend more\non necessities made many people feel that they had to cut down on spending\nmoney on automobiles and leisure-time activities which they would have liked\nto have had but did not need immediately. These findings, in turn, lead to an\nimproved theorem of the effects of inflationary expectations.\n\nExample 3 [8, Ch. 9]: It was argued a priori that there was no reason why a\ntax cut (increase in disposable income )should result in a different response by\nconsumers from any other increase in income of a similar size. Behavioral\ntheory suggests, however, that the response to an income increase which in-\nduces people to expect further income increases and raises their levels of aspi-\nration (-- 4- situation) will be different from a response to an income increase\nwhich does not make for optimistic expectations and does not raise levels of\naspiration (-- \u2014 situation). Empirical studies indicated such a difference in\nconsumers! discretionary expenditures over several years and helped to clarify\nthe developments in 1964-65. Households with stable before-tax income\nstepped up their expenditures on durables in response to the 1964 tax cut less\npromptly and to a smaller extent than households which also experienced an\nincrease in wages or salaries because only the latter were viewed as *cumula-\ntive\" personal accomplishments. These findings add to our understanding of\nconsumer response to income increases.?\n\nExample 4 [4, Chs. 9 and 10; 7, 10]: The prevailing large fluctuations in\nthe demand for automobiles and in the incurrence of installment debt by con-\nsumers called for a new approach. It began with the hypothesis that consum-\ners? discretionary demand is a function of both ability to buy and willingness\nto buy. The second step consisted of developing methodological tools suitable\nfor the measurement of changes in intervening variables, such as consumers'\n\n?* Machlup asks, \"What can be imperfect about the information on a tax increase?\" [9,\np. 25]. Perhaps nothing. But people's\u2014businessmen's as well as consumers'\u2014notions about\nthe probable outcome of a tax increase are dependent on their attitudes and are \"imper-\nfect.\" These notions, in turn, will influence the response both to a proposal of a tax in-\ncrease (\"announcement effect\") and to the reduction in disposable income after the law\nwent into effect.\n",

The major question that theory is equipped to answer concerns func-\ntional relations among variables (for instance, to cite Machlup's example, how\nprices of cotton textiles will be affected by an increase in wage rates).\n\n4. Price and production theory of the firm \"serves only to explain and pre-\ndict effects of mass behavior\" [9, p. 6]. What an individual firm does, or. a few\nfirms do, may be subject to different considerations.\n\nThe role of behavioral science must be clarified in the framework of these\npropositions. I shall proceed to do so with respect to the economic behavior of\nthe household or the consumer, rather than the firm. My justification for thus\nshifting the argument from Machlup's main concern to a somewhat different\narea is the following: (a) The restriction of theory on account of monopolistic\nor oligopolistic conditions, extensively discussed by Machlup does not apply\nto consumers, Since in a study of consumer behavior only mass behavior is rel-\nevant [see 6, p. 219], in this area it is possible to study Machlup's strongest\ncase.! (b) Machlup's discussion of total utility applies to households as clearly\nas to firms. (c) The following statement by Machlup, in which references to\nmanagement have been omitted, represents the starting point of studies of con-\nsumer behavior: the decision-makers! \"discretion will be a function . . . chiefly\nof the independence . . . from urgent worries about the sufficiency of earnings\"\n[9, p. 19].? (d) The two examples used by Machlup about household behav-\nior or individual behavior (in his footnotes 4 and 3, respectively) do not illu-\nminate the possibilities of behavioral studies. In addition, it so happens that\nthis writer has done more work on the behavior of the consumer than on the\nbehavior of the firm.\n\nThe behavioral sciences study the actions of man or groups of men by ap-\nplying the scientific method\u2014observation, measurement, testing\u2014to man him-\nself [4, p. 328]. Behavioral economics is concerned primarily with the process\nof decision making regarding spending, saving, investing, borrowing, pricing,\netc., and thus supplements the analysis of interrelationships among results of\nbehavior (amounts spent or saved, business investments, prices) which has\nbeen the traditional domain of economics. I shall illustrate the function of be-\nhavioral economics by referring to recent studies of consumer behavior.\n\nExample 1 [4, Ch. 20; 5, 6]: Psychological theory postulates that aspira-\ntions rise with accomplishment and that concrete and atteinable rewards exert a\npositive stimulus on action. In view of these considerations it is not necessarily\ntrue that the larger the assets, the less will consumers save (and therefore the\nmore they wil! spend). Empirical studies, conducted for the purpose of testing\nderivations from both economic and psychological hypotheses showed that\nconsumers with large initial liquid assets both saved more and dissaved more\nthan consumers with small initial assets, and that those with private pension\nrights saved more than those without such rights (when income, age, etc., were\nheld constant). When families who look forward to substantial retirement\n\n1 True, in sample interview surveys the income, savings, expenditures, as well as motives,\nattitudes, and expectations of individual consumers are determined. But the purpose of\ncollecting these data is to analyze changes in the behavior of all consumers or of broad\ngroups of consumers (for instance, of consumers with rising income).\n\n\"This writer's studies of consumer behavior began by postulating that \"affluence\" makes\nfor increased discretion in consumer action [see 3 and 4].\n",

                    "On the Measurement of Capacity Utilization: Comment\n\nThe recent article in this Review by Klein and Preston [3] (hereafter re-\nferred to as K & P) adds substantially to our understanding of the problem\nof measuring capacity utilization in industrial sectors of our economy. It\nprovides a revised and improved set of Wharton indexes. The index for the\ntotal manufacturing sector agrees much of the time quite closely with the\nnewly published Federal Reserve index [2]. Moreover the revised Wharton\nindexes provide, for most of the eleven industrial sectors covered, a firmer\nbasis for fixing the absolute level of capacity utilization measures than had\npreviously been available.!\n\nThe procedure developed by K & P involves three main steps: (1) deter-\nmining total manhours of labor available each quarter from 1948 to 1960 for\nthe whole economy except for agriculture and the self-employed; (2) appor-\ntioning this total to the several industrial sectors; and (3) determining a\nCobb-Douglas production function for each sector. K & P infer their capa-\ncity utilization measures from (L./ L;)\u00ab*8v,, where L, is actual sector man-\nhours, L, is available sector manhours, o and 8 are the sector labor and\ncapital exponents respectively, and v, is \"the disturbance at time /.\"\n\nIn the case of each of nine of the eleven sectors for which they have esti-\nmated production functions, K & P find a--8 is greater than one.? They\ncomment that \"the data suggest that increasing returns to scale is the\nproper assumption\" in these cases. I question the appropriateness of the\nwords \"returns to scale\" here. Presumably a major factor making for an \u00ab\n8 greater than one in these nine sectors was a sharper upward trend and a\nwider cycle in output than in labor input. And in a situation in which output\nshows an upward trend and labor input a downward trend their formula\nfor relating these variables may well be questionable.?\n\nThe ratio (L4/L.) is a measure of sector labor force utilization. The re-\nliance K & P put on this ratio suggests that it merits separate consideration.\nAn attempt to determine it for manufacturing for the past decade raises a\nquestion. For their Step 1, K & P assume that ''full employment aggregate\n\n! [6] makes clear that the various indexes now available differ significantly in absolute level.\n? The exceptions are Food and Beverages and Chemicals.\n\n3 K & P characterize their findings for l'ood and Beverages as *'the least reasonable estimate\nof \u00ab and 8\" among the eleven. The output trend for this sector from 1947 to 1960 was upward;\nthe trend of the number of production workers employed was downward.\n",

Let us con-\nsider, for instance, the product surface or \"hill of returns\" in Figure 1.\nFormed by rays out of the origin it is a geometric representation of a linear\nhomogeneous function F- F(x, y). As one can see, partial factor variation\nleads to total product curves which are initially S-shaped and which have\ntwo points of inflection. After the second of these points, the product curves\nare strictly convex (from below); that is, the marginal productivity strictly\nmontonically increases. Since this is the case in a region of negative mar-\nginal productivity, it is of interest in production theory. Let us remark in\nthis connection that the prototype of a two times continuously partially dif-\nferentiable total product curve introduced by Ragnar Frisch [3, p. 90] looks\nsomething like the curve in Figure 2 Aaving monotonically increasing mar-\nginal produclivity to the right of r.\n\nIn the papers referied to in footnote 1 nothing is said about the analytic\ndetermination of production functions having the property P. Nevertheless,\nit seems to be of great practical and theoretical importance to devise a\nmethod of deriving such functions, not only in the case of two but also of\n12 2 factors.

The amount of\nthis discount, of course, will depend upon the explicit formulation of P(X).\nUnder certain circumstances, this discount amount might be quite substantial.\nFor example, in a bidding model proposed in the author's dissertation, an ex-\nample is demonstrated for a sealed bid auction with five competing bidders in\nwhich the profit maximizing bid was $38.65 for a particular firm's certainty\nequivalent value* of $100.00 [1, pp. 75-86]. It is not suggested that the typi-\ncal discount need be this large; however, such a discount appears at least possi-\nble. A similar model could be developed for a sequential bidding situation in\nwhich the landholder is visited at random intervals by petroleum company rep-\nresentatives who give him offers which are good for a short time only. In this\ncase, too, there appears a strong incentive to bid below the certainty equivalent\nvalue, because of a finite probability of acceptance. If the landowner knows the\ncertainty equivalent value of the tract to each company, he can \"hold out\"\nuntil some bid near this amount had been received. However, typically the\nlandowner does not know nearly so much about the potential of the land as the\nbidding companies; therefore, the risk of holding out is greatly increased, and\nthe landowner may capitulate for much less lucrative terms than he could have\nobtained had he had as much information as the bidding companies.\n\nAn examination of equation (2) shows that it is possible that decreases in\nthe certainty equivalent value of tracts could be passed back entirely to the\nlandowners in the form of lower bids; whether this would be likely or not de-\npends upon the assumption made about the form of P(X).

In Lintner's model the difference between the expected\nvalue and the certainty equivalent value of the return stream is an increasing\nfunction of (1) the variance of the project's own present value return, (2) the\nproject's aggregate present value return covariance with assets already held by\nthe company, and (3) the project's total covariance with other projects con-\ncurrently included in the capital budget [6, p. 31].?\n\nThat the variance of a particular exploration project's present value return is\nlikely to be high is common knowledge. However, it is important to note that\ntotal project covariances with other petroleum company assets and projects are\nalso likely to be quite high because the returns to most of these projects are\nclosely related to the price of crude oil; thus, a crude oil price change would\ntend to cause the large majority of project returns to change in the same direc-\ntion. Therefore, almost surely the certainty equivalent value of a tract of po-\ntentially productive petroleum land, in terms of Lintner's model or similar\nmodels, is considerably less than the expected present value of the tract.\n\nSuppose that the expected present values of the stream of returns from oil\nproperties were to drop because of the removal of the depletion allowance. Da-\nvidson implies that the absolute amount of this decrease could be passed back\nto landowners not already protected by contracts and that the aggregate ex\npost rent retained by the producers (as compensation for their risk-bearing)\nneed not change. However, this is not the prediction implied by the Lintner\nmodel. The variances and covariances of the projects are measured in dollar\nvalues (not normalized rates of return). Thus the variances and the covari-\nances will decrease as the expected present value falls, and the expected present\nvalue and the certainty equivalent will move closer together. If market condi-\ntions were such that each producer would be forced to offer his certainty\nequivalent value for each tract, the absolute amount of the decrease in expected\npresent value caused by the removal of the depletion allowance could not be\nfully passed back to landowners.\n\nSecondly, most petroleum lands leases are not sold at open competitive auc-\ntions; indeed, most transactions between private landowners and petroleum\ncompanies are not the result of auction bidding at all. Publicly owned lands\n(for example, the outer continental shelf lands controlled by the federal gov-\nernment and the public lands of the states of Louisiana and Texas) are typi-\ncally sold at sealed bid auctions. These facts suggest that a rational firm often\nhas a strong incentive to bid less than its certainty equivalent price for a tract.\nThis is true since, in any situation other than an open competitive auction, &\n\n? If one uses different assumptions than Lintner, the difference between the expected value\nand the certainty equivalent value (ie. the \"risk discount\") may not be expressible in\nexactly these same terms; yet two general features remain in most of the models that have\nyet been proposed\u2014the risk discount is an increasing function of the project's present value\nreturn variability and the positive relationships between the returns from the project and\nthose from other assets already held by the firm and new projects in the firm's capital\nbudget.\n",

Accordingly, for each dollar of subsidy\ngranted, most went to intramarginal rents and little was left to encourage\nthe exploration of otherwise inframarginal no-rent land [4, p. 130].\n\nIt seems clear that lease bonus and royalty payments to many landowners\ncould be reduced substantially without altering the supply of petroleum lands.\nHowever, it does not follow that a moderate crude oil price reduction (or a\nreduction in the depletion allowance) can eventually be passed largely back to\nthe landowners without causing much effect on the incentive to explore cur-\nrently nonproductive oil lands. Kahn and Campbell have attacked Davidson's\nconclusions by challenging his assumptions about the supply of petroleum\nlands [5, pp. 289-94] [2]. They point out that an inelastic supply of land\ndoes not necessarily imply an inelastic supply of oil, any more than a fixed\nsupply of land implies an inelastic supply of wheat in the Ricardian model. A\nhigher price thus will not go merely into rents, but into extending the margin\nof exploration (or cultivation in the Ricardian model) and eliciting additional\nsupplies as well.!\n\nHowever, there is another very important consideration\u2014the distribution of\nrents under conditions of uncertainty. Davidson realized the need to discuss\nthis point and produced the following argument [4, pp. 127-28]:\n\n(1) If the future income stream of each oil-bearing property were known\nwith certainty, then the lease bonus would exactly equal the discounted value\nof the future economic rents on the property, and all rents would go to the\nlandowner.\n\n(2) However, there is usually very substantial uncertainty about the future\nincome stream from a potential tract of oil land. Because of this uncertainty, it\nis quite unlikely that the ex arte rent estimates of either party will closely ap-\nproximate the ex *ost economic rent which actually is realized. Therefore, a\nroyalty payment based on a percentage o\u00ed the gross value of the oil as it is\nproduced allows the producer and the landowner to share the inherent risk.\nThe way the parties agree to split the expected economic rent into a fixed sum\n(the lease bonus) and a variable sum (the royalty) depends, in part, on the\nexpected risk associated with the particular tract.\n\n(3) Therefore, given uncertainty, the depletion allowance merely raises\nboth the landowners! and the producers! estimates of the cx ante rent. There is\nno reason to believe that this subsidy will systematically increase the amount\nthe producers might receive in the absence of the depletion allowance, and\ntherefore it should not significantly encourage additional exploration of oil\nlands.\n\nThe purpose of this note is to question the validity of the conclusion stated\nin the preceding sentence. There exist at least two reasons for believing that\nthe depletion allowance subsidy does indeed increase the absolute amount of\neconomic rent that accrues to the producers. First, recent developments in the\ntheory of capital budgeting indicate that no risk-averting investor would be\n\n' This summary of the Kahn and Campbell criticism is a paraphrase of the referee's con-\ncise and cogent remarks on this subject.\n",

In these circum-\nstances, an insistence that peak users pay all capacity costs (reckoned as aver-\nage total historical costs), or any other device that tries to discourage overin-\nvestment may, by reinforcing any tendency of the companies themselves to un-\nderestimate either demand elasticity or the possibility of increasing returns,\nproduce far more harm than the A-J-W effect.*\n\nPerhaps the guarantee of a rate of rcturn in excess of the cost of capital,\nwhere regulation is effective (so that there remains a reserve of unexploited\nmonopoly power that can be tapped to cover losses on incremental investment)\n\u2014the very source of the A-]-W distortion\u2014is a necessary offset to the restric-\ntive effects of monopoly. This does not mean it is unimportant for regulatory\ncommissions to subject competitive rates to the test of marginal costs, as the\nI.C.C. has been urged to do[3] and as the F.C.C. ought to do in its current\ngeneral rate investigation of A.

More impor-\ntant, as the traditional critics of public utility regulation have pointed out,\nmerely holding the overall rate of return to competitive levels does not suffice\nto assure competitive levels of capacity and output. The reason for this is that\nregulators can never be certain about the elasticity of demand and the behavior\nof unit costs with increased sales. In the face of these inescapable uncertainties,\ncommissions are powerless to order rate reductions, such as might well prove\njustified, ex ost, so long as the regulated companies are earning no more than\nthe permissible return on their rate bases (see, e.g. [25, p. 228]). Competi-\ntion automatically probes the elasticity of demand and long-run behavior of\ncosts; regulation cannot. TVA did what regulatory commissions could not re-\nquire private companies to do: set low rates and see what happened to demand\nand cost (see [16, pp. 733-43] [23, pp. 493-94, 651-52]).\n\nI have no way of knowing which of these distorting influences is the more\npowerful. But there is one phenomenon, of particular importance in the public\nutility area, that tends to reduce the importance of the former and increase\nthat of the latter, in those situations in which both could be operative; that is\nlong-run decreasing costs. Static economies of scale? place long-run marginal\ncosts below average total costs; and unusually rapid technological progress?\nmay produce the same result, when average costs are estimated for some past\ntest year and return (including depreciation and provision for income tax) is\ncomputed on an historical rate base.\" Public utility economists and engineers\nhave quoted to me rule-of-thumb estimates of 30 to 40 per cent for electricity\ngeneration and distribution and 70 to 75 per cent for gas distribution as a mea-\nsure of the ratio between the two (though one of them indicated his LRMC\n\n? The presence or absence of increasing returns in public utilities depends on the dimen-\nsion along which output is increased. The extension of electricity and gas service to less\ndensely populated areas is probably subject to increasing transmission costs, as is making\ntelephone service available to additional subscribers, the latter because the number of inter-\nconnections grows geometrically as the number of subscribers grows arithmetically. See [24,\np. 369] and Troxel, in [19, pp. 179-82]. But all these are subject to markedly decreasing\ncosts with increasing intensity of use.\n\n* According to Kendrick's estimates, the average annual growth of total factor produc-\ntivity, 1899 to 19053, was 3.6 per cent in communications and public utilities, as compared\nwith 2.2 per cent in mining, 2. O per cent in manufacturing and 1.7 per cent in the entire\nprivate domestic economy [13, pp. 136-37]. This technological progress has by no means\nbeen independent of the sharp increase in the demand for the services of these industries.\n\n\"This discrepancy is offset by (a) inflation and (b) the gradual erosion of this historical\nrate base by allowance for depreciation. As for the former, it is interesting to discover that,\ndespite inflation, the capital cost for complete new power stations, per kilowatt of elec-\ntricity sent out, dropped in the United Kingdom from \u00a3 67 to \u00a3 37 between the early\n1950s and 1963, as the average size of the generating units newly installed rose from 30 to\n550 megawatts [20, p. 49 n]. And that the book investment cost per circuit route mile of\nthe Bell System's long lines declined from $217 in 1930 to $158 in 1940 and $25 in 1965.\nBackup data for [10, Chart 4], supplied by A.

The second would be no offset to the first with respect to\nalternative methods of producing a given level of output: for example, by (ex-\ncessive) substitution of capital for labor or for other variable inputs where the\neffect was not necessarily to expand service. Nor would it be an important\nrestraining influence on investments in the service of more competitive mar-\nkets, where elasticity of demand would be greater and the divergence between\nmarginal and average revenue correspondingly less.\n\nBut the two tendencies would clearly conflict where the investment under\nconsideration involved the expansion of capacity to produce for the markets in\nwhich the utility has great monopoly power. Shepherd cites as *the most glar-\ning instance\" of public utility companies! ignoring marginal cost principles\ntheir aversion to thoroughgoing peak-responsibility pricing: i.e., to levying all\ncapacity costs on use at the peak [19, p. 265 n.; cf. 21, 12]. In my judgment\nthis attitude is attributable in part to the A-J-W effect: if peak users can be\ncharged less than the full capacity costs for which they are (marginally) re-\nsponsible, this \"'justifies\" a greater capacity and a larger rate-base, the costs of\nwhich can then be recouped partially from offpeak users (see also, on this, [6,\npp. 150-51] [26, pp. 35-36] [17, pp. 58, 61, 64]). So we do have a tend-\nency to overinvestment on this account. But it is precisely with respect to such\ninvestments that monopoly has heretofore been accused of promoting excessive\nconservatism (see, e.g, [11] [2, Ch. 2] [5, pp. 339, 342-45] [7]). It is\nsignificant that the main agencies adopted to offset this conservatism, public\npower authorities and \"tough\" regulatory commissions, have, according to\nShepherd's survey [17, pp. 63-65], been as a group markedly worse than av-\nerage offenders against such marginalist practices as peak-responsibility\npricing.* These agencies have regarded it as their mandate to promote an ex-\npanded use of electricity: this was TVA's explicit purpose, and it, according to\nShepherd, practices no marginalist pricing at all.\n\nA-J-W and the others in effect assume that regulation eliminates the monop-\noly problem. By holding price to average total cost including some maximum\npermissible rate of return, regulation, they assume, forces the public utility\ncompany to increase capacity and output until ATC and AR (rather than MR)\nare equated (see, e.g., [1, pp. 1056-57]). Or, to put it another way, effective\nregulation makes the marginal revenue product of the utility company's invest-\n\ntherefore ordinarily to be expected [8, pp. 208-9], we did not construct any general case\nagainst price discrimination on this ground.\n\n\"The significance of this qualification is spelled out below.\n\n* On the differential attitude of oligopolists toward output-expanding and factor-saving\ninnovations, see [15, pp. 21-25].\n\n*For a description of the similar effects of tough F.P.C. regulation in allocating costs\nbetween jurisdictional and. nonjurisdictional sales of gas, see [26, p. 31].\n",

The essential difference between this\nanalysis and that of Weiss is that we have measurements of all the variables on\nthe microeconomic level. Assigning variables (such as unionism) to whole\nsubgroups of individuals from aggregated data will generally result in errors in\nmeasurement.* Consequently, if the assigned variables are correlated with other\nvariables measured on the microeconomic level subject to less measurement\nerror, when these other variables are introduced into the regression the mea-\nsured effects of the assigned variables can differ markedly from their true ef-\nfect.\n\nIn addition to the question of unionism and money earnings, from Weiss?\nand other analyses it is often unclear whether proper measures of perquisites\nwould imply that money earnings understate or overstate the effect of union-\nism. In this regard a regression analysis suggests that union members have\nslightly longer annual vacations (by .19 week or about 1 day) in comparison\nwith nonmembers after accounting for other characteristics such as income,\nage, and education.?\n\nOf those in the sample who were 35 or older, only 22 per cent had private\npensions azd were able to report the monthly value in dollars.

This is because\nalternative jobs without union membership may pay less and because changing\njobs could entail the loss of membership.

It appears from Frank Stafford's note that union membership\nmay have a far greater impact on earnings than my own and other studies\nbased on aggregative measures of unionism have suggested. However, his terri-\nbly broad \"industries\" (such as *manufacturing\" or \"retail and wholesale\ntrade\") leave his results open to some question.\n\nSince the main concern of my article was with the effect of industrial con-\ncentration, I published only a limited portion of my information on the effect\nof unionism and made the remainder available in a multigraphed appendix.\nTable I shows a more complete set of results selected for comparison with Staf-\nford's study. The passages quoted by Stafford referred to the regressions for\nconstruction, manufacturing, and mining where I thought that the concentra-\ntion data were more meaningful than in the regulated fields. Mr. Stafford's data\ninclude all sectors, so his results should probably be compared with the last\ntwo columns of Table 1 which cover observations from both regulated and\nunregulated industries. Estimates are shown for low and high CCR (corrected\nconcentration ratios [2, p. 101]).

High collective bargaining\ncoverage seems to yield a 22 per cent advantage in average hourly earnings when CCR is\n20 and an 11 per cent advantage when CCR is 60.

The essential difference between this\nanalysis and that of Weiss is that we have measurements of all the variables on\nthe microeconomic level. Assigning variables (such as unionism) to whole\nsubgroups of individuals from aggregated data will generally result in errors in\nmeasurement.* Consequently, if the assigned variables are correlated with other\nvariables measured on the microeconomic level subject to less measurement\nerror, when these other variables are introduced into the regression the mea-\nsured effects of the assigned variables can differ markedly from their true ef-\nfect.\n\nIn addition to the question of unionism and money earnings, from Weiss?\nand other analyses it is often unclear whether proper measures of perquisites\nwould imply that money earnings understate or overstate the effect of union-\nism. In this regard a regression analysis suggests that union members have\nslightly longer annual vacations (by .19 week or about 1 day) in comparison\nwith nonmembers after accounting for other characteristics such as income,\nage, and education.?\n\nOf those in the sample who were 35 or older, only 22 per cent had private\npensions azd were able to report the monthly value in dollars.

This is because\nalternative jobs without union membership may pay less and because changing\njobs could entail the loss of membership.

                    "Railroad Social Saving: Comment\n\nThe introduction by Robert W. Fogel of the concept of social saving into\nthe world of the economic historian has formulated a revolution, the results of\nwhich certainly have not been fully digested [2]. Fogel calculated the social\nsaving (the flow of income from the resources freed by an innovation, ex-\npressed as a percentage of national income) for the railroad in 1890. This he\naccomplished by comparing the actual situation, favored with the railroad, with\na hypothetical alternative of the economy, deprived of the \"iron horse\" but\nadjusted to the next-best alternative. He found an optimistic social saving of\n6.3 per cent due to the presence of the railroad but considered a figure of less\nthan 5 per cent to be more realistic [2, p. 223].\n\nThis raises the question of the significance of this finding. Does 5 per cent\nrepresent a large or a small number? Fogel was specifically testing the hypoth-\nesis that the railroad was indispensable to American economic growth. He\nclearly believed that this figure, calculated at the peak of the railroad's influ-\nence, demonstrated that it was not. (Furthermore, if we read Fogel correctly,\nhe never implied that the railroad was unimportant, as often alleged\u2014only that\nsignificant growth could still have occurred in its absence.) It however appears\nto remain for the reader to agree or disagree, since there exists no objective\ncutoff between dispensable and indispensable.\n\nRecently E. H. Hunt, in this Review, raised the question of interpreting\nFogel's findings [5]. He concludes that the correct interpretation of the social\nsaving attributed to the railroad would support the traditional view of the rail-\nroads significance. Even though Mr. Hunt's analysis has been challenged in\nthe note immediately preceding this one, the question that he raised is real\nenough. In this note we tentatively offer an alternative way of evaluating the\nsignificance of Fogel's findings. We suggest that one could proceed by asking a\n",
                    "to this method GNP is decreasing at an increasing rate, eventually it will reach\nzero and become negative. The error is that Hunt subtracted 5 (not 5 per cent\nof the change) from GNP. Following Hunt's reasoning, if the original GNP\nwere 200 rather than 100, we would have GNP increasing at an increasing\nrate.\n\nTable 1 is the relevant table for comparison between a railroad and a non-\nrailroad economy [columns (a) and (c) respectively]. Because of an increase\nin costs, the growth rate of economy (c) will be less than that of (a); the\ndivergence of the two economies will increase at an increasing rate over time.\n\nPuiriP R. P.

If the bridge is closed and it costs\n5 per cent more to transport goods, a reopening of the bridge will reduce costs\nonce and for all by 5 per cent. The case for an economy which closes down its\nrailroads for one year is analogous except that we would expect that economy\nwould continue on its long term trend also. In Table 1 columns (a) and (b)\nconverge much more rapidly than iu Table 2 simply because Hunt failed to\nadd the social savings of railroads after he permitted them to run again.\n\nColumn (c) in Table 1 is the growth rate of the economy without railroads.\nI assume the \"normal\" rate of 4 per cent growth in GNP in the nonrailroad so-\nciety is reduced because 5 per cent of every increase in output must be de-\nvoted to transportation; that is, because of increased costs (assumed to be\n5 per cent) output will grow more slowly. If the economy were to grow with\nrailroads at 4 per cent per annum, then, according to our assumption, without\nrailroads the economy will grow at 3.8 per cent, the other .2 per cent being de-\nvoted to transport costs which would not be needed if railroads had existed. In\nTable I (2) and (c) are both growing but (a) is growing at a faster rate than\n(c).

Griliches was interested in esti-\nmating the costs of return to investment in research, and his estimates conse-\nquently are biased downward. Nevertheless, his methods follow closely those\nemployed by Fogel, Chambers and Gordon, and Gunderson. Griliches arrived\nat a net social return of $248 million annually after 1955 [3, p. 424]. This\namounts to less than .06 of 1 per cent of national income.\n\nGriliches also produces evidence that would allow a calculation of a rough\nsocial saving deriving from agricultural research for the years 1940-1950. His\nfigures show a gross social saving between $1,110 million and $5,430 million\n[3, p. 428]. Deducting the annual average cost of research of $141 million,\nthe range of net social saving is $969 million to $5,289 million. Since gross\nnational product was $329 billion in 1951, the social saving on agricultural re-\nsearch amounts to between .3 and 1.6 per cent of national income for that year.\n\nIt is clear that comparing Fogel's figure with but four other estimates is like\ndeciding an election on the returns of the first four precincts counted. The\nvalue of the decision depends upon the representativeness of the precincts se-\nlected. A reasonable case can be made that in fact these four estimates will\nprove to be fairly representative; if so, then we shall find that the railroad was\nrelatively a very important innovation.

                    "related but different question: Was the railroad, for instance, more or less im-\nportant than other innovations? Thus we should compare social savings. We\nmight expect that, had the railroad been truly indispensable, its social saving\nwould be larger than that attributed to other less spectacular innovations.\nShould it prove otherwise, then either there were other indispensable innova-\ntions or the railroad was not. Should the railroad's social saving be larger than\nany other, we can say only that it contributed more to increasing national in-\ncome than did these other innovations.\n\nThere are several a priori reasons why we should expect a social saving of\nabout 5 per cent to be relatively high. It is, after all, a once-and-for-all improve-\nment in national income equivalent to about 15 months' economic growth [2,\np. 47]. Also we would expect that the significance of any innovation would be\nproportional to its effectiveness in reducing costs and to the importance of the\nsector it influences in national output. In both cases the railroad scores rather\nwell. Fogel's results suggest that the cost in 1890 of interregional transport of\nagricultural goods that went over the railroad would in its absence have dou-\nbled [2, pp. 211]; also, the transportation sector which the railroad domi-\nnated comprised about 12 per cent of national income [6, Series F39]. It\nwould appear from these arguments unlikely for any other single innovation\n(i.e., confined to one sector) to surpass the contribution of the railroad.\n\nIndeed, this is what the few other existing studies of social savings suggest.\nWe have found four roughly similar estimates that we feel are directly com-\nparable to Fogel's. These relate to the social saving attributed to the expansion\ninto the Canadian prairies made possible by the chilled-steel plow and red fife\nwheat [1], to the introduction of the steam-powered ocean vessel [4], to the\ndevelopment of hybrid seed corn [3], and to agricultural research in general\n[3]. These, along with Fogel's famous number, are reproduced in Table 1.\n\nChambers and Gordon measured the contribution made to Canadian national\nincome by the expansion into the prairie provinces, their aim being to subject\nthe \"staple thesis\" to empirical test. They asked the question, What would Ca-\nnadian national income have been in the absence of the innovations that al-\nlowed settlement and profitable wheat production in the prairie provinces? The\nmodel they developed implies that the proper measure of the economic contri-\nbution of these innovations that led to the famous Canadian wheat *boom\" is\nthe rent on the land brought into cultivation. This amounts in 1911 to 1.94\nper cent of Canadian income [1, p. 320], which is considerably less than Fo-\ngel's calculation for the American railroad in 1890.\n\nAnother study which more closely follows Fogel's methods is Gerald Gun-\nderson's study of the social saving attributable to the steamship in the nine-\nteenth century. Using as his counterfactual proposition a world without the\nsteamship but with the sailing ship, Gunderson presents evidence that the\nfreight costs in international trade would have risen 53 per cent in the ab-\nsence of the steamship, but that the C.L.F. prices would have increased only\n4.0 per cent [4, p. 96]. Since the international trade sector is only a small\npart of national income (exports 7.4 per cent of GNP, imports 4.3 per cent, in\n1897-1901) [6, Series U45, U46], this amounts to less than a quarter of 1 per\ncent of national income.\n",

                    "Railroad Social Saving: Comment\n\nThe introduction by Robert W. Fogel of the concept of social saving into\nthe world of the economic historian has formulated a revolution, the results of\nwhich certainly have not been fully digested [2]. Fogel calculated the social\nsaving (the flow of income from the resources freed by an innovation, ex-\npressed as a percentage of national income) for the railroad in 1890. This he\naccomplished by comparing the actual situation, favored with the railroad, with\na hypothetical alternative of the economy, deprived of the \"iron horse\" but\nadjusted to the next-best alternative. He found an optimistic social saving of\n6.3 per cent due to the presence of the railroad but considered a figure of less\nthan 5 per cent to be more realistic [2, p. 223].\n\nThis raises the question of the significance of this finding. Does 5 per cent\nrepresent a large or a small number? Fogel was specifically testing the hypoth-\nesis that the railroad was indispensable to American economic growth. He\nclearly believed that this figure, calculated at the peak of the railroad's influ-\nence, demonstrated that it was not. (Furthermore, if we read Fogel correctly,\nhe never implied that the railroad was unimportant, as often alleged\u2014only that\nsignificant growth could still have occurred in its absence.) It however appears\nto remain for the reader to agree or disagree, since there exists no objective\ncutoff between dispensable and indispensable.\n\nRecently E. H. Hunt, in this Review, raised the question of interpreting\nFogel's findings [5]. He concludes that the correct interpretation of the social\nsaving attributed to the railroad would support the traditional view of the rail-\nroads significance. Even though Mr. Hunt's analysis has been challenged in\nthe note immediately preceding this one, the question that he raised is real\nenough. In this note we tentatively offer an alternative way of evaluating the\nsignificance of Fogel's findings. We suggest that one could proceed by asking a\n",
                    "to this method GNP is decreasing at an increasing rate, eventually it will reach\nzero and become negative. The error is that Hunt subtracted 5 (not 5 per cent\nof the change) from GNP. Following Hunt's reasoning, if the original GNP\nwere 200 rather than 100, we would have GNP increasing at an increasing\nrate.\n\nTable 1 is the relevant table for comparison between a railroad and a non-\nrailroad economy [columns (a) and (c) respectively]. Because of an increase\nin costs, the growth rate of economy (c) will be less than that of (a); the\ndivergence of the two economies will increase at an increasing rate over time.\n\nPuiriP R. P.
