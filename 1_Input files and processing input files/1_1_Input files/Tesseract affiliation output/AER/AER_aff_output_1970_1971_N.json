Therefore, for a central\nbank the primary decision is concerned with\nthe choice between gold and foreign exchange\nsince all foreign exchange holdings are affec-\nted by those factors that determine the price\nof gold in terms of dollars.\n\n'This is not to deny that if a country holds\npounds or other reserve currencies, addi-\ntional variables may have an influence on\nthe ratio of foreign exchange to total re-\n", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "S Or C\n\n-nlnl\n", "", "her res\n", "Serve currern\u00ab\n\n3... o n luna\n", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "s tha\n", "e betwee\n", "e choi\n", "1e\n", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ")n\n", "e secon\n", "", "", "", "", "a n\n", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "d S\n", "", "", "", "[V\n", "", "icy C\n", "", "", "", "", "ome ci\n", "", "", "ese fact\n", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "serve currency, we have excluded the ster-\nling area countries which hold most of the\nexternal pound balances.

The only\nU.K. variable that showed a significant\ninfluence was the amount of a country's ex-\nports to the U.K. relative to its total ex-\nports! We said, *...if a country exports\nprimarily to reserve-currency countries, it is\nmore likely to accept a low gold content of\nits reserves\"? By holding foreign exchange\ninstead of gold, it can help the reserve-cur-\nrency countries to avoid import restrictions\nwhich would be most harmful to its own\nforeign trade.\n\nIn conclusion, we can say that the em-\npirical analysis of Part II was intended to\ndeal with and did deal with the key question\nhow central banks allocate their interna-\ntional reserves between foreign exchange\nholdings and gold. We recognize that foreign\nexchange holdings represent a conglomerate\nof many different kinds of reserve assets.* Of\ncourse, if we had more information on the\ncomposition of foreign exchange holdings of\nthe different countries, we would probably\nbe able to refine our empirical analysis and\nmake more realistic assumptions for the hy-\npothetical calculations in Part III.\n", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "-\u2014\u2014 899\n", ")D on\n", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "central ba\nreserves\n", "s allocate\n(tween fo\n", "", "", "OW cen\n", "", "", "", "", "leir ir\n\"n ex\n", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "h wol\n", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "pu\n", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "ilv\n", "", "I\u00ab\n", "", "", "", "", "K. relative to its\n* ..1f a counti\n", "", "", "", "", "...
