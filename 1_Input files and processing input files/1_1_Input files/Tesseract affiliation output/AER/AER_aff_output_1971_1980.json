This study is part of the NBER program of\nresearch on Business Taxation and Finance. I am\ngrateful to participants in the NBER Summer Institute\nfor helpful comments, and to the NBER and the Na-\ntional Science Foundation for financial support. The\nviews expressed in this paper are my own and not those\nof the NBER or Harvard University.\n\nlThese price-earnings ratios are based on earnings\nnet of real depreciation and with the inventory valua-\ntion adjustment. See my paper with Lawrence Summers\n(1979) for the description of the method by which these\npretax price-earnings ratios are constructed. The tradi-\ntional Standard and Poor's posttax price-earnings ratio,\nbased on book profits (including inventory profits) fell\nfrom 17.45 to 9.02. An alternate measure of share-price\nperformance, the ratio of the share price to the underly-\ning real capital at replacement cost, fell from 1.214 in\n1967 to 0.788 in 1977. For further evidence of the\nadverse effect of inflation on real share prices, see\nCharles Nelson and John Lintner (1973, 1975).\n\n?The analysis also shows that it is unnecessary to\ninvoke a theory of systematic error of the type de-\nveloped by Franco Modigliani and Richard Cohn.\n\n5] emphasize that these are tax rules in the United\nStates. Share prices in other countries that do not tax\ncapital gains and that permit extremely rapid tax\ndepreciation of investments may respond very differ-\nently to inflation. The relation between share prices\nand inflation in other countries is therefore of little\nrelevance to the United States without a careful analy-\nsis of local tax rules.\n"

This is equivalent to a subsidy plus a lump sum\ntax. The government does not then have to finance the\nsubsidy.

It may also\nbe useful to distinguish between \"socialist\" labor\nmanagement (for example, the models of Furubotn and\nVanek) where property is socially owned and \"private\"\nlabor management (for example, the model of K. V.\nBerman and M. D. Berman) where individual members\nof the collective retain a private claim on the returns\nfrom investment.\n"

                    "PETER KENYON, University of Virginia:\nMy comments on Lorie Tarshis' paper are\nfew. First, Tarshis is to be thanked for his\nreminder that \"normal cost\" pricing is quite\ncompatible with profit maximization and\nstandard micro theory. It is timely for\nTarshis to remind Post-Keynesians of the\nimportance of the M/4A ratio to the func-\ntional distribution of income at the micro\nlevel\u2014that is, at the level of costs, markups,\nand prices. (Recall that Sidney Weintraub\nmade exactly the same point over twenty\nyears ago when discussing Kaldor's //Y\ntheory of profit share.)\n\nSecondly, Post-Keynesians would take\nissue with Tarshi! comments concerning\nthe investment funds theory of the markup.\nIn Keynesian and Post-Keynesian models,\none must be very careful about assumptions\nas to the state of long-term and short-term\nexpectations and their interaction. As J. A.\nKregel argues, Post-Keynesians, in the tradi-\ntion of Keynes, use a \"stationary equi-\nlibrium\" methodology, where long-period\nexpectations are held constant at a given\nlevel, but where short-period expectations\nmay be disappointed and, most importantly,\nwhere there is no feedback from the disap-\npointment of short-period expectations on\nthe state of long-period expectations.\n\nThe investment funds markup model can\nbe seen as an application of this methodol-\nogy. The state of long-term expectations\ngoverns the perception of agents about the\nevolution of *normal\" output, \"normal\"\ncosts, and the desired stock of capital goods.\nIt is under these conditions that the firm\nmakes its decisions about the desired level\nof retained profits and about the size of the\nmarkup. None of this is inconsistent with\nmaximizing expected long-period profits or\nwith a fairly constant markup or, for that\nmatter, with a variable gearing ratio\n(although Tarshis comments concerning\nsources and uses of funds is well-taken).\n\nIn addition, there is no implication that\nthe decision about the desired level of cor-\nporate saving has anything to do with cor-\nporate investment decisions. In this scheme\nof things, investment decisions are domi-\nnated by the volatile state of short-\n",

A careful application of\nthe \"stationary equilibrium\" methodology\nwould deny any implication that an act of\nsaving would lead to an increase in invest-\nment outlays. It is true, however, that Post-\nKeynesians have been rather careless about\nthis, and Tarshis' concern is well founded.\n\nMy third comment concerns two issues\nraised by Tarshis towards the end of the\npaper. The first is that Post-Keynesians\nhave paid little attention to the macro-eco-\nnomic implications of micro-adjustment\nprocesses. This sin of omission is not re-\nstricted to Post-Keynesians; however, Post-\nKeynesians have been very concerned about\nthe need to analyze processes of adjustment\nthrough historical time, and it is incumbent\nupon them to attempt this analysis. How-\never, this raises severe problems with the\nKregel/Keynes methodology discussed\nabove. It is precisely the need to model the\nfeedback from the disappointment of short-\nperiod expectations on the state of long-\nperiod expectations that is pushed aside by\nthe adoption of the Kregel/Keynes\nmethodology.\n\nThe problem is that Post-Keynesians have\nno model of expectations formation. They\nconstantly appeal to the inoperative concept\nof \"animal spirits.\" This appeal to capri-\ncious fate has led Coddington to dub\nPost-Keynesian analysis \"Chapter 12\nKeynesianism.\" The argument comes from\nKeynes' early work on probability theory,\nand says that situations involving decisions\nabout the future are uncertain and cannot\nbe reduced by applying the tools of proba-\nbility to situations involving risk. Decisions\nmust be made today about a logically un-\nknowable future; however, these decisions\nwil have long-lasting intertemporal con-\nsequences.\n\nThis is a paradox of Post-Keynesian the-\nory. It wishes to model economic processes\nthat depend upon the formation of, and\nadjustment to, the state of long-term ex-\npectations, but there is no theory of expecta-\ntions formation. In fact, it is virtually denied\nthat there ever could be such a theory: refer-\nence is continually made to chapter 12 of\n",

                    "GARY CHAMBERLAIN, University of Wis-\nconsin-Madison: The paper by John\nSiegfried and George Sweeney provides\nsome useful insights into the selection biases\nthat can arise in evaluating alternative\nteaching techniques. Say that there is a regu-\nlar program (x \u20140) and a special program\n(x1). Each individual is characterized by\na performance level under the regular pro-\ngram (yg) and under the special program\n(x). Initially we observe a mean score un-\nder the regular program. This is the sample\ncounterpart to E(yo). Then a special pro-\ngram is introduced and students are allowed\nto choose between the two techniques,\nproviding estimates of E(y,|x-\u2014]) and\nE(yo|x 0). Siegfried and Sweeney point\nout that E(y;|x ^ 1) \u2014 E(yo|x ^ 0) in general\ndiffers from  E(y,)\u2014 E(yg) if students\nchoose the program that is more effective\nfor them. A more novel point is that E(y,)\n\u2014 E(yo) is not necessarily a relevant\nmeasure of the program's effectiveness. It is\nfor a program that will replace the existing\none, but not if both programs are to be\noffered, with students free to choose be-\ntween them. In that case a relevant measure\nis E(y,|x 5 1) - E(yog|x\u2014- l), the mean in-\ncrease in performance of those who elect the\nspecial program. Siegfried and Sweeney\nnote that in general this also differs from the\ncommonly used \u00a3( y;|x ^ 1) \u2014 E(yo|x \u20140).\n\nI would like to point out that E(y,|x\u2014 1)\n\u2014 E(yox 1) is in fact readily estimable.\nWe have a direct estimate of E(y,|x- 1)\nand only need an estimate of E(yj|x- 1).\nNote that E(yg)\u20149 pE(yox ^ D - (1\u2014 p):\nE(yo|x\u20140), where p is the probability of\nselecting the special program. Since p,\nE(y9), and E(yo|x \u20140) have sample counter-\nparts, we can obtain an estimate that almost\nsurely converges to E(yo|x \u2014 1) as the sam-\nple size increases.\n\nSiegfried and Sweeney also consider esti-\nmation of E(yj)\u2014 E(yg9 when random\nassignment is not feasible. If the probability\nof using the new technique depends only on\nyo and not on the gain (y; \u2014 yo), then our\nprevious estimate of E(y,|x 4 1) - E(yg|x \u2014\nl1) is still appropriate.

                    "case is the quite plausible one in which the\nchoice of technique depends on y; \u2014 ys. As\nSiegfreid and Sweeney note, a novel tech-\nnology exists for dealing with this case, at\nleast under normality assumptions. I was\ndisappointed that no applications of this\napproach were presented in the papers. It\nshould be stressed, however, that the neces-\nsary distributional assumptions are not in-\nnocent. The model is not identified without\nspecific distributional assumptions.\n\nTo see this, consider the simple case in\nwhich x \u2014 1 if y, 2yg and x \u20140 if y, &yg. We\nobserve only x and max(yg,y;). The ob-\nserved data is not affected if yy is reduced by\nan arbitrary amount when x \u2014 l, or if y, is\nreduced by an arbitrary amount when x \u20140.\nThe empirical distribution of x,max(yg,y,)\nis not affected, and passing to the popula-\ntion we see that a given distribution for x,\nma\u00e0x(yo,y;) is consistent with any value for\nE(y)) - E(\u00bb9\n\nOne might hope that observing an instru-\nmental variable (z) that is independent of\ny, \u2014 yo but correlated with x would help. Say\nthat x \u20141 if y; \u2014yg\u2014z 20, so that there is\nobservable variation in the threshold. Once\nagain we can decrease yg by an arbitrary\namount if x \u20141, and we can decrease y, by\nan arbitrary amount if x \u20140. The population\ndistribution for x,y,,z is consistent with any\nvalue for E(y,))\u2014 E(yg); there is still no\nidentification without specific distributional\nassumptions.\n\nSo if we proceed in this direction, some\nsensitivity analysis is called for. This can\nlead to a firm negative conclusion if, for\nexample, going from the normal to the stu-\ndent family makes a big difference. The\nmore difficult question is how to settle on a\nclass of distributions that is large enough.\n\nWilliam Becker and Mathew Morey con-\nsider some of the measurement issues that\narise when test scores are available at\nseveral points in time. They are particularly\nconcerned with the bias in regressions of\nScores on previous scores. In their frame-\nwork, the previous score enters through a\nKoyck transformation of a geometric dis-\ntributed lag model, with the same lag struc-\n",

They cover a\ngreat deal of territory and contain many\nideas. Also, aside from some minor dif-\nferences, I very much agree with each paper.\nAs a group, the papers address the major\ngaps in economic research relating to the\nmarket and policy determinants, and to the\neffects on productivity growth and in-\ndustrial development of research and devel-\nopment and technological innovation. My\nmajor reservations relate to questions I\nwould have liked to have seen addressed.\n\nIn capsule form, these papers provide an\nexcellent basis for understanding some\nimportant gaps in economic research with-\nout making any substantial suggestions to\naddress these gaps. I will focus my attention\non the status of economic research in assess-\ning the relationships among research and\ndevelopment, technological innovation, pro-\nductivity growth, and industrial develop-\nment. Economic research will be viewed in\nterms of its contribution to formulating and\nassessing public policy options. There are a\nnumber of public policy domains where the\nrelationships of interest to this session play\nan important role in discussion and think-\ning. The three most prominent involve\ngovernment actions in regulating private\nsector economic activity (for example, en-\nvironmental, health, and safety regulation,\nantitrust actions), policies to stimulate eco-\nnomic growth (for example, tax credits, as-\nsistance to individual industries, credits for\nforeign trade), and government funding of\nresearch and development.\n",

He suggests more\nwork designed to evaluate the social welfare\nimpact of inequality changes attributed to\nparticular policies using explicit social\njudgements, yet where are the references to\nthe growing body of work involving applica-\ntions of Atkinson's index in an optimal\ntaxation framework to alternative welfare\nreform and tax credit proposals? And while\nhe views estimates of the overall effect of\nthe fisc on inequality as relatively unfruitful,\nthere is no acknowledgement of the value of\nsuch studies over time and no reference to\nthe most complete and consistent of these\ntime-related analyses.\n\nFinally, I would call into question the\ngeneral thrust of King's \"social welfare\neffects of incremental reduced inequality\"\nexercise. The minimum degree of inequality\naversion he admits is that which values a\ndollar going to a household with twice the\nmean income at one-half the worth as a\ndollar to a household with one-half the\nmean income. Surely there is some inequal-\nity aversion in the United States, but I have\ndifficulty believing it to be as large as King's\nminimum. Clearly his maximum is then\nquite out of the question. When he uses his\nminimum value\u2014 which may well be a real-\nistic maximum\u2014the permitted inefficiency\nloss is a meager 14 percent of GNP. Evi-\ndence on labor supply responses to transfer\nprograms based on both social experiments\nand cross-section studies suggest that a siz-\nable but by no means enormous (say, $250\nbillion) tax-financed expansion of the trans-\nfer system could well yield national income\nlosses in excess of 14 percent of national\nincome without bringing the nation even\nclose to perfect equality. Indeed, if such a\nprogram was a simple expansion in the cost\nand coverage of the current system of taxes\nand transfer programs, the reduction in\npoverty and inequality would be very small\nand the expected inefficiency losses large.\nWithout major changes in the structure of\ntaxes and transfers, reduction in equality\nper marginal dollar of efficiency lost is\nlikely to be trivial.

HAVEMAN, University of\nWisconsin-Madison: Mervyn King's paper,\neven considering constraints on length, con-\ntributes little to the discussion of the effects\nof government policy on the income distri-\nbution. I find no basis for the conclusion\nthat analysis of the distributional impact of\nparticular policies is more fruitful than\nevaluating the inequality impacts of the en-\ntire budget. The two kinds of analysis serve\nquite different purposes, but both are valu-\nable in their own right. The case for more\nlimited policy analysis was made by King\nand is clear; I would in no way dispute it.\nThe case for the more global analysis of the\ninequality effect of the fisc deserves to be\nmade. It rests, I believe, on three proposi-\ntions: 1) An overall appraisal of the existing\nimpact of the fisc on equality, even if rough,\nsets the domain for any policy discussion on\nthe need for, and the desired direction of,\nproposed tax or transfer reform. It is dif-\nficult to argue against better, more con-\nsistent numbers when poorer, inconsistent\nones would be used. 2) Analyzing the in-\nequality impact of the fisc over time using\nconsistent data and a fixed methodology\ndoes enable one to separate if only roughly\nthe time-related effect of the fisc relative to\ndemographic and labor market changes, and\nis not subject to the same critique as are\ncommon interpretations of a single year's\nestimate of fiscal impact. 3) An overall ap-\npraisal of the inequality impact of the fisc is\nin the same league as appraisals of the effect\nof, say, regulatory policy on economic\ngrowth, economic development on fertility,\nor minimum wages on unemployment\n\u2014they happen to be the *big questions\"\nabout which economists and policymakers\nalike speculate, and over which they fret. I\nwould not wish to be the first in line to\ndenigrate studies which seek to serve these\npurposes.\n\nMy second comment concerns King's ap-\nparent lack of familiarity with recent work\non a number of the issues he addresses. He\ncalls for micro-data analysis of the distribu-\ntional impacts of policy proposals which\ntake into account incentive effects, yet\n",

Monnis, University of Wash-\nington: Two decades ago, David Landes\nwrote: \"Western Europe...was already rich\nbefore the Industrial Revolution-rich by\ncomparison with other parts of the world\nof that day and with the pre-industrial\nworld of today.\" (See his book, The\nUnbound Prometheus, p. 13.) This judgment\nmerely gave further currency to Simon\nKuznets' more general statement that the\npre-industrial per capita income level of de-\nveloped countries was \"several times\" that\nof most underdeveloped countries today.\n(See his book, Economic Change.) The gen-\neral conclusion is that today's less-devel-\noped countries (LDC) face a much more\ndifficult development problem than faced\nnineteenth-century industrializers, and that\nthis difficulty derives primarily from the\nsheer poverty of these countries as measured\nby per capita income. Recently, however, a\nflurry of essays have directly challenged this\nview.\n\nThe Heston-Summers essay points in a\nsomewhat similar revisionist direction. Their\nresults, with which I have no quarrel, should\ntend to dampen the rather extreme views\nthat have derived from Kuznets' suggestion.\nThe difference between India and U.S. per\ncapita incomes in 1870, when adjusted by\npurchasing power parities (PPP), gets re-\nduced to 4 or 5 to 1, a fairly modest ratio\nfor a date when the United States was\nalready a highly developed country and\nIndia was at the bare beginning of its very\nslow modern development. Pushed back to\nan even earlier era, the Indian-U.S. dif-\nference would certainly amount to very\nmuch less than that.\n\nOne important conclusion Heston and\nSummers draw is that a successful develop-\nment effort in South Asia (and by implica-\ntion in LDCSs generally) will require many\nfewer resources than calculations based on\nofficial exchange rates suggest. Referring to\nthe heterogeneity of South Asia, Heston and\nSummers remark that there are \"several\nvery large regions (each) with populations\nin the tens of millions, that have shown\n",

Heston and\nSummers now convincingly illustrate the\neven greater danger of making these com-\nparisons over time. But policymakers and\nscholars feel free to ignore the implica-\ntions of PPP adjustments. Similarly, I fear\nthat having made a ritual obeisance to the\nHeston-Summers thesis about historical\ntrends, development analysts will continue\nto operate as if this remains the best of all\nworlds.\n\nImportant a contribution though it is, the\nPPP adjustment still leaves many difficult\nproblems unresolved. Purchasing power par-\nity does not cope at all with the trouble-\nsome implications of differences in social\norganization among countries about which\nKuznets wrote so long ago. Moreover, the\nHeston-Summers PPP adjustment cannot\nsatisfy those fundamental conditions which\nare crucial if we are to think about the\ninternational welfare implications of these\nincome comparisons. I refer here to ques-\ntions about the stability of preferences and\nconsumption bundles over time and about\nthe meaningfulness of a social or national\nwelfare concept.\n\nFocusing on per capita income, even\nwhen the data incorporate the Heston and\nSummers improvement, is not the way to a\nsatisfactory understanding of the develop-\nment process. This is not only for reasons\nalready advanced, but because economic\nhistorians are beginning to recognize the\nwidely diverse patterns of development\nthrough which even the already developed\ncountries have moved. The strategic analytic\nfeatures lie not in the levels of per capita\nincome attained but in the institutional\narrangements which help or hamper the\nachievement of specific objectives.\n\nThe importance of this theme emerges\nmost clearly when we examine real welfare\n",

If this 1s so, since\nmuch of the current evidence is based\non conventional hours measures, effective\nhours and labor supply may be more sensi-\ntive to incentives than is suggested by most\nof the evidence derived from analysis of\nhours of work.\n\nThe choice of retirement age is one ele-\nment in the broader class of questions that\narise in connection with such policies as the\nearnings test for Social Security recipients\nand the effects of programs such as unem-\nployment insurance, disability insurance,\ntrade adjustment assistance, and the treat-\nment of benefits from these various pro-\ngrams under the income tax law. These vari-\nous programs have potentially important\neffects on labor supply, and analyses of\nthem can potentially provide additional in-\nsight into labor supply sensitivity.\n\nA third dimension of labor supply dis-\ncussed in the paper is labor quality in the\ncontext of human capital investment. For\nreliable evidence on this question I think a\nfairly comprehensive approach is necessary.\nEducation and training are strategic deci-\nsions, with students and their parents par-\nticipating jointly in the decisions. They are\nstrategic in the sense that they involve actu-\nally developing attributes that are usually\ntaken as given in labor supply studies. What\nneeds to be taken into account in analysis of\nsuch lifetime choices is not only differences\nin before-tax wages (which are themselves\nlikely to be affected by the tax system), but\nalso the incidence of taxes for different\nearnings profiles. To address the entire dis-\ntribution of human capital investment and\nearnings, account would have to be taken of\nthe terms under which income support and\nservices are available at the low end of the\ndistribution. Essentially, what is at issue is\ndifferences in real after-tax and after-trans-\nfer incomes that are associated with dif-\nferences in human capital investment.\n\nFinally, one aspect of the labor supply\nevidence that is not discussed in Rosen's\npaper\u2014but which I believe may be of\ngreater importance than some that are dis-\ncussed\u2014is the role of customary work prac-\n",

One of the most notable\nadvances in this area of research has been\nthe introduction of nonlinearity into models\nand estimating techniques in order to\nanalyze the effects of taxes. It is interesting,\nhowever, that, at least in a qualitative sense,\nthe results of early research suggesting\n\"small\" substitution effects for adult males\nand considerable sensitivity for married\nwomen have not been altered greatly by\nnew and sophisticated analyses of conven-\ntional data and of information from income\nmaintenance experiments.\n\nIt is heartening that labor supply incen-\ntives have received so much attention. What\nis less encouraging, however, is that there\nremains considerable uncertainty about how\nmuch confidence can be placed on the evi-\ndence that has been developed. One source\nof uncertainty has conceptual roots. Income\nfrom nonemployment sources has usually\nbeen treated as largely exogenous in labor\nsupply estimation. But in a life cycle model\nof asset accumulation, hours and assets can\nbe expected to be simultaneously deter-\nmined by similar economic forces; that is,\nassets, and hence nonemployment income,\nare endogenous. As it happens, the prob-\nlems this creates for estimation are likely to\nbe more critical for adult males than for\nmarried women. Consequently, in my view,\nwe can place more confidence in the esti-\nmates that have been developed for married\nwomen (where the evidence indicates eco-\nnomically significant responses) than for\nadult males (where the evidence suggest\nonly small effects).\n\nIn his paper, Harvey Rosen discusses\nsome questions on which there is little re-\nsearch evidence, such as the adequacy of\nconventional measures of labor supply. In\nhis discussion of \"intensity of work,\" he\nsuggests that \"effective\" hours of work may\nbe more responsive to wages than conven-\n",

                    "MARYANN O'HaAGAN KzariNG, St. Mary's\nCollege (Notre Dame): My comments on\nJulie Matthaei's paper are more suggestive\nthan critical. First, it must be emphasized\nthat the historical development of the\nAmerican two-career family is not a univer-\nsal experience. Second, rather than suggest-\ning that society constructs two different\ntypes of human beings, could not one say\nthat the absolute advantage in bearing\nchildren and the relative advantage in\nhomemaking have historically expressed\nthemselves in certain forms of model\nhousehold and employment agreements?\nThird, a critical thesis developed in\nMatthaei's paper is that the technology of\ncommodity production caused women to\nenter the labor force to secure products for\nthemselves and their families. She might ex-\nplore how these developments altered the\nterms of trade within the family. Fourth, the\npaper suggests that women at present are\nlocked into sex-typed jobs with work agree-\nments that are obsolete with respect to their\nown identity and changed family relation-\nships. As an overall conclusion, I must take\na more pessimistic outlook in expecting the\nworkplace to conform to the needs of the\ntwo-career family. The difficulties as-\nsociated with such a family, given socie-\ntys low premium on children, will neces-\nsarily be internalized, hopefully with both\npartners bearing the cost.\n\nThe major hypothesis of Daniel Quinlan's\nand Jean Shackelford's paper is that female\nemployment is a doubly derived demand. It\nis first derived from the demand for males,\nwho assume leadership and high-paying\n",

Because the greatest in-\ncrease in female labor force participation\nsince 1950 is in clerical work, it is hypothe-\nsized that female labor force participation in\ngeneral can be explained by the percentage\nof males in managerial and professional\nwork in the previous decade and by female\nparticipation in the secondary sector. The\nQuinlan-Shackelford empirical results failed\nto support this hypothesis, and they do not\nsuggest an alternative hypothesis. Why?\nFirst, there is not enough variance in\ncross-sectional state data. Second, clerical\nworkers may be experiencing a technologi-\ncal substitution of machinery and/or col-\nlege-educated managers, who are themselves\nplentiful, relatively inexpensive, and willing\nto assume clerical and secretarial duties.\nThird, the Standard Industrial Classification\nof Occupations is much too aggregated\nto produce very meaningful results about\nmanpower shifts. However, 1 am sympa-\nthetic to the basic idea of the paper. It is the\ncase that in many fields such as medicine\nand education, much of the work is done by\nwomen in traditional paramedical and\nteaching occupations. However, these wo-\nmen earn one-third to one-half of their male\nsupervisors who \"check\" to see if the teeth\nhave really been cleaned, or the fractions\ntaught. It is unfortunate that the Quinlan-\nShackelford paper did not key in on those\nfields where quasi-monopolistic licensing,\nalong with sex-typing, would confirm their\nhypothesis.\n",

                    "JouN W. KENDRICK, George Washing-\nton University and University of Hawaii: I\nam in full agreement with the central\nmessage of Edward Denison's paper that\ntangible capital formation is only one of a\nnumber of important sources of economic\ngrowth. In view of the extensive studies of\ngrowth and development during the past\ngeneration, particularly Denison's own well-\nknown growth accounting exercises, the ex-\nclusive focus on investment by some policy\nmakers does seem strange.\n\nPerhaps the most charitable explanation\nis that these policymakers construe invest-\nments in a broader sense, and expect that\nmeasures to create a more favorable climate\nand incentives for tangible investment will\nalso help to stimulate research and develop-\nment outlays and human investments, par-\nticularly in education and training.\n\nThe decline in the rate of advance of\ntechnological knowledge after 1966, reflect-\ning a sharp drop in the R&D/ GNP ratios,\nwas undoubtedly a factor reducing the rate\nof growth in real capital stocks per worker.\nAlthough education and training per worker\ncontinued to grow at or above prior rates,\nslowing technological advance appears to\nhave reduced the rate of return on, and\nproductivity of, education and training.\nNevertheless, as documented in my mono-\ngraph The Formation and Stocks of Total\nCapital, the growth of real capital stocks,\ntangible and intangible, accounted for only\nabout three-fourths of the growth of real\nGNP in the United States, 1929-69. The\nother quarter was due to noncapital forces\nsuch as economies of scale, resource reallo-\ncations, the net impact of governmental in-\nterventions, and changes in labor efficiency\nas such.\n\nI believe that William Freund, author of\nthe study Reaching a Higher Standard of\nLiving (to which I contributed the analysis\nof sources of productivity growth, and of\nthe slowdown after 1973) had a broader\nview of the policies required to return to a\ngrowth rate of real product per hour of 3\npercent than was implied by Denison. While\nFreund put primary emphasis on policies to\n",

                    "ALLAN H. MELTIZER, Carnegie-Mellon\nUniversity: Robert Gordon has undertaken\nto explain the rate of price change in each\nof the past eighty-seven years. I applaud his\neffort because I believe that much more can\nbe learned from studies of annual data, de-\nspite the imprecision in earlier years, than\nfrom additional studies of quarterly data for\nthe recent past.\n\nDuring the period Gordon considers, the\nUnited States shifted from gold to a paper\nstandard, and from fixed to floating ex-\nchange rates. The role of government in the\neconomy expanded greatly. From studies of\nthis experience, we can learn about the con-\nsequences of these and other changes for\ninflation, price, and output variability, and\nthe formation of anticipations. Eventually,\nwe will learn about the institutions that in-\ncrease or reduce variability.\n\nGordon's principal findings are: 1) there\nis a nearly constant response of the per-\ncentage rate of price change to the per-\ncentage rate of change of nominal GNP; 2)\nthe size of the response is approximately\none-third; 3) there is a slower response by\nthe prices observed during postwar reces-\nsions (mainly the result of changes in beliefs\nabout persistent inflation and not, as com-\nmonly alleged, the result of increased\npowers of unions and monopolies or other\nchanges in the relation between prices and\noutput); 4) the standard Phillips curve is far\nless reliable than a relation that links output\nor spending to the price level so that the rate\nof price change varies with the rate of\ngrowth of output or spending, and not with\nthe level of spending or output; and 5) the\nlagged inflation rate is now a far more im-\nportant predictor of current inflation than\nbefore World War II.\n\nConclusions 3) and 4) are consistent with\nand supportive of my own earlier work,\nespecially the rejection of the standard Phil-\nlips curve on the grounds that it is misspeci-\nfied.

                    "United States left the gold standard. The\ngreater importance of past average rates of\nchange of money and prices does not mean\nthat people now look farther back when\nforming anticipations about the future rate\nof inflation. The opposite is more likely to\nbe true.\n\nTo see why, think of the current rate of\nprice change p as consisting of two compo-\nnents, p \u2014 7t p. The anticipated rate of in-\nflation 7 is the central value around which\nprices are expected to change; p is the one-\ntime rate of change of prices. (See Gordon's\nequation (3). Under the gold standard, v\nchanged slowly, but p changed frequently.\nConsequently, people looked back farther to\nestimate z, but gave less weight to 7 when\nforming anticipations about p. In the 1950's\nand 1960's, v dominated p, so past average\nmoney growth (or past rates of price\nchange) received greater weight in the ex-\npected rate of inflation. The oil shocks of\nthe 1970's shifted some of the weight from z\nback to p.\n\nGordon's conclusions 1) and 2) differ\nfrom Phillip Cagan's and my own earlier\nresult. The difference in conclusion is re-\nlated to the way in which Gordon models\nthe pricing process. His model, like many\nstandard Phillips curves, is based on an im-\nplausible idea. Deviations of prices from\nexpected price levels depend on the gap\nbetween current output and some measure\nof capacity. The problem does not depend\non either the use of price levels instead of\nrates of price change or on the use of output\ninstead of employment. Expected price\nlevels are not related to expected levels of\noutput except in the special case in which\nthe economy is near capacity. The use of\ncapacity involves sizeable error in the de-\npressions of the 1890's and the 1930's.\n\nGordon overcomes the problem by in-\ntroducing lagged \"net\" price change as a\nmeasure of anticipated inflation. Net price\nchange is not significant in the heyday of\nthe gold standard. The lack of significance\nwarns us, and should have warned Gordon,\nthat his explanation of a shift from regres-\n",

Thus, the traditional Paasche\nand Laspeyres indexes could be abandoned\nin favor of procedures which do not unduly\nconstrain the production structure. The non-\nparametric approach has received less atten-\ntion than the index number approach, partly\nbecause it is still in the experimental stage,\nbut also because it sacrifices much of the\nsimplicity associated with the index number\napproach.\n\nIs there a logical order in which to apply\nmultiple methods? It is my view that best\npractice in productivity estimation is to be-\ngin by employing an unrestrictive index\nnumber procedure and to conclude by using\nthe econometric approach, employing a flex-\nible functional form. It is sufficient to rely\nsolely on the index number result only if the\nassumptions of constant returns to scale and\nfull competitive equilibnum are deemed\nsatisfactory. Otherwise, estimated productiv-\nity growth will reflect such factors as scale\ndiseconomies and changes in capacity utili-\nzation\u2014which are movements along the\nproduction function.\n\nWhile these problems may suggest that\nthe index number approach be abandoned\nentirely, such a conclusion is unwarranted.\nMost of the effort required to obtain index\nnumber estimates is also required to obtain\neconometric estimates. Consideration of in-\ndex number estimates might well reveal data\nproblems which could otherwise remain un-\ndetected and lead to erroneous econometric\nresults. Furthermore, the index number ap-\nproach can be applied to highly disaggre-\ngated data, whereas the econometric ap-\nproach requires considerable aggregation.\nFinally, as Caves, Christensen, and Swanson\nhave demonstrated, there may be applica-\ntions in which it is attractive to combine the\nindex number and econometric approaches.\n\nIn his final section Diewert observes that\nthe existence of capital goods creates nu-\nmerous problems for the practitioner. To\nhis list of problems, I would like to add\nwhat I would consider to be the most seri-\nous practical problem: the economic entity\nmay not be holding the stock of capital\n",

                    "LaAunirs R. CHRISTENSEN, University of\nWisconsin-Madison:W. E. Diewert has pro-\nvided an excellent overview of the theoreti-\ncal underpinnings of several approaches to\nthe estimation of total factor productivity. I\nwill discuss the approaches from the point\nof view of one who wishes to use the best\navailable techniques for estimating produc-\ntivity growth.\n\nDiewert emphasizes the differences\namong the approaches and treats them as\nsubstitutes. The practitioner would be well-\nadvised to recognize the similarities of the\napproaches and to view them as comple-\nmentary. Productivity growth, as defined by\nDiewert, is a shift in the production func-\ntion over time. All of the approaches dis-\ncussed by Diewert presume the existence of\na well-behaved production function and at-\ntempt to disentangle shifts in the produc-\nton function from movements along the\nfunction. Since the objective is the same in\neach case, it is desirable to bring multiple\nmethods to bear on the problem, rather than\nrelying on the findings of a single approach.\nA good productivity study might well read\nlike a good detective story: clues from a\nvariety of approaches can supplement each\nother and provide important cross checks in\norder to shed light on the true (but not\ndirectly observable) state of affairs. Results\nfrom alternative approaches are particularly\nimportant when evaluating the econometric\napproach which is complicated and contains\nthe most potential pitfalls. Armed with clues\nfrom the other approaches, the investigator\nwill be in a much better position to interpret\nresults from the econometric approach.\n\nDiewert distinguishes four approaches,\nbut in view of the very close relation be-\ntween the Divisia and exact index number\napproaches, it is useful to combine them\nunder the heading of *the index number\napproach.\" This approach has received con-\nsiderable attention in recent years due, in no\nsmall part, to Diewert's 1976 article which\nintroduced the concept of superlative index\nnumber procedures. This work made it pos-\nsible to choose among index number proce-\ndures on the basis of the flexibility which\n",

An industrialized world riddled\nwith unpredictable tariffs and import quotas\ncould turn export drives into disasters.\n\nWill the 1980's be more like the 1960's\nthan like the 1930'3? Some economists\nworry that fine tuning commercial policy to\nworld circumstances will lead to renewed\nThird World excesses in import substitution.\nPerhaps, but the advice that Third World\ncountries should design their trade policies\nas if the state of the world economy did not\nmatter (or as if they were small at all times)\nsuggests evangelical fervor rather than sci-\nentific analysis. The advice *equate IMRT\nto DMRT\" is unimpeachable but, alas, not\nso operational once one departs from the\nsmall-country assumption and the number\nof goods multiplies.\n\nThird World regional trading arrange-\nments could be viewed as insurance against\na rest-of-the-world in depression; the Latin\nAmerican import substitution efforts of the\n1930's would have been even more impres-\nsive within the framework of a regional\ncommon market. Krueger observes that un-\nder more prosperous circumstances south-\nern common markets remain a complement\nto North-South trade, a complement whose\neconomic welfare consequences are moot\nand whose politics are prickly.\n\nEconomic size is bound to influence the\ntrade-growth nexus. Brazilian growth during\nthis century has been vigorous under a\nvariety of alternating trade regimes; Uru-\nguayan or Dominican growth will show\ngreater sensitivity to trade regimes and will\nbe seriously impeded by excessive import\nsubstitution. What about social systems?\nPerhaps the most impressive bit of evidence\nin favor of Krueger's protrade arguments\ncomes from the trend toward greater open-\nness in socialist countries. Cuba, for exam-\nple, views trade with both socialist and\nnonsocialist countries as a source of scarce\nforeign exchange needed to buy technology,\n",

DiAZz ALEJANDRO, Yale Uni-\nversity: Since Adam Smith, the professional\nmainstream has felt that the closer commer-\ncial policies are to free trade the higher the\ngrowth rate will be. Yet, as Anne Krueger\npoints out, there are few models showing\nthat link both rigorously and convincingly.\nTheorists have handled better the effects on\ntrade of exogenously given growth than the\neffects on growth of different degrees of\npolicy-determined openness. Real income\nlevels can be shown to be modified by trade\npolicies, but it is difficult to translate once-\nand-for-all trade gains into higher steady-\nstate long-run growth rates. Little more than\nthe poverty of extant growth theory should\nbe read from all this.\n\nAs Krueger notes, there is substantial\nempirical evidence showing a positive cor-\nrelation between export performance and\ngrowth. However, that evidence typically re-\nfers to post-World War II years; it could be\nargued that other historical epochs tell dif-\nferent stories. When most of the Third\nWorld was under colonial rule export pro-\nmotion was the rule; growth consequences,\nespecially when the industrialized countries\nwere in a slump, were less than spectacular.\nOther development goals, such as those\ndealing with income distribution and\ndomestic institution building, fared worse.\n\nDuring the 1930's, Latin American coun-\ntries which moved away from the gold\nstandard and /aissez-faire orthodoxies reg-\nistered better growth rates than those which\ndid not (or could not). Note that there is\nroom for discussion whether the trade poli-\ncies of the largest Latin American countries\ndeparted significantly from Krueger's criter-\nion (equate /MRT to DMRT). The point is\nthat when the industrialized world is in de-\npression no country is small; external de-\nmand price elasticities sag, providing neo-\nclassical justification for some trade taxes.\nEdgeworth, Keynes, and Krueger all may\nlook approvingly upon Brazil's departure\nfrom /aissez-faire during the 1930's, even if\nagreeing that policy could have been re-\nfined.

                    "the 1938 changes in FDA regulation were\nsimply part of a general trend of the times\nto seek to interpose government between\nparticipants in a market owing to the de-\ncline in faith in markets that came about as\na result of the Great Depression.\n\nTemin notes that a more complicated\nworld developed in the 1950's, which natu-\nrally raises the question of whether the\nmandatory prescription regulation is justi-\nfied now, even if it was not in 1938. For\nsome categories of drugs, Temin is un-\ndoubtedly correct. For example, one could\nimagine a world in which a patient could\ndeal directly with a medical laboratory to\nobtain tests about the cause of an infection,\nand if the laboratory identified a particular\nbacterium as the cause, then deal directly\nwith a pharmacist to purchase an ap-\npropriate antibiotic. A visit with a doctor\nmay not always be a necessary part of the\nprocess. However, doctors are aware of\nsome types of problems and uses of drugs,\nand particularly drug interactions, that con-\nsumers might miss, even if we all owned our\nown Physicians! Desk Reference, as is em-\nphasized by Temin's horror story about\nchloramphenicol.\n\nEven if this were not the case, economists\"\nviews about the reliability of informed\nchoice are not widely shared in the case of\nmedical care. Doctors and public health\nofficials note that a very large proportion of\ndrug use is by either children or the elderly,\nneither of which is necessarily able to\nmake informed judgments. Moreover, medi-\ncal care professionals claim that alarmingly\nlarge numbers of people abuse drugs or\nsuffer from hypochondria, and argue that\ndoctors keep some of them away from self-\ndestruction by use of the prescription regu-\nlation. These views cannot simply be\nignored in the debate about the proper\nscope of drug regulation.\n\nTemin's discussion of the court case in-\nvolving chloramphenicol leaves a few ques-\ntions open. The efficiency consequences of\nthe case that Temin discusses seem to not be\nvery important. Consider an automatic rule\n",

                    "RocER G. NorL, California Institute of\nTechnology: Peter Temin's work makes the\nimportant point that following the 1938\nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, consumers\nhave had to use doctors as gatekeepers for\naccess to most drugs. This distorts incen-\ntives through the medical care sector, and\ncreates numerous potentially important in-\nefficiencies. Temin has added two new ob-\nservations: first, the post-1938 regulations\nmake consumers more ignorant about drugs\nthan they would otherwise be, creating evi-\ndence in support of further regulation; and\nsecond, the regulations have adverse effects\nupon the attitudes of courts in adjudicating\ndamage suits. A third point made by Temin\nis that the 1938 changes probably made the\ndrug industry less competitive; however, this\nis a secondary point and is (correctly) not\nclaimed as original.\n\nMost economists would not quarrel with\nTemin's policy conclusion that government\nshould rely more upon consumers in the\nprocess by which drug decisions are made.\nIndeed, the FDA in recent years has advo-\ncated better information for consumers\nabout prices of drugs and their aspects. A\ngap is left in Temin's analysis by the conclu-\nsion to eliminate mandatory prescriptions.\nHis proposal of patient package inserts 1s\nnormally suggested in the context of the\ntraditional mode of medical practice, not as\na substitute for prescriptions. It is one thing\nto say that patients know their own attitudes\nabout alternative risks better than anyone\nelse, including doctors, but it is another to\nsay that PPIs and the like will enable\npatients to make unassisted decisions about\ndrug choice and dosage.\n\nTemin correctly points out that in 1938\nthe problem of drug choice was not very\ncomplicated for two reasons: there were not\nvery many useful drugs, and doctors did not\nknow very much about the effects of the\nones that were then in use. In this milieu,\none could hardly argue that the disen-\nfranchisement of drug consumers accounted\nfor some quantum leap in the welfare of the\npopulace. Temin has argued elsewhere that\n",

BULOW,\nStanford Graduate School of Business: The\nfirst order of business is to commend\nBarbara Fraumeni and Dale Jorgenson for\ntheir massive but high-quality data-gather-\ning effort, of which the paper today is only a\nsmall manifestation. Their estimates of in-\ndustry capital stocks and returns will be\nuseful to researchers in several areas.\n\nWe were curious to see how the nominal\nreturn estimates presented by Fraumeni-\nJorgenson (hereafter F-J) would compare\nwith the implicit estimates of investors who\nparticipated in the stock market during the\nsame period (1948-76). Our source was\nStandard and Poor's (S- P) Market Analysts?\nHandbook. We found there industries or sets\nof industries coinciding with twenty-one of\nthe SIC groupings used by F-J. (See our\nTabulation, which is a comparison of S-P\nand F-J estimates of nominal industry rates\nof return for 1948-76. The * denotes\n1957\u201476 data) For each S-P industry we\ncalculated the average dividend yield and\nthe average growth of the stock price index\nover the period. The sum of these two num-\nbers was taken as an approximation to the\nactual nominal return experienced in the\nmarket. (Note that a really careful analysis\nwould take into account variations in di-\nvidend yield over time, interindustry dif-\nferences in debt-equity ratios, and the return\nto intangible stocks corresponding to flows\nlike advertising or research and develop-\nment.) Where several S-P industries corre-\nsponded to one SIC group, we aggregated\nusing relative market values as weights.\n\nBasically, we found a good match be-\ntween the S-P and F-J results. The rank\ncorrelation is .57, rising to .79 when the\nthree regulated utilities are left out. Without\nthe utilities, this is higher than the correla-\ntion of the S-P ranking and an ordering\nbased on standard accounting rates of re-\nturn (that correlation was .59). That is, F-J\npredict the ordering of stock market returns\nover industries better than does information\non earnings and book values. F-J and S-P\nalso agree reasonably well in absolute\nterms: eight of the twenty-one industries\n",

                    "JEROME A. Mank, U.S. Bureau of Labor\nStatistics: The problems Albert Rees men-\ntions are certainly present in the productiv-\nity measures, and the government agencies,\nparticularly the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\nhave been aware of them. While I would\nagree that there probably is some downward\nbias to the BLS measures of productivity, I\ndo not believe it is very large, as may seem\nto be indicated by Rees' observations.\n\nThe problem of inclusion of input\nmeasures for output in the National Income\nand Product Accounts has a very small im-\npact on the BLS measure, which excludes\ngeneral government, households, and in-\nstitutions precisely for this reason. As Rees\nmentions, only 5 percent of the measure of\ntotal real output is probably affected by this\nproblem.\n\nOn the price deflators, I would agree that\nthe lag in the introduction of new and\nchanging products like computers does lead\nto an upward bias in the price measures and\nhence a downward bias in the output\nmeasure. However, on the general question\nof quality change I am not sure that we\nknow the overall direction of the quality\nerror. Jack Triplett, in his survey of studies\nmeasuring quality change in the price in-\ndexes (in Analysis of Inflation, edited by\nPaul H. Earl) observed that some studies\nhave produced quality-adjusted price index-\nes which rise more slowly than counterpart\ncomponents in the CPI or WPI deflators,\nwhile for others the indexes have risen more\nthan the comparable BLS or BEA indexes.\nAlso, the Rees panel report pointed out that\nthe price indexes can contain an upward or\ndownward bias because of the measurement\nof quality change. As Triplett concludes, we\nare a long way from being able to estimate\nthe quality error in the indexes or even to\nestimate the sign of the error in the overall\nindexes.\n\nThe use of hours paid rather than worked\nmost likely results in a downward bias, but\nat present we only have a very crude esti-\nmate of its magnitude and that is not very\nlarge. The BLS task force did examine an\nhours-worked measure using various sources\n",

This method, which is similar to that\ndeveloped by Ed Denison, rests on the\nassumption that categories of labor input\nare paid according to their respective margi-\nnal products. This assumption, as Rees\npoints out, is tenuous in some cases.\n\nThe BLS welcomes the recommendation\nthat multifactor productivity measurement\nbe undertaken and research effort has\nalready been directed along those lines. The\nundertaking is a major one, however. The\nissues of capital measurement are particu-\nlarly troublesome, and capital measurement\nfor productivity analysis rests on different\nprinciples from those appropriate to na-\ntional income accounting. We are also work-\ning with the BEA and the Bureau of the\nCensus to try to improve the data collection\nto permit better capital measurement. Key\nproblems include more detailed measure-\nment of investment by asset class, better\ninformation on retirements and depreciation\nof capital goods, information on land hold-\nings, and detail on inventories by finished\ngoods, raw materials, and goods in process\ncategories.\n\nAt present, reasonably reliable data on\nenergy inputs are available only for the\nmanufacturing sector, and that only annu-\nally. Thus, multifactor productivity mea-\nsures which include energy and materials\ncan be constructed only for that sector. Sim-\nilarly, capital stock data outside agriculture\nand manufacturing are not separated by in-\ndustry on a basis consistently updated and\n",

Rate-base regula-\ntion, now nearing its first centenary, em-\nbodies an asymmetrical contradiction favor-\ning the regulated companies which is why it\nseemingly is a permanent feature of the\nprivate power structure of America.\n\nThomas Standish asserts that the old reg-\nulatory paradigm of monopoly power versus\nregulators has somehow dissolved, leaving\nus with a new paradigm: integrated plan-\nning versus unacceptable risks. In the econ-\nomy as a whole, pursuit of increased\nefficiency (and presumably profits) has\nachieved both objectives through ever-in-\ncreasing integration both of the scale of\nphysical goods production, and of financial\nand administrative corporate organization.\nThere has been a tradeoff of efficiency\nversus systemic insecurity because of the\nvulnerability of the giant edifice to break-\ndown due to failure of the parts to dovetail\nreliably into a state of steadily increasing\nefficiency. In short, regulators can best serve\nthe public interest by participating in plan-\nning with industry at both the level of states\nand the nation to maximize overall\nefficiency.\n\nIs efficiency best served by monopoly on\nan ever grander scale rather than by the\ncompetition of smaller independent enter-\nprises? His paper does not sustain the\nburden of proof. What does he mean by\nreducing the growing risks of increasing\nscale? Do not unacceptable risks imply un-\nacceptable costs? And how should regula-\ntors be prepared to act against these risks?\nNothing is specified.\n\nAre we prepared to make the ideologi-\ncal jump which his proposal entails? The\nAmerican system has presented itself as one\nbased on competitive free enterprise. Public\nutility regulation was justified to the public\nas a means by which the aims of competi-\ntive free enterprise might be accomplish-\ned through the alchemy of legalizing and\nregulating monopoly enterprises.

SMvrHE, Simon Fraser Uni-\nversity: The Trebing and Standish papers\nconcern three questions: Is the process of\nregulating public utilities symmetrical as is\nusually assumed? Is it a viable institution\nunder conditions prevailing in the 1980's?\n*Will we be on time for 7984?\"\n\nHarry Trebing reviews the formidable\nproblems facing the regulatory process,\nespecially those stemming from its attempt\nto regulate price and earnings. It seems the\nproblems in the traditional regulatory pro-\ncess put the regulatory authority in the posi-\ntion of the person on the treadmill. No\nmatter how doggedly the runner persists, the\ntreadmill looms ahead. The net effect is to\nput the viability of price-earnings regulation\n1n question.\n\nThe viability question is sharpened if we\nreexamine the basic assumptions underlying\nit. At the outset, it was assumed that the\nregulatory institutions and courts would\nhave power at least equal to and perhaps\ngreater than that of the regulated firms. In\nreality this was never the situation. In terms\nof expertise (paid for as operating expenses\npassed on to the consumer), the regulated\nfirms always outweighed the regulators.\nThere has been a fatal ambivalence in the\nposture of the regulators because of the\nterms of the statutes and how they were\nconstrued. The regulator was supposed to\nsimultaneously favor consumer interests\nwhile also being impartial in a quasi-judicial\nprocess. The statutes typically failed to con-\nfer power to regulate certain functions of\nthe regulated entity which resulted in the\nlatter presenting the regulators with faits\naccomplis. I refer here to innovation, financ-\ning, planning, and public relations (includ-\ning advertising). Finally, there was a basic\nimbalance in effective political power. The\nmonopoly to be regulated rolls on appar-\nently permanently as a political power for-\nmation. But consumer advocacy is a tran-\nsient, and unstable political force.\n\nThe whole apparatus was created because\nthe private enterprises concerned wanted to\nhead off public ownership between the\n1880's and 1920's, and because naive re-\n",

                    "Recent studies by Morrison and others\nhave shown, however, that migration in the\n1970's is not explained by such an assump-\ntion. There is considerable migration from\nhigher to lower income places, resulting in\nsubstantial net population gains for such\nlower income areas. A set of work force\nmigration studies which we have been con-\nducting at the Urban Institute has shown\nthat both interregional and intermetropoli-\ntan sector migrants generally experience\ngreater increases in mean wages than non-\nmigrants regardless of the relative income\nlevels of origins and destinations. This sug-\ngests that general wage differences between\nareas may not be as important in determin-\ning migration flows as the wage differences\nexpected by individual migrants. These\nlatter expectations are not necessarily corre-\nlated with area wage differences. Other re-\ncent migration studies (see, for example,\nAnn Bartel's 1979 paper in the American\nEconomic Review) have shown that migra-\ntion probabilities are influenced by job\ntenure, quitting a job, and being separated\nfrom a job which are not uniformly corre-\nlated with wages. It is not necessarily the\ncase, therefore, that wage differences be-\ntween areas would have to rise over time to\nproduce a constant rate of net immigration.\n\nAlonso's major point, however, is that\nmigration produces further endogenous\nchanges in the population of both the send-\ning and receiving areas. Migration tends to\nmake net receiving areas younger and losing\nareas older. These age-distribution changes\ncreate further changes in the total fertility\nrates in both kinds of places. Further endog-\nenous change in both migration patterns\nand fertility rates of nonmigrants might be\nproduced by changes in job availability, sta-\nbility, wage rates, and externalities attribut-\nable to the location decisions of migrants.\n\nRepeat migration is an interesting part of\nthe puzzle. Bartel suggests that this has to\ndo with job tenure and the decision to\nchange jobs, not simply length of residence.\nOur migration studies show that high-\nimmigration rates are generally associated\nwith high outmigration rates for regional\n",

                    "HanvEY A. GaARN, The Urban Institute:\nWilliam Alonso notes that urban and re-\ngional models have generally assumed that\nemployment growth influences population\ngrowth with population migration treated as\nthe mechanism which equates labor supply\nto demand. There has been recent discus-\nsion in the literature which suggests that the\ninfluence of population growth on employ-\nment has been growing and may be the\nmajor influence. Those who argue this case\nattribute the change in strength to increas-\ning importance of markets in industrial\nlocation partly as a result of shifts in the\noverall distribution of employment toward\nservices and away from manufacturing. My\nreading of the evidence is that, even though\nboth effects are clearly operating, the pre-\ndominant effect is still a population re-\nsponse to patterns of employment change\nrather than the reverse. The issue is of con-\nsiderable importance from a policy perspec-\ntive, since it influences the mix of programs\nwhich might be suggested for stemming the\njoint decline of employment and population\nfrom many of our large urban areas. The\nquestion is whether one would expect better\nresults from a mix which puts most weight\non direct efforts to influence the location\nand expansion of business firms or on\nefforts to influence the location of house-\nholds through improvements in residential\nareas and services.\n\nIt remains true, however, that the specific\nrequirements for (let alone the long-run de-\nsirability of) inducing migration or changes\nin natural population increase (births over\ndeaths of the nonmigrant population) in\ncities which are losing population and jobs\nhave not been determined. In illustrating the\nfeedback effects of migration on fertility\ndue to changes in the age distribution, for\nexample, Alonso starts the discussion by\nassuming a migration response to real wage\ndifferences between places and argues that\nan increasing real wage difference is neces-\nsary to induce a constant net flow of\nmigrants over time. This conclusion follows\nfrom the assumed migration response to\narea-wide real-wage differences.\n",

                    "Per capita income is an important notion\nin economics. It is used as an explanatory\nvariable with great frequency in theoretical\nand empirical analyses, and its size distribu-\ntion is one of the long-standing topics of\neconomic research. Moreover, it is a con-\ncept in which public concern is as deep and\nsustained as is professional interest. How-\never, information about income is often\nobtained for household units instead of\nper capita units, or for only a subset of\npersons (for example, wage earners). This\ncreates difficult problems with the mea-\nsurement and, indeed, the concept of per\ncapita income. The problems include: 1)\nwithin any household the apportionment of\nhousehold income to members is not in gen-\neral known; 2) comparison of household\nincome per capita among households of dif-\nferent structures requires judgment about\nthe relationship between real income and\nfamily size. Remarkably little study has\nbeen done on the first of these two issues.!\nThis paper is another contribution to the\nvast literature which addresses the second\nissue.\n\nThis latter issue is usually characterized\nas one of determining the income equiva-\nlence among households of various sizes.\nThese equivalence scales can either adjust\n",

One of\ntwo approaches to the estimation of equiv-\nalents has generally been used: 1) a revealed\npreference approach in which household\nsize/structure variables are included in\nempirical demand studies and the esti-\nmated coefficients on these variables are\nused to infer equivalence; 2) a judgment\nof \"experts\" is relied upon to yield equiva-\nlence on the basis of some quasi-objective\nstandard (such as daily nutritional needs)\nand a cost estimate of these items (food)\nfor each household type is then expanded\nby some factor to approximate an equiv-\nalent income level. Most research favors the\nfirst approach (see S. J. Prais and\nHendrik Houthakker; A. P. Barten; John\nMuellbauer) while the official U.S. poverty\nlevel equivalents are based on the\nOrshansky equivalence measures derived\nfrom a presumed nutritionally adequate\neconomy food plan (see B. S. Mahoney).\nOur work also uses the first of these two\napproaches; it differs from many of the\nother studies not in basic concept but in its\nempirical strategy. While most studies build\nfamily composition effects into a relatively\nformal structural model of demand and im-\npose considerable restriction in order to ob-\ntain an estimable system, we use a reduced-\nform approach which requires much less of\nthe data.\n\nProfessional and popular interest in per\ncapita income is predicated on the assump-\ntion that income is an observable, mono-\n",

The\nviews expressed here are solely my own and do not\nnecessarily represent the views of the Council of\nEconomic Advisors or the Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City.\n\n' A stimulative impact on the economy is implied when\ninvestors aggregate securities according to time-to-\nmaturity-\u2014for example, long-term Treasury securities\nwith equity. This aggregation scheme is adopted by John\nMaynard Keynes (1930, 1936) and Axel Leijonhufvud.\nThe possibility of a restrictive impact is, for example,\nimplied by Earl Rolph. In Rolph's analysis, there is an\noptimal maturity composition of the federal debt which\nfurther implies that the substitution of short- for long-\nterm Treasury securities could in some instances result in\na restrictive impact. Debt management has no impact\nwhen short- and long-term Treasury securities are\nassumed to be perfect substitutes. For an analysis of this\ncase, see James Tobin (1961, 1963). The inability of debt\nmanagement to affect the Treasury security yield\ncurve\u2014 which is consistent with the perfect substitutes\nhypothesis\u2014has been supported by empirical research\nusing reduced-form interest rate equations. A partial list\nof this empirical research includes Arthur Okun; Robert\nScott; Franco Modigliani and Richard Sutch (1966,\n1967); G. O. Bierwag and M. A.

In\nthis case, unlike that of steel, price is determined by the\nmost efficient producing region within the EEC rather\nthan the rest of the world. Also similar to the reference\nprice is the threshold price on grains established to\ncontrol their imports into the EEC. There is a minimum\n(maximum) price at which the EEC countries buy (sell\nfrom the stocks) grains to maintain the floor (ceiling) of\nthe grain support price. The threshold price is determined\nby deducting the cost of shipping grain overland to the\npopulation centers from the minimum price, that is, the\nthreshold price is the minimum import price that the\nEEC will tolerate. Accordingly a variable levy, amount-\ning to the difference between the c.i.f. import price and\nthe threshold price, will be levied and will vary with any\nchange in the difference between these two prices.\n"

This was followed, with\nsubstantively the same methodology, by Stern (1962),\nBela Balassa, MacDougall et al., Mordechai Kreinin, and\nmore recently with a somewhat different methodology,\nby Herbert Glejser. Kreinin's study is particularly\nsuggestive, however, in that the remarkably stable empir-\nical relationships which were found in the earlier studies\nwith American and British data do not extend to several\nother countries which he considered. The first systematic\nattempt to test the H-O theory was due to Wassily\nLeontief, whose well-known finding on the U.S. capital\nposition caused a major controversy. (See Robert Bald-\nwin, for example, for a perspective review of the Leontief\nParadox.) Leontief's work was followed, with widely\nmixed results, by Masahiro Tatemoto and Shinichi Ichi-\nmura, Donald Wahl, Ranganath Bharadwaj, Karl\nRoskamp, Michael Hodd, and Roskamp and Gordon\nMcMeekin, among others, all of whom applied the\ninput-output technique for observations from additional\ncountries. More recently, however, a multivariate\napproach to testing the H-O theory, with diverse empiri-\ncal specifications, has been undertaken. See, for example,\nGary C. Hufbauer, William Branson and Helen Junz,\nBaldwin, Edward Leamer, Jon Harkness and John Kyle,\nStern (1976), Branson and Nikolaos Monoyios, and\nHarkness.\n"

            "found": "During the past few years there has been\nconsiderable interest, among both economists\nand politicians, in the question of how to\nlower the unemployment rate consistent with\nnonaccelerating inflation by the use of struc-\ntural policies. Although it is not possible to\nestimate the value of this rate (which will\nhereafter be referred to as U,) with any\nprecision, its consensus estimate in 1978\nterms is about 6 percent, plus or minus\none-half of 1 percent. While recognition of\nthis constraint on aggregate macro-economic\npolicy has been taking hold, Congress has\nbeen debating a bill to establish a 4 percent\noverall unemployment rate as the national\ngoal for 1983. Implicit in this bill (the so-\ncalled Humphrey-Hawkins proposal) is the\nnecessity of expanding labor market pro-\ngrams in order to achieve its principal objec-\ntive. The major component of such programs\nin the United States has been the direct\nprovision of job opportunities to specific\ngroups in the labor force.' These generally\ntake the form of public service employment\n(PSE), but there has also been some use of\nemployment tax credits in the private\nsector.\n\nThere are several possible objectives of\nemployment policy, ranging from fiscal relief\n\n*University of Michigan, and Council on Wage and\nPrice Stability, respectively. An initial draft of this paper\nwas written while we were on the staff of the Council of\nEconomic Advisers, and subsequent work on it was\nsupported by Department of Labor Contract No. J-\n9-M-6-0009. The paper, alas, does not necessarily repre-\nsent the official positions of any of these agencies. A\nlonger version is available on request.\n\n\"The other four components of labor market policy\nincluded skill training, job search assistance, strengthen-\ning of work incentives, and the elimination of restrictive\npractices. Expenditures on employment programs, how-\never, have dwarfed those on the other four.\n"

The possibility of perverse welfare effects resulting\nfrom vertical integration of firms subject to variable\ninput proportions was considered initially by John\nVernon and Daniel Graham, examined further by\nRichard Schmalensee, George Hay, Frederick Warren-\nBoulton, recently repeated by Martin Perry, and by\nJohn Haring and David Kaserman. However, one can\nhardly neglect the quantitative importance of the vast\nset of industries and integrations for which fixed pro-\nportions apply. For example, in the petroleum in-\ndustry, the quantity of crude remains invariant from\nthe recovery process to the shipping of crude from\nwells to refineries. This invariance also applies to the\nshipment of the refined products to dealers and their\nfinal distribution to consumers. In refining, a pre-\nselected method of converting the crude into a certain\noutput of refined products is used. Simple substitution\nof another mineral for some of the crude cannot be\neffected without shutting down the refinery and chang-\ning the entire production process.\n"

The *catastrophists\" believe\nthat the earth's resources will soon be exhausted and\nthat this will lead to the collapse of society. The \"'cor-\nnucopians\" argue that most of the essential raw mate-\nrials are in infinite supply: that as society exhausts one\nraw material, it will turn to lower-grade, inexhaustible\nsubstitutes. Eventually, society will subsist on renew-\nable resources and on elements, such as iron and\naluminum, that are practically inexhaustible. Accord-\ning to this view, society will settle into a steady state of\nsubstitution and recycling. This asymptotic society\nwe call the Age of Substitutability. In this article we\nexamine these questions; although much of what we\nsay must be regarded as tentative and speculative, we\nexpound these views in the hope that they will\nstimulate further study.\n\nWe are cornucopian, even in this era of dwindling\nresources and in spite of dire predictions (/, 2).

But very long range forecasting, in which fluc-\ntuations in human experience are blips on an underly-\ning statistical state, could be done in the same sense\nthat statistical mechanics predict the future of a big\nensemble.

Man's continual scramble for finite re-\nsources condemns him to eternal social instability,\nviolence, and brutishness.\n\nDarwin realized, as do all neo-Malthusians, that\nthere was no panacea; no solution could work unless\npopulation leveled off. But even this was not enough: as\nresources dwindled, the pressures on what remained\nwould grow. Darwin also recognized, as did H.

The authors h\u00e1ve gone through the entire periodic system\nexamining all the elements plus some important compounds, to deter-\nmine the flow of their extraction in 1968, and estimate for each the total\nresources potentially available according to a rather generous defini-\ntion of potential sources\u2014the atmosphere, the ocean and a mile-thick\ncrust of the earth. The ratio of total resources to demand in that year is\nexpressed for each element in years to go until exhaustion at the con-\nstant 1968 rate of extraction\u2014a simple signal of relative abundance or\nscarcity.\n\nThrough the entire list and in the cases where there is a clear indica-\ntion of a finite life time, the authors trace the important uses and pos-\nsible substitutes in thes\u00e9 uses. On the basis of their scrutiny of these\ngeological and technological data, Goeller and Weinberg pronounce\nthe principle of infinite substitutability: With the exception of phospho-\nrus and some trace elements for agriculture, mainly cobalt, copper and\nzinc, and finally the CH, (coal, oil and gas), society can exist on near-\ninexhaustible resources for an indefinite period.\n\nThis line of thought suggests that when you look very far into the fu-\nture quite a different type of information becomes important. Tradition-\nal econometrics doesn't help us much here. There is a type of thinking\nhere that draws on basic scientific notions and knowledge, and that\neconomists might well take note of.\n",

The colonies are en-\ndangered by various contingencies. The different castes in the colony\nhave different comparative advantages in dealing with the different con-\ntingencies. Each insect in the colony imposes a cost of maintenance\nwhich may be measured roughly by its weight, and the weights differ\namong castes. Survival of a given number of virgin queens in the face of\nthe different contingencies can be achieved by varying combinations of\nthe different castes. Presumably the colony structure most fit to survive\nis that in which the numbers in the different castes minimize the total:\nweight of the colony for given survival of virgin queens. This gives rise to\na linear programming problem whose solution has biologically interest-\ning implications for the degree of specialization of the different castes\nand for their proportions.\n\nResource scarcity is a common characteristic of the biological world,\nof which humans are part. It is therefore not surprising that the same\nmodes of analysis find applications in both biology and economics.\nAfter all, Charles Darwin has reported that the idea of natural selection\ncame to him from a reading of Malthus.

Dale\nOsborne has recently proposed a rule for\ncartel members which, if followed, will pose\na credible threat of lost profits to potential\ncheating members and thereby reduce the\ninherent instability of the cartel. The rule\nis simple: once cheating in the form of in-\ncreased output is detected, each. member\nshould increase output in the same propor-\ntion as the cheater so as to maintain the\nsame share of the output as under joint\nprofit maximization. This market share\nmaintenance rule forces the cheater to share\nin the decline of profits and hence induces it\nto help the loyal members revitalize the\ncartel or, perhaps, not cheat in the first\nplace.

However there\nsurely cannot be any question that the\nhigher unemployment in those years was\ndue to a lack of effective demand\u2014 not to\nstructural factors.\n\nThe second phase began with the food\nand fuel price explosions of 1973-74.\nDespite attempts to apply incomes policies\nin various countries, it was impossible to\nhold down wage increases in the face of a\n400 percent increase in the price of im-\nported oil and a 25 percent jump in food\nprices. All of the countries except for\nSweden quickly enacted restrictive macro\npolicies both to hold down inflation and to\nstave off balance-of-payments crises. The\ncrucial role of the restrictive policies\nfollowed by West Germany surely should\nalso be mentioned. In this period, labor\ninterests fought erosion of real wages by\nseeking catch ups to the spiralling food and\nfuel prices. Simultaneously. unemployment\nrose as a result of restrictive policies. While\nthis shows up statistically as a worsening of\nthe Phillips relation. it was due to the\ncontemporaneous effects of separate\ninfluences on wages and unemployment\nrather than an indication that the labor\nmarket had become tighter for some given\nunemployment rate.\n\nHaving objected to Haveman's concep-\ntualization of the problem, I am afraid I\nshall also have to take issue with his expla-\nnation. He rejects the inadequate demand\nexplanation on the basis of a rough calcula-\ntion of labor demand and supply growth for\nthe period since 1960. Since it is an annual\naverage calculation, the experience of the\nmost recent years is swamped by the\nbuoyant performance of the 1960's, when\nlabor was very scarce in Europe and when\nthe United States was involved in a major\nAsian military operation. Extrapolating\nfrom a trend dominated by the 1960's is\nhardly a way to characterize labor market\ndemand conditions in the period since 1971,\nnor an appropriate framework for analyzing\nthe recent rise in unemployment.\n\nHaveman then moves to structural expla-\n",

Robert Haveman attributes this\nphenomenon to a change in the relationship\nbetween measured unemployment and\nexcess labor supply. While this factor may\nexplain some of the increase, surely a more\nimportant explanation is the simultaneous\noccurrence of strong inflationary shocks\nfrom higher food and fuel prices and at-\ntempts by workers to protect their real\nwages by seeking cost-of-living adjust-\nments, combined with restrictive macro\npolicies to ward off balance-of-payments\ncrises and to defuse political opposition to\ninflation. It is true that higher unemploy-\nment has coincided with higher inflation.\nHowever, this says nothing about the\ntradeoff, that is, what would happen to the\ninflation rate if aggregate demand policies\npushed unemployment lower; nor does it\nmean that the labor market has become\ntighter for a given unemployment rate.\n\nBefore 1971, unemployment rates in\nEurope were typically in the I to 2 percent\nrange, while in the United States they\nranged from 4 to 6 percent. Although some\nof this difference resulted from a dis-\ncrepancy between survey methods and\ndefinitions, most of it was related to other\nfactors. For instance. there is less labor\nmobility in Europe than in the United\nStates. This means less frequent job change\nand also a lower incidence of unemploy-\nment. Also, in the pre-1971 period, the Eu-\nropeans were operating closer to potential\nthan was the United States.\n\nAfter 1971. unemployment rates rose\nmarkedly in the United States and Europe.\nBut two distinct phases must be identified.\nThe first is 1971\u201473 when European rates\nrose to around 2.5 percent and the U.S. rate\nto around 5.5. This unemployment resulted\nfrom a sharp drop in aggregate demand. In\nthe United States the recession was due to\nrestrictive macro policies designed to shake\nout the inflationary legacy of Vietnam, and\nthe downturn in the United States was\nclearly the principal impetus for the\n",

He\nalso gives us a useful theoretical framework\nby presenting five major reasons for the\nneed for psychology in economics. He im-\nplies that even more is needed than apply-\ning psychological principles to economics.\nEmpirical research on the behavior of\nconsumers and business firms is required\nthat is based on economic as well as\npsychological hypotheses. This is what the\nnew discipline of behavioral or\npsychological economics does, of which\nMorgan is a successful practitioner.\n\nI shall supplement Morgan's discussion\nby saying a few words 1) about the ways\neconomic theorists exclude psychology\nfrom economic analysis, and 2) about the\nrole of psychology in a major current issue\nof economic theory and economic policy,\nthe relation of inflation to unemployment.\n\nRecent writings on \"rational expecta-\ntions\" indicate how some theorists make\nthe observation and measurement of expec-\ntations unnecessary by assuming that they\nare formed rationally. Expectations are\nmade an endogenous variable that may be\ndeduced from data already included in the\nsystem (such as past trends of the variable\nand the consideration of past forecasting er-\nrors). This procedure is followed even\nthough behavioral economists have\nmeasured people's expectations of in-\ncomes, prices, and some other variables for\nthe past thirty years and have established\nthat expectations are extrapolative only\nunder certain specific circumstances, while\nunder other circumstances they differ\ngreatly from past trends.\n\nMilton Friedman in his recent Nobel lec-\nture refers to such psychological processes\nas perceptions, expectations, and surprises\nin order to account for the relation of\ninflation to unemployment. He mentions\nthe notion of \"rational expectations\" with\napproval and states a priori what the expec-\ntations were at certain times. For instance,\nFriedman writes that \"In the immediate\n",

                    "post-World War II period, prior experience\nwas widely expected to recur . . . The ex-\npectation in both countries [U.S. and U.K.]\nwas  deflation\" | (Journal of Political\nEconomy, 1977, p. 465). But we know from\nextensive surveys conducted under my di-\nrection, first in Washington and then at the\nSurvey Research Center of The University\nof Michigan, and published in the Federal\nReserve Bulletin, that in. 1945-46 most\nAmericans were optimistic and expected\ngood times to come with small price\nincreases. In contrast to a few experts they\ndid not expect the resumption of the\ndeflation of the 1930's. Consumers and\nbusinessmen behaved in line with their\nopinions and expectations, and there was\nno postwar recession.\n\nFriedman's new \"tentative hypothesis,\"\naccording to which \"'the rate of unemploy-\nment will be largely independent of the\naverage rate of inflation\" (ibid, p. 464) fails\nto specify the forces that make for a posi-\ntive and those that make for a negative rela-\ntion between unemployment and inflation.\nSome psychological forces operated in the\nfirst direction. I shall be brief, supplement-\ning what I have written on the psychology\nof inflation in my book, Psychological Eco-\nnomics, and the book by Strumpel and\nmyself, A New Economic Era (New York\n1975; 1978). One of the helpful psy-\nchological principles is that about the\ngeneralization of effect: At any given time\nonly good or only bad news is salient, and\ngood (bad) news is thought to have only\ngood (bad) effects. Most people believe that\ninflation, which is considered a bad thing,\ncannot have good consequences such as\nimproving business conditions or decreas-\ning unemployment. A second useful\npsychological principle says that un-\ncertainty tends to retard, sometimes even\nto paralyze, action. Inflation, associated\nwith heightened uncertainty, usually in-\nhibits spending and investing, and stimu-\nlates saving. While stocking up and hoard-\ning may be stimulated by the expectation of\nlarge price increases, disorientation and\nstress prevail, inhibiting optimism and mak-\n",

Thus\nvariables could be constructed for the pro-\nportion of adult women in the labor force in\nthe reference week in each $MSA that were\nemployed last year and five years ago.\n\nCynthia Lloyd and Beth Niemi are\nconcerned with \"whether the elasticity of\nlabor supply with respect to employment\nconditions ... has changed over time.\"\nThey estimate the elasticity of age-sex\nspecific civilian labor force participation\nrates (LFPR) with respect to the overall\nunemployment rate (UN), real average\nhourly earnings (REAL), and the relative\nimportance of female-intensive industries\nin the economy (EMPWo). They use quar-\nterly data for two subperiods, 1956\u201465 and\n1966\u201476.\n\nThey conclude that there has been a nar-\nrowing of sex differences in procyclical\nlabor force participation. That is, women's\nprocyclical sensitivity to the probability of\nemployment and wages has not changed,\nwhile for men, particularly young men, it\nhas increased. However they offer no\ntheoretical explanation for their findings.\n\nThe labor force status questions in the\nCPS were revised in 1967 in a way that may\nhave significantly altered sex differences in\nunemployment, and hence in the labor\nforce participation rate. It is not clear\nwhether the Lloyd-Niemi findings are a\nresult of this change in the survey instru-\nment. Their hypothesis could have been\ntested by including interaction terms for a\ncontinuous time variable with both UN and\nREAL in each subperiod or, in an equation\ncomputed for the entire period, the interac-\ntions of a continuous time variable and a\npost-1967 dummy variable with UN and\nREAL.\n\nIt is now well established that the overall\nunemployment rate has undergone a sec-\nular drift and is an inferior cyclical index.\nIt also introduces a simultaneous equation\nbias, which is particularly severe for adult\nwomen.

Christopher Lingle\nand Ethel Jones are concerned with the\nrecent increase in the ratio of adult female\nto adult male unemployment rates. Using\ndata on ninety-nine $MSAs from the 1960\nand 1970 Censuses of Population. and a set\nof quite reasonable explanatory variables.\nthey estimate equations to explain the un-\nemployment rate of adult women.\n\nThey find no structural change from 1960\nto 1970 in the cross-section female unem-\nployment rate equations, once they allow\nfor the non-linear effect of male unemploy-\nment rates. Thus some of the rise in the\nratio of female to male unemployment rates\nis due to lower unemployment rates for\nboth sexes in 1970, and the smaller cyclical\nsensitivity of the female rate. Unfortu-\nnately, they estimate the effect of the\nchange from 1960 to 1970 of only one\nexplanatory variable, the male unemploy-\nment rate, and changes in other variables\nmay have been important.\n\nLingle and Jones also find that the greater\nthe relative importance of the \"male inten-\nsive\" industries the higher the female\nunemployment rate. They do not note,\nhowever, that male intensive industries\nhave declined in relative importance as a\nsource of male employment in recent\ndecades. Thus I would suspect that the\nunemployment rate of men across $MSAs\nmay be related positively to the relative im-\nportance of male intensive industries.\nMoreover there is an important, but often\nmisunderstood, difference between the\nconcepts of the male intensiveness of an\narea's industrial structure and the extent of\nsex segregation of employment in the area.\n\nPerhaps the most important secular fac-\ntor in female unemployment is the rise in\nthe relative importance of married women\nin the female labor force. Is the effect of\nmarital status attributable to the greater\nmovement of married women in and out of\nthe labor force? This hypothesis could have\nbeen pursued by adding labor force attach-\nment variables.

John Meyer and Robert Leone\ncall attention to the significant variations\nwithin the snowbelt, and Lee Brown and\nAllan Kneese remind us that there is still\nabject poverty and economic anemia in sec-\ntions of the southwest.\n\nThe very first sentence in the Southwest\npaper troubled me personally because it\nstates flatly that the four states have no\n\"shared institutional apparatus for solving\nthose problems.\"' I have spent the last four\nmonths evaluating regional commissions,\none of which is the Four Corners Regional\nCommission embracing these four states\nand Nevada. I am shocked by the apparent\nand assumed impotence of the Commission\nin this context.\n\nI have two problems with the Alaska\nmodel. I don't see why the later decline in\npublic sector expenditures would be\nviewed as a problem if in the earlier period\na substantial amount were devoted to pub-\nlic capital expenditures which would gen-\nerate a stream of services into the future.\nThus, the \"real\" flow of public services\ncould be held constant, even if money out-\nlays were diminished. Isn't this simply\nanother form of savings which the authors\nwant to encourage in the period of high\nrevenues?\n\nMy second complaint is an old one (with\nme) and it may not survive a careful study\nof the model.

KOoOPMANS, Yale\nUniversity: The study presented by\nEdward Hudson and Dale Jorgenson rests\non an impressive body of work in the\neconometric representation of production\npossibilities developed over the last\ntwenty years or so. Two different methods\nare applied: one to the energy sector; the\nother to the industries that make up the rest\nof the economy. While their description of\nthe latter method uses the terminology of\nthe classical input-output approach\ndeveloped by Wassily Leontief, the method\nis essentially different in that it both recog-\nnizes and estimates the effects of the rela-\ntive prices of the various inputs on the input\nmix used in each industry. This is achieved\nby econometric estimation of the price\npossibility frontier of each nonenergy in-\ndustry from past data. (This is a relation-\nship between prices that, under the\nassumption of profit maximization in com-\npetitive markets, is dual to, is implied in,\nand in turn implies the production func-\ntion.)\n\nThe energy sector is represented by a\nprocess model developed by Hoffman,\nMarcuse, and their colleagues at\nBrookhaven Laboratory, based on\nengineering estimates of ratios of inputs to\noutputs for a substantial number of energy\nextraction, transportation, conversion, and\nutilization processes. The essential point\nhere is that the number of processes in the\nmodel exceeds the number of different end\nuses, thus enabling the model to simulate a\ncost minimizing or  benefit-minus-cost\nmaximizing response to demand shifts or\ninput price changes.\n\nThe principal advantage of the process\nmodel over the **econometric\"\" model used\nfor the nonenergy industries is that it can\nabsorb not only engineering information\nbased on past performance, but also an-\nticipated characteristics of processes not\nyet in operation, at all, or on a commercial\nscale. Moreover, the process model allows\none to simulate the effects of quantitative\nor other constraints placed on the levels of\noperation of specific processes for reasons\nof environmental protection.\n",

                    "Rupv OswarLD, AFL-CIO: The basic\ntheme that runs through all three papers is\nthat job satisfaction is a necessary\nconsideration for economic analysis. But\nwhat is job satisfaction?\n\nIs it some set of responses to satisfaction\nquestions, or is it \"quit rates\" (Richard\nFreeman); is it employee participation in\ndecision making, or \"social learning\"\n(Karl-Olof Fax\u00e9n); or is it \"fame, power,\nfriends, physical discomfort, risk of life,\netc.\" that Lester Thurow calls psychic in-\ncome?\n\nMaybe it is all of these things, plus much\nmore\u2014more than can easily be measured\nwith existing tools. In general, job satisfac-\ntion is approached by the behavioral\nscientist as either a psychological study of\nworkers classified into such standard vari-\nables as age, sex, race, income, and related\nfactors, or as an organizational behavior\ntool to be used to increase productivity. I\nmaintain that neither of these approaches\nidentify a worker's satisfaction on the job.\nThey disregard the basic needs of workers\nfor income and security\u2014and the role of\nunions in our society in trying to assure\nthese basic needs. Indeed 1 find it shocking\nthat these representatives of the economic\nprofession can describe various aspects of\njob satisfaction without taking account of\nthe role of unions in our economic system.\n\nPay itself is directly related to job satis-\nfaction. Only Fax\u00e9n emphasized the\n\"overwhelming importance of pay,\" while\nThurow recognizes the need for \"positive\nwages.\" These analyses assume that the\n\"pay\" for the job meets some level of\nsufficiency, and disregard pay above that\nlevel as a measure of satisfaction. Yet for\nmany workers their pay has not yet attained\na level of sufficiency that is a prerequisite\nfor consideration of that luxury called ''job\nsatisfaction.\" Secondly, only Freeman\nmentions the importance of job security as\na criteria of job satisfaction. Without job se-\ncurity, or the ready prospect of alternative\njob opportunities, job satisfaction is again a\nluxury.\n",

                    "Unions, representing the concerns of\ntheir members, place primary emphasis on\nthese two basic elements of job satisfac-\ntion\u2014adequate wages and job security.\nFirst in regard to wages, through the\ncollective bargaining process, wages are no\nlonger solely determined by the employer.\nbut the result of a codetermination of the\nappropriate wage. This is an important ele-\nment that is neglected in these papers'\nconcentration on aspects of satisfaction not\nrelated to wages or the importance of\nworkers having an equal voice with em-\nployers in establishing wages. Further\nstudies of job satisfaction should analyze\nboth the level of wages and the role of the\nworker in determining that level.\n\nSecond, job security has a direct relation-\nship to quit rates and turnover as Freeman\npoints out. In this paper he only alludes to\nthe importance of the various types of job\nsecurity that are provided under most union\ncontracts. The grievance procedure\nprovides an outlet for resolving problems,\nthe discharge and discipline clauses assure\ncertain intrinsic elements of justice and fair\nplay, the seniority clauses assure protec-\ntion against favoritism, the 540 clauses and\nattrition clauses protect incomes. and many\nof the other parts of contracts provide job\nsecurity. These written contract clauses are\nclearly related to job satisfaction.\n\nLet me hasten to add that unions\nfrequently seek the broad type of job satis-\nfaction discussed in these papers. Many\nstrikes .are generated by job dissatisfac-\ntions. One example that comes to mind is\nthe legend written on the picket sign of one\nof the garbage collectors in that famous\nMemphis strike of 1968. That striker wrote\nthe simple legend \"I am a Man.\" And in\nmany of the issues involving work that is\nstill an issue today. Fax\u00e9n talks about\n\"worker participation\"' but he ignores the\nmeaning of \"unionism'' and the role of the\nunion as an organization of workers in\n\"participation.\" While Fax\u00e9n adds to the\ndocumentation of the substantial contribu-\ntion made by \"job satisfaction\" to\n",

                    "One finding has especially great implica-\ntions for public policy. Spells of unemploy-\nment in one year are associated with an\nincrease in the duration of unemployment\nof blacks in the following year by two\nweeks per spell, and for whites, by one day\nper spell, a tenth as much as for blacks.\nSimilarly, if spells in one decade are related\nto spells and added duration of unemploy-\nment in future decades, as seems plausible,\nthe current sustained high level of unem-\nployment, particularly for blacks, would\nhave great continuing consequences for\ndecades to come. Moreover, the social\nbenefits from lowering unemployment now\nwould be greater than current calculations\ncomprehend. Another implication for\npublic policy is that, ceteris paribus, any\ngiven reduction in unemployment will\nreduce transfer payments associated with\nunemployment by a greater extent, the\nlarger the proportion of the added jobs oc-\ncupied by blacks. One must however be\nmindful that this is a study of only one city.\nThe results may not be completely\ngeneralizable.\n\nSeveral other. largely technical, com-\nments appear warranted. The unexplained\nvariance in the regression model for the du-\nration of unemployment may dominate the\nexplained variance. The R? was less than 10\npercent for both black and white males.\nAlso, there is probably colinearity among\nsome of the variables. The severe space\nlimitations undoubtedly precluded Betsey's\ndiscussion of such fine points.\n\nOne factor which was not discussed\ncould conceivably bias greatly.the analysis\nby understating the already large racial dis-\nparities. The discouraged worker effect\nmay conceal some periods of unemploy-\nment to the extent that the discouraged\nworker is correct in his expectation of a\ndearth of jobs for himself.\n\nThe interactions over time between\nspells of unemployment and duration of\nunemployment suggest that a single equa-\ntion approach may not capture adequately\nkey relationships.

                    "KARL D. GnEGORY, Oakland University:\nIn an excellent analysis of racial differences\nas one approach to viewing unemployment,\nCharles Betsey focuses upon males, aged\n16-64, in New York's inner city. He em-\nploys data for 1969-70, a period of rela-\ntively low unemployment. Following tradi-\ntion, he factors the unemployment rate\ninto three components, including the\nnumber of spells of unemployment and the\naverage duration of each spell. Through\nmultiple regression analysis of each of\nthese two components\u2014number of spells\nand duration\u2014for males, individually by\nrace, Betsey finds major differences among\nblack and white males in their unemploy-\nment experiences. His models differ in part\nfrom those of earlier studies and cast new\nlight on racial disparities.\n\nAmong the conclusions I found most\ninteresting are the following: for black\nmales, several characteristics are\nassociated positively with a longer duration\nof unemployment. Among these charac-\nteristics are being a family head, separated,\nage 16-19, or having several spells of un-\nemployment in the previous year.\n\nThe crisis in black teenage unemploy-\nment finds confirmation in this study. Black\nteenage males suffer greater duration of\nunemployment than any other group. In\ncontrast, white teenage males experience\nthe shortest duration of any white\nsubgroup.\n\nFor all age groups, the duration of unem-\nployment is higher for blacks than for\nwhites. Presumably, this added burden for\nblacks would have been longer were the\ndata corrected to adjust for periods of job-\nlessness caused by worker discouragement.\n\nIn contrast with conclusions from pre-\nvious studies by Robert Hall, and by Nancy\nBarrett and Richard Morgenstern, Betsey\nfinds striking differences among black and\nwhite males in both duration and spells of\nunemployment. He also found union mem-\nbership is strongly and positively asso-\nciated with spells of unemployment for\nboth black and white males.\n",

He shows that the\nBayesian decision theory axioms. if applied\nto the theory of social decision making.\nimply that society must use a simple utili-\ntarian criterion to rank possible actions.\nThe Bayesian axioms are widely accepted\nas reasonable for individual decision\ntheory. and yet many economists are\nunwilling to limit themselves to utilitarian\ntheories of social choice. To resolve this di-\nlemma we must find at least one of the\nBayesian axioms which can be weakened in\nthe context of social decisions. I shall focus\nmy discussion on the sure-thing axiom. I\nwill try to show that a weaker version of it\nmay be more relevant to social decision\ntheory. This will allow maximin or equity-\nconstrained social decision criteria. as well\nas the utilitarian criteria.\n\nConsider the following example. There\nare two individuals A and B. two equally\nlikely states of nature 0, and 0.. and there\nare two actions available in each state. If 0,\noccurs. action o, gives utility allocation\n(U4,.U,) \u2014 (10.0. and action 8, gives\n(U ,. Ug) \u2014 (4.4). If. 0, occurs, action. a\u00bb\ngives utilities (U ,. U ;) \u2014 (0.10). and ac-\ntion B\u00bbgives (U ,. U ,) \u2014 (4.4).\n\nSuppose we believe that equity is a fun-\ndamental moral concern. so that the best\naction should be the one which maximizes\nthe individuals\" utilities subject to the\nconstraint that their utilities should be\nequal. Assuming free disposal of utility.\nthis criterion is equivalent to maximizing\nthe minimum utility. or maximin. In this\nexample, suppose we judge actions after\nlearning the true state. If 0, occurs. then B,\nwill be the best action for the maximin cri-\nterion., and if 09, occurs. then 8. will be best.\n\nBut if we judge action prior to learning\nthe state. then the plan [o. o] is better\nthan the plan [,. s]. since the expected\nutility allocation (U ,. U ,) \u2014 (5.5) given by\n[o,. \u00ab.] is better than the expected alloca-\ntion (4.4) given by [ B,. B.]. So the maximin\ncriterion does not satisfy the sure-thing\n",

If what we would\ngain are simply generalizations equally ap-\nplicable to biology and economics, I see lit-\ntle advantage in it. Our theories are, for\nmost purposes, already too general. While\nwe would doubtless learn something from a\ntheory which is equally instructive in\nexplaining the division of labor in the oil in-\ndustry, among the teeth in the human\nmouth, and in a community of ants, our\npressing need is to explain the division of\nlabor in the oil industry. It is not general\ntheories which we lack, but theories which\nexplain the working of our actual economic\nsystem. Ghiselin rightly points out that our\nanalysis of the division of labor is primitive.\nThe reason is not a lack of knowledge of\nbiology but of economics. We likewise\nhave a primitive analytical system to handle\nthe firm, the market, the process of\ncontracting and property rights\u2014all vital\nelements in the working of our economic\nsystem.\n\nIn seeking to improve our treatment of\nsuch subjects, biological analogies can be\nvery misleading. The firm, the market, the\nlegal system are all social institutions and\nare the result of purposeful human activity.\nGhiselin explains that natural selection has\nan IQ of zero. The IQ of businessmen and\npoliticians may not be high, but it is not\nzero. Natural selection produces its results\nby trial and error over long periods of time.\nEconomic systems, such as the structure of\n",

But the place where its im-\nmediate influence will probably be felt is\nnot in the analysis of competition, but in\nutility theory. Modern utility theory, which\nanalyzes the effect of human preferences\non economic behavior, largely regards man\nas a rational utility maximizer. It tells us lit-\ntle about the purposes which impel people\nto action. Recently, attempts have been\nmade to relate preferences to certain basic\nneeds. But it seems unlikely that we can\nmake much progress without a comprehen-\nsive view of man's nature on the basis of\nwhich such a theory can be developed. It is\nsuch a view which is found in sociobiology.\n\nHuman nature is here seen as the product\nof evolution over a long period and is\ngenetically determined. The structure of\nhuman nature includes learning rules, and\nwhat is particularly important in eco-\nnomics, the way in which we translate\nexperience into expectations. Human na-\nture is what it is because it contributed to\nhuman survival in the conditions in which\nhuman beings developed, not, as is some-\ntimes supposed, because it contributed to\nhuman happiness, although what may be\ntermed altruistic behavior may have sur-\nvival value. This approach downplays the\nrational element in human behavior. As\nGhiselin has said, \"If fools are more prolific\nthan wise men, then to that degree folly will\nbe favored by selection\" (see his 7e\nEconomy of Nature and the Evolution of\nSex, p. 263). This approach is similar to that\nof Adam Smith. Jacob Viner noted in his\narticle in /776\u2014-1926 Lectures to. Com-\nmemorate Publication of \"The Wealth of\nNations,\" the lowly role which reason\nplays in Adam Smith's thought: \"Under\nnormal circumstances, the instincts make\nno mistake. It is reason which is fallible.\"\nThus, as Adam Smith said in 1759 when dis-\ncussing self-preservation and the propaga-\n",

                    "DANIEL McFADDEN, Yale University:\nWhile the papers in this session deal with\nvarious aspects of the problem of collective\naction, they have a common thread. They\nview the social decision as the outcome of a\ngame with individuals, interest groups,\nlegislators, or bureaucracies as players. In\neach paper, the goals and behavior of the\nplayers have been stylized in order to ob-\ntain clear-cut results. The authors are to be\ncommended for obtaining meaningful\nanalytic formulations of these problems,\nand simplifying the problems in ways that\nyield interesting first results. However. it is\ninteresting to consider how these games\nmight change if richer, and more realistic.\nstrategies were available to the players.\n\nConsider government bureaucracy as a\nplayer. The paper by Morris Fiorina and\nRoger Noll treats bureaucracy as a largely\npassive actor, evolving as a consequence of\nthe election game played by congressional\ncandidates. The only active role of the bu-\nreaucracy in this paper is to apply distribu-\ntional penalties to opposition congressmen.\n\nThe serious and popular literature on bu-\nreaucracy suggests that it will be a more ac-\ntive participant, and that its strategies will\nbe determined by the interplay of bu-\nreaucrats responding to the internal struc-\nture and incentives of the organization.\nMax Weber views the evolution of bureau-\ncratic behavior as the result of individuals\nwithin the organization seeking power and\navoiding personal liability, by replacing dis-\ncretionary judgements with impersonal\nrules. Parkinson's laws suggests the\nmechanisms by which individual incentives\nare translated into the evolution of the bu-\nreaucracy. Kafka paints a bleak picture of\nthe outcome of this process, and incidently\npoints out the usefulness of a good facilita-\ntor.\n\nApplying this view of bureaucracy to the\nworld of Fiorina and Noll, one sees that\nwhile the form of bureaucracy is molded by\nlegislation, the bureaucracy may itself be-\ncome an active lobbyist for legislation af-\nfecting its future. It is particularly suited for\nthis task because of its control of informa-\n",

Bu-\nreaucracies have a strong incentive to nof\nyield distributional power to Congress, but\nrather to retain this power in order to\ndevelop their own constituencies and sup-\nporting lobbys, and to avoid exposure of in-\ndividual bureaucrats to pressure which\ncould create personal liability. In this view,\nexcessive bureaucratization is in large\nmeasure a consequence of the internal in-\ncentives to individuals in the organization.\nThe evolution of complex rules requiring\nfacilitators occurs for Weberian and Parkin-\nsonian reasons. As a player. the bu-\nreaucracy may actively attempt to maintain\nits own constituency, and to minimize the\nrole of facilitators, and may be an active\nand effective lobbyist for its own growth.\n\nIf bureaucracy is an active player, then\nthe games considered by Joel Guttman and\nby William Brock and Stephen Magee also\nchange. In the Guttman world, the bu-\nreaucracy may actively seek an enforce-\nment role for collective action, providing\nboth a mechanism and a lobby for coercive\nsolutions to problems of providing public\ngoods. The preferences of government for\nquotas over tariffs, for environmental regu-\nlations over pollution prices, may be due\nmore to the self-interest of bureaucrats than\nto the difficulty of understanding the\ntheoretical advantages of decentralization.\nThe Brock-Magee model also changes\nwhen bureaucracy becomes an active par-\nticipant. In addition to buying a favorable\npolicy position, campaign contributions\nnow play a second role\u2014the purchase of\nfacilitation services, including favorable\nlanguage in legislation establishing bu-\nreaucracies to enforce collective action. In\nthis world, the lobbying strategies\nconsidered by Brock and Magee will be su-\nperimposed on \"facilitation insurance\"\npurchased from all viable candidates.\n\nI have discussed government bu-\nreaucracy as one of the players in the\ncollective action game whose role is more\nactive, and more important, than the\nmodels treated in these papers suggest. I\nhope the evolution of this research area will\n",

This\ndoes not mean, however, that the poor are\nforever consigned to misery. Income, after\nall. is the product of price and quantity. If\nhigher relative prices are not the answer,\nthen larger quantities must provide the\nsource of economic improvement. What is\nneeded is a transformation and diversifica-\ntion of developing economies with greater\nemphasis on manufacturing.\n\nConsider the following scenario. The\nOECD nations are likely to experience an-\nnual real growth of 4 percent annually dur-\ning the next decade. On past experience.\nthis rate of expansion would support a 7\npercent annual growth in world trade; and a\n7 percent growth in overall trade would\nenable exports of manufactures from\ndeveloping nations to expand at 10 percent\nannually. Such a rate of growth in manufac-\ntured exports could account for 60 percent\nof the increment in developing nations'\nforeign exchange earnings during the next\ndecade.\n\nThis scenario is by no means assured. Di-\nplomatic efforts directed toward the crea-\ntion of new cartels in primary commodities\nmay well distract attention from the pre-\nservation of a world trading system con-\nducive to the long-term interest of develop-\ning nations.\n\nContrary to the claims of the Group of\n71, an expansionist outlook requires not so\nmuch a new order as a vigorous defense of\nthe old. The trading system that emerged\nfrom the ashes of World War II was ideally,\nif inadvertently, suited to the export-led\nprosperity of \"two, three, many Japans.\"'\nThis suitability rests on two key features\nof the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade: the most favored nation (MFN)\n",

As best I can make out,\nDiaz-Alejandro believes that the old\ninternational economic order (O/EO)\nworks to the disadvantage of emerging\nStates. As a consequence, the world trading\nSystem\u2014a system that now facilitates the\nannual exchange of $1 trillion worth of\ngoods\u2014is loaded in favor of economic\nagents in the northern climes. The rules\nhave worked to nurture monopolies con-\ntrolled from Europe and North America\nwhile fostering competition among the\nproducts exported by developing nations.\nThe new international economic order\n(NIEO) would remedy this imbalance\nthrough greater \"market organization\" on\nthe part of developing nations, particularly\nin primary commodities. So there we have\ni: \"OIEO vs. NIEO\u2014old monopolists\nmake way for new!\"\n\nIn answer to these N/EO propositions, I\nwould propose a simple experiment for an\nenergetic student:\n\nA. Take a list of commodity groups\nselected so that there exists a reasonable\ndegree of substitution in production\nbetween the commodities within each\ngroup.\n\nB. Assume that the market for \u00abnv\ncommodity group can be sufficiently \"'or-\nganized\" so that its nominal price can be\npropelled upwards by as much as a four-\nfold increase, with no diminution of\nquantity demanded. (This assumption is un-\nrealistic, but it coincides with N/EO think-\ning. heavily influenced as it is by the suc-\ncess of OPEC.)\n\nWith only this limit on the reaches of mo-\nnopoly power. and no requirement of\ninternal consistency in the resulting price\nstructure, the student should try to find a\nvector of prices that would materially raise\nthe real income of those states which house\nthe poorest half of mankind. (This. of\ncourse, is an easier test to meet than a test\nexpressed in terms of materially raising the\nper capita income of individuals making up\nthe poorest half of mankind.)\n",

I agree with their judg-\nments and findings, so my comments will\nsimply qualify, or elaborate on, one of their\nthemes.\n\nClearly they are correct that agencies do\nnot give much weight to cost-benefit\nanalyses of alternative courses of action,\nand particularly to costs imposed on\nconsumers. The latter reminds one of the\nfailure of \"consumer\"' groups to get more\nupset than they do about tariffs, quotas,\ntaxes, price supports, and inflation. This\ngeneral indifference to impacts on costs\nsuggests that consumer agencies and orga-\nnizations are soon captured by factions\nwho do not represent the average shopper.\n\nAnd, in a broad sense, it may seem (as\nthe authors indicate) that product-safety\nagencies follow some sort of \"safety im-\nperative\"\" \u2014that our political process treats\nsome degree of safety as a \"right\" that\npeople should not be allowed to trade for\nother things, much like the right to vote or\nto due process. Yet there are many excep-\ntions; government doesn't adopt a safety\nimperative in any systematic fashion.\n\nFor example, as the authors mention, the\nregulatory agencies could produce more\nsafety from their budgets if they tried to be\ncost effective, that is, to equalize marginal\nproductivity in various life-saving pro-\ngrams. Similarly, agencies could probably\nallocate effort among enforcement and\nother activities in such a way as to increase\nthe safety produced with their budgets.\n(Indeed, efforts that result in unopenable\npill containers or safety matchcovers may\nactually reduce safety.)\n\nMore significantly, though, neither the\nagencies nor Congress will do much about\ncertain extremely hazardous products,\nsuch as alcohol or tobacco. Officials are\nvery hesitant to limit the output of nuclear\npower. With regard to the breeder, they\nseem willing to accept extra risks of nuclear\nterrorism. Government could save a huge\n",

Why does\ngovernment instead (through the CPSC) try\nto reduce grocery-cart hazards and declare\ntricycles unsafe at any speed?\n\nTo explain these results, I think one must\nturn to public-choice and bureaucratic-\nchoice models. Along this line, consider the\nfollowing factors. A significant number of\nvoters, and thence congressmen, and\nthence administrators, do sometimes get\nconcerned with costs. Ceteris paribus, the\nmore direct the cost of regulations, the\nmore likely cost will influence decisions\nabout those regulations. For instance, the\nvoter who wants a drink or a cigarette is\nacutely aware of inconvenience ahead if\nthose products are threatened. Or, a few\nyears ago, some costs of the automobile in-\nterlock system were painfully obvious\nwhen people couldn't start their cars unless\nevery package and  watermelon was\nsecurely belted into its seat. However if\ngrocery carts are made 20 percent more\nexpensive than before, or if toxic substance\nregulations render many final products\nmore costly, the tax\" on the consumer is\nindirect and hard to perceive.\n\nAlso, if a voter becomes emotionally\naroused\u2014enough for him to overcome his\ninherent free-riderhood \u2014then the cost of a\nregulation to him personally is large. The\nbigger the directly felt cost, the more likely\nit will be taken into account. A moratorium\non nuclear power plants would, as many\npeople see the situation, mean great\ndistress to them personally. They would\nhave to curtail their use of electric hair\nbrushes and other conveniences. Not so\nwith tricycles\u2014many parents could buy\ntheir children Hondas instead.\n\nMoreover, voters will overcome their\nfree-rider positions if they become emo-\ntionally involved over the nature of the\nissue, that is, if it involves what they see as\ntheir \"rights.\" In some instances perhaps\nthey regard the \"right to safety\" as some-\nthing that individuals should not be allowed\nto trade for extra wages or convenience.\nHowever when it comes to automobile\n",

                    "Orro EcksrTEIN, Data Resources, Inc.\nAND PAUL M. WanBURG, Harvard Uni-\nversity: The three papers provide some\ncomfort to the forecaster. They show that\nshort-term macro forecasting has produced\nresults that are substantially better than\nextrapolation methods. It would be a sad\nday if this were not the case, since forecast-\ning is one test of whether the body of\nmacroeconomics, embodying the human\ncapital of so many capable thinkers and re-\nsearchers, has a positive social product.\n\nThe three papers are done with high\ncraftsmanship and objectivity. The auditing\nof forecasts help improve their accuracy by\nmaintaining the \"best effort\" of the\nforecasters, and by producing technological\nprogress. We hope that the work of\nStephen McNees, to whom we all have to\nbe grateful for developing the track records\nfor the 1970's, will be maintained. and we\nare glad to welcome back Victor Zarnowitz\nfor a second major round of work in his\nforecast evaluations.\n\nTo raise just a few specifics: Vincent Su\ncontrasts the results of the ASA-NBER\nforecasters survey with the forecasts\nproduced by the Wharton group. and uses\nthese two sources to compare econometric\nwith noneconometric forecasts. Perhaps in\nthe 1950's and early 1960's there was\nvalidity to this distinction, but it is long\ngone. We doubt that there is any member of\nthe ASA-NBER panel who is not affected\nby the forecasts of the econometric model\ngroups. and conversely, econometric\nmodel forecasting has assimilated the in-\nformal forecaster's grist of surveys. data,\nand policy analyses. It is not surprising that\neconometric models have become central\nto virtually all serious forecasting. It would\nbe strange indeed if computer technology \u2014\nthe central technological change of our\nera\u2014did not have a massive impact on eco-\nnomic forecasting which is essentially an\ninformation processing activity.\n\nWe disagree with Zarnowitz on one\ncritical point. He abjures adjustments of\nforecasts for base revisions, assuming that\nrevised data represent the \"truth\"' and that\n",

                    "all differences between preliminary and\nrevised data are reductions in measurement\nerror. This is a questionable assumption.\nData revisions have at least three principal\nsources: more complete data become\navailable; benchmark data, usually of\ncross-section survey origin, replace time-\nseries interpolators; and government\nagencies redefine concepts. The practical\nforecaster soon discovers that much of the\ngovernment's revision work is counter-\nproductive for forecasting. Completeness\nof coverage of later data principally means\nthe inclusion of smaller economic units\nthrough sampling programs, whereas\npreliminary data mainly reflect the larger\neconomic units with better reporting\nsystems. Benchmark cross-section data\nmay indeed improve long-term measure-\nment, but at the expense of time-series\nconsistency. Taken at infrequent intervals,\nwith changed procedures and personnel\nboth at the issuing and at the form-filling\nend. they cannot be consistent from one\nsurvey to the next. Yet forecasts, whether\nby econometric model or informal method,\nrest almost entirely on the time-series\nproperties of the recorded data.

The changing treatment of\nprofits and depreciation in the official data\nare larger examples of revisions that reduce\ninformation content.\n\nThe paper by McNees finds that the\nextent of bias in forecasts is rather small.\nWhile we are relieved that our forecasts are\nnot \"irrational\" according to the canons of\nthe rational expectations theorists, we do\nnot take much comfort in this finding.

Second, if we are to allow for\nlearning in a state of incomplete\nknowledge, which is involved in a funda-\nmental way in even the simplest gaming\nproblems, then we must use optimizing\nwith feedback. that is, local search of\ndrastically simplified representations of the\nchoice problem. In the form used by\nRichard Cyert and James March. learning is\nformally equivalent to a very simple recur-\nsive linear programming problem whose\nbasic computation is the selection of the\nlarger or smaller of two numbers after two\nelementary divisions. Of course, even this\ntakes time, so learning (and economizing)\nin its crudest form cannot be the universal\nbasis of behavior. though of course we\nhope it may be present in much of it.\n\nTo rephrase. learning involves optimiz-\ning not only in the sophisticated Bayesian\nsense, but also in the crudest behavioral.\nrule of thumb sense\u2014and learning must be\nslow relative to the speed of many real\nprocesses because. even in its simplest\nform, it takes time. Since optimizing enters\nthe scene as soon as we go beyond ser-\nvomechanistic and other mechanical forms\nof behavior. we may see in it a kind of a\npriori concept. already existing in the\nbrain\u2014 programmed there\u2014to aid in the in-\nterpretation of and response to environ-\nment.

The theory emphasizes the role\nof monetary factors, international linkage\nof nominal interest rates as well as the rela-\ntion between interest differentials, and the\nexpectation of exchange rate depreciation.\nThese relations are viewed from the\nperspective of industralized countries with\ntheir efficient highly integrated capital\nmarkets.\n\nThe main elements of exchange rate de-\ntermination can be summarized by interest\narbitrage. adjusted for exchange rate ex-\npectations: | \u2014 i* \u2014 d and the definition of\nthe expected rate of depreciation: d \u2014\n[S \u2014 Sy S, where i and i* are the domestic\nand foreign nominal interest rates, and d is\nthe expected rate of depreciation, defined\nas the percentage excess of the expected fu-\nture spot rate $ over the current spot rate S.\nCombining the two equations yields an\nexpression for the equilibrium spot rate:\nS-S/[Ic-i-i*].\n\nThe equilibrium spot rate is equal to the\nexpected future spot rate discounted at the\ninternational nominal interest differential.\nThis formulation highlights two essential\naspects of exchange rate determination:\nFirst, there is the link between exchange\nrate expectations and the equilibrium value\nof the current spot rate.

Bilson starts from absolute\npurchasing power parity (PPP) to derive\nthe exchange rate as the link between na-\ntional price levels, which in turn are de-\ntermined by nominal money supplies and\nreal money demands. The equilibrium ex-\nchange rate is thus determined in the\ngeneral equilibrium of the economy, which\nis proximately characterized by the\nnominal quantity of money on one side, and\ninterest rates and real income as de-\nterminants of money demand on the other\nside. In a monetarist construction with full\nprice flexibility the theory would suggest\nthat an increase in money would be instan-\ntaneously offset by an equiproportionate\nincrease in prices and the exchange rate\nwithout any incidence on real variables.\n\nBilson recognizes, of course, that such a\nview is untenable as a description of the\nfacts. He sug\u00abests that effective prices are\nmore flexible than measured indices such as\nthe CPI. More specifically he argues that\nthe exchange rate can be taken to represent\nthe flexible price segment of the effective\nprice level and deflator of money balances.\nWith such an adjustment an increase in\nnominal money is dampened in its real ef-\nfects because the induced depreciation of\nthe exchange rate raises the effective price\nlevel and thus reduces the increase in the\nreal money stock. He argues that empir-\nically the exchange rate has a 60 percent\nweight in the effective price level with the\nremaining 40 percent going to the CPI.\nConsidering that this result arises in the\ncontext of monthly data. in equations that\nuse M \u00bb and M 4 money demands as the ag-\ngregates, it vastly overstates the potential\neffect of the exchange rate. After all, with\nM \u00bb and M 5 money demand by the business\nsector (exposed to the more flexible seg-\nment of prices) is deemphasized. For these\nmonetary aggregates we are primarily look-\ning at the behavior of households for whom\nthe CPI is, by and large. an accurate\nmeasure of the effective price level.\n",

                    "SrTEPHEN BREYER, Harvard Law School:\nThis interesting paper by Rodney Smith\nand Charles Phelps deals with \"rent con-\ntrol\" price regulation\u2014a form of regulation\nused to control the price of housing and\nnatural gas as well as oil. Such regulation\nseeks to transfer producer \"rents\" to\nconsumers, typically by using a \"tiered\"\npricing system. which sets a low price for\nthe \"old\" low-cost product and a high price\nfor the \"new\" high-cost product. Any such\nsystem must deal with two difficult sets of\nquestions: Is the \"high price\" high enough\nto elicit adequate new production? How\nwill the cheap \"low price\" product be\nallocated?\n\nSmith and Phelps note several of the\noften conflicting complicated sets of incen-\ntives regulation can create as it struggles\nwith these questions. They first point out\nthat the \"released barrel\" program created\nan incentive to extract oil at a cost that\nexceeded the uncontrolled price. Second.\nintegrated producers had an incentive to\nsubstitute controlled for uncontrolled (high\nprice) oil in refining. Third. producers had\nan incentive to withhold oil in hope that\ncontrols would be relaxed: an incentive\nwhich became more powerful as the world\nprice of oil increased. I shall comment\nbriefly on each.\n\nl. The discussion of the released barrel\nprogram may be less important empirically\nthan is suggested. As Smith and Phelps\nnote, whether it actually led producers to\nextract oil at a cost of; say. $12, $14 or$16a\nbarrel can better be determined by looking\nat individual properties, than by noting an\noverall production increase in 1974. The\nshort life of the program. chaos and un-\ncertainty in 1974, institutional delays in\ntranslating incentive into significant field in-\nvestment, conservation laws or policies of\ncompanies that tie production rates to\ntechnical considerations, all would argue\nagainst a large output expansion due to\nreleased barrels.\n\nThe same discussion is more important\nthan suggested in its implications for\npolicy. The paper suggests the absurdity of\n",

                    "using old oil rents in effect to finance the\nextraction of oil that costs more to produce\nthan the uncontrolled price. Yet. the\nentitlements program, which took effect in\n1974, embodies that same absurdity \"writ\nlarge.\" By guaranteeing each refiner a pro-\nportionate share of cheap controlled oil. it\nnot only makes controlled oil more expen-\nsive for those refiners who have it, but it\nmakes imported oil cheaper for all the\nothers. It offers refiners foreign oil. not at\nits incremential world price of. say. $14.\nbut at an \"average\" (domestic and foreign)\nprice of, say. $9 to $10. The result solves\nthe \"allocation\" problem (it produces a\nmarket clearing price between the \"low\ntier\" price and the high foreign oil price).\nHowever it solves this problem by\nsacrificing the purpose of rent control price\nregulation, for in effect it uses old oil rents\nto finance the importation of high cost\nforeign oil. As Hall and Pindyck have\npointed out, it transfers these rents not to\nconsumers, but to the Arabs and. it en-\ncourages extra imports as well.\n\n2. The discussion of the integrated\nrefiner/producer's incentives rests upon the\nassumption that the price control system\nwas totally ineffective; that refiners were\nable to capture the rents that price controls\ntook from producers, and market prices for\nrefined products were unaffected. This\nassumption, which Phelps and Smith have\ndiscussed elsewhere, strikes me as ques-\ntionable, for the government imposed price\ncontrols on refined products that were\nbased upon crude prices. How could these\ncontrols have been so ineffective as to\nallow  refiners to capture rents that\namounted to $6 or more per barrel? Their\ncase seems to rest upon the facts that\nrefined product is imported and sold at a\nprofit, and that major refiners have\n\"banked\"' costs since 1973 (which means\nthat their resale price was lower than the\nprice ceiling allowed them). The first of\nthese facts has been disputed by others who\nstate that the amount of foreign refined\nproduct imported (except for residual oil) is\nnegligible. The second fact is insignificant\n",

But it will not be a\nstruggle of market against plan or vice versa,\nbut rather an essentially political struggle be-\ntween the beneficiaries of the status quo and\nthose who wish to change the status quo.\n\nI think this gives us a useful framework for\ninterpreting American controversies over plan-\nning. Big business, the main supporter and ben-\neficiary of the status quo, is afraid any move\ntoward explicit planning will be controlled by\nadvocates of change and therefore seeks to\nidentify planning with subversion of private en-\nterprise and all manner of related evils. Those\non the other side, more specifically the pres-\ntigious Initiative Committee for National Eco-\nnomic Planning, are more sophisticated: plan-\nning, they say, far from threatening the existing\nsystem is urgently needed to strengthen it and\nimprove its functioning in what looks like being\na protracted time of troubles. They can and do\npoint to France, the capitalist country that has\nbeen a pioneer in developing the technique of\n\"indicative planning\" and where, according to\na recent Organisation for Economic Co-opera-\ntion and Development study, the distribution of\nincome is at or close to the top in inequality.\nWhat the promoters of planning are saying, in\nother words, is that as an ideological issue\nplanning is a phoney and that those in business\nand elsewhere who allow themselves to be\ntaken in by it are depriving themselves of what\nmay be a useful weapon in defense of their own\ninterests. If I understand him correctly, Richard\nMusgrave would not disagree.\n\nDeborah Milenkovitch's discussion of the\nYugoslav case is useful in bringing us up to date\non developments in that country. She argues\nthat the market-dominated system adopted in\n1965 failed in all its major objectives and has\nbeen replaced by a more centralized and con-\ntrolled though still far from complete system\nduring the 1970's. Limitations of time ob-\nviously prevented her from discussing the rela-\ntive success of this new departure, which is too\nbad. Instead she speculates on whether the re-\n",

                    "PAUL M. SwzaEZv, Co-editor Monthly Re-\nview: | used to think that important principles\nwere involved in the market vs. plan question,\nbut I no longer do. The concept of a pure market\neconomy is of course an extreme and I think not\nvery useful abstraction. Governments and other\npublic or private institutions have always\nplayed an important role in the functioning of\ncapitalist economies. I vividly remember Rip-\nley's course on railroads at Harvard many years\nago, where we students learned that during the\nnineteenth century the U.S. federal government\nhad granted to the railroads a total area bigger\nthan France and Germany combined (I can't\nvouch for the accuracy of either the fact or my\nmemory), after which I could never believe in\nthe market determination of the economic\nprocess in what was then supposed to be one of\nthe two or three freest economies in the world.\nAnd those who, like John K. Galbraith and\nAndreas Papandreou, argue that the present-day\nU.S. economy is largely planned by a few\nhundred giant corporations can certainly adduce\na great deal of evidence to support their view.\nOn the other hand even those countries, like the\nUSSR, which officially boast of planned econo-\nmies make very extensive use of markets to\ncarry out the production and distribution of\ngoods and services. Planning and markets are\ncertainly not mutually exclusive, and on the\nbasis of the historical record it would seem to be\nmore accurate to say that they are complemen-\ntary rather than antithetica].\n\nNevertheless, the notion of an opposition be-\ntween market and plan, while by no means in-\nherent in the concepts as such, may refer to a re-\nality. Markets tend not only to reproduce but\nalso to intensify and strengthen the social rela-\ntions which they embody. They favor the rich\nover the poor, the skilled over the unskilled, the\nknowledgeable over the ignorant. If these ten-\ndencies agree with the biases of planners, or if\nplanners want at most to moderate excesses in\nthe processes and results of market behavior,\nthere is no conflict. On the other hand, if\nplanners aim to achieve results seriously at odds\nwith the natural tendencies of markets, or rather\n",

That is, in many cases, we are not confront-\ning the difficulty of estimating parameters of a\nreasonably well understood structure, but of\ngroping with quite badly understood systems.\n\n1) In the tax field, this is illustrated by the\ncontinuing controversy over the incidence of\nthe corporation income tax.

First, in spite of the apparent concern\nwith the expenditure side of the government in\nthe Levy-Lambert paper and the tax side in the\nStiglitz-Boskin paper, they have in common\nthat they are concerned with issues of pricing.\nMany of the decisions involved in transpor-\ntation, housing, agricultural policy and water\nresources described by Levy-Lambert are pric-\ning decisions. Tax policy, of course, also con-\ncerns the appropriate relationship among prices\nand costs. The second point concerns a contrast\nbetween the two papers. The Levy-Lambert\npaper illustrates the widespread use of eco-\nnomic models and economic theory in making\npublic policy decisions throughout the French\ngovernment. The Boskin-Stiglitz paper, on the\nother hand, is more speculative, and I think this\ncorrectly reflects the difference between France\nand the United States in the degree of applica-\ntion of economic analysis.\n\nWhat have been the *'recent developments\"\nreflected in the application described in these\npapers? By and large these have been an evolu-\ntion, rather than a revolution, with the common\nelements of increasing sophistication, in dealing\nwith the second best nature of public policy\nproblems, in attempting to make quantitative\nestimates of important parameters of the prob-\nlems, and in elaborate modeling. While these\npapers show that a great deal of good work has\nbeen done, they have led me to consider some\nof the gaps that remain. Let me discuss a few of\nthese in turn.\n\nOne of the problems which needs to be dealt\nwith in an analysis of a public policy choice is\nidentifying the *'real'\" constraints. Second-best\ntheory has increased our awareness of how im-\nportant it can be to identify these and has shown\nhow the results may be affected by them. Un-\nfortunately, our policy recommendations will\n",

            "found": "One frequently encounters the casual em-\npirical conclusion that some consumers and\nfirms are not able to borrow as much as they\nwould like at market rates of interest. The\nexistence of these rejected offers to pay mar-\nket rates of interest is then said to constitute\n\"credit rationing.\" Marshall Freimer and\nMyron Gordon, in addition to Dwight Jaffee\nand Franco Modigliani, assume that rejected\nmarket interest rate offers exist and then\nattempt to explain why lenders might engage\nin such credit rationing.\"\n\nOur analysis begins by questioning the\nprevalent identification of credit rationing\nwith rejected offers to pay market rates of\ninterest. This concept of credit rationing is\napparently derived by analogy with the\ntheory of commodity markets under cer-\ntainty. In that theory, any economic agent\nwho makes an effective demand for a.com-\nmodity, that is, who offers to pay its market\nprice, is subject to nonprice commodity ra-\ntioning if his demand is not supplied. The\ncommon extension of this conclusion to credit\nmarkets is that any economic agent who\noffers to pay the market rate of interest on\nsome type of loan is subject to credit ration-\ning if his *demand\" for credit is not supplied.\nWe argue that this concept of credit ration-\ning is not useful because it is based on an in-\nappropriate implicit assumption that an offer\nto pay the market rate of interest on a loan\nconstitutes an effective demand for credit. In\nSection I we show that the distinction be-\ntween a borrower's wants and demands for\ncredit depends not only on the rate of interest\noffered, but also on the amount of collateral\noffered and on the borrower's equity. There-\nfore, if one is to have a concept of credit ra-\ntioning that refers to nonsupplied effective\ndemands for loans, rather than unsatisfied\nwants, it must involve analysis of lender re-\nsponse to offers of interest rate-collateral-\n\n* Assistant professor .of economics, Lawrence Uni-\nversity, and associate professor of economics, Univer-\nsity of Massachusetts, respectively. We wish to\nthank Ronald Ehrenberg and Thomas Russell for\nhelpful comments. |\n\n911\n\nequity combinations rather than only inter-\nest rate offers.\n\nFreimer and Gordon consider the case of a\nrisk-neutral lender who faces a certain cost of\nfunds and observe that his supply of credit\nto a borrower may not be an increasing func-\ntion of the rate of interest offered by the\nborrower. They attach significance to this\nobservation, saying that it raises the possi-\nbility of unstable equilibria and protracted\nexcess demand in credit markets; this has\nbeen called *disequilibrium credit ration-\ning.\" In Sections II and III we show that,\nunder various conditions, the supply of credit\nto a borrower is an increasing function of the\namounts of collateral and equity offered by\nthe borrower. Thus under the conditions as-\nsumed by Freimer-Gordon, and under more\ngeneral conditions, a borrower will be sup-\nplied more credit if he offers more collateral\nor equity.\n\nJaffee and Modigliani's primary concern is\nwith 'equilibrium credit rationing.\" They\nassume that a lender can act as a discrimi-\nnating monopolist and conclude that he will\nration some borrowers if he is subject to an\ninstitutional constraint which requires him to\ncharge the same interest rate to borrowers\nwith different demand curves for credit. In\nSection IV we demonstrate that credit ra-\ntioning is not optimal for any lender unless\nthere are effective institutional constraints\non the collateral and equity terms of loan\ncontracts in addition to an effective con-\nstraint on interest rates. Therefore, given the\nJaffee and Modigliani assumption of a single\ninterest rate constraint, their conclusion that\ncredit rationing is rational for a monopolistic\nlender is shown to be false.\n\nI. Collateral, Equity, and Effective\nDemand for Loans\n\nWe proceed to an analysis of the role of\nequity and collateral in transforming a desire\nfor credit into an effective demand for a loan.\nAssume that a lender has preferences defined\nover his random terminal wealth x, and that\n"

His\nanalysis is confined to specific functional\nforms of the utility function, the production\nfunction, and the spatial distribution of pub-\nlic services function. Moreover,'his specifica-\ntion implies that the level of public services\nenjoyed by a.household depends solely on the\nper capita supply of public services, thus\nusing a specific form of congestion for a con-\ngestable public service.\n\nIn this note, we present an analytical\nmodel of identical consumers which does.not\nsuffer from the restrictions mentioned above.\n\n' Schuler's model turns out to be a very special\ncase of this general model.

The concept of consumer's\nsurplus originated in 1844 (see Jules Dupuit) and has\nbeen controversial ever since. Alfred Marshall, who\npopularized the tool, stipulated that for it to be validly\nused the marginal utility of money must be constant\n(Marshall, p. 842 or David Katzner, p. 152). However,\nHarold Hotelling wrote that consumer's surpluses \"give\na meaningful measure of social value. This breaks down\nif the variations under consideration are too large a part\nof the total economy of the person . . . \" (p. 289). John\nHicks too, stated only a gentle caution: \"In order that\nthe Marshallian measure of consumer's surplus should be\na good measure, one thing alone is needful\u2014that the\nincome effect should be small\" (p. 177). More recently,\nthough, Paul Samuelson (pp. 194-95) concluded that\nconsumer's surplus is a worse than useless concept (be-\ncause it confuses), and L.M.D. Little (p. 180) agreed,\ncalling it no more than a \"theoretical toy.\" Nonetheless,\ntheorists and cost-benefit analysts have persisted in\ntheir use of the tool. For justification they resort (see\nE. J. Mishan, pp. 337-38, for example), with no formal\ntheoretical support, to statements similar to those\nquoted above from Hotelling and Hicks.\n"

(This use of the term liquidity deviates somewhat\nfrom that followed by Keynes and Tsiang.) The longer\nthe investor's horizon, the more incentive he will have\nto invest in illiquid assets since transactions costs will\ndecline as a percentage of asset yield as the holding\nperiod is lengthened. Put somewhat differently, Hicks\nis saying that it will pay to invest in illiquid assets only\nif they can be held long enough to compensate for their\nhigh transactions costs.

Smith considers a situation where a\nlender with initial wealth vo has the option\nof either buying government bonds with a\ncertain return r, or giving a risky loan z at a\ncontractual rate of interest r* to an indi-\nvidual borrower or firm. The borrower uses\nhis loan to finance a risky investment proj-\nect ylelding an uncertain return 0 (assumed\nindependent of the amount invested). The\nborrower also has an initial wealth W^,\nwhich he invests partly in his risky invest-\nment project (his firm\") and partly in the\nform of riskless government securities at\nrate r. Since the borrower's risky investment\nactivity (his firm) is assumed to be incorpo-\nrated with limited liability, so that his private\nholdings of riskless bonds are protected from\nlender claims, the lender's expected utility\nfrom extending a loan clearly becomes de-\npendent on the debtors' equity decision, i.e.,\non the way in which the debtor divides his\npersonal wealth W, into investment in the\nrisky project y (his equity in his firm) and\ninvestment in riskless bonds (his personal,\nnonliable assets). The higher y, the lesser is\n(given the size of the loan z) the risk that\nthe debtor will default on his loan, and thus\nthe higher is the lender's expected utility.\nThe debtor's equity capital acts, as Smith\nexpresses it, as an external economy to the\nlender.

Many\neconomists, basing themselves on rational\nexpectations,\" doubt whether the Phillips\ncurve exists domestically; work has been done\non the same basis for international inflation;\nand the phenomenon of devaluation-induced\ndomestic inflation is part of the \"monetary\napproach\" contention that devaluation does\nnothing for the balance of payments in the\nlong run. Dynamic gains from tariff reduc-\ntion have been dealt with extensively in W.\nM. Corden's Trade and Welfare; the same\nsource deals extensively with the allegedly\nunexplored problem of oligopoly power. Trade\nliberalization can only be a one-shot palliative\nof domestic inflation. If policy makers think\nthat the balance of payments can be improved\nby trade restriction, especially under floating\nrates, they are repeating a fallacy exploded\nby Hume two centuries ago and should so be\ntold. The terms-of-trade effect of devaluation,\nalleged to be ignored by conventional theory,\nis well known to be capable of going in either\ndirection. A quarter of a century ago Sidney\nAlexander showed that if a terms-of-trade effect\nexists, it should be exploited to the optimum\nrestriction point and devaluation used there-\nafter; earlier, Meade and others pointed to\nthe correct policy of free trade plus inter-\nnational transfers. Finally, it is odd indeed\nto find U.S. government subsidized sales of\nwheat to Russia, and the actions of OPEC, as\nproof that the free market cannot be trusted.\nIn short, the state of trade theory is quite\nadequate to the task the authors want to\nassign it, even though the relevant theory is\nnot known in Washington.\n",

                    "Hannv G. JonNsow, University of Chicago:\nBaldwin's paper is an admirably careful ex-\nample of professional empirical study of the\neffects of tariff elimination. The only ques-\ntion it raises is that, whereas theory stresses\nthe \"small triangle\" welfare gains from tariff\nreduction, the implied welfare cost in Baldwin's\nstudy is the loss of jobs in the affected indus-\ntries. If this is the relevant measurement,\ntheory needs reshaping. Apart from that, in\norder to determine whether costs or gains are\n\"Jarge\" or \"small,\" we need a standard of\ncomparison. It seems to me that a change\nrequiring an exchange rate change of --14\npercent, or the loss of something over a thou-\nsand jobs in only a few states over a ten-year\nperiod, is scarcely worth worrying about.\n\nHorst's paper is equally professional. My\ncomments are only that in a time of inflation\ntax deferral involves considerable real savings\nto the taxpayer allowed to defer; and that I\nam unhappy with the work on international\ncompanies and \"domestic monopoly profit.\"\nIt seems to me that both measured monopoly\nprofit and competitiveness in production\nabroad are the results of some kind of tech-\nnological advantage in the broad sense; and\nthat describing the phenomena of the complex\neconomics of technology as a public good\nproduced by private investment in terms of\n\"barriers to entry\" is not helpful to\nunderstanding.\n\nBergsten and Cline promise a research\nagenda; but what they actually offer is a\nshopping list prepared by a would-be master\nchef who is so accustomed to eating in first-\nclass French restaurants that he does not know\nthat established firms like General Mills, H. J.\nHeinz, Pepperidge Farms, and Birdseye exist\nto make it unnecessary for the home cook to\ngrind his own corn, bake his own bread, and\nwash his own potatoes. Their list shows\n",

Niehans is concerned\nwith three related issues\u2014first, the collapse\nof the Bretton Woods (BW) System;\nsecond, the short-run management of the cur-\nrent payments system; and third, the long-run\nreform of the international payments system.\nLet me take each of these in turn.\n\nNiehans maintains that the BW System\ncollapsed because of the lasting expansionary\ncourse of American monetary policy which\nbegan in 1961. I find this argument either\none-sided in its historical perspective or restric-\ntive in its interpretation of BW. In the first\nplace, the United States was, for a long time,\nblamed for the so-called dollar shortage. Then\nin the 1960's, it was accused of creating a\ndollar glut. So initially the complaint was one\nof too strong an American balance of payments\nposition and later it turned to one of too large\na deficit. It is clear that if the Europeans\nwere not accumulating enough dollars, they\ncould have devalued with respect to gold and\nif they were getting too many dollars, they\ncould have revalued. I would, however, agree\nthat the same result could have been achieved\nif the United States had changed the parity\nof the dollar to gold; but it chose not to, I\nthink, for good reasons. But, in any case, the\nrest of the world had a very powerful and\ndirect mechanism for correcting any complaint.\nNiehans could, however, argue that continuous\nchanges in parity was against the \"spirit\" of\nBW. 1 would find such a position as subjective.\n\nIn regard to the desired management of\nthe current system, I have two related con-\ncerns. First, I think that there should be\navailable a constant purchasing power (in\nterms of internationally traded goods) and\ninterest bearing Special Drawing Rights\n(SDR). My reason for this is that the oil\nexporting nations are currently wasting a great\ndeal of resources in haphazard development\nplans largely because they feel that they have\nto spend their oil receipts immediately. Tf, on\nthe other hand, such an SDR was available\n",

Second, the major\nbalance of payments deficit now resides with\nnonoil exporting developing nations. But no\nexchange system can alleviate their deficit\nposition. However, the International Monetary\nFund (7MF) could, by acquiring OPEC bal-\nances through the creation of this new SDR,\nmake large loans to finance development of\nsuch nations. Thus a larger Organization of\nPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) sur-\nplus could be indirectly used to finance\ndevelopment of the largest segment of the\nworld population.\n\nIn the long run, I agree with Niehans that\nwe should be able to do much better. Any\nviable long-run system must incorporate some\nflexibility in allowing for relative autonomy\nin domestic policy and further not be dis-\nruptive in causing unnecessary short-run shifts\nin resources which are not dictated by long-\nrun scarcities.\n\nAny system of fixed exchange rates will be\nlimiting, as Niehans has pointed out, in flexi-\nbility of differing domestic goals. No nation is,\nI believe, willing to again abdicate control of\nits domestic monetary tools as required under\na system where exchange rates do not change,\nor at least, do not change frequently.\n\nA system of floating rates, though desirable\non many grounds, has two major drawbacks.\nFirst, large fluctuations in rates can cause\ntransfers of real resources which may not be\ndesirable from the long-run perspective.\nSecond, and probably much more controver-\nsial, floating rates may enhance world wide\ninflation. I have come to this tentative con-\nclusion from some casual empirical and\ntheoretical considerations.\n\nEconomists have, since the writings of\nKeynes, agreed with the proposition that\nprices, although flexible upwards, tend to be\nsticky downward. Furthermore, since the\ntheory of Absorption, the notion that devalu-\nation will, in time, lead to pressures on\ndomestic output, thus increasing prices and\nleading to an eventual deterioration of the\n",

WarricH, Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System: The use of\noptimal control techniques in planning for eco-\nnomic stabilization is approaching the policy\nstage. At the present time, as the papers before\nus show, the principal application of these\ntechniques has been the examination of models\nand of past policies. Its use for effective policy\nadvice still seems some distance away. But\ninitial efforts to build an optimal control\napproach into Federal Reserve policymaking\nare underway. I believe that there is potential\nfor progress at both the technical and the\npolicy levels. It is important, therefore, for\nthe producers and the potential users of this\ntechnique to become better acquainted. Model\nbuilders and policy makers must explore one\nanother's needs and capabilities.\n\nPolicy makers, I believe, regard their role\nas somewhat more modest than that with\nwhich the terminology of the loss function\nsometimes endows them. The Federal Reserve,\nto be specific, is responsible for only one\nphase of the nation's economic policy\u2014the\nhandling of monetary policy. The overall\nobjectives, moreover, are given by the Em-\nployment Act. Most of the economic policies\nthat influence the rate of growth, employment,\nand the degree of price stability, are handled\nelsewhere in the government. Particularly\nwhen several objectives are involved, which\nobviously cannot all be attained with one\ninstrument, it seems somewhat presumptuous\nto state one's preferences in the form of\n\"targets.\"\n\nThe monetary policy official naturally has\nideas also about desirable fiscal policy, and\nabout many other policies that influence eco-\nnomic development. Only in the very short\nrun can he make fairly firm assumptions as\nto what these policies will be. For the longer\nrun, a not unreasonable attitude for him may\nbe to think of monetary policy as helping to\ncreate the environment in which other public\npolicies, as well as decisions made in the pri-\nvate sector, will become effective. Any given\nmonetary policy may be consistent with alter-\nnative combinations of growth, unemployment,\nand inflation. The monetary policymaker will\n",

But he should not over-\nestimate his ability to influence the outcome.\n\nThe time horizon over which target values\nare to be set likewise presents difficult prob-\nlems. One may believe that a lower rate of\neconomic expansion in the immediate future\nwill lead to more sustainable growth and lower\nultimate unemployment and inflation than\nwould a more aggressive policy. But unless\nsuch preferences are built into a loss func-\ntion, and a long time horizon is allowed for,\nrather extreme policy proposals may follow\nfrom optimal control techniques applied to\neconometric models with long lag structures,\nas some of the papers at this meeting indicate.\n\nThe policy maker may also be troubled by\nan appearance of misplaced concreteness. He\nmay be accustomed to thinking in directional\nterms\u2014up or down\u2014-or in terms of rates of\nchange\u2014faster or slower. He may want to\nreserve judgment as to precise targets for\nunemployment and inflation until the economy\nis a little closer to what he might consider\noptimal. And if in addition he were asked\nwhether he has a quadratic loss function, i.e.,\nwhether he is indifferent to an equal degree\nof over- and undershooting of his targets, he\nmight be tempted to think the whole thing a\nspherical nuisance, i.e., a nuisance from every\nangle.\n\nMonetary policy in the United States,\nmoreover, is made by a group, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee. The loss functions\nof all its members are unlikely to be identical.\nPerhaps one could think of a consensus loss\nfunction, or at least of one that would be\nPareto optimal as between two disagreeing\ngroups. But as a practical matter, it is prob-\nably easier for such a group to arrive at\nagreement on something on which they are\ncompelled to take immediate action such as\nbank reserves, or the money supply, or the\nFederal funds rate, than about desirable condi-\ntions in the economy over which they have\nno immediate control.

                    "ALBERT O. HigsCHMAN, Institute for Ad-\nvanced Study: In the venerable folklore of\ntraditional economics political action in the\neconomic sphere has typically been considered\nas noxious interference with the totallv bene-\nficent market mechanism The equally ven-\nerable opposing point of view castigates the\nInvisible Hand as the Blind Forces of the\nMarket\u2014note the clever replacement of\nAdam Smith's metaphor by one that uses a\nclosely related image\u2014and instead advocates\nplanning by a political authority that, in turn,\nis assumed to be totally beneficent. A prin-\ncipal intent of my work on exit and voice,\nconsiderably bolstered by all three papers\npresented at this session, was to show that\nthere is a wide range of economic processes\nfor the efficient unfolding of which both indi-\nvidual, economic action (via exit) and partici-\npatory, political action (via voice) have\nimportant constructive roles to play. The\nnovelty of the theory for the economist\u2014apt\nto infuriate or to disconcert both market and\nplanning enthusiasts\u2014consists in its stress on\nvoice not as a substitute for the market nor as\na restraint on it in a few well defined situa-\ntions, but as another generally available\nmechanism that, like the market, has its\nstrengths and weaknesses, its successes and\nfailures. There is also a stress on the possi-\nbility of unstable equilibria between exit and\nvoice as one drives out the other and on the\nlack of once-and-for-all solutions through opti-\nmal mixes of exit and voice. In other words,\nthe new approach does not satisfy our craving\nfor equilibrium, harmony and final repose. If\nit has met, nevertheless, with the beginning of\na response from economists, this is probably\nbecause of the new or renewed emphasis on\nsuch phenomena as ignorance and the cost of\ninformation, transaction costs, bounded ration-\nality, X-efficiency, and even altruism. The\npossibility of 'market failure\" is today no\nlonger limited\u2014as was taught not long ago\nby received doctrine\u2014to the presence of exter-\nnalities, and I welcome Dennis Young's pro-\nposal to redefine this concept broadly in terms\nof situations where exit doesn't do a good job\nof stirring up management and of restoring\n",

In this perspective the availability\nof another mechanism\u2014voice\u2014should not be\nviewed as a threatening rival, but as a welcome\nresource whose potential contribution to a\ncontainment of our multiple troubles deserves\nto be closely studied. For example, while look-\ning at the provision of medical services\nprecisely in this manner, Carl Stevens has\nrecently proposed to complement consumer\nsovereignty\u2014that is, exit\u2014by consumer parti-\ncipation and to limit professional producer\nsovereignty by /ay management constraints.\n'These terms are useful modulations of the\nperhaps excessively compact ''voice.\"\n\nMy comments, including some further\nthoughts will be in four parts.\n\n1. In all three papers, when voice scores\nover exit this is primarily because it is informa-\ntion-rich whereas exit conveys little beyond the\nfact of restlessness or restiveness on the part\nof the consumer, customer, employee or who-\never else one has an economic relation with.\nTake Freeman's paper on labor and the em-\nployment relationship: here dissatisfaction\narises from a mixture of motives that includes\nunhappiness about a whole array of working\nconditions no less than the desire for higher\nwages and benefits. Unions are more efficient\nin communicating information about this com-\nplex mixture of complaints than the personnel\nturnover rate. To make this point even\nstronger I would add that the content of\ndiscontent is apt to change over time: exit\nalways takes the same form no matter what\nthe complaint; but voice can articulate newly\narising demands\u2014often, to be sure, with a con-\nsiderable lag as the union leadership takes its\nown time to understand and adopt the new\n*outlandish\" grievances of its members.\n\nAccording to Williamson, markets are not\nworking properly whenever the parties are\ninvolved in a relationship which it is difficult\nto specify fully in writing because of uncer-\ntainty and complexity or which lends itself\npeculiadly to the display of bargaining be-\nhavior. In these cases the substitution of hier-\narchy for market relationships between the\nparties is indicated. In my language hierarchy\ncan be considered as a special variety of insti-\n",

                    "pollute is positively correlated with the captur-\nable implicit grants. Alternatively, in a situ-\nation where the pollutor is no longer allowed\nto capture the implicit grant stemming from\nthe non-abatement of external diseconomies,\nthen his propensity to pollute is likely to\ndecline.\n\nThe imposition of effluent charges will\naccomplish just that. Two of the papers at\nhand propose actions along those lines. Lloyd\nOrr proves quite convincingly that the halting\nof an implicit grant to the pollutor sets in\nmotion technological innovations conducive to\nenvironmental improvement. Brumm and\nDick show that subsidies for water treatment\nfacilities are suboptimal or often counter-\nproductive. In a sense, both papers argue\nagainst certain pathological grants which harm\nthe environment. An exception to this is the\ntransitional period toward the pollutor-pays-\nprinciple, when interregional dislocations may\nstill warrant an elaborate network of explicit\nand implicit grants, as considered by Martin\nPfaff.'\n\nScenario Two: Implicit Grant from Nature\nto the Mineral Exploiter. Natural resource\nexploitation is a composite economic trans-\naction wherein the true value of the material\nis more than the cost of production (extrac-\ntion). The ore itself is accepted as a gift from\nnature, which does not ask for a quid pro quo\nprice. The exploiter becomes the recipient of\nan \"implicit grant from nature.\" The fact\nthat this is shared by the miner, the material\nprocessor, and the consumer, does not negate\nthe idea that there is a grant from nature\nwhich, in turn, means that natural resources\nare undervalued. Certainly, the pivotal ques-\ntion is how to determine the size of this grant\nfrom nature via minerals. For this purpose\nwe may make a distinction between the market\nvalue versus the surrogate value, and in a\nparallel fashion between the market price and\nthe surrogate price. The market price is, of\ncourse, known. The other, the surrogate price,\nwill approximate to a level where such large\n",

                    "Jawos HonvarH, Holcomb Research Insti-\ntute, Butler University: Projecting the search-\nlight of grants economics on environmental\nproblems, we obtain a clearer perception of\nthree things. Firstly, we can trace some\nimplicit income and wealth transfers. Secondly,\nwe can observe the mechanism by which such\ngrants may affect productive efficiency and\ndistributive equity. Thirdly, from this under-\nstanding we can design policy tools to\ninduce environmentally desirable technological\nchanges.\n\nThe papers of this panel have made com-\nmendable starts toward exploring what good\nand bad those grants can do to environmental\nquality and how they should be harnessed.\nI will attempt to examine to what extent their\npropositions have contributed tc staking out\nthe role of exchange versus grant transactions\nin environmental models.\n\nWhat we ought to strive for is a broad\nenough framework within which all the various\nenvironmental policy problems could be inte-\ngrated. In the realm of generalities, the first\nquestion is to detail the production and con-\nsumption functions of the economics of the\ncoming spaceship earth, wherein the goal will\nno longer be to maximize output but rather to\nminimize throughput. Having perceived the\nspaceship earth, i.e., the environment, as the\nsignificant limiting factor, our task is to\nconduct human activities without wrecking\necological equilibrium. The fundamental envi-\nronmental problem is, therefore, to achieve a\nreduction in the per capita use of the environ-\nment as a waste receptor.\n\nIn paving the way toward a comprehensive\nmethodology of environmental policy prob-\nlems, I recommend as building blocks, some\npertinent concepts of grants economics. Herein\nI outline, for the sake of illustration, three\nscenarios.\n\nScenario One: Implicit Grant to the Pol-\nlutor. The pollutor gains through the non-\nabatement of the nuisance he causes, and in\nthis sense he is the beneficiary of an implicit\ngrant. The grantor is the inconvenienced\nneighbor, or nature to the extent that it\nabsorbs the pollutant. The propensity to\n",

In the presence of\ntechnical change, how much resource use is\nconsistent with a stationary state or positive\ngrowth?\n\nQuestions like these are examined in the\nClub of Rome study on the limits to growth.\nUnfortunately, the treatment of preferences,\nof production technologv, and of the econ-\nomv appears unconventional and implausible\nto many economists. The following is an\nattempt to reformulate the allocation prob-\nlem for exhaustible resources in neoclassical\nterms.\n\nPreferences are described by a logarithmic\nutilitv function and future utility is dis-\ncounted by a constant discount factor. Pro-\nduction of goods and control of bads (pollu-\ntion) is described bv Cobb-Douglas produc-\ntion functions with exogenous technical prog-\nress at constant rates. In addition to pro-\nducible inputs, net inputs of exhaustible\nresources are needed in the production of\ngoods. Consumption of leisure is equal to the\nstock of persons minus the person inputs into\nproduction, and in this way labor can be\ntreated as any other consumption good.\nUnder these assumptions which may be\nmore palatable to economic theorists than\nthose of \"World Dynamics,\" the optimal in-\ntertemporal allocation of stocks of producible\ngoods and of the given known stocks of ex-\nhaustible resources will be investigated.\n\nOur objective is to maximize the present\nvalue of the stream of utility generated by\nconsumption (flows) and by the levels of\ncertain variables descriptive of the quality of\nthe environment. The utility function is\nspecified to be log-linear. Such a utility func-\ntion may be interpreted in the aggregate or\nin per capita terms without change in the\nmathematics.

For example, the Water\nResources Council has recently provided new\nrules for benefit-cost analysis that are far\nmore comprehensive than any previous fed-\neral effort, but the new standards do not\nmention pricing policies or how they might\nalter the performance of public undertakings.\n\nIn the academic literature, very few have\nnoted the dilemma created by not explicitly\ntaking into consideration pricing policies\nwhen conducting benefit-cost analvses.

I am indebted to Gary Fields, Michael Roth-\nschild, Michael Spence, and to participants at seminars\nat Yale, Pennsylvania, Chicago, Queens, Wesleyan,\nand Princeton at which earlier versions of this paper\nwere presented, for helpful conversations and com-\nments.\n\nThe idea that education serves as a screening device\nand that as a result the allocation of resources to educa-\ntion may not be optimal is, of course, an old one. (See,\nfor instance, Hull and Peters (1969) and Young (1958).)\nMore recently, Thurow, l'ields, Akerlof (1973), Spence,\nand Arrow (1973) have discussed education as a screen-\ning device. The first two papers assume a disequilibrium\nin the labor market (i.e., wages of any group of individ-\nuals need not equal the mean marginal product of the\ngroup); none of the papers, with the exception of l'ields,\nappears to contain a completely articulated theory of\nthe equilibrium of the svstem (the \"supply\" of educa-\ntion), and without a theory of the determination of the\nscreening mechanism, it is difficult to make welfare\neconomic evaluations of the system. For a more ex-\ntensive discussion of this point, see Rothschild and\nStiglitz (1973a). Several of the results are closely related\nto those obtained independently by Akerlof (1973),\nSpence, and Arrow (1973). As we show below, the pre-\nsumption that these papers attempt to establish, that\nthere is too much screening, is not necessarily valid.\nVarious aspects of the theory of screening have recently\nbeen the subject of extensive discussion in other areas\nbesides those of the capital market and education re-\nferred to earlier: in insurance markets (Rothschild and\nStiglitz (1973a)), in labor markets (Salop and Salop\n(1972)), in discrimination (Arrow (1972), Phelps, Stig-\nlitz (1973, 1974)), and in product markets (Salop\n(1973)).

STEPHAN, Georgia State Uni-\nversity: Gregg Lewis focuses upon possible\neffects of the negative income tax (INIT)\nwithin the traditional framework of the\nwork-leisure choice. Lewis applies the fa-\nmiliar tools of comparative statics, albeit to\nmultiple time periods. Lewis' results are of\ninterest since thev remind us that the NIT\nmarket-work disincentive results are de-\npendent upon the length of time of the V7T\nand the intertemporal elasticity of substitu-\ntion. With regard to the first of these points,\nwe should be cautioned that the VIT work\neffects are dependent upon the length of\ntime of the VIT relative to the horizon of the\nindividual, not relative to his working life.\nIndeed, one likely reason the poor are poor\nis because of an abbreviated horizon.\n\nThe N7T is a useful vehicle for analyzing\naspects of time allocation. I find it somewhat\ndisappointing, however, that Lewis chooses\nto analyze the question within the parochial\nframework of utility maximization. It is\nuseful to point out that other approaches\nexist. In particular, Lewis does not mention\nthat the .V7T can affect human capital ac-\ncumulation. Consider the human capital\napproach which states that the objective of\nthe individual is to maximize the present\nvalue of income net of investment costs.\nWithin this framework, it can be shown that\nby lowering the after-tax value of the in-\ndividual's time the N7T will lower the indi-\nrect cost of human capital investment as\nwell as the present value of the benefit\nstream arising from the human capital in-\nvestment. Because the N7T does not alter\nthe cost of direct inputs used in human cap-\nital production, however, the V/T will cause\nthe present value of benefits arising from\nthe human capital investment to decrease\nrelative to the cost of investment. As a re-\nsult, the V7T leads to a flatter human cap-\nital profile. One consequence of this may be\nto keep persons permanently on the negative\nincome tax roles. Since earnings are lower in\nthe early and late years of the life cycle, the\nNIT may expect to enroll primarily the\nyoung and the old. If, however, the VT has\n",

                    "human capital disincentive effects, today's\nvoung enrollees may prove to be eligible in\nthe mid-years as well as in the late years of\ntheir lives.\n\nJust as the Lewis work disincentive effects\ndepend upon the length of time of the VIT\nrelative to the horizon of the individual, so\ntoo do the human capital disincentive effects.\nWhile the present value of benefits arising\nfrom human capital production depends\nupon the relative length of time of the V7T,\nthe costs do not. As a result, a nonpermanent\nNIT will have smaller human capital dis-\nincentive effects than a permanent \"VIT.\nIndeed, when the N7T is not permanent, it\nis possible to conceive of a situation where\nthe NIT operates to augment the quantity\nof human capital produced by the individual.\nIf, for example, the NT is relatively short-\nlived, the cost of human capital production\nmay well decrease more than the resulting\nbenefits and we may find persons accumulat-\ning human capital inventories.\n\n(The Lewis view sees the wage rate as\nexogenous and hours of work as endogenous\nand demonstrates that the N7T' can lower\nthe number of hours worked. The human\ncapital view sees the combined number of\nhours of work and training as exogenous\nand the wage rate as endogenous and\ndemonstrates that a permanent VIT can\nflatten the wage profile. Both are, of course,\npartial views of the world. Yet these partial\nviews are seldom joined. As a profession we\nteach our students that the hours-of-leisure\nvariable is solved in a utility maximization\nframework while the wage-rate variable is\nsolved by the technique of lifetime income\nmaximization.\n\nRecent work by G. S. Becker and G. R.\nGhez attempts to unite these two approaches\nby depicting the life cycle as a series of static\nutility-maximizing decisions superimposed\nupon an endogenous wage rate which\nchanges over time as the human capital\nstock is altered by the individual's invest-\nment decision. Following the Becker-Ghez\napproach, one could argue that the .V7T acts\nto augment leisure not only because of utility\n",

Instead, I shall\nindicate how these two variables change\nmodels of discrimination.\n\nSuppose a tribe owns land whose pro-\nducts such as timber, fur, buffalo, minerals,\nor oil can be transformed into capital with\nlittle net borrowing. Suppose, further, that\nhistorically the tribe has successfully admin-\nistered property rights in land among its\nmembers, with exclusive use-rights but a\nsystem of inheritance different from the\nAmerican norm. Suppose, also, that it can\ntax all, white or Indian, who live within a\ndesignated boundary. Then questions about\nsegregation in work places or residences are\nnot major. More important are questions\nabout trade with outsiders, immigration and\nintermarriage, and the ability of the tribe to\nprevent confiscation of land and sovereignty.\n\nThe federal government has always had a\nconflict of interest in its chosen role as pro-\ntector of Indian property rights. American\npoliticians and bureaucrats perceive a choice\nin the implementation of discrimination be-\ntween trade methods and confiscation meth-\nods. Let us examine briefly the benefits and\ncosts which affect the choice. Thinking in\nterms of centuries, the benefits of confisca-\ntion vary with the price of land, with land\nclassified by type of natural resource. The\ncosts depend upon other factors. For in-\nstance, in 1974 the strength of the sympathy\nvote is important. In 1874, the availability\nof rifles, ammunition, and horses mattered.\nIn 1774, the strategic relationships between\na tribe and the British mattered. At times,\nthe American government has preferred\ntrade to confiscation after examining the\nbenefits and the costs.\n\nFinally, I must emphasize that Native\nAmericans are very diverse. Our cultures are\ndifferent from one another, both aboriginally\nand in the type of borrowing from Euro-\npeans. Further, the relative success in retain-\ning land and sovereignty varies greatly\namong tribes. Those who wish nationally\nvalid generalizations risk error should they\n",

Since this\nis a large task for a brief space, I will focus\non main points. I begin with general remarks\nand end by applying them as brief criticism\nof the papers just presented.\n\nOne should expect that the forms of dis-\ncrimination would vary across minority\ngroups during a given year and during a\ngiven century. Some differences between\nblacks and Native Americans are so import-\nant that policies or predictions based on\nintuition developed with current models of\ndiscrimination against blacks lead to serious\nerror when applied to Native Americans.\nOne error is to omit land and sovereignty as\nvariables. Another is to fail to examine the\nfull range of policies open to the majority\nwhen they discriminate.\n\nBecause Native Americans have always\nowned large amounts of land and still do, an\nexclusive focus on labor markets is incorrect.\nThe nature of property law and the limita-\ntions on it are different for land, physical\ncapital, and human capital. As a result, the\nbenefits and costs of different forms of dis-\ncrimination change as compared to blacks.\nHence, the preferred forms of discrimination\nalso change.\n\nFor Native Americans, one must empha-\nsize the benefits of sovereignty and focus\nupon the problems which tribal governments\nhave protecting and utilizing their constitu-\ntional status. Personal sovereignty, or free-\ndom, is emphasized for blacks. Governments\nshould be able to tax and to control property\nlaw among individuals within their jurisdic-\ntion, including whites who settle upon con-\nfiscated lands. Native Americans ruled them-\nselves originally and have attempted to ad-\njust their political institutions in order to\nretain control over internal affairs, in spite\nof becoming politically subordinate to the\nUnited States government. I believe that the\npower to tax and to write civil and criminal\nlaw are important economic variables.\n\nAlthough land and sovereignty are key\nvariables, the sad fact is that Indians have\n",

This is in-\ndeed an extraordinary suggestion since it is\nargued that an exchange rate change in and\nof itself exerts permanent real effects. As it\nstands, the only support for such an effect is\npermanent money illusion. Alternatively,\nwith the appropriate macroeconomic sup-\nport, an exchange rate change can and will\nhave long-run real effects. In that context,\nhowever, the roles are essentially reversed.\nA change in the balance between income and\nexpenditure is essential and an exchange rate\nchange is helpful in effecting the necessary\nrelative price adjustments via an increase in\nthe price of traded goods rather than a de-\nflation-induced decline in the price of home\ngoods.\n\nA macroeconomic perspective suggests\nthat changes in absorption that are implied\nby changes in the trade balance will have\nsystematic effects on relative prices. As a\nfirst approximation, the relative price of do-\nmestic goods will decline in terms of all\ntraded goods in the surplus country while in\nthe deficit country, where absorption ex-\npands, the relative price of nontraded goods\nwill increase in terms of traded goods. These\nrelative price changes are required in order\nto translate changes in absorption, part of\nwhich falls on nontraded goods, into a change\nin the trade balance.\n\nThe preceding line of argument can be\nused to establish how an exchange rate\nchange, accompanied by a validating aggre-\ngate policy, will affect the \"competitive\nposition\" of a country in world markets. The\nrelevant reasoning is not so much that do-\nmestic exports become cheaper abroad and\nimports become more expensive at home\u2014\nthe relevant distinction is one between traded\nand nontraded goods. The improvement in\nthe competitive position of domestic pro-\nducers of traded goods derives from the fact\nthat the reduction in absorption frees factors\nof production in the home goods industries\nand therebv lowers real factor costs to the\ntraded goods sector, making its expansion\n",

Her conclusion that we\nmust be tentative about everything and dog-\nmatic about nothing is perhaps unduly pessi-\nmistic, and I shall therefore concentrate in\nmy remarks on those issues that I feel we can\nquite confidently make strong statements\nabout.\n\nThe first issue about which we can be quite\ndogmatic is that balance of payments ques-\ntions, and more narrowly trade balance ques-\ntions, are issues in the realm of macroeco-\nnomics and that consequently any approach\nthat does not cast the problem in that setting\nis at best misleading and more likely incor-\nrect. Nobody, I believe, is on record ques-\ntioning this fundamental proposition about\nthe adjustment mechanism, but still the\nliterature and policy discussion abounds with\ninstances where the implication of that as-\nsertion is evaded by approaches euphemisti-\ncally referred to as \"partial equilibrium,\"\nwhatever that may mean in a macroeconomic\ncontext.\n\nThe recognition that payments problems\nare macroeconomic problems raises doubt\nabout two propositions that have recently\nattracted interest. The first is the J-curve\u2014\nthe suggestion that a devaluation in the short\nrun causes \u00e0 worsening in the trade balance\nto be followed subsequently by an improve-\nment. Already in the framework of a crude\nelasticity approach, there is no presumption\nthat such an outcome is inevitable. More\nfundamentally, however, there would not\nseem to be a macroeconomic relationship\nthat would predict an increase in nominal\nspending relative to income as a consequence\nof an exchange rate change, inevitably and\nindependently of monetary and fiscal policy.\nItis true, however, that theories of the short-\nrun consumption function might shed an in-\nteresting perspective on the problem and\nthat accommodating monetary and/or fiscal\npolicy would surely contribute toward estab-\nlishing why we observe J-curves.\n\n\u00c0 second proposition that has to be ques-\n",

Vet neither\nseems to me to give a satisfactory answer to\nthe question posed for this session. The trees\nalmost completely obscure the forest.\n\nWould it be apparent to anyone reading\nthese papers that twenty-five years ago the\nbulk of professional economists regarded\n\"money\" as simply a five letter word de-\nscribing an utterly passive magnitude that\nresponded to other economic forces but had\nnegligible independent influence; that they\ntook it for granted that inflation and unem-\nployment alike could be relegated to a be-\nnighted historical past, if only policyholders\ncould be persuaded to adopt the new Key-\nnesian insights about fiscal policy; that the\nonly role assigned to monetary policy in this\nhappy scenario was to keep interest rates\nlow; and that the quantity theory was of\ninterest only to historians?\n\nThe past twenty-five years have seen a\nrevolution in professional thinking. The\nrevolution is well described in the title of this\nsession as a \"'rediscovery,\" for indeed, as I\nshall note shortly, it is far harder to specify\nwhat 'we\"\u2014 meaning the profession of eco-\nnomics\u2014have learned in the past two hun-\ndred years than what we have learned in the\npast twenty-five vears.\n\nTo try to delineate the forest, the major\ncomponents of that rediscovery have been:\n\n1) The interest rate is the price of credit, not\nof money. The price of money is the in-\nverse of the price level. Monetary au-\nthorities can control directly the quantity\nof money and therebv determine the\nlong-term rate of inflation.\n\n2) Nominal interest rates must be sharply\ndistinguished from real interest rates. One\nimplication is that while more rapid\nmonetary growth may lower interest rates\nin the short run, it will raise them in the\nlong run as it produces inflation which is\nembedded in interest rates.\n",

When re-\nduced to testable propositions, quite differ-\nent hypotheses come up with the same equa-\ntion and therefore cannot be tested against\neach other. However, one result of Darby's\npaper is new. This is the very low value of\nbeta, and hence the very long lag in the\nformation of permanent income. But as dis-\ncussed below the evidence for this is not\nvery strong.\n\nA second problem with time series re-\ngression tests is that many quite arbitrary\ndecisions inevitably have to be made and\npoor proxies have to be used. For example,\nDarby simplifies by treating the desired\nstock of durables as proportional to per-\nmanent income. But why should the income\nelasticity of durables be equal to unity?\nSecond, Darby explains the inclusion of the\nmoney stock as representing an allowance\nfor a portfolio adjustment process. But why\nconfine a portfolio adjustment process to\nmoney; why not include savings and loan\nShares, etc.? Third, the inclusion of the\nmoney stock creates a problem of reverse\ncausation since an increase in consumption,\nby raising interest rates, is likely to cause\nthe Federal Reserve and the banks to raise\nthe money stock. (Obviously, the transitory\nincome variable and the interest rate also\nhave a potential for \"reverse causation.\"\")\nFourth, the interest rate variable is mea-\nsured badly. As Milton Friedman has rightly\ninsisted, the observed interest rate on securi-\nties is a very poor measure of the expected\nreal rate of return which households can ob-\ntain from holding a wide variety of non-\nmoney assets. (Darby uses a bond rate as his\nmeasure of the interest rate. A composite\ndeposit rate on bank time deposits, savings\nand loan shares, mutual savings bank de-\nposits, and consumer loan rates would have\nbeen better since, until recently at least,\nhouseholds did not buy bonds to any signifi-\ncant extent.) Fifth, since quality improve-\nments have probably been more important\nfor durables than for nondurables, the rela-\ntive price variable is probably measured\n",

                    "TuHoMAS Mavzn, University of California,\nDavis: Michael Darby's paper is a very com-\npetent piece of work. He uses standard econo-\nmetric techniques in a sophisticated way,\nbut still I am uneasy about his results. This\nis so primarily because I feel uneasy about\nthe validity of our standard techniques, not\nbecause of the particular way he uses them.\n\nOne difficulty with standard techniques\nappears when one asks what is new about\nDarby's results: In what way do they differ\nfrom the standard view? His use of both\npermanent income and transitory income\nis fairly standard bv now. Moreover, his\nfinding that the coefficient of permanent in-\ncome is about twice the coefficient of trans-\nitory income is consistent with the bulk of\nthe empirical evidence. Specifically, it is\nconsistent not only with a modified per-\n: manent income theory such as Darby pre-\nsents, but also with a theory intermediate\nbetween the permanent income theory and\nthe older theories, a theory which has house-\nholds consuming both out of permanent\nand transitory income directly. Similarly,\nhis inclusion of the money stock and the\ninterest rate in the consumption function is\nalso consistent with previous work. To be\nsure, the relative price variable is normally\nnot used, but since it has the wrong sign, it\nreally does not belong in Darby's function\neither. Finally, his 4 variable has been used\nby Hendrik S. Houthakker and Lester D.\nTavlor.\n\n'This raises the question whether the de-\ntour via the consumption of durable services\nis really needed. Darby could have written\nout the function he actually tested directlv,\nbased on a general theory of household be-\nhavior. It can be derived from a much\nbroader range of theories than the permanent\nincome theory. For example, in Darby's\nmodel the transitory income term enters as a\npart of the permanent income theory be-\ncause some so-called nondurables are ac-\ntually durables. But one could also say that\nhouseholds consume directly out of transi-\ntory income. Hence, one can accept Darby's\nequation without accepting his permanent\n",

I shall try\nmy best to avoid the temptation of being less\nthan impartial; and I hope that any preju-\ndice on my part will not be prejudged.\n\nI also happen to have some reservations\nabout comparing and contrasting the prob-\nlems and performance of these two countries.\nThere are, of course, similarities between the\ntwo in terms of their enormous land and\npopulation masses and the historical burden\nof long foreign exploitation. However, each\nhas been operating under a different political\nsystem; besides, their record of economic\ngrowth is so brief as to be more an experi-\nment defying attempts at prediction rather\nthan a sustained experience. Moreover, the\nproblems of each are staggering. Perhaps my\nfamiliarity with the mind-boggling Indian\nscenario breeds some caution. The Chinese\nscene is equally complex with the additional\nhandicap of lack of reliable information on\nChina.\n\nWith these introductory remarks, I pro-\nceed to comment on how successfully these\ncourageous men accomplish the task of con-\ntrasting Chinese and Indian economic per-\nformance and explaining the sources of their\ndifferential achievements.\n\nI begin with Richman's paper. He provides\na conceptual framework for explaining the\nbetter economic performance of China in\nterms of its superior social development. The\nsequence of argument proceeds as follows:\nthe higher the level of social development,\nthe greater the willingness and ability of the\npeople to work *hard and effectively on a\nnational scale for goals that inspire them\";\nas a consequence, economic growth is more\nrapid.\n\nSocial development, in turn, can be iden-\ntified in terms of progress not only in educa-\ntion, health, social mobility, and so on but\nalso in the attitudes, values, motivation, and\n",

Instead,\nRichman picks out certain criteria of social\ndevelopment, such as level of education,\nwork motivation, social mobility, income\nequality, employee participation, standard\nof health, etc., and then identifies them\nquantitatively for both China and India. For\nexample, high labor productivity and low\nabsenteeism indicate superior motivation;\nthen again, educational and career oppor-\ntunities are suitable indexes of social mobility\nand so on.\n\nOn the basis of tenuous observations, he\nconcludes that on almost all counts of social\ndevelopment China has done better than\nIndia; therefore, by inference from his model,\nChinese economic performance is superior to\nIndian; and he proceeds to assert that there\nare quite a few economic indicators which\nsupport this claim.\n\nI have reservations both about the ana-\nlytical framework and its actual application\nto China.\n\nTo begin with the conceptual shortcomings\nof the framework: a heightened level of social\nawareness with its attributes can lead to\nfaster economic growth if its total contribu-\ntion to the growth process is positive.

                    "ARTHUR W. WRrGHT, University of Massa-\nchusetts: Both the Gerard Brannon and the\nMalcolm Gillis-Charles McLure papers illus-\ntrate the point that we cannot deal ade-\nquately with the taxation of natural re-\nSources in isolation from alternative, nontax\npolicy measures. By recognizing this point,\nBrannon is able to put energy taxes in proper\nperspective and to suggest interesting inter-\npretations of nontax policies (e.g., the oil\nimport quota). In contrast, by focusing on\ntax incidence in isolation from other, more\nbasic policy issues, Gillis and McLure do not\nfully exploit the potential of their topic.\n\nIt is appropriate to begin the discussion of\nBrannon's paper by indicating substantial\nagreement with his treatments of (1) the per-\ncentage depletion allowance and the ex-\npensing of \"intangible\" drilling and dry-hole\ncosts; (2) the price controls on domestic\ncrude oil and natural gas; and (3) the pro-\nposed loss-guarantees for high-cost alterna-\ntives to OPEC oil. There is less agreement on\nforeign tax credits.\n\nTo me, the most interesting part of Bran-\nnon's paper is his treatment of a windfall\nprofits tax on oil and natural gas. As a pre-\nliminary, we can improve upon his definition\nof **windfall income.\" According to that defi-\nnition, firms would realize windfall profits\nonly when they were operating along the\nperfectly inelastic portions of their supply\nschedules. In fact, windfall profits can be\nsaid to arise from any unexpected increase in\nmarket price. The quarrel here is more than\nsemantic: under Brannon's definition, noth-\ning varies but the distribution of the windfall\nrents, whereas under the broader definition\nattempts by governments to appropriate\nthose rents may affect market price and\nquantity\u2014that is, the efficiency of resource\nallocation. Unless we want to discuss Alfred\nMarshall's market period\" case (and no\nbureaucracy, let alone a legislature, could\never move \u00edast enough to appropriate\nmarket-period rents), in the interesting cases\nboth demand and supply will have finite,\nnonzero slopes.\n\nThe windfall profits excise tax measure\n",

                    "proposed by the Treasury, which Brannon\napparently favors, would raise price and re-\nduce quantity compared to the no-tax equi-\nlibrium. In the familiar story, the resulting\ntax revenues and deadweight loss would be\nborne by both consumers and producers.\nWhen the Treasury first mooted its proposal,\nthe OPEC cartel and the Arab embargo had\nalready inflicted upon consumers some dead-\nweight loss and transfers of wealth to foreign\nand domestic producers; the Treasury's ex-\ncise tax would compound both the ineffi-\nciency and the redistribution of income away\nfrom consumers. The tax revenues could, of\ncourse, be rebated to consumers, as Brannon\nrecommends, but the added inefficiency\nwould remain.\n\nBy the rough numerical estimates pre-\nsented at the end of section II of Brannon's\npaper, consumers could be more than com-\npensated out of tax revenues for the increase\nin price resulting from the excise tax. This\nresult is, however, specific to the particular\nassumptions made in the calculation (which\nmay be suggestive but is too rough to serve\nas the basis of a major policy initiative).\n\nBrannon advocates gradually phasing out\na windfall profits tax according to a definite\ntimetable; however, he dismisses too cava-\nlierly the possibility that such a scheme\nwould induce destabilizing intertemporal\nshifts in supply. It would be worth exploring\nwhether uncertain timing of tax reductions\nmight not prevent or discourage such shifts.\n(This is not an argument for the Brownian\nmotion of statements and retractions which\npasses for energy \"policy\" in the Ford Ad-\nministration.) Interestingly, it would also be\nworth exploring whether an announced time-\ntable for phasing out percentage depletion\nand the special expensing provisions for oil\nand gas corporate income might not give an\nadded incentive to produce more petroleum\nnow, thereby easing the present burden on\nconsumers azd cutting windfall profits in the\nindustry.

It is assumed that\nthe characteristics possessed by a good or a\ncombination of goods are, in principle at\nleast, objective and the same for all con-\nsumers. The utility derived by the con-\nsumer, on the other hand, is subjective and\ndepends on his preference function. Briefly,\ngiven the units of measurement any good\ncontains the same amount of any character-\nistic for all consumers, but each consumer\nmay derive a different level of utility from\nconsuming those characteristics.

Since economic re-\nforms in the USSR and many other socialist\ncountries were initiated in the early 1960's,\nthere have been a few studies analyzing the\nbonus schemes in Soviet-type economies.\n(See S. Gindin, Michael Ellman, Michael\nKeren, James A. Mirrlees, and Wayne A.\nLeeman.) The trend toward profit-related\nbonus schemes has been continuing in social-\nist economies, except China's industrial\nsector which completely dropped the bonus\nas a revisionist deviation.\n\nThere are two basic problems involved:\none is the bonus which induces a greater\neffort than the normal exertion, and the\nother is the tautness (or slackness) of the\nplan that discourages (or encourages) the\neffort. Gindin noted the effort-inducing ef-\nfect of the bonus and the fear of a potentially\nhigher new plan target when the current\nplan is fulfilled or overfulfilled. His model\nexplains the managers! and planners! con-\nflicting interest, which is inherent in a\nplanned economy.' Leeman discussed some\nbonus formulae in a Soviet-type economy.\nHe noted that if the reward were given only\nto the fulfillment of physical output targets,\nmanagers would tend to ignore the volume,\nand if the reward were based on the volume,\nthen managers would be indifferent to plans.\n\n* Professor of economics, Colorado State University.\nThis work was supported by a National Science Founda-\ntion grant to the University of Minnesota. I wish to\nthank Leonid Hurwicz for support and encouragement.\nI am also grateful to an anonymous referee who pro-\nvided comments for the revision of this paper but I re-\ntain sole responsibility for its content.\n\n! Gindin's utility function, pp. 147-48, is\n\nu \u2014 f(B, Ts, To) where B \u2014 g(T, X)\n$6 2e PB,\n3B\n\nwhere B is the bonus. X the output, 7, the current\ntarget, and 7,, the new target, are related to the cur-\nrent target as T, \u2014 To4-t(X \u2014 Ty).\n"

J.\nMishan (1968) and a subsequent exchange\nbetween Mishan (1971) and Melvin Krauss\nand David Winch have clarified to some ex-\ntent ambiguities in Harry Johnson's famous\nattempt to resuscitate consumer's and pro-\nducer's surplus measures of gains from trade.\nNevertheless, a crucial issue remains ob-\nscure. Mishan claims that Johnson's identi-\nfication of the welfare effects of a tariff as an\nexcess of consumer's surplus loss over pro-\nducer's surplus gain is arbitrary with respect\nto concept, hence improper. All that can be\nidentified is a net loss, which is measured\npurely in terms of consumer's surplus. In the\nparticular case of two goods, Mishan's objec-\ntion reduces to denying any significance to\nthe area in back of the general equilibrium\nsupply function. Krauss and Winch side\nwith Johnson, but unconvincingly. The main\nproblem is that, though all writers deal in\ngeneral equilibrium terms, their arguments\nare shackled by the use of the ambiguous sur-\nplus concepts. The purpose of this note is to\npresent the gains from trade measurement\nproblem in a consistent general equilibrium\nframework. The measure of the gains from\ntrade attained is very similar to Johnson's:\nthe net gain (measured correctly by all) is a\ndifference between a change in income from\nproduction and a change in income from the\nincome effect of price changes in consump-\ntion. Both sources of gain (or loss) are evalu-\nated through their impact on social welfare,\nbut the identification of the components of\nthe net gain (loss) by source is natural in\nterms of the decision problem facing the\ngeneral equilibrium economy. In the two-\ngood case analyzed in the exchange, the area\nin back of the general equilibrium supply\nfunction measures the change in income from\nproduction and thus has a very useful inter-\npretation.

Trenery Dolbear\nand by Talbot Page and John Ferejohn in\nthis issue of the Review reemphasize an im-\nportant point concerning the achievement of\na Pareto optimum via constant per unit\ntaxes. In my original paper I intended to\nbring out two points: 1) to set down a set of\nsuff\u00fccient conditions under which the con-\nstant per unit taxes or subsidies envisioned\nin traditional discussions of  Pigouvian\nschemes would correspond to a Pareto opti-\nmal outcome for an economy; and 2) to\nformally introduce *'externality technologies\"\ninto a model framework (Page and Ferejohn\nhave referred to these by what is perhaps a\nmore apt phrase ''damage functions\").\n\nAs with any results developed on sufficient\nconditions, the assumptions about convexity\nare stronger than necessary to obtain the\ntheoretical results that I stated, but they are\nnot irrelevant if one actuallv contemplates\ncalculation. All algorithms which might be\nemployed in solving a particular applied\nproblem seek a solution by various myopic\ngropings which are assured of finding a\nglobally optimal solution only under rather\nstringent convexity conditions. The pos-\nsibilitv of nonconvexity raised by Page and\nFerejohn here, and earlier by Mark Pauly\nwhen he alluded to nonconstant per unit\ntaxes or subsidies, may raise the most diffi-\ncult application issues. Having the external-\nity prices vary with quantity does not by\nitself raise difficulties since one could ap-\nproximate non-linear pricing functions by\nlinear segments which had constant per unit\ncharges over each segment, but assuring that\nsuch problems do not have a multiplicity of\nlocal optima is a different matter.\n\nIn *Externalities as Commodities,\" I did\nnot discuss the issue of lump sum transfers\nsince this point was covered by E. J. Mishan,\np. 527, but the reemphasis by Dolbear, his\n\"starting point,\" and by Page and Ferejohn,\n\n* Associate professor, University of California,\nBerkeley.\n"

                    "ing the differences in men's sense of justice or, more precisely,\nby assimilating the differences in men's exercise of the morally\nand politieally relevant aspects of the moral virtue of justice, to\ndifferences in skill, he ean relegate the question of how such skills\nare to be assessed and aeknowledged to the workings of the differ-\nenee prineiple (to the market and related institutions). But the\nmarket is an even less satisfactory mechanism for assessing men's\njustice than is the ballot box (354, 359-62). It is not designed to\ntake account of moral or politieal virtue, merit, or desert. Noris\nthe market the proper mechanism for promoting, acknowledging,\nand rewarding men's justice. \"The market is designed to establish\nentitlements to unequal shares of income and wealth; and ineome\nand wealth are neither appropriate nor just acknowledgments of\nmen's virtue, any more than they are appropriate or just bases\nfor power, authority, and prestige. As Hobbes warned, the\nmarket will find *^[a] learned and uncorrupt judge is much worth\nin time of peace, but not so much in war\" (Lev. L10). Rawls\nechoes that warning when he insists that a person's moral worth\ndoes not fluetuate with the market for his skills (311). \"The reason\nwhy it does not, however, cannot be that all are, as he claims,\nequal in moral worth (312). For as we have seen, if they may be\nsaid to be equal in moral worth, they ean be said to be so only on\neondition that all forms of moral exeellenee above and beyond the\nbare desire to obey the laws of one's just society are treated not\nas eontributing to moral worth, but as mere skills. \"The decision\nto treat them in this way is, most immediately, a consequence of\nthe decision to reduce questions about just inequalities of power,\nprestige, and authority to questions about just inequalities of in-\ncome and wealth. 'That decision may have been justified on prae-\niieal grounds when it was a matter of redressing or compensating\nfor the unjust inequalities that result from morally irrelevant\ncontingencies of nature and nurture. Tt ceases to be justified in a\nsociety where such eontingencies have ceased to play a significant\nrole: in Rawls! just and well-ordered society where everything\nconspires to free men from the empire of fate and where, there-\nfore, differences in moral character may be viewed as also differ-\nenees in moral merit and desert, and allowed their rightful place\nin the public life.\n",

In particular,\nI shall focus on his more difficult comparison\n\u2014the one between his two principles of jus-\ntice and a variant of these in which the dif-\nference principle is replaced by the principle\nthat \"social and economic inequalities are to\nbe adjusted so as to maximize average utility\nconsistent with fair equality of opportunity.\"\nRawls presents several reasons which, he\nbelieves, support the maximin criterion in\nthis comparison. I would like to question\nwhether, upon further examination, these\narguments provide as strong a case as he\nsuggests they do. The paper by Dennis\nMueller and the one by James Buchanan and\nWinston Bush can be viewed as bearing in\nimportant, though different, ways on the\narguments Rawls puts forth in making his\ncomparison.\n\nRawls's first argument is based upon the\n\"very considerable normal risk aversion\"\nindividuals will display in the original posi-\ntion. He grants that, because of the crucial\nnature of the choice faced in that position,\nthe utility criterion may not differ much\nfrom maximin, and he cites the result that\nthe standard of utility approaches maximin\nas risk aversion increases without limit.\nNevertheless, he writes, *I assume that,\nbased on considerations of risk aversion\nalone, there is a significant difference be-\ntween the two criteria.\" But that is all the\nrisk aversion argument comes to: an as-\nsumption.\n\nSecond, Rawls argues that '*much less\ninformation is needed to apply the maximin\ncriterion.\" While maximin may require less\ninformation than average utility maximiza-\ntion, I think the difference is smaller than\nRawls suggests. First, the same group may\nnot be least favored under each possible ar-\nrangement so that under maximin one has\nthe considerable task of determining the least\nfavored group under all alternative arrange-\nments. Second, this task requires one to\nmeasure the utility of each group and com-\n",

Third, the method\nof estimating the overall balance of gains\nand losses in the average utility setting is\nreadily at hand since it has been agreed that\nthe goal is maximization of the average of\nthe utilities. Rawls states that in applica-\ntions the average utility principle \"leaves so\nmuch to judgment that some may reasonably\nclaim that the gains of one group outweigh\nthe losses of another, while others may\nequally reasonably deny it.\" It would seem\nthat such reasonable differences of opinion\ncould also arise under maximin in determin-\ning which is the least favored group. This\nsuggests that a real cost under both of the\ntwo sets of principles Rawls is comparing is\nthe cost of resolving such differences of opin-\nion. Or does his statement that everyone\nreasons in the same wav exclude this prob-\nlem? If it does, then surely it must also apply\nto resolving the disputes to which he alludes\nin the average utilitarian context.\n\nThis brings me to the largest part of the\ninformation required in the contractarian\nsetting being considered\u2014information needed\nfor both maximin and the average utilitarian\nrule. It is the information to which Mueller\ndevotes his discussion\u2014knowledge which\nenables the individual \"to place himself in\nthe position of those actually or potentially\nsubject to the rules... knowledge of those\nwith whom he might exchange places.\"\nMueller discusses the costs of achieving such\nknowledge, the tradeoff between acquiring\nknowledge at the intensive and knowledge at\nthe extensive margin, and the fact that for-\nmation of the polity does not necessarily di-\nrectly contribute to the kind of knowledge\nand understanding needed for a just society.\nThe fact that this major information require-\nment is common to Rawls's two principles\nand the variant with which he is comparing\nthem also narrows the difference between the\ninformational demands of the two ap-\nproaches.\n\nHaving mentioned Mueller's ideas, let me\ndigress for a moment to consider the para-\n",

Thus I have considerable diffi-\nculty getting past Richard Musgrave's intro-\nduction. It is perfectly all right for Musgrave\nto address himself to *the incidence of a hy-\npothetical national tax.\" But itis not enough\nmerely to assert that local jurisdictional dif-\nferentials *are not central to the issue of pro-\ngression versus regression.\" Quite the con-\ntrary, I can imagine the development of an\nanalysis in which a uniform national tax\nturned out to be regressive while, within the\nsame analytical framework, a local tax with\nwide rate differentials proved to be progres-\nsive. At any rate, I believe that more needs\nto be made of the consequences of the avail-\nability, for capital and labor, of lower-tax\nalternative locations.\n\nWith respect to the property tax levied on\nindustrial property, Musgrave opts for par-\ntial forward shifting through the medium of\ncost-plus administered prices. But the taxed\nfirms will in many, if not most, instances be\nnational (or even multinational) in charac-\nter, producing any one product in plants in\nseveral localities, each with a different effec-\ntive property tax rate. \u00c1s a consequence,\nsome difficult questions are raised for this\nroute to analysis of incidence. Which prop-\nerty tax rate does the firm take into account\nin setting.its administered price? And what\nof the tax rates paid by those firms that are\nprice takers rather than price setters? The\ncase for forward shifting seems to me to be\nextremely weak. Clearly it can be only that\ntax rate that the price setter adds to his\ncosts that matters for forward shifting. The\nproperty tax paid by all other firms in the\nindustry cannot affect prices and presumably\nnot wages, so it becomes a profits tax, as does\n",

BRAzER, University of Michi-\ngan: Henry Aaron finds in the Harberger-\nMieszkowski approach a better theoretical\nfoundation than ever before for estimates of\nproperty tax incidence. The basis of Miesz-\nkowski's theoretical foundation consists of a\nfixed capital supply assumption and the as-\nsumption that industries are specific to par-\nticular taxing jurisdictions, while at the same\ntime capital, as well as labor, is perfectly\nmobile. Then, if one begins by assuming that\nthe property tax is a uniform national tax on\nall real capital (including land), the conclu-\nsion that it will be borne by owners of capital\nthrough a reduction in net returns on capital\nfollows. (It seems to me to be at least as\nplausible to assume that labor is in fixed sup-\nply while capital supply is yield-elastic, and\nconclude that the property tax reduces real\nwages.)\n\nIf one abandons the uniformity assump-\ntion and instead allows for local variations in\nthe tax rate, above and below the *'national\naverage,\" the tax will be found to produce\n\"excise tax\" effects. The high tax communi-\nties experience higher prices while the lower-\nthan-average tax rate communities enjoy\nlower than average prices. Thus, some house-\nholds gain qua consumers while others lose,\ndue to variations in local tax rates, but the\nproperty tax reduces net returns on capital\nby the amount levied. Thus the tax is as pro-\ngressive as the distribution of the ownership\nof capital, modified by the income distribu-\ntion of excise tax effects.\n\nSurely this analysis is just a bit trouble-\nsome. I do not know of any good reasons\nwhy many industries should be specific for\nvery long with respect to particular taxing\njurisdictions. And with capital perfectly\n(highly?) mobile, I should not expect either\nthe costs of capital or the prices of products\nto be higher in high-tax than in low-tax\njurisdictions (other things being equal).\nEven more elusive, to my mind at any rate,\nis the significance of the average rate of tax,\nonce the specificity of industries to given\njurisdictions is dropped.

Owzw, Stanford University:\nOur rebellious colonial forefathers seem to\nhave believed that the press must be kept\nindependent of government in order to avoid\ntyranny. Accordingly, the First Amendment\nsays that the government should not regu-\nlate the marketplace of ideas. Recent Su-\npreme Court decisions and long-standing\nFederal | Communications \u2014 Commission\n(FCC) policies have the opposite effect. The\nlaw now is that the government has a posi-\ntive obligation to ensure that the public is\n\"informed,\" largely by broadcasters acting\nunder government license as fiduciaries of\nthe public. According to the Court, there is\nno public right of access to the airwaves.\nThis paternalistic attitude is at variance with\nthe \"principle\" of the First Amendment,\neven though it is the current legal interpre-\ntation of the Amendment.\n\nThe principle of the First Amendment\npresumably is that there should be \"free-\ndom\" (from government) in the market-\nplace of ideas and in the expression of ideas.\nA plausible corollary is that there ought also\nto be freedom from private restraints in this\nmarket.\n\nThere is an interesting set of connections\nbetween freedom and the economist's notion\nof competition. In a sense, perfect competi-\ntion is the antithesis of freedom (for pro-\nducers), since each economic agent is faced\nwith a choice set containing only one alter-\nnative which permits survival. Monopolists\nare not constrained by this survival mecha-\nnism if they are protected by entry barriers\nand from take-over bids and accordingly\nhave some freedom to make different choices\nconsistent with survival. But the First\nAmendment principle is concerned not only\nwith the production of information and ideas\nbut also with their consumption, and here it\nis clear that greater competition (or at least\na greater number of producers) is likely to\nlead to greater freedom of choice. Product\ndifferentiation in this market is not only in-\nevitable but desirable.\n\nThe industrial organization of the mass\ncommunications media is of greater than the\n",

                    "usual importance because of its implications\nfor freedom of expression. Actually, we know\nquite a lot about media structure and tech-\nnology. Most cities have only one daily\nnewspaper firm, and this circumstance is ex-\nplained by the tension between economies of\nscale in printing and distributing newspapers\nand the product differentiation which re-\nsults from monopolistic competition in satis-\nfying varied tastes and a geographically dis-\npersed population. Most consumers have ac-\ncess to three or more television stations and\ndozens of radio stations, and this is explained\nby the FCC's spectrum allocation policies.\nThere are three television networks, and this\nis explained both by the FCC'sspectrum poli-\ncles and by the economies of scale of distrib-\nuting collective goods (programs) over large\naudiences. It seems generally to be true that\nin the fransmission stage of most mass media\nthere are significant economies of scale, and\nit also seems generally to be true that the\nowners of this stage (broadcast licensees,\nnewspaper publishers) also control (or are\nlegally compelled to control) access to their\nmedia, and thus the selection of messages.\nIn this way, the industrial structure of the\ntransmission media affects freedom of ex-\npression by producers of ideas (who are\nmostly atomistic) and the freedom or range\nof choice of consumers of ideas: the econom-\nics of this structure dictate fewness and\nmarket power for the gatekeepers of the\nmedia. By contrast, some transmission me-\ndia with significant degrees of concentration\n\u2014for example, the telephone company and\nthe post office\u2014do not control the content of\nmessages.\n\nThe standard liberal approach to the\nproblem of market power and fewness in the\nmedia is, first, to increase the '\u00c1number of\nvoices\" by a policy of deconcentration, sub-\nsidization of new entrants, and increased ac-\ncess, and, second, to increase the vigor of\ngovernment regulation. Thus one hears of\nproposals to break up joint newspaper-\ntelevision interests, to bring antitrust suits\nagainst newspaper mergers and newspaper\nchains, to increase funding for public broad-\n",

Chinese attacks then were\ndirected against the revisionist clique in\nYugoslavia ^ while Russian propaganda\nblasted Albania. My topic raises some im-\nportant policy issues and some subtle but\nsignificant points of theory which apply most\nimportantly neither to little Albania nor to\nthe miniscule portfolio of the American Eco-\nnomic Association (A EA), but rather to the\ngreat bulk of private colleges and universities\nin the United States, and a number of the\npublic institutions as well. In a broader\nsense we come to grips with the basic con-\ncepts of income and wealth, welfare, and\nintergenerational allocation and optimaliza-\ntion.\n\nThe current problem of endowment in-\ncome of educational institutions had its\nmajor and modern genesis in the 1950's.\nImmediate needs in terms of faculty salaries\nand educational services generally seemed\nenormous. Yet trustees and some adminis-\ntrations of private universities revealed a set\nof preferences which appeared to some of us\nmost appropriate for managers of an invest-\nment trust. In many cases they had acquired\nportfolios including substantial, if insuffi-\ncient, numbers of low payout \"growth\"\nstocks. But those persons accounting for\nuniversity resources and significantly in-\nfluencing the expenditures were willing to\ncount as income to be spent for current edu-\ncational purposes only dividends and inter-\nest and ignored capital gains. A university,\nit seemed, could improve by leaving the next\ngeneration a higher endowment than the\namount it received, not by spending to leave\na higher quality faculty, a greater investment\nin research, or whatever else a college and\nuniversity was supposed to be about.\n\nSome enlightened university  adminis-\ntrators, such as W.

An AEA\nCommittee on Financial Investment Policies,\nunder the impeccable chairmanship of Mil-\nton Friedman (and including the present\nauthor) recommended and secured adoption\nby the Association of a formula which made\nits \"income from equities in each year equal\nto dividends received in that year plus one-\nthird of market appreciation of that year\n(adjusted for price-level change) plus one-\nthird of adjusted appreciation in the pre-\nceding year, plus one-third of adjusted ap-\npreciation in the second preceding year\"\n(see Amer. Econ. Rev., Proc., May 1969, 2,\n586).\n\nNow, as Donald Nichols points out, while\nthere is merit in including some portion of\nreal capital gains in income, it is not clear\nthat the AEA formula, which counts in\ncurrent income a simple average of real\ncapital gains on equity over a three-year\nperiod and real capital gains of the current\nperiod on bonds, is universally appropriate.\nFollowing Sir John Hicks, if one defines\nincome as what one can consume during a\nperiod and still be as well off at the end of\nthe period as at the beginning, and if being\nas well off\" relates to expecting at the end of\nthe week to have as much future \"welfare\"\nas was expected at the beginning of the\nperiod, the amount of capital gains which\ncan be consumed without reducing expected\nutility in the future depends upon an inter-\ntemporal utility function. If the intertem-\nporal utility function is maximized by con-\nsuming indefinitely at a constant rate, then\nno part of capital gains due to reductions in\nthe rate of discount of expected future re-\nceipts can be included in income. For exam-\nple, if a portfolio consists of a million consols\neach paying one dollar per year to the holder\nforever a change in the market rate of inter-\nest or discount from, say, 10 percent to 8\npercent, thus raising the value of the port-\nfolio from $10 million to $12.5 million has no\neffect whatsoever on the future stream of\n",

That\ntheory predicts no necessary relationship be-\ntween consumption and income receipts at\nany age, but Thurow demonstrates a strong\nrelationship and shows that income and con-\nsumption expenditure both peak in the age\ninterval 45-54. 'Thurow's principal explana-\ntion for his finding is that credit market re-\nstrictions prevent consumers from borrowing\nas much against their future income as they\ndesire at the going interest rate. As long as\nincome tends to increase with age, and dis-\ncounted future income cannot be fully trans-\nferred at the borrowing rate, a consumer's\neffective net worth increases with age which\ncauses increasing consumption with age.\nBased on this argument, Thurow recom-\nmends government intervention into the\nconsumption loan market to allow for opti-\nmal adjustment of consumption.\n\nKeizo Nagatani explains the same facts by\nbuilding a model based on the uncertainty of\nfuture income.

KQ argue for including\nthe white ownership rate to control for *intermetropoli-\ntan variation in the relative cost of owner-occupied and\nrenter-occupied housing or differences in the timing of\nurban development\" (p. 271). Their statement does not\nindicate whether the coefficient in question should be\npositive or negative.\n\n? A model which could be thought to underlie the\nKQ study is a housing market segmented by race.\n"

            "found": "John McDonald's comment is a useful\nverification and extension of our earlier\nanalysis of the effects of racial discrimination\nin urban housing markets. In our paper we\ndemonstrated that black households have a\nlower probability of home ownership or pur-\nchase than otherwise comparable white\nhouseholds. We concluded that this differ-\nence results largely from ''supply restric-\ntions,\" re., a limited supply of units suitable\nfor home ownership within the ghetto and\nsubstantial impediments to the purchase of\nhomes outside the ghetto bv black house-\nholds.\n\nOur paper contained two empirical in-\nvestigations: a detailed analysis of the prob-\nability of home ownership and purchase,\nbased on a large sample of St. Louis house-\nholds, and an analysis of intermetropolitan\ndifferences in black and white home owner-\nship among 18 large metropolitan areas. The\nsecond of these two analvses was devised\nprimarily to test the supply restriction hy-\npothesis. In it the proportion of central city\nunits that are single family and the propor-\ntion of the SM.SA black population that re-\nside in the suburban ring were used to repre-\nsent these supply restrictions.\n\nIn his note, McDonald replicates our St.\nLouis analysis of homeownership using De-\ntroit data and correctly points out that part\nof the difference he obtains in black and\nwhite ownership probabilities may result\nfrom the \"fact that blacks have more diffi-\nculty obtaining mortgages on single family\nhouses.\" He then attempts to decompose the\nracial coefficient in our model into two com-\nponents: 1) a component due to difficulties\nin obtaining morgages, and 2) a component\ndue to our notion of supply restrictions. In\nhis first alternate model, he includes whether\nthe household lives in a single family unit\nas an explanatory variable (Equation (2),\n\n* Harvard University.\n"

Erroneous Use of Some Elasticities\n\nThe price elasticities of demand used by\nHayami and Peterson for the three food\ngrains and three feed grains create exag-\ngerated returns and highly sensitive benefit-\ncost ratios of meaningless dimensions for\npractical government decision making.

Using\ndata for 1963 they show that the average\nnominal wage rate for a sample of five north-\nern metropolitan areas is significantly greater\nthan such an average for five '*'southern\"\nmetropolitan areas. However, after the nom-\ninal wage figures are adjusted for differences\nin the cost of living in each of the ten areas,\nthis differential disappears. This result sur-\nvives the introduction of dummy variables\nto account for differences in industry com-\nposition, sex, color, and capital-labor ratio.\n\nIt seems almost unbelievable that earlier\nstudies of the wage differential have ignored\nregional differences in price levels, and\nCoelho and Ghali must be commended for\ncalling attention to this anomaly. However,\nthey have not proved the end of the North-\nSouth wage differential; at least not to the\nsatisfaction of this writer.

To produce interesting\nimplications about the behavior of the econ-\nomy, a theory of information has to make\nfairly strong assumptions about underlying\nbehavior. Look at what happens when one is\nunwilling to make these strong assumptions.\nTake the question: Is there underinvestment\nin technological information? Our theory of\ninformation has advanced to the point we\ncan assert: We do not know. (It is some com-\nmentary on where we started that this is,\nindeed, an advance. The serious job of\ndetermining which of the alternative theories\nis behaviorally more significant has not even\nbeen begun.\n\nWhen the theorist does make strong as-\nsumptions about behavior, it is crucial that\nthat theory be tested to see if those assump-\ntions are acceptable or not. Hirshleifer makes\nno distinction between tested and untested\ntheory in his paper. For example, Hirshleifer\nreports on Spence's work on job signalling\nwithout mentioning that it probably has\nlittle empirical relevance. The proposition\nthat education increases human skills makes\na lot more sense of the data than does\nSpence's hypothesis. The proposition suc-\ncessfully predicts the time series association\nbetween education and both the skill mix\nand the wage ratios of skilled and unskilled\nlabor. Spence's hypothesis does not.\n\nEven where signalling is empirically rele-\nvant, Spence's theory need not be applicable.\nThere is empirical support for the proposi-\ntion that much of advertising behaves as a\nsignal to consumers. This need not imply\noverinvestment in this kind of advertising,\nhowever. In the simple Spence model increas-\ning advertising expenditures in general\nwould simply increase proportionately the\nadvertising messages that each person re-\nmembered about any brand. Necessarily,\nthen, there would be overinvestment in\nadvertising, for this increased advertising\n",

                    "expenditure would have zero marginal social\nbenefit. But increases in advertising expen-\nditures do not produce that kind of result.\nFirst, additional advertising expenditures\nincrease the number of people who have\nheard about a brand. Second, they increase\nthe reliability of a consumer's sample esti-\nmate of what brands are most heavily adver-\ntised. Both of these effects produce a positive\nmarginal social benefit of increased advertis-\ning expenditures. A simple extension of\nSpence's work on signalling is not going to\ntell us whether there is overinvestment in\nadvertising or underinvestment.\n\nI have one more objection to Hirshleifer's\nsurvey. He gives the impression that Stigler's\noriginal search models have been effectively\nsupplanted by sequential decision models.\nWhile it is true that sequential decision pro-\ncedures usually lead decision makers to bet-\nter solutions than if they worked with a fixed\nsample size, that does not imply that the\nsimple sequential decision models are to be\npreferred over the simple fixed sample size\nmodels. For example, one has to use the lat-\nter model when investigating questions\nabout elasticities, since the simple sequential\ndecision models yield preposterous results\nfor that problem.\n",

                    "JEROME ROTHENBERG, Massachusetts In-\nstitute of Technology: The purpose of the\nSheshinski model is to throw light on the\noptimal size relationship between Central\nBusiness District and remainder of a metro-\npolitan ar\u00e9a. This question is posed in the\ncontext of a real cost of transportation be-\ntween the two areas, a cost that rises in the\npresence of traffic congestion.\n\nThe connection between congestion and\nthe optimal size relationship is as follows.\nCongestion at any point is a function of the\nsize of traffic flow relative to transport capac-\nity at that point. Congestion can always be\ndecreased by investing resources in additional\ntransportation capacity. In this model,\ntransport capacity is measured in terms of\nthe amount of land devoted to transporta-\ntion (as, for example, the number of high-\nway lanes). But any land used for transpor-\ntation cannot be used for business activity or\nhousing. In this model, the metropolitan\narea (SM.SA) is assumed to have a popula-\ntion and total number of jobs (total business\nactivity) that are fixed. Moreover, it is\nassumed that there are constant residential\nand business densities (i.e., land area per\nhousing 4nit and land area per job require-\nments). So the total land area required for\nthe assumed total housing and business uses\nis determined. Any further land used for\ntransportation adds to the total area of the\nSMSA. Thus, the absolute size of the city,\nand the relative sizes of Central Business\nDistrict (CB.D) and remainder depend on the\noptimal pattern of investment in transporta-\ntion capacity between the two sections.\n\nInvestment in transportation entails two\nelements of real cost: (1) the opportunity\ncost of any land used for urban purposes;\n(2) the larger is the city in total area, the\nlonger are work trips on the average and\ntherefore the greater is the average travel\ncost of such trips for given congestion.\n\nThus, the optimality problem can be for-\nmulated as: what is the optimal size of the\nCBD and the optimal size of the overall city\nresulting from the optimal program of high-\nway investment in the two parts of the city?\nOptimality is defined as that program of\n",

                    "D. Gare Jomnwsow, University of Chi-\ncago: Paul Schultz has succeeded in a very\ndifficult task\u2014to present a survey of re-\nsearch in an interesting and informative\nmanner. The resurgence of interest by econ-\nomists in population issues, including popu-\nlation growth, is one of a number of fairly\nrecent efforts to apply the tools of modern\neconomic analysis to a wider range of prob-\nlems than has been customary during most\nof this century. On the whole, it appears to\nme that economic analysis has stood up very\nwell under these efforts to extend its domain,\nin part perhaps because many outstanding\nresearch scholars have been involved in the\nvarious enterprises.\n\nThe results of little more than a decade's\neffort to increase our understanding of im-\nportant problems has been impressive and is\nwell documented by Schultz. The economic\nanalysis of population problems is, of course,\nnothing new. Many of the major figures in\neconomics during the nineteenth century\nconsidered the determinants of population as\none of the key issues in economic growth\u2014\nin the improvement of the well-being of\nman. Marshall was concerned with the con-\nnections between what we might now call\nthe quality of life, family size, and wage\nlevels. But during the twentieth century\neconomists gave little attention to popula-\ntion change, except for the discussion during\nthe Great Depression of the effects of slow or\nnegative population growth upon the main-\ntenance of full employment.\n\nEven though the recent efforts have im-\nportant antecedents, the careful develop-\nment of analytical frameworks and the care-\nful confrontation of the frameworks with the\navailable data represent an important break-\nthrough. The work described in the paper is\nnot only important as evidence of the sturdi-\nness of economic analysis, but also because\nour understanding of important problems is\nbeing improved. While I have no way of\nknowing what has motivated those who are\nnow applying economic analysis to the study\nof population growth, there can be no doubt\nthat the potential for practical application to\nsignificant issues of human welfare exists.

As he\nindicates, we are still not in a position to\nindicate what impact alternative policies,\neither in programs designed to directly affect\npopulation growth or those designed to influ-\nence such growth through more indirect\nmeans such as the level and distribution of\nincome, would have or have had upon fer-\ntility.\n\nFor almost two years I served as a member\nof the Commission on Population Growth\nand the American Future. While the Com-\nmission had an outstanding staff and several\nmembers of the Commission were outstand-\ning population scholars, it was all too clear\nthat the state of our understanding of the\nfactors that affect fertility was meager,\nindeed. The Commission's report was, in my\nopinion, an honest one. While the Commis-\nsion agreed that it was desirable to slow the\nrate of population growth in the United\nStates\u2014that slowing growth provided the\nopportunity to seek solutions for some of our\nmost pressing problems\u2014it did not believe\nthat the objective of slowing population\ngrowth was of such overriding importance\nthat a specific population size or growth rate\nshould be made into a national objective. In\nbrief, the Commission recommended policies\nthat it felt were desirable in their own right\nand which would assist families and indi-\nviduals in achieving their own desires and\naspirations with respect to a wide range of\nhuman activity, including reproduction. It\nalso thought that by providing more infor-\nmation and knowledge, by reducing pro-\nnatalist incentives that appear to exist, and\nby providing access to services and facilities\nthat would minimize unwanted child bear-\ning, that for a given set of values fertility\nwould be reduced. But there could be no\nguarantee that, within any given policy\nframework, values and preferences with\nrespect to the number of desired children\ncould not change and that birth rates might\nnot once again increase.\n\nThis is a long introduction to what I con-\nsider to be one of the great puzzles in fer-\n",

If population is\ncontrolled, as it eventually will be, the liv-\ning space constraint either disappears or is\ngreatly ameliorated. Concern with growth\nalone also rules out of initial consideration\nchanges in the quality of life. They can and\nshould be introduced later as a side effect of\nthe operation of the resource constraint or of\nefforts to escape it.\n\nThe second assumption is that the scope of\nthe inquiry must initially be global, not\nlocal, regional, or national. The operation of\na localized resource constraint has no signifi-\ncance under conditions of perfect mobility of\ncapital and labor and their functional equiv-\nalent, freedom of interregional trade. Man-\nmade barriers to mobility and trade often\nblock efforts to escape from localized con-\nstraints, but, because they are manmade,\neither they can be removed or their conse-\nquences eliminated. If neither step is taken,\nthe barriers become the constraint, for in\ntheir absence no resource constraint would be\nfelt until some global limit had been reached.\nHence, we must initially adopt a global view.\n\nThirdly, we make the Ricardian assump-\ntions that resources are expansible, that\nthere is a celeris paribus tendency for their\neconomic quality to decline as growth pro-\nceeds, and that this tendency is exacerbated\nby depletion. That is, we postulate that a\nresource constraint, if effective, will show up\nas diminishing returns to scale. While we\nrecognize that there may be some non-\nsubstitutable resource which: is absolutely\nlimited, absolutely essential for human life,\nand absolutely certain to be exhausted if eco-\nnomic growth continues, no such resource\nhas yet been identified. Pending such identi-\nfication we ignore this possibility.\n\nFinally, we assume that the substitution\npossibilities, existing and yet to be devised,\nwhich Rosenberg has emphasized and illu-\ntrated, provide systematic escapes from or\nameliorations of diminishing returns to\nscale.\n",

Because I agree with\nnearly everything the papers say, my re-\nmarks can best deal with what they do not\nsay, and specifically with this implicit ques-\ntion. Before stating the question, however,\nlet me try to justify it.\n\nNeoclassical microtheorists have consis-\ntently treated natural resources as a fixed\nfactor and diminishing returns as an inevi-\ntable consequence of the law of factor propor-\ntions. Growth economists, on the other hand,\nhave merged natural resources with capital,\nthus endowing them with manmade wealth's\nattribute of indefinite expansibility. Both\nmethods foreclose further analysis, the one\nby imposing absolute rigidity, the other by\nruling out the possibility of a constraint.\nConservation economists, though attempting\nto steer a course between these extremes,\nhave become entoiled in capital theory and\nhave had great difficulty in escaping its nar-\nrow confines, even when they have tried,\nwhich is not every often. Noneconomic con-\nservationists, on the other hand, customarily\nignore the relevance of economizing criteria\nbut, having failed to develop alternative cri-\nteria, they tend to deal with problems of\nnatural resource management on an ad hoc\nbasis, virtually eliminating the possibility of\ngeneralization. The **new conservationists,\"\nit is fair to say, are attempting to escape the\nconstrictions of these several approaches.'\n\nTo deal with the problem of natural re-\nSource constraints on economic growth, it is\nnecessary to be precise concerning the nature\nof the hypothesized constraint and its ex-\npected consequences. Hence, certain defin-\ning and limiting assumptions and postulates\nmust be specified. These can be relaxed later\nin order to lower the level of abstraction or\ntake account of empirical realities.\n\nThe first assumption is that the opposition\nwith which we are concerned is that between\neconomic growth as a purely quantitative\n",

The great work in this second tradi-\ntion, which dominated scholarship on vot-\ning in the 1950's and 1960's, is The American\nVoter by Angus Campbell, Philip E. Con-\nverse, Warren E. Miller, and Donald E.\nStokes. Its main theme is that people vote\nfor a candidate because they are identified,\nmostly for accidental and nonrational rea-\nsons, with the candidate's party. In its anal-\nysis of the behavior of voting, rational cal-\nculations of advantage and even so tenuously\nrational forces as ideology were deempha-\nsized, indeed, were almost wholly ignored.\n\nDespite the dominance of the nonrational\nor antirational tradition, there were a few\nwriters who clung to the notion that voters\nare rational or utility-maximizing human\nbeings. Anthony Downs's Aw Economic\nTheory of Democracy was based on this\nnotion. In a posthumous (1966) work, The\nResponsible Electorate, V. O. Key attempted\nto demonstrate that supposedly irrational\nparty identifications did, in fact, embody\nintuitive calculations of advantage. In a\npaper entitled **A Theory of the Calculus of\nVoting\" Ordeshook and I attempted to\naccount for both the decision to vote and the\ndecision not to vote in utility-maximizing\nterms.\n\nKramer's essay is, in my opinion, mainly\nsignificant as an effort to sustain the tradi-\ntion of rational choice. He speaks of the vote\nas a rational choice between alternatives and\nsays his study is an attempt to put that inter-\npretation to a 'more direct test than is\nreadily possible with survey data.\"\n\nThe trouble is that in order to conduct the\ntest Kramer specifies the goals that the\nrational voters ought to have. This is con-\ntrary, I think, to the sense of utility theory\nin which the goals of the behaving person\nshould be specified only by that person and\nnot by the observing social scientist. The\nscientist cannot be certain that his attribu-\ntion of goals makes sense and here indeed\nStigler makes a good case that it is impru-\n",

                    "WiLLIAM H. RIkKER, University of Roches-\nter: Gerald Kramer's essay, while super-\nficially concerned with an economic subject,\nis actually concerned with a much broader\nquestion of behavior, namely, \"Why do\npeople vote the way they do?\" George\nStigler, while critical of some of Kramer's\ndiscussion of economic subjects, actually\nstrengthens what Kramer has to say on the\nbroader question. In a discussion among pro-\nfessional economists, there is some danger\nthat the analyses of the economic subject will\nobscure the contributions of both writers to\nthe broader question of behavior in voting.\nAs a political scientist, my function on this\npanel is, I suppose, to try to keep track of\nthe main question and thus to compensate\nfor any professional parochialism that may\nbe manifested.\n\nIn order to begin to compensate, let me\nput Kramer's essay in the context of its\nintellectual tradition. When in the 1920's\nand 1930's social scientists first attempted to\ngeneralize about the reasons people vote the\nway they do, the usual method was an at-\ntempt to associate statistically the aggregate\nof votes with various observed and objective\nsocial conditions like the state of the econ-\nomy or the distribution of persons in various\ncensus categories (e.g., percent foreign born,\npercent urban, etc.). This is the method used\nby all the writers discussed by Kramer and\nStigler as well as by many others. It results in\npropositions like prosperity favors the ins\"\nor \"the Irish vote Democratic.\" But the tra-\ndition of this method was mostly extin-\nguished by the end of the 1940's, as indicated\nby the fact that, with one exception, all the\npredecessors mentioned by Kramer and\nStigler worked prior to 1950.\n\nReplacing the older method of association\nof actual votes and objective conditions was\na newer method of associating subjectively\nreported votes (or vote-intentions) with sub-\njectively estimated conditions. This new\nmethod derived from survey research and\nresulted in propositions about people voting\nfor a party because they identified with the\n",

RosERT HELLER, University of Hawaii:\nIlargely agree with Paul McCracken's anal-\nysis that policy makers are likely to accord a\nhigher priority to domestic economic objec-\ntives than to international ones. In general,\nthe attention paid to international economic\nproblems seems to stand in inverse propor-\ntion to the relative size of the foreign trade\nsector. This is a clear indication of the trade-\noffs faced by the policy makers in the various\ncountries. In nations with a foreign trade\nsector which is small compared to the domes-\ntic economy, foreign trade considerations are\nlikely to be accorded a low priority. The case\nis especially clear in the U.S. economy, where\nthe foreign trade sector is only about one-\ntwentieth as large as the domestic economy.\nTo sacrifice domestic goals for international\nobjectives would, in all likelihood, be a mis-\nguided policy.\n\nNevertheless, there are important gains to\nbe reaped from free international trade, and\nthe spectacular success of the European Eco-\nnomic Community is evidence enough on\nthat score. But a way has to be found to\ncushion the domestic economy more effec-\ntively against large disturbances originating\nin the foreign sector, especially if they are of\n\u00e0 short-term nature. Much of the recent\nunrest in international capital markets\nseems to have been caused by actions\ntaken by governmental authorities, and\nMcCracken's call for greater coordination of\neconomic policy actions is, therefore, well\nfounded.\n\nJohn Helliwell and Peter Kenen address\nthemselves to the future role of the dollar as\n\u00e0 reserve asset and, just as their physical\nlocations place them on opposite sides of the\nproblem, their intellectual vantage points\ndiffer accordingly. Helliwell presents us with\nstill another plan for reserve creation: the\nmulti-currency-bundle, or MCB. The most\nintriguing aspect of his MCB's is that they\ncan be created and destroyed at will by\nprivate individuals and official agencies. His\nMCPB's are something like an international\nmutual fund of currencies, which presumably\noffers a more attractive package than any\n",

But I believe that his pro-\nposal raises just as many problems as it sup-\nposedly solves.\n\nFor one, what is the incentive for indi-\nviduals or official agencies to put together\nMCB packages? Presumably, they will do so\nonly if they themselves stand to gain from\nthis effort. Potential purchasers would have\nto be willing to pay a higher price for the\nbundle than the value of the sum of the\npackaged currencies. But then again, any\npotential holder could do the packaging of\nthe MCEB's himself. In short, I fail to see the\nincentive for the creation of MCP's, unless a\ncompulsory element were to be added to\nHelliwell's proposal.\n\nSecond, any individual or country might\njust as well hold its preferred portfolio of\ncurrency reserves without first creating the\nartificial bundles. If it should be true that\nany other reserve asset composition should\nprove superior at a particular point in time,\nholders of MCB's will presumably break up\nthe unit and sell the less desirable currencies\nto obtain the optimal portfolio mix. This\nconstant incentive to create and destroy\nMCPB's will result in a great degree of insta-\nbility in the system, with private and official\nparticipants shifting between alternative\nreserve assets.\n\nThird, the creation of yet another reserve\nasset to hold alongside gold, foreign ex-\nchange, / MF drawing rights, and SDR's has\nno obvious advantages to my own mind.\nThis is especially true as M 'CB's do not con-\nstitute a net addition to reserves, but merely\nconsolidate bundles of foreign exchange\nreserves.\n\nWhere the MCB's may serve a useful pur-\npose is not as reserve assets, but as an inter-\nnational standard of value in terms of which\nother currency values may be defined, and\nwhich may serve as a pivot for exchange rate\nfluctuations. But there is no reason that the\npivot is actually traded itself, as the con-\ntinued use of the Guinea for quotation pur-\nposes shows.

EcKAUS, Massachusetts In-\nstitute of Technology: Both of the papers\npresented provide insight into the structure\nof one of the great economic puzzles of our\ntime: the operation of the economy of the\nPeople's Republic of China. In the process,\nboth papers also raise new questions. On\nbalance, however, the papers result in a net\nimprovement in our deficit in the balance of\nquestions and answers, not only because of\nthe new insights but also because asking bet-\nter questions will finally help to get better\nanswers.\n\nThe paper by Dwight H. Perkins provides\na brief history of the phases of Chinese plan-\nning and plan implementation.\n\nIt is enlightening to learn from Perkins\npaper about the problems which the People's\nRepublic of China has had in formulating\nand implementing consistent plans for de-\nvelopment. There is in some quarters a ten-\ndency to believe that such problems are spe-\nci\u00fcic to the market-oriented economies of\nmost of the less developed areas of the world.\nIt is, therefore, useful to learn about the suc-\ncessive extensive reorientations in planning\nand plan implementation which have oc-\ncurred in China.\n\nPerkins also raises but does not resolve\nsome of the central issues of planning and\nplan implementation in China. The issues\nare highlighted in a few sentences, quoted\nselectively below, but, I hope, without dis-\ntorting the meaning of the whole.\n\nPerkins tells us that: \"China, however,\nseems to have had a mechanism for correct-\ning major errors in direction without formal\nfive-year plans or markets . . . major bottle-\nnecks [do not] appear to have lasted very\nlong in particular industrial sectors. . . . Im-\npressionistic evidence, however, suggests that\nthe economic costs of reliance on annual and\nshorter term plans alone were not high.\"\n\nThus Perkins suggests that a mechanism\nhas been developed in China which can sup-\nplant both markets and direct controls for\nthe achievement of reasonably efficient re-\nsource allocation. The mechanism is de-\nscribed as follows: \"The explanation for this\n",

                    "absence of large numbers of important bot-\ntlenecks or of numerous white elephants in\nthe investment sphere (there were, of course,\nsome) would seem to lie in part with the fact\nthat China was a nearly closed economy with\na small foreign trade ratio and few sources of\nforeign assistance. ... With imports equal\nto about 2 percent of GN P, China had to\nfollow a balanced growth strategy and a fail-\nure to do so quickly manifested itself.\"\n\nPerkins is telling his story under space con-\nstraints which limit the amount of qualifica-\ntion which he can make. So perhaps these\ncomments may make a contribution by\npointing out some of the qualifications to his\nexplanation which are necessary. First of all,\nthe absence of \"large numbers of important\nbottlenecks or numerous white elephants\"\nis, at most, a test of the consistency of the\nplan. And the necessary emphasis on \"large\nnumbers\" and *numerous\" should be noted.\nSome bottlenecks, in the sense of limited\ncapacity in one sector constraining output in\nseveral other sectors, and the existence of\nsome amount of excess capacity do not them-\nselves rule out the possibility that plans are\nconsistent.\n\nSecondly, while consistency is a necessary\ncondition for overall efficiency, policymaking\nshould try to do better than that. Economic\nplans should do as well as possible in terms\nof some fundamental criteria, such as per\ncapita income or overall growth. There are\ninfinite number of feasible and consistent\nplans for an economy, but presumably these\nare not all equally desirable. The information\nwhich Perkins gives us, which is, presumably,\nall that is available, does not permit us to\njudge the degree to which the People's\nRepublic of China has been successful in\nachieving its own fundamental economic\ngoals.\n\nFinally the virtual self-sufficiency of the\nChinese economy to which Perkins ascribes\npart of the reason for its success in planning\nwould normally, and more correctly, I be-\nlieve, be considered a handicap rather than\nan asset.

The only\nsalvation that I could see was to avoid con-\ntending with them seriatim, and to see what\ncould be learned by considering them as a\ngroup. \u00cdt soon appeared that a good deal\ncould be learned and that this was a case\nwhere the whole was greater than the sum of\nits parts.\n\nBelievers in historical continuity keep re-\nminding us that the pollution problem is by\nno means new, and they are right. The con-\nservation movement in this country is a\nhundred years old; studies of urban waste-\nwater discharges go back to 1902 at least; the\nhistory of worry and action about the con-\ntamination of the air in cities is nearly as\nlong. True enough. But still a new ingredient\nhas been added in the past few years, and\nthe calm, professional application of ac-\ncepted procedures has been escalated into a\npublic issue.\n\nThe new ingredient is a magnification of\nour ability to damage the environment, per-\nhaps irreparably, and therewith a recognition\nthat the old, piecemeal approaches that deal\nwith each pollution source as an isolated\nproblem no longer suffice. Integrated plans\nfor protecting and managing the environ-\nment, at least regional in scope, are what is\nnow needed. On the analytic side, this en-\ntails studies of the environment-economy-\npopulation complex as an interacting system.\nAt the same time, fortuitously, the tech-\nniques of making such systems studies have\nbeen developing rapidly in other contexts.\nSo, at the moment, there must be in progress\nliterally scores of systems analyses of en-\nvironmental problems.

To me, this appears to\nbe a hopeless cause, as every economist\nshould recognize, because it amounts to no\nless than attempting to devise a detailed,\ncomplete, economic plan. We all know that\ndetailed planning for marketable goods and\nservices is not a very promising undertaking;\nplanning for nonmarketable externalities\nentails even greater difficulties.\n\nThis is not to say that the systems analy-\nsis of environmental problems, which we are\nconsidering at this session, is a useless enter-\nprise. Far from it\u2014it has a very important\nrole to play, which I shall come to later. But\nthis role will not be served by increasing\nelaboration and detail, which I perceive to be\nthe current trend. But now let us look at the\nevidence.\n\nOur three papers have many characteris-\ntics in common. They are all quantitative.\nThey all rest on elaborate, systems-type\nmodels. Isard's, the simplest, uses an input-\noutput formulation. Russell's goes beyond\nthat to a multistage mathematical program-\nming analysis. Evans' employs an aggrega-\ntive general equilibrium model of the econ-\nomy. But the most important point of simi-\nlarity is that all three authors concede with\ngreat candor that their models are not suc-\ncessful, or not yet successful, in terms of the\nobjectives that they have set for themselves.\nIsard is the most explicit. He writes, ''it is\nimportant to recognize the low state of\nmodel development that exists,\" and again,\n*to be able to rank (industrial distributions,\nland-use plans and transportation networks)\nin terms of overall social welfare, taking into\n",

The problem Fernan-\ndez will encounter when he calls this a *'radi-\ncal critique\" is that his friends will forget his\nimportant distinction between positive and\nnormative purposes. The paradigm will be-\ncome a criticism. Why does radical eco-\nnomics need to develop the notions of the\ncriminal and the poor as classes? To explain\ncriminal behavior or to further the revolu-\ntion? The problem of radical economics is\nthat it first must be scientific, and this is\nhard to do while organizing a revolution or\nchecking on who is deviating most from\nMarx's view.\n\nControversy on the question of legalizing\nheroin could be reduced if economists could\nprovide good estimates of factors affecting\nthe rate of addiction. A colleague of mine,\nDavid Ball, suggests that we should be able\nto find cross-sectional data (averages) that\nallow us to relate rates of addiction to effec-\ntive prices. He has suggested that the follow-\ning groups are paying gradually higher\nprices: (1) health workers having a low\neffective cost, (2) U.S. forces in Vietnam, (3)\nusers in large cities which have \"legitimate\"\npatient use, (4) large cities without metha-\ndone programs but with many suppliers, (5)\nuniversity campuses, and (6) small towns\nwith costly sources and high moral sanctions\nagainst usage. If data can be obtained on the\nrates of addiction for such distinct popula-\ntions, then it may be worthwhile seeking\nsome price data. If prices are not available,\nit may be logical to make up a composite\ncost index based on low, medium, and high\njudgments about price, cost of search, and\nrisk of buying. The obvious problem with this\napproach would be adjusting one's inferences\nfor differences in the backgrounds, activities,\ngoals, and alternatives of the different\ngroups. Even so, a simple table relating effec-\ntive prices to rates of addiction would be\nvery useful and might provide some insight\ninto other factors that affect addiction.\n\nMy own feeling about such demand stud-\n",

                    "JAwES A. SEAGRAvES, North Carolina\nState University: The economist's approach\nto the heroin problem is conservative and\ncoldly scientific, yet exciting. Why is it so\nexciting? Because economics offers frame-\nworks for thinking about utility and produc-\ntion functions, about competition and mo-\nnopoly, about freedom and responsibility,\nabout externalities and internalities, and\nabout the process of social change. And these\nframeworks, or models, are essential to good\nscientific analysis. My role here today will be\nto say that we should not be conservative\nabout selling our approach and that we\nshould not oversimplify the problems in our\nanalyses.\n\nOne side effect of the illegality and high\nprice of heroin is the individualized market\nthat develops between the small pusher who\nis also a user and his clients. To the extent\nthat these pushers must consciously create\nnew demands to feed their own habits, there\nis a way in which high prices create more\nsalesmen. The process is self-equilibrating in\nthat higher prices and more salesmen both\ncut into the profits of each salesman. This\ncalls for a special *microeconomics of per-\nsonal monopolies.\" To the extent that this is\n& true description of sales to new users, we\nwould not expect price to have much effect\non the number of new addicts. The friend-to-\na-friend contagion model and the junkie-\npusher model lead us to somewhat different\n& priori notions about the elasticity of new\naddiction with respect to changes in the\neffective price. Also, some people believe that\nthe illegality of heroin has been its major\ndrawing card to the young. There must be\nsome truth in all these views, but what they\npoint to is a need to develop fairly sophisti-\ncated models for analysis of the demand for\ndrugs on the part of the young.\n\nRaul Fernandez stresses that we need a\nbetter historical perspective and an aware-\nness of the role of classes in social change. He\ncalls for a sophisticated explanation of the\nHarrison Act based on \"more refined ap-\nproaches to the ideological superstructure.\"'\nFernandez also asks for a richer concept of\n",

How important is this\ncorrelation as compared with the relation-\nship between earnings and other economic\nvariables? In a previous paper Bowles has\nshown that 13 percent of the variance in\nearnings can be explained by father's occu-\npational status, parents' income, and num-\nbers of siblings. This implies a correlation of\n.36 between income and a composite of\nfamily background variables. By contrast,\nhuman capital models can explain about 52\npercent of the variance in log of incomes,\nwhich implies a correlation of .72 between\nlog of income and a composite of human\ncapital variables such as education, experi-\nence, and weeks worked. Thus, although\nsocial economic background does have an\nimpact on earnings it is not as important\nquantitatively as that of other subsets of\neconomic variables. Yet the question re-\nmains\u2014why do background variables affect\nearnings? It is this question Bowles addresses\nhimself to.\n\nFirst, Bowles outlines three contrasting\nviews of the causes of this correlation (called\nby him the inequality of income-earning op-\nportunity): first, that inequality in income-\nearning opportunity results from inequality\nin schooling; second, that it results from\ndifferences in ability; and third, that it re-\nsults from conditioning in the family.\n\nThe correlation between background vari-\nables and income is then allocated among\nthese factors. Using data adjusted to correct\nfor a suspected downward bias in the coeffi-\ncients of background variables, Bowles finds\nonly 20 percent of the correlation between\nfamily background and income is due to\nschooling, 9 percent is due to childhood 7Q\nand 11 percent due to genotypic 7Q. The find-\ning that the contribution of ability is small is\nconsistent with a number of studies which\nfind that ability measures contribute little to\nexplaining earnings, once schooling is in-\ncluded in the earnings function.\n",

                    "The finding that schooling accounts for\nonly 20 percent of the correlation between\nearnings and background can be cited not as\nevidence of immobility, as Bowles claims,\nbut as evidence that opportunity to receive\nschooling which affects earnings is not rigidly\ntied to parents! characteristics. Since school-\ning accounts for only a small part of the cor-\nrelation between income and background,\nthis suggests that the major part of school-\ning's impact on income is independent of\nbackground variables.\n\nThe indirect effects of ability and educa-\ntion account for 40 percent of the correlation\nbetween income and background variables;\nthe remaining 60 percent is attributable to\nthe direct effect of family background vari-\nables. Thus of the 13 percent of the variance\nin earnings attributable to the background\nvariables alone, 8 percent is attributable to\nthe direct effect of background. This seems\nlike a rather small number upon which to\nbase a charge of intergenerational immobil-\nity. However, the relationship might appear\neven less overpowering without the correc-\ntions made upon the data.\n\nBowles's method and rationale for correct-\ning the data have been described in a previ-\nous paper. The argument goes that data on\nparents' education, occupation, and income\nare usually obtained from questionnaires\nadministered many years after the fact, and\nthus responses are subject to considerably\nmore reporting error than the responses to\nquestions concerning own years of schooling.\nConsequently, the importance of background\nvariables in determining income will be\nunderestimated, while that of own schooling\nwill be overestimated. With the use of a\ngood set of longitudinal data such problems\ncould be overcome. I have estimated earn-\nings functions on a set of longitudinal data in\nwhich family background information was\nsupplied by the parents of the subjects when\nthe members of the sample were eleven years\nold. Thus, background variables were inher-\nently subject to no more error in measure-\nment tlian *own\" variables. Nonetheless,\nmothers! education, fathers! education, and\nnumber of siblings are not significant determi-\n",

BonkiN, Economic Council of\nCanada and the University of Western On-\ntario: I regard the paper by Gary Fromm\nand Lawrence Klein as a very interesting,\nstimulating one. Indeed, a paper like this\nis indicative of a certain degree of ma-\nturity in the subdiscipline of econometric\nmodels; one could not have had such a sur-\nvey paper in the early days of econometric\nmodel-building just before or just after the\nSecond World War. I regard what follows as\nprincipally being in the nature of a develop-\nment of the ideas of Fromm and Klein,\nrather than being primarily a criticism of\ntheir work.\n\nFromm and Klein begin their paper by\ncomplaining about the attempts of third-\nparty scholars to evaluate large-scale econo-\nmetric models on a comparative basis, argu-\ning that often such attempts utilized unac-\nceptable procedures and were, for a variety of\nreasons, inefficient. On the other hand, most\nindividuals would concede that the model\nbuilders themselves might well possess con-\nScious or unconscious biases. As Klein taught\nme some years ago, the choice between an\nefficient but biased estimator or an unbiased\n(but high variance) estimator is by no means\na clear-cut one. For this reason, I feel that\nwe need both the efforts of the model-build-\ners! own seminar (of which this paper is one\nof the first fruits) and the work of third-\nparty scholars. May both continue to flourish\nand develop!\n\nThe heart of this paper is the two sets of\ntables (Tables 1-4 and 5-6), which present\nroot mean square error properties and multi-\nplier properties, respectively. Consider the\nfirst set of tables, which is concerned with\nroot mean square errors for four aggregative\nvariables, both within and beyond estimated\nsample periods. Whenever one is confronted\nwith tables like this, I urge readers to study\nsuch tables and attempt to discern what\nmeaning (if any) one can draw. from these\ntables, before turning to the author's\n(authors\") explanation. This is the procedure\nthat I have followed, from which I drew sev-\neral conclusions. First, it seems quite clear\n",

Consider\nthe level simulations for constant dollar\nGNP within the sample period, for the long-\nrun path, in Table 2. These root mean square\nerrors range from 4.34 (FRB, St. Louis) and\n4.88 (DRI-71) to 12.33 (MPS) and 13.66\n(Wharton M. III, anticipations version).\nThus I must dissent from the authors! con-\nclusion: When account is taken of differ-\nences in sample periods, in assumed input\ndata, and in revisions of models, the main\nconclusion from the comparison of errors is\nthat all or most models currently are func-\ntioning near the limits of attainable preci-\nsion.\" It seems to me that this assertion can\nbe challenged, even within the class of quar-\nterly models for sample period simulations.\n\nFrom my quick examination of Tables 1-4,\nI have drawn the following supplementary\nconclusions.\n\n(a) The Liu-Hwa monthly model would\nappear to be of great promise for purposes of\nshort-term forecasting. This would especially\nappear to be the case if the property of a\npossible cancellation of the forecasting errors\nwithin a calendar quarter (mentioned by\nKlein in his oral presentation) survives the\nrigorous scrutiny to which it is intended to\nsubject this possible result.\n\n(b) At the other end of the spectrum, the\nannual models would appear to be of limited\npotential for short-term forecasting. Pair-\nwise comparisons (e.g., Wharton Annual vs.\nWharton Mark III or H-C Annual vs. DRI-\n71) will corroborate this assertion. Of course,\nthis is merely confirmation of a standing\nproposition among econometric forecasters,\nrather than a new suggestion.\n\n(c) Use of anticipations data on balance\nprobably improves forecasts, particularly\noutside the sample period (the realistic case).\nM y basis for this assertion is a pairwise com-\nparison between the two versions of the\nWharton Mark III model, one with and one\nwithout anticipations data.\n\n(d) The challenge of monetarism, as ex-\nemplified by the FRB St. Louis model, to\nneo-Keynesian orthodoxv is still a formid-\n",

But\napparently economists have never been quite\nhappy simply to propose transfers of income\nto the poor as a commendable aim of policy.\nRegarding themselves as social scientists, it\nis apparently more satisfying to their search\nfor status if the policy of equalizing transfer\npayments could be made to flow from some\nessential part of economics; if, that is, it\ncould be given a sort of \"scientific\" under-\npinning.\n\nThe old fashioned way of going about this\nbusiness is described in recent histories of\neconomic doctrine, and we need only remind\nourselves that with the help of some agree-\nable assumptions about the nature of the real\nworld, the neoclassical Cambridge School\nwas able to deduce equality of income as a\ncorollary of maximizing society's total util-\nity. By about 1939, however, scepticism\nabout such propositions could no longer be\ncontained. The old scaffolding was scrapped\nand that of the New Welfare Economics\nerected in its stead. Following some early\nyears of heated debate, it became explicitly\nrecognized that the new normative structure\nrested ultimately on a dual criterion, one in-\nvolving allocation and one involving dis-\ntribution. Admittedly, a dual criterion looks\n\u00e0 bit untidy, and not surprisingly economists\nhave been busy once more, this time trying\nto empty the contents of the distributive\naspect into a purely allocative container\u2014\nagain making some agreeable assumptions\nabout human nature.\n",

The specification that demand\nvanishes at some high (finite) price along with a resale\nproviso will be shown to be sufficient to establish the\nfull scope and generality of this proposition.\n"

                    "Anyone who has read the American Economic Review for the last twenty-five years realizes\nthat great changes have taken place in the subject matter and methodology of economic re-\nsearch. Articles on mathematical economics and the finer points of economic theory occupy a\nmuch more prominent place than ever before, while articles of a more empirical, policy-\noriented, or problem-solving character seem to appear less frequently. Such changes have\noccurred slowly, and are to a degree illusory. Nevertheless, readers may wonder and some have\ninquired whether the editor of the Review and his colleagues, the Board of Editors, have sought\nto further this trend, or whether we have a prior preference for one type of manuscript over\nanother. No such preference exists. The pages of the journal are open to every subdivision of\neconomics and to every method. We are governed in what we publish first by the papers that\nare submitted and second by those that survive the editorial refereeing. Space allows us to\nprint only 14 percent of the papers submitted. Thus, we seek to make editorial refereeing as\nobjective as possible. An acceptable paper must either advance the art of economic analysis,\nor else exemplify a highly skillful and pertinent application of that art. The function of the\nReview is to publish those papers which contain the most fruitful research, the most lucid\ndiscussions, and which open the most promising avenues for further inquiry.\n\nWhile much published work contains mathematical models, this must not hide the fact that\nmany of these papers are directed to applied subjects such as government stabilization and\ntaxation, monetary theory, financial institutions, international trade, public regulation, racial\ndiscrimination, poverty, health, education, housing, environmental control, and economic\ndevelopment. The Review welcomes theoretical and empirical and policy-oriented papers in\nall areas of economic inquiry, and recognizes the validity of a variety of methods of research\nand exposition. The distribution of space in the journal is highlv elastic and reflects the quality\nand volume of work in various fields, not any prior judgments as to their importance.\n\nWhen the American Economic Association was founded in 1885, its report of organization\nstated three major objectives: *'\"The encouragement of economic research, the publication of\neconomic monographs, and the encouragement of perfect freedom in all economic discussion.\"\nThese goals retain their vitality and the present statement of editorial policy reaffirms them.\n",

I wish to thank Agnar Sandmo and Bridger\nMitchell for interesting discussions on the subject. An\nearlier version of the paper appeared in 1970, and was\nfirst presented to the Berkeley-Stanford Mathematical\nEconomics Seminar, November 1969.\n\n1 Aspects of decision making with uncertain demand\nhave been treated by David Baron (1970), Phoebus\nDhrymes, Jacques Dreze and J. Gabsewicz, A. L.\nHempenius, Ira Horowitz, Ronald McKinnon, Edwin\nMills, M. Rothschild, Agnar Sandmo, Kenneth Smith,\nC. Tisdell, and Edward Zabel. All these have analyzed a\nsingle behavioral form; price setting, quantity setting,\nor price-quantity setting, and all except Horowitz as-\nsume uncertainty enters in a simple way\u2014through a\nmultiplicative or additive shift in the demand curve.\n\n? A paper by Baron (1971) has just come to my atten-\ntion, in which price-setting and quantity-setting be-\nhavior are considered in the same iramework. Baron,\nhowever, starts with the (curious) notion that price and\nquantity are jointly random (see fn. 6).\n"

On the\nbasis of results for the U.S. petroleum\nrefining industry, this paper questions the\nabove conclusion and suggests an alterna-\ntive approach. Specifically, a process\nanalysis approach? rather than a statistical\ncost function approach, yields the classical\nshort-run cost function properties\u2014rising\nmarginal costs and a U-shaped average\ncost function. Also, this study demon-\nstrates the generality of the process analy-\nsis approach by first treating the single and\nthen the joint product? cases. The applica-\ntion to joint production is particularly\npromising because many industries involve\naspects of joint production and yet the\ntreatment of joint product cost functions\nin the literature is an area of little pro-\ngress.^\n\n* Economist, Standard Oil Company (New Jersey).\nMuch of this paper is drawn from my dissertation\nsubmitted to the University of Pennsylvania, May\n1971.

This second\napproach, though, is fraught with difficulties.\nMuch of the data one would like to have is\nsimply not available, while much of what is\navailable is of poor quality and serves at best\nas poor surrogates for the measures one\nwould really like to have. Though some suc-\ncesses are recorded in the econometric esti-\nmation, when it comes time to deliver results\nunfilled gaps in the equation system exist. It\nis probably for this reason that, as the build-\ners of this model point out, previous ones\n\"have relied primarily on trend projections\nor variants of gravitational attractional\nmodels.\" While I have the highest profes-\nsional regard for the builders of this model, I\nfear they may experience many of the same\ndiffculties others have.\n\nThe present effort is a combination of a\nmacroeconomic model for the citv as an\nopen economy and a spatial allocation model\nof its internal structure. Not surprisingly,\nthe macro model is more highly developed\nbecause of the fact that more previous work\nis available to draw on. Both parts, it seems\nto me, suffer from three shortcomings. First,\ndespite the acknowledged defects of previous\nmodels, this one, too, seems devoid of *'con-\nvincing behavioral relations forming the\nbasic structure\" of the model. Manv sets of\nrelationships are written down, but it seems\nto me that theory consists of far more than\nwriting Y \u2014f(X), even if X is a vector and a\nrandom disturbance term is added. A second\nshortcoming is that the model itself seems to\nconcentrate primarily on the dynamics of\nadjustment to the exclusion of long-run com-\nparative statics considerations. One can, of\ncourse, draw heavily on macro models for the\nwhole economy in constructing an urban\n",

MvrBH: With the apparent\nsuccess of large scale macroeconomic models\nofthe economy as a whole and the continuing\ndecrease in the relative cost of computation,\nit is becoming more and more tempting to\napplv large scale computer models to the\nsolution of our pressing urban problems. I\nwill even admit that, buried in my files, I too\nhave the beginnings of.an urban computer\nmodel and the results of some tentative\nsimulations with it. (In making this admis-\nsion I feel somewhat as if I were confessing to\nbeing a closet drinker.) The possibilities of\napplving such models are indeed tempting,\nbut I am inclined to view them with sus-\npicion, the same kind of suspicion, for ex-\nample, that a vacht buyer should show to-\nward a freshly painted hull.\n\nThe paper by Engle, Fisher, Harris, and\nRothenberg points to the \"burgeoning in-\ndustry\" in such models in the past ten or\nfifteen vears. It concludes, and I believe cor-\nrectly, that the overall results of these\nmodels have been disappointing. Yet, to mv\nknowledge, few if any of the previous model-\ning efforts started out in this way. Rather,\nthey were each based upon a grand concep-\ntion similar to that of the model we are con-\nsidering and evolved into their unsatisfactory\nstate when coming up against certain hard\nfacts of life.\n\nBasically, the urban modeling industry is\nin the position the U.S. space program would\nhave been in ten years ago without Newton's\nlaws of motion. Though great progress has\nbeen made in the theory of urban spatial\nStructure in recent years, we still know far\ntoo little about it. Therefore, an urban\nmodeling effort can proceed in one of two\nways. One is bv a careful, step-by-step de-\nvelopment of the theoretical relationships,\ntesting them in the small and refining them\nbefore fitting them into the overall model.\nFew previous efforts have taken this first ap-\nproach, probablv because of the pressure for\nquick results. When one is charged with the\nresponsibility of developing a master plan for\nan urban area's transportation system, time\nseems too short to permit a careful theoreti-\ncal analysis.

This is done, not\nto redistribute credit, a worthless enterprise\nper se, but rather to show how the inbred\ninsularity of the academicians first divorced\nthem from much influence upon what was\ndone or even knowledge of who was doing\nit\u2014and later led them to do the wrong\nthings when their influence increased. Refer-\nence is especially to the designated followers\nof Keynes, who in later years I hold to be\nperverters of his teachings.\n\nI shall list nine outstanding New Deal\nprograms not closely related to those men-\ntioned here today\u2014six of which I was\npeculiarly able to observe because of my\nproximity as a major or the principal drafts-\nman, and, in some instances, the originator\nof the proposal that they enacted.\n\nFirst, there was the National Industrial\nRecovery Act. Its provisions for trade associ-\nation action under government aegis origi-\nnated primarily with Gerard Swope, trade\nassociation lawyers, and the planning ideas\nof Rexford G. Tugwell. Its wage and hour\nprovisions and Section 7(a) for collective\nbargaining were first recommended to Sena-\ntor Wagner by me.\n\nSecond, there was the National Labor\nRelations Act, which history mav record as\nthe most influential vehicle of economic,\nsocial and political change of any New Deal\nprogram. During the long and bitter battle\nfor its enactment, under Senator Wagner's\nleadership with my help, it was opposed by\ntop officials of Cabinet rank, never really\nhelped by the President, and accorded no\ninterest by top executive branch economists.\n\nThird in my enumeration, the original\nmassive public spending, from which most\npublic spending under the New Deal ema-\nnated, was the S3.3 billion public works title\nof the NTRA. This did not come from the\nexecutive branch at all. It summed up re-\npeated public works bills introduced bv\nSenators Wagner, Costigan, and LaFollette\nfrom 1929 forward, stemming in turn from\nSenator Wagner's Economic Stabilization\n",

                    "Act of 1929, which proposed increased public\nworks spending as private indexes of eco-\nnomic activity fell. The proposal that the\ngovernment spend more to employ people\nwhen unemployment is very high, and thus\nrun a deficit, came well before Kevnes was\nin vogue, and cannot be attributed to any\none man or school. Nor were the main *'idea\nmen\" behind these measures among those\nstressed here today.\n\nA fourth aspect of enduring New Deal\nprograms was housing legislation, ranging\nover FHA mortgage insurance, home loan\nbank operations, and public housing. This\nemerged from the work of the housing re-\nformers of the 1920's and some practical\nexperts in the home financing field. I was\ncrucially involved in almost all of this\nhousing work, and vital parts of it were\nviewed very unsympathetically by the execu-\ntive branch.\n\nA fifth example was the Agricultural\nAdjustment Act. Despite some mistakes, the\nprice support program served a great and\nuseful purpose. The main role of most\nacademic economists in later years has been\nto undermine the price support legislation\nby largely unanalytical and unfair attacks.\n\nA sixth aspect covered the whole field of\nsocial security. This ran way back to Euro-\npean examples, and many vears of work by\nwelfare specialists here. The main influence\nof the academic economists who helped draw\nup the original social security legislation was\nunfortunate. Over my unavailing protests,\nthev started a system of old-age insurance\nfinanced by regressive taxation, and a system\nof unemployment insurance conducted sepa-\nrately in forty-eight states, when we needed\na national system supported by progressive\ntaxation.\n\nSeventh, the liberal and so-called *cheap\"\nmoney policies of the New Deal were de-\nmanded by the times, were a trademark of\nthe Democratic Party, and went back at\nleast to the Populist movement of the 1890's.\n\nEighth, there was the TVA, which went\nback to George Norris and Muscle Shoals.\n\nNinth, there was the Employment Act of\n1946, to which I shall return.\n",

                    "MvRA H. SrgonER: Mr. Lekachman has\npresented a most interesting paper on the\nrelationship between unions and economists\nand I quite agree with his point of view. I\nwould like to concentrate my remarks on\nthe reasons why, as Lekachman observes,\nunions rank so low on academic economists'\nresearch agenda.\n\nA perusal of any issue of the Journal of\nEconomic Literature wil confirm that re-\nsearch on unions is indeed in\u00edrequent.\nLekachman suggests that unions and econo-\nmists view one another as irrelevant because\nthey perceive reality at different angles.\nEconomists have a more complicated utility\nfunction, a longer time horizon, a more prac-\ntical outlook and a more basic faith in\nmarkets than do trade unionists. In addition,\nLekachman asserts that economists simply\ndo not tackle problems of power or social\nissues very frequently.\n\nI believe Lekachman is mainly right\u2014\nalthough economists of my generation have\nfar less faith in markets than he ascribes\nto the profession as a whole. But the lack of\ninterest in unions among economists has\nsome additional roots. These can be divided\ninto two groups\u2014those involving noneco-\nnomic or intellectual issues and those in-\nvolving economics.\n\nLet us take the noneconomic issues first.\nMost economists, like most Americans, have\nvery little understanding of trade union\ngoals, operations or history. In large part,\nthis is the fault of American high schools\nwhich present little or no information on\ntrade unions. The study of unions is slowly\nmaking its way into the curriculum, but,\nunfortunately, the present generation of\neconomists is unaffected. Of course, econo-\nmists could learn about unions in their col-\nlege and graduate school years, but thev\ngenerally become interested in other matters.\nThere is a feeling among young economists\nthat unions are not * where it's at.\" Econo-\nmists, or at least some of them, do prefer to\ndeal with social issues\u2014but not union\nissues.

These are the social issues\nwhich have turned on\" economists\u2014\nalthough, as Brimmer, Harper, and Lekach-\nman all point out, the majority of economic\nresearch is not on these tvpes of problems.\n\nMost liberal economists do not believe\nthat unions share their interest in alleviating\nracial discrimination and poverty. The fact\nthat certain trade unions discriminate or\nhave discriminated against blacks has been\nblown way out of proportion. Many Ameri-\ncans, economists included, are unaware that\nthe percentage of blacks in trade unions is\ngreater than the percentage of blacks in the\npopulation\u201415 percent vs. 11 percent\u2014or\nthat one out of every three new union mem-\nbers is black, or that, according to the\ndirector of the Washington bureau .VAACP,\n\"None of the legislative fights we have\nmade in the field of civil rights could have\nbeen won without the trade union move-\nment\" (Bayard Rustin, pp. 76 and 80).\nNor do many seem aware of the long-stand-\ning American labor movement tradition of\nautonomy for national unions.\n\nThere is also a good deal of misunder-\nstanding, as Lekachman points out, on the\nmatters of so-called blue-collar conservatism\nand wealth. Bok and Dunlop's review of\npublic opinion surveys of union member\nattitudes reveals (p. 47) that union mem-\nbers are not more conservative than the rest\nof the population. If anything thev stand\ntwo or three percentage points on the liberal\nside on matters of race, the United Nations,\nthe poverty program, and most other public\nissues.\" Nor has the labor movement been\nunited behind George Meany's stance on\nVietnam. Moreover, blue-collar workers\u2014\nthe mainstay of trade unionism\u2014have been\nlosing out over the past decade. \u00c0 recent\narticle by Peter Henle in the Monthly Labor\nReview notes (p. 35) that in the 1960's\nworkers in blue-collar occupations did not\nobtain improvements in income comparable\n",

SANDELL: To prescribe what\neconomic equality for women requires, it\nhelps to know what is happening in today's\nlabor market.\n\nIn particular, wnequal opportunity is\nneither a necessary nor a sufficient condition\nfor the observed unequal occupational dis-\ntribution between the sexes. I believe that a\nsubstantial part of the occupational dis-\ntribution and the observed differences be-\ntween male and female wages can be at-\ntributed to different expected lengths of\nlabor market involvement and differences in\nthe related incentives to invest in human\ncapital for the sexes. These labor force par-\nticipation differences stem from the dif-\nferences in the perceived family roles of men\nand women in contemporary American so-\nclety.\n\nAs a supplement to the approach used by\nCharlotte Phelps, who takes economic equal-\nity as the given and looks at the ramifica-\ntions in household behavior, much can be\nlearned by taking present household be-\nhavior as the given (probably a realistic ap-\nproach considering the strong influence of\nsocietal pressure on family roles) and exam-\nining the labor market consequences. If a\nwoman expecis to spend, say, at least six\nyears raising children (and thus not in\nmarket work), she has less incentive to\nsacrifice current income for a larger future\nyearly income from training than a man (or\nwoman) who does not expect to have a six-\nyear break in his (or her) labor market ac-\ntivities.\n\nBy directly affecting the number of years\nwomen will be doing market work and hence\nthe size of the return to any investment in\ntraining, societal norms in regard to the\nfamily role to be enjoyed by each sex in-\nfluence the incentives for acquiring human\ncapital. For those people who try to maxi-\nmize the present value of their market in-\ncome streams, the amount of human capital\nto be acquired and the concomitant occupa-\ntional choice will be affected.\n\nThose people with less expected time in\nthe labor force will train less and will enter\n",

Empirically, formal professional\nschooling and on-the-job training seem to be\nsignificantly less important in the perfor-\nmance of the so-called *female occupations\"\nthan in those occupations composed largely\nof men. On-the-job training is perhaps more\nimportant in this respect than formal school-\ning before employment.\n\nAlthough Harriet Zellner's paper does not\nexplore the reasons why women are con-\ncentrated in some occupations and are poorly\nrepresented in others, her regression equa-\ntions provide some indication of the factors\ninvolved.| If workers pay for on-the-job\ntraining by being paid a wage lower than an\nuntrained worker while they receive the\ntraining and reap a return on their invest-\nment by receiving a wage higher than the\nuntrained worker after the training is\nfinished, then we should observe earnings\nincreasing with experience fastest for those\nworkers who receive the most on-the-job\ntraining. For each group (male, single fe-\nmale, married female, etc.) in Zellner's\nequations, the regression coefficient of earn-\nings on experience is /arger in the male oc-\ncupations than in the female occupations.\nThis is consistent with the hypothesis that\ntraining is more important in the so-called\n\"male occupations\" than in the \"female oc-\ncupations.\"\n\nAlso, if we look at the magnitude of the\nexperience coefficient for each group within\nthe training-intensive (male) occupations, we\nfind further evidence that those workers who\nexpect to stay in the labor force the longest\nwill receive the most training. The coefficient\nfor the male group is larger than any of the\nfemale groups. Among the female groups the\nsize of the experience coefficients seems to\nindicate that never-married women receive\nthe most training, followed by married\nwomen. Married women with children re-\nceive the least training. This finding is con-\nsistent with the theory, if, as is likely, ox\n",

I am indeed rather surprised by\nFriend's remark that *to many, if not most,\neconomists the stock market seems endowed\nwith an almost mystical degree of efficiency.\"\nMy definite impression is that, at least until\nvery recently, most economists tended to\nshare the view which Friend attributes to\nthe lay public of the stock market as a\nlegalized gambling casino bearing very little,\nif any, relation to the economic activity,\neither at the macro level or at the level of\nresource allocation. I am sure most of my\ncolleagues have shared with me the experi-\nence of being regarded by the lay public,\nbecause of our label of economists, as the\ndepository of valuable tips about the stock\nmarket\u2014though usually with the sarcastic\ninnuendo of **if you are so smart, why ain't\nyou rich?\"\u2014and of having taken some pain\nto explain that concern with '\"The Market\"\nwas something below the dignity of an\neconomist! I submit that it is only in the\nlast half dozen years that the words \"stock\nmarket\" and \"speculative markets\" have\nbecome respectable in the profession at\nlarge as a result of a series of developments\nbeginning with application of the expected\nutility approach to the theory of portfolio\u2014\nMarkowitz, Tobin, and Farrar\u2014and with a\nfresh approach to corporate finance\u2014Dur-\nand, Miller and myself, Gordon, Baumol,\netc.; followed by the work on random walks\nby Mandelbrot, Samuelson, Alexander,\nCootner; and more recently by the break-\nthrough on general equilibrium analysis of\nspeculative markets by Sharp, Traynor,\nLintner, Mossin; and on life-cycle saving and\nportfolio beginning with myself, Brumberg,\nand Ando and, more recently, Tobin and\nSamuelson; and on most of these subjects\nplus regulation and evaluation of perform-\nance by Friend and associates. By now this\n",

In prepar-\ning these comments I have greatly benefited\nfrom the advice of Albert Ando, the person\nwho has been most closely associated with\nme in my work on the life-cycle hypothesis\nand in structuring the wealth effect in the\nconsumption function of the Federal Re-\nserve- MIT-Model which has now become\nthe MPS Model (MIT-Penn-Social Science\nResearch Council). Rasche's paper is pri-\nmarily concerned with the macroeconomic\nimpact of the stock market via consumption.\nIthink it is fair to say that thisisa role about\nwhich the profession at large seems to be\nstill somewhat skeptical. Indeed, when a\nfew years back we began our work on the\nmodel with the notion that the stock market\nplayed a central role in the transmission of\nmonetary policy both via investment and,\nmore heretically, via consumption, most\ncolleagues did not even think it was a good\npiece of theory, let alone of practical rele-\nvance.\n\nAs it turns out, in the version of the\nmodel which is now operational, the value of\ncorporate equity\u2014a  euphemism for the\nstock market\u2014plays most definitely a cen-\ntral role. In a paper entitled \"Monetary\nPolicy and Consumption\u2014The Linkages Via\nInterest Rates and Wealth Effects in the\nFederal Reserve-MIT-Penn Model,\" pre-\npared for a conference of the Federal Re-\nserve Bank of Boston, which is coming out in\nprint this week, I have shown that in that\nmodel a major portion of the effect of\nmonetary policy on economic activity comes\nabout by way of the effect of monetary\n",

The only clear national goal we now\nhave with regard to income distribution is to\neliminate what is arbitrarily defined as in-\ncome poverty. But few economists and fewer\npoliticians have tried to specify what degree\nof income inequality we should strive for. In\npart, this is because \"income inequality\" is\na complex term. I think Dr. Gordon has\noversimplified the problem of selecting goals\nin the realm of income distribution. We tend\nto have one set of goals for the distribution\nof earnings, and another for the distribution\nof per family or per capita user incomes. I\nsuspect he would agree that some adjustment\nof the prescribed earnings distribution needs\nto be made for part-period and part-time\nworkers within occupations, and that some\nadjustment could be made for *compensat-\ning\" differences among occupations. (For\nexample, is it not fair that later income\nshould compensate for income foregone in\ncompleting education?)\n\nIt is important to note that an earner dis-\ntribution only accounts for the income re-\nceipts of about half of the population. One\nmust take account of the variability of user\nincomes associated with number of earners\nper family and the variability of special edu-\ncational and health needs.\n\nIn specifying what particular pattern of\ninequality is being prescribed, one should\nspecify not only a Gini coefficient (or perhaps\nsome other index of inequality), but also\n(a) what income (cash, in-kind, environmen-\ntal quality, job satisfaction); (b) what in-\ncome receiving unit (individual earner, fam-\nily, per capita); (c) what method of ranking\nunits; and (d) what income period (annual,\nlifetime, or somewhere 1n between) are to be\nused in indicating income inequality.\n\nI mentioned that Gordon has a prediction,\na prescription, and a description. The de-\nscription\u2014which I do not find particularly\nnovel\u2014is of the process by which govern-\nment influences distribution. One can imag-\nine, but not observe, a distribution which\n",

                    "Roznznr1 J. LAMPMAN: David Gordon's sub-\nject is not well denoted by the title of his\npaper. It is not about the poor so much as it\nis about inequality of income. It is not about\ntaxation so much as it is about the broad\nrange of governmental policies (including\nthose not reflected in budget documents)\nwhich bear on both the primary and secon-\ndarv distributions of income. The paper\nmight better have been titled: *Government\nand the Size Distribution of Income.\"\n\nI detect three principal themes in this\nessay. One is a prediction, one is a prescrif-\nlion, and one is a description. Quite lacking is\nany new information on the quantitative\nsignificance of government activity. Also\nabsent is any discussion of particular meth-\nods to be used in effecting the prescribed\nchange in the income distribution.\n\nThe prediction has to do with what kind\nof distributional and redistributional pat-\nterns will arise under a given set of institu-\ntions. The author avoids the Marxian predic-\ntion that capitalism will produce ever-in-\ncreasing inequality, but he does conclude\nthat reduction of income inequality is se-\nverelv constrained by capitalism. I would\nurge that a broader statement of this rela-\ntionship is subject to empirical test, \u00e1 la\nKuznets. Perhaps some institutional arrange-\nments build in even more constraints than\ncapitalism, and perhaps some involve very\nlittle less, but my untested prediction of\nwhat the author might find is not a scientific\nfinding.\n\nThe author does not let his untested pre-\ndiction stand in the way of his offering a\nprescripltion\u2014and it is a radical one indeed\u2014\nthat, even prior to the revolution, Americans\nshould dedicate themselves to the elimina-\ntion in one generation of all but what he calls\n\"frictional inequality\" in the distribution of\nincome. Presently inequality in what I would\ncall the \"user distribution of income\" is indi-\ncated by the Gini coefficient of .400. Note\nthat this ranks families without regard to\nsize and composition in terms of a one-year\nreceipt of total money income pretax. Dr.\nGordon's prescription is that we should re-\nduce that .400 to .150 in 25 vears. The .150\nis selected because that is the present degree\n",

After all, game theory is merely\na way of thinking about the general fea-\ntures of games\u2014or those conflict situations\nwhich may be viewed as games\u2014and is\nnecessarily too abstract to be informative\nabout oligopoly behavior.

Pecuniary Externalities and Markets\n\nWhy should a pecuniary externality, i.e.,\nan externality that is manifested in a change\nin prices, be different from a physical ex-\nternality such as the production of smoke or\nother pollution? Modern economic analysis\nprovides the answer that the change in\nprices is merely a reflection of the maximi-\nzation process in a competitive market em-\nbodied in a general equilibrium system. The\napparent externality shows up as a feedback\nfrom one market to another in a comparative\nstatics explanation of adjustment to change.\n\nThe paradox of the pecuniary externality\nis caused by the nature of the partial equilib-\nrium analvsis of the firm. A real or a pecu-\nniary externality appear to be the same\nwhen viewed from the viewpoint of the in-\ndividual firm. When embedded in a general\nequilibrium context the differences emerge.\n\nIn our attempt to set up the appropriate\neconomic model we find that the paradox\nof the pecuniary externality is closely related\nto the implicit assumption of the existence of\nmarkets rather than the assumption of the\nemergence of markets as part of the economic\nprocess.\n\nThe paradox does not even appear if, in-\nstead of viewing the behavior of the indi-\nvidual firm or customer as a mere mecha-\nnistic adjustment to a price system, it is\nviewed as the acts of a player in an economic\ngame.\n\n* Professor, economics of organization, Yale Univer-\nsity, on leave to the RAND Corporation.

Iam\nindebted to him for his careful reading of my\npaper and for making the discovery he has.\nThe essence of my proposal was that regula-\ntion could be improved if the fair rate of\nreturn s were converted from a constant so\ninto a decreasing function of capital s \u2014 s(K),\nwith s'(K) \u00ab0. In attempting to prove that\nthis modification of regulatory procedures\nwould decrease the input inefficiency noted\nby Harvey Averch and Leland L. Johnson,\nnamely, the divergence between the margi-\nnal rate of substitution (M RS) of capital for\nlabor and the factor-cost ratio, the com-\nparison I drew between the constant and\ngraduated fair return methods of regulation\nwas invalid..\n\nThis comparison! required that: (i) the\nvalue of the graduated fair return at the\nfirm's optimal position (K\u00ab, L\u00ab) be equal to\nthe value of the constant fair rate of return,\nthat is, s(K\u00ab) 755; and (ii) the shadow price\nfor the constant fair rate constraint be equal\nto the shadow price for the graduated return\nconstraint, that is \u00c0\u00ab \u2014Ao. As Wichers argues,\nthe first requirement can be met only if the\ngraduated fair return schedule is constructed\nso that so equals s(Ko), where K\u00bbis the opti-\nmal capital stock in the constant fair return\nmodel. But, then, the optimal K, L pair for\nthe graduated fair return problem will be\nidentical with the optimal pair for the con-\nstant fair return problem, and a graduated\nfair return causes no change in input effi-\nciency. Imposing requirement (ii) above en-\ngenders a further inconsistency. For, as\nWichers notes, one cannot simultaneously\nrequire s(K\u00ab) 259, &\u00ab\u2014As and have any de-\ngree of graduation at the optimum (that is,\nhave s'(K\u00ab) z\u00a30).\n\nIn light of Wichers! arguments and after\n\n* Associate professor of economics, Yale University.\n\n!

Unfortunately, as so often happens\nwith forward planning for acadentic pur-\nposes, others have also been alert to topi-\ncality, and have undermined our forward\nplanning by getting in earlier with their\nversion of the theme. Thus Milton Fried-\nman himself gave a widely publicized lec-\nture on *The Counter-Revolution in Mon-\netary Theory\" last September in London,\nwhich lecture has recently been published\nby the Institute of Economic Affairs, [4];\nKarl Brunner has recently circulated a\ntypically scholarly paper on \"The *Mone-\ntarist Revolution In Monetary Theory\"\n[1]; and undoubtedly many others have\nbeen writing and publishing on the same\nsubject. My treatment of this beginning-\nto-be-well-worn theme today will, I hope,\nstill retain some novelty, inasmuch as I\nshall be primarily concerned, not with the\nscientific issues in dispute in the monetar-\nist counter-revolution against the Keyne-\nsian revolution, but with the social and in-\ntellectual conditions that make a revolu-\ntion or counter-revolution possible in our\nprofession. This lecture is therefore an ex-\ncursion\u2014amateurish, I must confess\u2014\ninto the economics and sociology of intel-\nlectual change.\n\nAs is well known from the field of eco-\nnomic history, the concept of revolution is\n",

For able-bod-\nied adults under 65, the most important\nalternative support program is Aid to\nFamilies with Dependent Children\n(AFDC). This program offers support\nprimarily to unemployed one-parent fam-\nilies, although two-parent families are eli-\ngible if the father is unemployed and ac-\ntively seeking work. A small number of\nfamilies with a partly employed parent\nalso receives support. The effective level\nof welfare support for a typical family of\nfour in Seattle with no other means is ap-\nproximately $3,400, although some fami-\nlies with older children receive as much as\n$4,000. Thus, a $3,600 support level re-\nplaces welfare for the unemployed family\nwith a program that offers less categorical\nand demeaning aid rather than aid at a\nsignificantly higher level of financial sup-\nport. However, the working poor, for\nwhom AFDC is essentialy unavailable,\nwill materially benefit from an income\nmaintenance program even at the $3,600\nlevel. In the experiment, there will be a\nsecond support level at $4,800 a year, in-\ntroduced to enable the impact of higher\n",

                    "Jawrs N. Momcaw: Economics is rapidly\nbecoming a science with three major branches\ninstead of one. There is the traditional and\npowerful analytic science working out the in-\nterrelationships within systems: resource allo-\ncation, pricing, dynamic equilibrium. There is\nthe new behavioral science of economics, find-\ning more precise information on the way peo-\nple actually make economic decisions so that\nwe can better specify the parameters of the\nanalytical models. The experiments we discuss\n\nChangein Awareness Interpretation Behavioral\n\nthe rules \u2014\nCredibility\n\ntoday reflect, hopefully, a great leap forward\nin economics as a behavioral science. A third\narea, mostly only looming on the horizon un-\nder the title of social indicators, is the assess-\nment and measurement of what matters to\nwhat subgroups of people\u2014the social welfare\nfunction, if you will. As we make more and\nmore decisions on resource allocation politi-\ncally, our elected representatives need better\ninformation on what matters, how much, and\nto whom. 'The welfare, that we were all taught\ncould not be measured, at least must be com-\npared for competing alternatives.\n\nTo return to the second area, much of our\ninformation on economic behavior has come\nfrom analysis of time series, progressively dis-\naggregated but limited in scope and by their\nvery aggregation. It has also come from sur-\nvey data, cross section and reinterview panels,\nproviding some natural\" or quasi-experi-\nments, but not always the ones we want most.\nIf we are impatient, the alternative seems to\nbe experiments.\n\nThe term *experiment\" has been used to\ncover a range of things from rigidly con-\ntrolled, somewhat artificial, laboratory experi-\nments, producing rather precise information\non very restricted questions, all the way to\npublic information or persuasion campaigns in\nselected areas. Those at the first extreme are\nsometimes difficult to extrapolate to the real\nworld, where people must continue to work to-\ngether, while those at the second extreme are\nfrequently so muddied up by other uncon-\n\ntrolled changes or differences that it\nto isolate the impact of any one e3\nvariable.

It was, a\u00edter all,\nsupposed to describe the present state of eco-\nnomics\u2014with outsiders as the main audience\n\u2014not to blaze new paths. I'm afraid it 2s an\nunexciting document. (It was written by a\nCommittee!) It suggests no double helix or\nmiracle rice, probably because none of us\ncould see such a thing on the horizon in eco-\nnomics. (Those are Famous Last Words, I re-\nalize.)\n\nSome of the things Schultze talks about\nwere indeed mentioned in the Report. I had a\nparagraph in my chapter on *Microeconomic\nTheory\" suggesting that the study of com-\nmodity taxes and user charges to accomplish\nallocational purposes would be an important\nresearch topic for the future. I mentioned ur-\nban economics as a major source of such prob-\nlems. I had traffic congestion rather than pol-\nlution in mind. I might as well confess that I\ndiscovered the interesting and important work\nof Kneese and his associates only after I had\nwritten my chapter; otherwise I would cer-\ntainly have mentioned it prominently. It car-\nries an important message that economists\nhave to transmit to others.\n\nSchultze may be a little less than fair when\nhe says that economists have tended to regard\nthe design of public programs as a problem of\nspecifying objectives and regulations rather\nthan as one of providing correct incentive\nschemes \u00cd\u00edor decentralized decisions. \"There\nmay be some truth in that\u2014he is in a better\nposition to know than I am\u2014-but it is at best\na partial truth about a profession that has in-\nvented and spread the whole idea of shadow-\nprices in the last 20 years.\n\nGenerally, I see the immediately promising\ndirections of theoretical and applied research\nwhere Schultze sees them. Despite the flurry\nover monetarism-and-fiscalism and natural-\nrate-of-unemployment vs. permanent-trade-\noff, I think these are essentially minor issues\nin which good sense will eventually win out.\nAs Schultze argues, microeconomics is due for\na revival as problems of regulation and decen-\n",

The Averch-Johnson literature is an-\nother example of the analysis of the subtle dis-\ntortions caused when the regulatory process\nprovides improper incentives.\n\nFor some reason, economists often meet\nradical blasts like Professor Gurley's with a\nkind of embarrassed silence. Perhaps that is\nbecause one tends to swallow the notion that\ndoing conventional economic analysis some-\nhow identifies you with the System and its in-\nequities, not to mention its foreign policy. I\nthink that notion is false. If you want to work\nfor reform of the System, or even for revolu-\ntion, that is no excuse for abandoning the\nusual standards of scientific work. To do so is\nto add ignorance to injury. I have known Pro-\nfessor Gurley for a long time. I have always\ntaken him seriously and I propose to do so\nnow. But I'm going to take a tough line, just\nas he did.\n\nThe Report under review is a survey of the\npresent state of economics, and clearly not an\nexhaustive survey. Gurley's review is much\nmore an attack on the present state of eco-\nnomics than an attack on the Refort. The Re-\nport itself is faulted only if the body of radical\npolitical economics is so large and so impor-\ntant that it demands mention. But I don't be-\nlieve that is the case. Radical economics may\nconceivably be the wave of the future, but I\ndo not think it is the wave of the present. In\nfact, to face the issue head on, I think that\nradical economics as it is practiced contains\nmore cant, not less cant; more role-playing,\nnot less role-playing; less facing of the facts,\nnot more facing of the facts, than conven-\ntional economics. In short, we neglected radi-\ncal economics because it is negligible.\n\nFirst I want to say that I think radical\neconomists have corrupted Thomas Kuhn's\nnotion of a scientific paradigm, which they\ntreat as a mere license for loose thinking. If\nyou look at Kuhn's examples\u2014all from natu-\nral science, of course\u2014you will see that they\nrepresent well developed models or frame-\nworks for thought. Some of his examples are\nNewtonian dynamics, Copernican astronomy,\nPtolemaic astronomy for that matter, wave\n",

PECK:\nThe papers presented today illustrate that\neconomists can make substantial contribu-\ntions to enlightened discussion of performance\nand regulation in television broadcasting.\nCommon to these four seemingly diverse\npapers is an emphasis on quantitative analysis\nof important policy issues in television broad-\ncasting. This emphasis itself is a significant\nstep forward. All too often, policy discussions\nhave been generalized criticism of television's\nperformance and qualitative assertions about\nthe effects of industry practices. Beyond this,\nthe papers illustrate how the concepts of mi-\ncroeconomics can be combined with quantita-\ntive testing to examine the performance of this\nindustry and the rationality of present policy.\n\nProfessor Peterman demonstrates quite\nconclusively that concentration and ownership\npatterns have little influence on local station\nadvertising rates, if those rates are converted\ninto the standard industry way of expressing\nprices\u2014cost per thousand viewers. This very\nprocess, however, nets out the most important\naspect of product differentiation\u2014audience\nsize\u2014so that comparison of price per thou-\nsand is, in effect, price comparison of undiffer-\nentiated products.\n\nWith undifferentiated products, price uni-\nformity is to be expected, regardless of market\nstructure. Hence it would be consistent with\nPeterman's findings to regard the television\nadvertising market as either oligopolistic or\npurely competitive. In each case, an undiffer-\nentiated product insures price uniformity\u2014\njust as, for example, the price of wheat and\nsteel are both uniform among their sellers. But\nthis is not the same thing as saying that vastly\ndifferent market structure and seller concen-\ntration do not affect the price level and pat-\ntern of price changes. To show that concentra-\ntion does not affect the price of television time\nrequires some investigation of the dynamics of\nprice changes rather than an analysis of price\ndifferences at one moment of time.\n\nHow this would be done with the same de-\ngree of quantitative precision that Professor\nPeterman brings to price differences at one\nmoment of time is not easy to visualize.

                    "have the strong suspicion that the kind of\nownership variables that the FCC has tradi-\ntionally been concerned with and that Profes-\nsor Peterman investigates\u2014cross ownership\nbetween radio and television, newspaper own-\nership and group ownership\u2014are not as im-\nportant for price behavior as is the role of the\nnetworks. The three networks own five sta-\ntions each\u2014all in large markets\u2014and have af-\nfiliations with more than 500 of the nation's\n700 commercial stations. Each network faces\nits two rivals in almost all markets. It may\nwell be that these three oligopolists largely de-\ntermine advertising rates.\n\nIt should be noted that Peterman's results\ncan be viewed as consistent with a pricing pro-\ncess that assigns a key role to the networks.\nPeterman's price variable is individual sta-\ntion's rates for national advertisers. To some\ndegree, national spot advertising and network\nadvertising are substitutes, though advertisers\ndo in fact often view them as complements.\nThe essential point is, however, that there is\nprobably a high degree of cross elasticity of de-\nmand between national spot and network ad-\nvertising. With the network oligopolists set-\nting similar prices per thousand, the link be-\ntween the national spot and network advertis-\ning markets may partially explain the similar-\nity of price per thousand among local stations\nin different markets. Peterman's finding of a\nhigh correlation between national spot and\nnetwork station rates also supports this view\nof price making.\n\nAs Peterman recognizes, the major concern\nwith ownership patterns is not with their im-\npact on the advertising market. We think the\nimportant concern may be their impact on the\ncontent of local news presentation and politi-\ncal processes in specific localities. Unlike most\nprime time programming, local news is pro-\nduced by the local station management and it\nis a commonplace that the ownership of sev-\neral stations or perhaps better yet some com-\nbination of the local newspaper, radio and\ntelevision station tends to insure that tele-\nphone calls to Washington, the State house,\nand City hall are returned promptly.

Hag-\ngling, explicit contracting, and enforcement\nare costly activities. I am much impressed by\nthe extent to which social intercourse and\nmarkets themselves rely on trust, tacitly un-\nderstood contracts, and, for enforcement, la-\ntent social or retaliatory pressures. Transac-\ntion costs can explain much behavior that has\nbeen unexplained and can correct many expla-\nnations that have been at least partly wrong.\n\nMy only criticisms are that Williamson\nmight have helped the reader by (1) showing\nmore fully how the various points fit together\nand (2) looking more consistently at property\nrights and thus probing further into the rea-\nsons for the behavior he describes.\n\n(1) The following way of presenting or\nsumming up the ideas might help one see the\nway Williamson's points fit together. Without\nvertical integration there are deals that would\nbe mutually advantageous at low transaction\ncosts but are not carried out because of high\ntransaction costs, and other deals that are car-\nried out but at unnecessarily high transaction\ncosts. These potential or actual deals include\ninformation exchange, product purchase, re-\ndistribution of risk bearing, elimination of in-\nefficient input combinations by the processor\nbecause of monopoly prices charged by com-\nponent manufacturers, and achievement of\ntechnological economies by arranging lower-\ncost transfer of components to the processor\n(e.g. molten iron to the steel mill). AIl of\nthese deals would amount to internalizing ex-\nternalities or taking interdependencies into\naccount, so I see no reason for a separate cate-\ngory of that sort. They are all externalities be-\ncause in each instance there is a cost being im-\nposed on, or a potential benefit being denied\nto, one firm or the other without contractual\nagreement. Moreover, these interdependencies,\nie. ones involving high transaction costs, are\nespecially pervasive in a dynamic world in-\nvolving product redesign, durable investments,\nand numerous contingencies.

This\nstudy is an attempt to fill part of this gap.\n\nWe have developed a model which per-\nmits us to estimate, through the use of a\nmicro data file, the effect of inflation (de-\nfined as a rise in the price level of goods\nand services) on the size distribution of\nreal income and net worth. The first step\nin its construction was the theoretical\nanalysis and empirical estimation, from\ntime series data from the post-World War\nII period in the U.S., of the effects of in-\nflation on the real value of various asset,\ndebt, and income \u00a3yfes (as listed in Ta-\nbles 1 and 2).

The Packer paper is asking appropriate\nquestions when it recognizes the endogenous\nnature of many budget outlays and empha-\nsizes the allocative effects of macroeconomic\nbudget decisions. On the other hand, it is an\narbitrary exercise of sorts, and there is no in-\ndication how reliable the results are compared\nto what would be generated by various exist-\ning econometric models. The experiment was\nessentially to compare two defense budgets,\nwith nondefense expenditures being forced to\nadjust to maintain a balanced full employ-\nment budget. Since the distribution of adjust-\nments within the government sector was arbi-\ntrary, little insight was gained concerning\nthese allocative effects. The primary value of\nthe Packer effort lies not in his specific alloca-\ntion results, but as an illustration of the need\nto consider the effects on resource allocation\nof fiscal and monetary policy.\n\nThe paper by Budd and Seiders takes such\na partial and exogenous view of inflation that\nI don't know how to react to their conclusion\nthat the redistributive effects of inflation are\n*small.\" It appears that they achieve their re-\nsult by assuming away many of the reasons\nfor expecting a change in the income distribu-\ntion.\n\nMy first concern is with the notion of infla-\ntion as something exogenous which can be ex-\namined in the absence of other influences. The\nrelationship between inflation and the price\nadjustment coefficients on sources of income\nand net worth may well depend upon the man-\nner in which the inflation is generated. Sec-\nond, the adjustment coefficients are assumed\nto apply uniformly across the distribution.\nFor instance, inflation is assumed to affect the\nwage income of all individuals proportionally.\nThere is substantial evidence to suggest that\nneither wage rates nor employment rates ad-\njust uniformly. Related to this is the author's\nassumption that inflation is assumed to be\nneutral with respect to its effect on unemploy-\nment, Their argument that the unemployment\neffect may be either negative or positive de-\n",

I have participated for\nnearly four years now in an interdisciplinary\nseminar on environmental problems organized\nby Dr. Morris Garnsey at the University of\nColorado, and the main thing I have learned\nin regard to environmental problems is the rel-\native backwardness of the physical and biolog-\nical sciences. It is frequently our ignorance of\nthe physics and chemistry of the atmosphere,\nor of the biology of large ecosystems, which\nholds us up on the practical side of environ-\nmental improvement. The physical sciences\nare good at the very small and the very large,\nbut when it comes to medium-sized systems\nlike the earth they often seem strangely igno-\nrant. Meteorologists do not realy know\nwhether man's activities are warming up the\nearth or cooling it down, and biologists do not\nreally know the effect of DDT on the bio-\nsphere. It is in this atmosphere of scientific ig-\nnorance that the wilder speculations of the en-\nvironmental eschatologists get taken as gospel,\nand many young people today seriously seem\nto believe that the earth will become uninha-\nbitable in their lifetimes, never having heard\nof ultrastability in complex systems. This is\nnot to deny, of course, the positive probability\nof irretrievable catastrophe, but I suspect it is\nmuch smaller than the doom-and-gloom school\nsuggests.\n\nBy comparison with the ignorance and even\nobscurantism of the natural scientists, eco-\nnomics stands out like a clear beacon of eigh-\nteenth century enlightenment. It is true that\nwe also have our lunatic fringe who virtually\ndeny the existence of public goods and public\nbads and think that all things can be done by\nprivate bargains between smoky railroads and\nrational dairy farmers. Kneese has done a\nfine-tuned job of intellectual assassination on\nthese types, such that no further comment is\nnecessary. If one had to sum up what econo-\nmists have to say on this matter in five or six\npropositions, the first would be that we pro-\nduce bads (pollution) because bads are jointly\nproduced with goods. The second is that nega-\ntive commodities (bads) should have negative\nprices, and the third is that public goods and\n",

A fourth proposition is that\ngoods depreciate and bads appreciate, follow-\ning the generalised and extended Second Law\nof Practically Everything, that all things slide\ndown towards a middle muddle unless some-\nbody does something about it, that is, unless\ninformation of the right kind is applied at the\nright time and place in the system. There is a\nfifth proposition that depreciation and appre-\nciation are not continuous functions of use or\nload, but exhibit threshold or overload phe-\nnomena, which is what causes crises. Crises in\nthe differential calculus are very rare. Unfor-\ntunately continuous functions, which are fine\nfor celestial mechanics, are characteristic of\nsocial mechanics only over small ranges of\nvariation, and most social problems arise be-\ncause of discontinuous functions\u2014the road\nthat suddenly jams up as one more car ap-\npears on it, the river that refuses to clean it-\nself up under a single addition of sewage, the\ninternational system that breaks down into\nwar, or the city that erupts into riot, when one\nsmall straw is laid on some existing back. This\nis one reason why mathematical models of this\nproblem should never assume continuous func-\ntions, but should always explicitly include\nsome kind of step-function or limit of each\nvariable at which the system breaks down. A\nsixth proposition, which I have been stating\non and off for years without anybody paying\nmuch attention, is that human welfare is a\nstate, condition, or stock rather than a flow\nvariable, though it may be related to certain\nflow variables such as variety or quality of in-\nputs such as food. What we think of as the\nenvironment, therefore, is simply part of the\ncapital stock of human welfare and must be\nevaluated as such. Nature has no values, un-\nless we count survival as a value; only man\nhas the effrontery to try to calculate a net\nworth for the universe, or at least for that\npart of it which is relevant to him. Conse-\nquently, when we are evaluating the environ-\nment, we are also evaluating man himself as\npart of a total system. What we think of as\n\"capital\" must include not only human arti-\nfacts, and human bodies and minds, but also\n",

There has been a concentration of both\neconomic analysis and international negotiat-\ning effort, almost to the point of obsession, on\nthe scheme of general tariff preferences formu-\nlated in the OECD and UNCTAD over the\nlast few years. Preferences will be useful, but\ntheir effects will not be very large for yet some\ntime. Professor Clague's estimates suggest\nonly modest trade improvement. In the mean-\ntime, almost nothing has been done to analyze\nthe wide range of nontariff barriers (N'TB's)\nwhich are of much greater significance to the\ndeveloping nations.\n\nProfessor Walter's interesting and con-\nstructive paper concentrates on NTB's main-\ntained by developed countries on imports of\nmanufactures. He observes that these NTTB's\nfall relatively more severely on imports of de-\nveloping nations. This is not surprising. If\nanything, I would have thought the discrimi-\nnation would be even greater. He is correct in\narguing that any NTB is more difficult for a\ndeveloping country exporter to cope with than\nan exporter in a rich country who has the re-\nsources, marketing apparatus, and quality\ncontrol experience to get around the impedi-\nments, or else jump them by building part of\nthe production apparatus in the market\nabroad. I do not on this account agree, how-\never, that NTB's should be liberalized ?refer-\nentially. Many of them derive from varying\nnational standards, taxation, labeling require-\nments, customs and administrative procedures,\nand so on. Most NTB's are tied to domestic\nsocial objectives, policies, and laws. For many\nof these, the basic problem is to bring some\nharmony into national practices through bet-\nter international rules and consultative proce-\ndures. The rules should aim at preventing the\npassing to foreign interests of the costs of do-\nmestic policies, or where such cost-passing oc-\ncurs, providing for compensation or other bal-\nancing adjustments. The most pernicious re-\nstrictions are the import quotas (often of the\nso-called *voluntary export restraint\" type).\nThese usually discriminate against developing\n\n206\n\n\u2014 ($5 - (P jo (b\n\nuU rem -\u2014 0n\n\nevo o m I A Cnm 1 7] R\u00c0 \u00c1o A 078 M ID\n\n^ -\u2014 MA -\u2014-|DO ITO I8\n\nCA mA LL do m\n",

A\nnew framework for liberalizing quotas multilat-\nerally is sorely needed, and a framework or\nguidelines to control fotential restrictions is\neven more badly needed. Particularly useful\nwould be new concepts or definitions of what\nconstitutes *market disruption\" and excessive\nlabor displacement by imports, so that practi-\ncal guidelines might be negotiated which\nwould limit the politically capricious behavior\nof the rich countries regarding so-called \"sen-\nsitive\" imports.\n\nOn this business of rationalizing NTB's, the\nsame need exists in the case of the developing\nnations. They maintain an amazing array of\ntrade barriers. Most of these harassment de-\nvices are not measurable. If all these impedi-\nments could be simplified and converted to\ntariffs, there would be several benefits. The\nimpediments could be measured and manipu-\nlated as instruments of development policy.\nThe use of tariffs would provide revenue for\ngovernments, in the place of high administra-\ntive costs now borne in the administration of\ncomplex procedures, and in place of the brib-\nery which is a natural partner of complexity.\nOn this Professor Balassa has nothing to say,\nand perhaps in the future he might broaden\nhis analysis to cover these matters.\n\nProfessor Walter's paper has a conspicuous\nomission, in leaving out agricultural N'TB's\nsuch as the European Common Agricultural\nPolicy, the Japanese rice program, and the\ntropical products taxes in Europe. These agri-\ncultural problems are becoming increasingly\npainful for all trading nations, with the\npoorer countries least able to cope with the\ncompetition of subsidies, and of protectionism.\n\nThere is increasing global recognition that\nthe headlong plunge into import substitution\nin many countries has been unwise.

KAumw: Our chairman has sug-\ngested we discuss the papers as a group, in\nterms of the common problem to which all are\naddressed\u2014the problem of comparing the cost\nand benefits of regulation. Actually, the Nel-\nson and Friedlaender papers are so different in\napproach, I doubt that an extended compari-\nson would be worth the effort.\n\nDr. Nelson defines benefits wholly in terms\nof rate reductions realized in a certain time\nperiod, and costs solely in terms of the costs\nof the administrative process itself. In so do-\ning, he is assuming that the efficiency of the\ncommunications industry is unaffected by reg-\nulation. His sole concern, on the *benefit\"\nside, is with the redistribution of surplus from\nsellers to buyers.\n\nProfessor Friedlaender, in contrast, says\nnothing about possible benefits or administra-\ntive costs, presumably because in the field of\ntransportation both of these are dwarfed by\nthe inefficiencies that regulation has forced on\nthe industry. But neither of the authors ad-\ndresses himself more than perfunctorily to\nother important aspects of industrial perfor-\nmance\u2014the quality of the product, the devel-\nopment of new services, the behavior of cost\nover time, and the degree of discrimination\namong  customers\u2014although  Friedlaender\ndoes consider these matters in her book. In-\ndeed, Nelson explicitly characterizes all tasks\nof regulation other than calculation of proper\ncosts and prices as \"relatively minor.\" Surely\nmost economists would feel, on the contrary,\nthat the influence of regulatory policy on what\nLeibenstein has called X-efficiency is poten-\ntially far more important than all its other\ntasks.\n\n\"These differences in the approaches of the\ntwo papers are certainly reflective, in part, of\nthe very different effects of regulation in the\nindustries they are studying; but there obvi-\nously are basic differences in economic percep-\ntion as well. The basic difference is, of course,\nthat the mere distribution of surplus between\nsellers and buyers is not a measure of social\neff\u00fcciency, as the economist would define the\nterm, whereas it is precisely social efficiency\nthat Friedlaender attempts to measure.\n",

                    "The only way to determine what kind of\ndifference regulation has made is to compare\nthe actual performance of an industry with\none's surmise of what it would have looked\nlike in the absence of government controls. By\nattributing all changes in rates between 1950\nand 1970 to regulation, Nelson in effect as-\nsumes rates would otherwise not have\nchanged, which is obviously absurd. Consider\nthe dramatic technological progress and pro-\ngressive achievement of apparently immense\neconomies of scale in long-distance communi-\ncations that have, even during a period of in-\nflation, made possible rate reductions which\nNelson credits to regulation; and inflation it-\nself, which has required increases in local tele-\nphone rates during the same period\u2014increases\nthat, by Nelson's calculus, would all have to\nbe chalked up as demonstrating that consum-\ners would be better off, dollar for dollar, had\nthere been no regulation. This kind of reason-\ning implicitly assumes, also, that it is the\nproper function of government to press only\nfor rate decreases, regardless of their impact on\nthe quality and availability of service\u2014a par-\nticularly dangerous attitude in time of infla-\ntion.\n\nAnd yet the primitive view is surely not\nwholly wrong. Regulation is a political institu-\ntion, and its first political mission is, indeed,\nto transfer surplus from suppliers to custom-\ners. I think the FCC does in fact deserve\ncredit for some large portion of the benefits\nNelson attributes to it, and that the result has\nbeen an enhancement (though a much smaller\none) of social welfare in the economic sense,\nas well. In my judgment, the historical record\nin communications amply supports the view\nthat unregulated monopolists cannot reliably\nbe counted upon to reduce rates over time as\nrapidly as would be justified by cost-reducing\ninnovation, economies of scale and the elastic-\nity of demand. But to assume, without even\nstopping to argue the point, that long-distance\ncommunications rates would have been abso-\nlutely constant during the 1950's and 1960's\nexcept for the FCC is surely unacceptable.\n\nProfessor Friedlaender enjoys an enormous\nadvantage from the fact that the causal im-\n",

There is no reason to doubt\nthat additional returns, as they come in, will\ncontinue to be interesting and convincing.\nWhether a 3.7 point gain on a 33-point scale\nis sufficient encouragement to make us con-\ntinue to offer the introductory course is open\nto debate. This figure is statistically signifi\ncant, thereby casting doubt on the Stigler\nhypothesis, and it is half as much as the\nretention. shown by previous tests given\nimmediately after the introductory course.\nNote also that the reported 11 percent\ngain (3.7/33) can be boosted to 15 percent\n(3.7/25) if the score of eight that would be\nobtained by purely random guesses is sub-\ntracted from the base of 33. The gain factor\ncan be further boosted to 24.5 percent if it is\ntaken as a percentage of the potential gain\n(3.7/15.1).\n\nAlso of interest is the finding that ability of\nrespondents is related to test scores, although\nweakly. One hundred points, on either the ver-\nbal or mathematics SATs, is worth about one\n",

Further similar results can\nbe expected as Saunders! research is pursued,\nthrowing light both on the main objective of\ntesting the direct effect of the introductory\neconomics course and also on the effects of\ncontrol variables such as the SATs, the type\nof college or university attended, and current\noccupations of the responding alumni. As is\nwell known, the effects contributed by uncon-\ntroled variables often supply some of the\nmost interesting results of a research effort.\n\nI have always had some doubts about the\nTUCE (Test of Understanding of College\nEconomics).  Thirty-three \u2014 multiple-choice\nquestions seem like a slender base on which to\njudge all the substance of two semesters of\neconomics. Subtracting eight points for correct\nanswers that could be gotten by chance, the\nspread is only twenty-five points; and a few\nmore points need to be subtracted from the\nbase to account for correct answers that al-\nmost anyone could get by applying some com-\nmon sense. There is also the nagging doubt as\nto whether multiple-choice questions can mea-\nsure achievement with respect to the analyt-\nical skills that one hopes to nurture in the in-\ntroductory economics course.\n\nDespite these doubts, I have become con-\nvinced that the TUCE is a good test. The in-\ndividual questions are well constructed; they\nreflect levels of understanding from simple to\ncomplex; and they have been subjected to\nbroad criticism and testing in the field. The\n\"hybrid\" test used by Saunders was made up\nfrom all of the original four TUCE tests and\nis at least as good as and probably better than\nany one of the four.\n\nResponses to Professor Saunders! question-\nnaire have yielded some colorful bonus results.\nThe volleys from the Left, nominating Profes-\nsor Saunders as capitalist pig professor of the\nweek, make a colorful contribution to the lit-\nerature. The volleys from the Right, nominat-\ning Professor Saunders as the socialist Com-\nmie dupe of the week, are equally eloquent. If\nsuff\u00fccient similar data are available, it might\nbe possible to test the hypothesis that, in the\nheat of emotion, Leftists are more likely to\nemploy four-letter words than Rightists.

Hause edges up to,\nbut does not deal directly enough with anal-\nyzing whether employers prefer to hire abil-\nities with respect to specific skills, or the\nability to learn (if there is such an identifiable\nability). If it will be possible to measure the\neffect of schooling on ability to learn, say if we\ncan determine the pace of learning or changes\nin the rate at which value is added to in-\ndividuals, we can improve our understanding\nof individual investment in school, in on-the-\njob training, and so on. It may be, for ex-\nample, that schooling and ability may interact\nin favor of the more able. This would satisfy\nthe apparent theoretical necessity (when re-\nturns to schooling are measured in monetary\nterms alone) that education give higher abso-\nlute marginal returns to the more able, in\norder for continued schooling to maintain a\nfavorable rate of return despite the higher\nforegone earnings of the more able. The inves-\ntigation of such possibilities will require at\nleast one more observation per individual than\nseems to be available in the data reported\ntoday. That is, we would need at least two\nwithin-school *ability? measures, as well as\npost-school earnings.\n\nHause assumes that there are some *com-\nponents\" of schooling which do affect the earn-\nings of individuals differentially exposed to\nthem, but which of the several he mentions\u2014\ncognitive achievement, socialization effects,\netc.\u2014which of these is most important he is\nnot prepared to say. And he does not include\nlearning to learn as a school component, as\nmentioned above. I would like to see more\nattention to this matter of school components,\nalthough I do not know if he has appropriate\ndata, as a contribution to the study of school\nproductivity. Econometric studies of this type,\nof course, are by their nature historical: in\nthe Rogers data which Hause uses, for ex-\nample, most men in the sample had received\nthe bulk of their education by World War II.\nEven the most skeptical observer of the edu-\ncational scene will surely agree that the proc-\ness and content, not to mention the duration\nand institutional forms, of schooling have\nchanged a good deal since then\u2014for better,\n",

GanNEmn: The papers by John\nHause and Eric Hanushek are complemen-\ntary: Hanushek deals with the production of\nschool achievement, and Hause with the ef-\nfect of achievement or ability as measured at\nsome point on earnings thereafter. It will soon\nbe time for studies which can unify these ap-\nproaches and deal comprehensively with the\ndevelopment of human resources and eco-\nnomic behavior, whether viewed narrowly in\nterms of money-income streams or more\nbroadly in terms of the allocation of time by\nindividuals to various kinds of activities.\n\nHause's paper is itself a partial report on\nsome research whose time has come. He is to\nbe commended for seeking out and refining\nlongitudinal, as opposed to cross-sectional,\ndata for the study of ability and income. If my\ninformation is correct, Hause shares the credit\nfor seeing to it that the Project TALENT sur-\nvey follow-ups obtained information on the\npost-school earnings of students. That longi-\ntudinal survey might otherwise have been de-\nvoid of such economic information. Hause's\nresearch should form a valuable contribution\nto the understanding of the ability-income\nproblem.\n\nIt is unfortunate that all four of the cohort\nsamples he is working on could not be in-\ncluded in this report\u2014even if the four groups\nare not readily comparable. What we are\nreally waiting for in this area are some results,\nwhich in the case of the data reported today\nare admittedly weak. In addition, it would be\ngood to have some idea of what is in the re-\nmaining data, so we can know what refine-\nments to expect. Hause's treatment of *'abil-\nity\" in the present paper, for example, is too\nvague. He defines ability loosely as \"learning\npower,\" but operationally he uses I.Q. scores.\nSuch scores measure ability in at least two\nways. First, they measure the achievement of\ncertain kinds of skills, that is, the ability to\nperform certain tasks. Second, they measure\nthe rate at which these certain tasks can be\nperformed. Such a confounding inheres in\nmost ability measures, not just in I.Q. scores.\nFurthermore, it is important to distinguish\nthe ability to learn from other possible in-\n",

I foresaw an impending\nproblem of over-supply of young PhD's\nseeking academic jobs in the 1970's and\nearly 1980's, rather than the catastrophic\nshortage of faculty that was commonly\npredicted.\n\nIn 1969, after four years away from the\nsubject, I returned for a reassessment,\nonly to find that the market situation for\nthe 1970's looked even worse than it had\nfrom 1964's vantage point. Few persons\nneed persuading of this fact today after\nthe last year of professional meetings and\ntheir somber evidence that good teaching\njobs are indeed becoming scarcer. Federal\ncutbacks in research and development ex-\npenditures, overtaxed state educational\nbudgets, and all the other factors Earl\nCheit has identifed as contributing to\n\"the new depression in higher education\"\nhave exacerbated the situation. Some per-\nsons believe that the present imbalance in\nthe academic labor market is a temporary\nphenomenon due to these latter factors.\nThe projections for economics presented\nin this paper, however, indicate that we\nare likely to experience a continuing im-\nbalance as far ahead as one can see due to\n",

He anticipated that\neconomics (including ag economics) would\ncomprise 1.396 of all Masters! degrees,\nand 396 of all PhD degrees. He used the\nUSEO projections of total numbers of\ndegrees at each of these levels as a basis\nfor his calculations. It seems that this was\nhis major mistake, but it is hard for one\ndepartment of the government to tell an-\nother its projections are no good, even if\nthey think so. I do not know what Clague\nthought in 1961, but the USOE record is\none of chronic underprediction of output,\nparticularly at the PhD level. We will\ncome back to this matter of overall projec-\ntions of PhD degrees a bit later. First for\na look at Clague's projections set against\nthe actual USOE output data for the\nyears 1961-1968, which is as far as the\ndata are available at this writing. Table 1\ngives the essential information.\n\nAt the MA level, Clague had projected\n1.395 of the degrees would be in econom-\nics; actually it turned out to be 1.466. At\nthe PhD level, he had assumed that 396 of\nthe degrees would be in economics; actu-\nally it turned out to be 3.3296. 1f the pro-\njections of total degrees upon which he\nhad based his calculations had been cor-\nrect, he would have underestimated by\nabout 796 at the MA level and about 1196\nat the PhD level, which I believe we\nwould call pretty good shooting. His ac-\ntual errors were about five times as great\n",

The fifty-\nfour departments surveyed (as of 1970\u2014\n71) include all those (36) with published\nreputational ratings in the 1965 Cartter\nreport, and practically all departments\nproducing PhD's at a rate of five or more\nper year in the most recent years for\nwhich information is available.\n\nA parallel survey of some selected de-\npartments of agricultural economics be-\ngun in 1962 with nineteen departments,\n(twenty-four are being surveyed in 1970\u2014\n71), gives additional and comparable in-\nformation in this field.\n\nSince my assigned topic is Recent Be-\nhavior of Economic Salaries,\" I must\nwarn you that I will be using these most\nrecent surveys to give an up-to-date pic-\nture of a large, but specialized and nonrep-\nresentative sector of the market for\neconomists. These survey economics de-\npartments granted the bulk of the PhD's\nin economics in the United States (more\nthan 85 percent of the total in recent\nyears). Similarly the departments of agri-\ncultural economics surveyed granted\nthree-quarters or more of the PhD's in\nthat field in recent years. These depart-\nments in a very real way set the tone for\nthe new PhD's view of the academic and\nnonacademic market place as he faces it\non the completion of his studies.\n\nThe fresh PhD, largely living in the\nstudent environment of these major de-\npartments, does not, in most cases, move\ninto this same type of departmental envi-\nronment, as a teaching and/or research\nScholar, as he moves to the faculty side.\n",

In con-\ntrast, the proponents of decentralization\nargue that further political fragmentation\nis required in order to provide greater\nvariety in local public services. The only\nconsensus, if any exists at all, is that pres-\nent institutions of local government are\ninefficient. However, nowhere in the litera-\nture do we find an explanation of why, in\nview of this inefficiency, change is so rare.\nAnnexations to the central city, relatively\ncommon at the turn of the century, ceased\nrather abruptly in most metropolitan areas\nafter 1918. Subdivision of the larger\npolitical jurisdictions in our metropolitan\nareas does not appear at all likely. Thus, it\nseems reasonable to ask of an adequate\ntheory of metropolitan political economy\nan answer to the question: why are existing\njurisdictional boundaries so impervious to\nchange?\n\n'To answer this question we must inves-\ntigate the impact of local governmental\nstructure not only on allocative efficiency\nbut on the extent of redistribution from\nrich to poor as well. In a recent study of\nsuburbs in the Philadelphia metropolitan\narea, Williams, e! al.

                    "RoLAND ARILE: \u00c1n average reader of\nbooks and papers in Urban Economics today\nis likely to emerge from the reading with a\nsense of frustration\u2014with a feeling of ending\nup in a cul-de-sac. He reads so many words\nabout the acute urban problems, about the\nurban crisis, but the words do not seem to\nlead anywhere. He follows the winding\nthoughts of the renowned analysts in the\nfield, only to find that they use partial-\nequilibrium approaches to problems which\nby all appearances and flavors are general-\nequilibrium (or general-disequilibrium) in\nnature.\n\nHowever, reading Ed Mills is an entirely\ndifferent story. In a series of ingeniously and\nskillfully varied, and truly pioneering, papers\nhe has opened up new vistas. Although one\ncannot properly describe his framework as a\ngeneral-equilibrium format, Mills has come a\nvery long way in that direction, in compari-\nson with the standard literature on location\nand urban land use. The main thrust of his\npresent paper (written together with D. de\nFerranti) lies in its analysis of congestion\ncost in relation to city size. The authors show\nthat the elasticity of urban costs (as they\ndefine costs) with respect to city size (defined\nas the number of workers in the CBD) is less\nthan unity for small cities and greater than\nunity for sufficiently large cities.\n\nAssuming the discussant's role as devil's\nadvocate, I shall now make some critical\nobservations about the Mills-Ferranti pa-\nper\u2014first some specific comments about a\nfew of the assumptions underlying their\nanalysis, and then some more general com-\nments relating to their criterion of optimal-\nity.\n\nA weakness of the analysis is that V, the\nnumber of workers employed in the central\ncity, is exogenously determined. This does\nnot, of course, mean that N is fixed; it can be\nvaried parametrically. However, convenience\ncomes at a price. With N exogenous, it\nwas apparently necessary to make E, the\nradius of CBD, exogenous. In turn, this\nmeans that within the central area of the\ncity, transportation and congestion costs are\nzero, the opposite of a real-world city. Re-\n",

Barrgy: The Spence-Zeckhauser\npaper presents a theory of optimum insurance\nprovisions when all premia are actuarial: util-\nity-maximizing zero-cost insurance, with and\nwithout moral hazards (which imply con-\nstrained, second-best optima), variously speci-\nfied. Its assumptions are clear, its analysis\nthorough and apparently rigorous. My com-\nplaints are almost editorial in character. First,\nthe insurer's utility function is implicitly risk-\nneutral; in his oral presentation, Spence clari-\nfied this point partly by saying that the in-\nsurer is the government. Thus the analysis\ncovers only the demand side of the picture,\nand that only for the case of actuarial premia.\n\nFurther, to generalize this material the au-\nthors should consider the supply side of insur-\nance and the response of demand to loading\ncharges. They might wish to consider private\ninsurers. Moreover, even on the government\nside, the assumption of no risk aversion is con-\ntroversial, to say the least, and deserves dis-\ncussion.\n\nKihlstrom and Pauly start out with the po-\ntentially fruitful idea that the insurance prob-\nlem is logically the same as the problem of\nportfolio choice and of Arrow's market for\ncontingent claims. Rigor and thoroughness are\nregrettably much less apparent in their paper\nthan in the preceding one, however, and the\nsecond half has little connection with the first.\nThey leap from the alleged failure of Borch's\nmodel to predict actual insurance market be-\nhavior to an explanation in terms of informa-\ntion costs, without reviewing other possible\nexplanations, without serious discussion of the\nevidence, and indeed without describing\nBorch's assumptions and analysis. Although\ninformation cost deserves the kind of atten-\ntion they give it, using it to \"explain\" every\napparent discrepancy between theory and ex-\nperience is a cop-out similar to giving the\nname \"technological change\" to every discrep-\nancy between actual and explained economic\ngrowth. While seeming to explain everything,\nit explains nothing, when it offers no testable\nhypothesis. (The discrepancy that concerns\nthem is that Borch predicts that each claim-\n",

As an afterthought, how-\never, I would point out that insurance compa-\nnies adjust premia by experience and set their\npremia to provide reserves for years of excep-\ntionally high claims. Moreover, if a company's\nlosses are large enough, it fails, and the claim-\nants get less than their policies promised.\nThrough these adjustments each policyholder\nshares in total insured losses.)\n\nAlthough the Kihlstrom-Pauly discussion of\ninformation cost has intuitive appeal, the idea\nof applying the well-developed theory of risk\nto the particular case of insurance has by far\nthe most unexploited potential. In their paper\nBrainard and Dolbear seem to recognize this\npoint and present a good review of the broad\nsweep of the subject. However, to follow them\none must get on his horse and ride off in all\ndirections; their paper tries to do too much.\n\nIn one section Brainard and Dolbear chide\nArrow \u00cd\u00edor his superficial argument using a\nriskless discount rate when evaluating pro-\nposed government investments. Although I\nshare their view, I would point out that Ar-\nrow's work falls into two distinct classes: first,\nthere is a massive collection of brilliantly\nunassailable work that has enriched our un-\nderstanding of many problems; second, there\nare some ideas that he keeps repeating, and\nthat we can expect that he will go on repeat-\ning (although we can't predict what reasoning\nhe will use to support them) regardless of the\nbrilliantly unassailable counter-arguments that\nthe rest of us bring against them. It is as\nmuch a waste of time to argue with him about\nthe second group of ideas as it is about the\nfirst. Moreover, after coming up with one of\nthese brilliantly unassailable counterargu-\nments, we find to our chagrin that others have\nalready come up with it at least twice before.\n\nThe rest of the Brainard-Dolbear paper of-\nfers a commendably comprehensive view of\nthe insurance market, among other things,\nproperly noting its similarity to markets for\nother risky claims (as did Kihlstrom-Pauly).\n",

It is also ar-\ngued that the larger and more cosmopolitan\nmarkets sustained in the settled and urban\nareas of the country augment the range of\nconsumer goods which again shift \"tastes\"\nfurther toward goods and activities that are\ncompetitive with children.\n\nEasterlin's treatment of these two mecha-\nnisms under the rubric of changing tastes does\nnot correspond with the economic concept of\ntastes; changes in tastes or indifference maps\nare inferred only when changes in relative\nprices and income do not account for system-\natic changes in demand. In the first instance,\nGary Becker's theory of choice based on the\nallocation of time provides a persuasive ra-\ntionale for the commonly observed inverse re-\nlationship between a woman's educational at-\ntainment and her fertility, given the assump-\ntion that children are a relatively time-inten-\nsive activity. The market-size hypothesis is\nmore obviously a case where demand responds\nto change in the relative scarcity prices of\ngoods and activities that are competitive with\nchildren. I do not want to discount the poten-\ntial importance of noneconomic factors that\nmay systematically mold preferences for child\nbearing and rearing versus alternative activi-\nties, but to infer that social, psychological, re-\nligious, or genetic factors independently influ-\nence parent tastes for children, analysis of\nnon-experimental data requires that the more\ntangible pecuniary returns of children linked\nto price and income effects also be isolated\nand taken into account simultaneously.\n\nFinally, Professor Easterlin comments on\nimmigration and internal redistribution of\npopulation as a factor influencing secular\ntrends and interregional differences in U.S.\nfertility, but a clear understanding of this\ncomplex topic will presumably have to await\nEasterlin's complete discussion of this subject.\n\nThus, five hypotheses are proposed to ac-\ncount for differences in fertility over time and\nacross seven census regions of the United\nStates. To support these hypotheses the\nfollowing evidence is noted: (1) fertility, indi-\nrectly measured by the ratio of children age 0\n",

                    "T. PAur ScnuurTz: Professor Easterlin pro-\nposes that man's reproductive behavior re-\nsponds to his environment. This working hy-\npothesis may seem unexceptional to most\neconomists, but many influential voices in the\ncurrent debate on population policy do not\nshare this view with economists. For exam-\nple, Professor Ehrlich at Stanford and his as-\nsociates appear to believe that fertility is z:-\nrelated to economic forces, and thus, they ac-\nknowledge only one avenue for effective policy\nto deal with high fertility and rapid popula-\ntion. growth\u2014namely, replacing individual\n\"free\" choice with a system of direct compul-\nSory reproductive quotas.\n\nEconomists have contributed relatively lit-\ntle to understanding the causes or conse-\nquences of the population problem, and they\nhave not clarified the welfare implications of\npolicies proposed to cope with rapid popula-\ntion growth. It is with a great deal of satisfac-\ntion that I note Professor Cain has under-\ntaken this task today, and that Professor\nEasterlin has called upon his extensive knowl-\nedge of U.S. historical data to confirm the en-\nvironmental responsiveness of fertility and\nthereby show the feasibility of another avenue\nfor policy\u2014namely, indirect population poli-\ncies operating through decentralized tax and\nexpenditure schemes.\n\nMore specifically, five hypotheses can be\ndistinguished in Easterlin's paper dealing with\nhow differences in environment motivate man\nto reproduce at different rates. In reverse or-\nder they are, first, the knowledge and accessi-\nbility of birth control which makes it less diffi-\ncult or costly to avert *unwanted\" births. The\nsecond and third hypotheses relate to the net\ncosts of children; it is suggested that food and\nhousing costs of children are greater and the\nreturns from child labor are less in urban than\nin rural areas. Similar differences in costs and\nreturns are thought to prevail between old and\nnewly settled regions of the country. Two\nfinal factors are identified as influencing\n\"tastes,\" but it must be noted that Easterlin\nuses the word taste in a special sense.

We shall have to\nkeep in mind the distinctions between in-\nformational decentralization and decen-\ntralization of decision-making authority;\nbetween the processes of plan construction\nand plan implementation; between imple-\nmenting a central plan by prescribing\nprices (or price-like parameters) or by issu-\ning quantitative commands; etc. But I\nshall ignore the many unresolved issues\nin these areas in order to focus on the rele-\nvance of decentralized planning proce-\ndures to the operation of the centrally\nplanned economies.\n\nBy centrally planned economies (CPEs)\nI mean those of Eastern Europe (excluding\nYugoslavia). Here again we must distin-\nguish between the standard Soviet-type\nsystem and the variants which have\nevolved in recent years. Hungary is at\npresent farthest from the standard system,\nso that the two other papers in this session\nshould indicate the range of institutional\nframeworks which I have in mind. In this\ncontext, I shall point out what seem to me\nto be the most important problems de-\nserving further research, and then suggest\nan example illustrating one aspect of a\ngeneral approach which seems likely to\nbe fruitful in such research.\n",

                    "Decentralized planning procedures are\nmodels which assume that the Central\nPlanning Board (CPB) cannot solve the\nplanning problem directly: i.e., either the\nCPB does not possess all necessary infor-\nmation regarding technology (and possibly\npreferences), or even if it had this informa-\ntion it could not directly solve the overall\noptimization problem (because of its size),\nor both. Hence there must be an exchange\nof information between the CPB and the\nvarious units into which the economy is\npartitioned, and typically some calcula-\ntions must be performed by units other\nthan the CPB (for examples of the litera-\nture, see [1], [2], [5, Chap. 23], [7], [8],\n[10, Chap. 24, 25, App. H], [11], [12],\n[13], [14], [17 ]). This kind of process does\noperate in all CPEs, but it bears little\nresemblance to the form of iterative search\nfor an optimal plan characteristic of the\nformalized decentralized planning proce-\ndures. In practice in the CPEs, plan con-\nstruction involves very few rounds of itera-\ntion between the CPB and lower-level\nunits. Much of the iteration in seeking a\nplan takes place within the CPB itself,\nand at the same time there is direct com-\nmunication between the lower-level units,\noften going through intermediate levels of\nan administrative hierarchy.\n\nThis kind of apparent discrepancy be-\ntween the models and the actual planning\nprocess raises the broader question of the\nobjectives of the models. In some respects,\nthey are descriptions of planning; in other\ncases, prescriptions of procedures for\n",

                    "On January 1, 1968 Hungary launched\nan economic reform. Its aim was to create\na type of socialist economic system in\nwhich the planned central control of the\nnational economy was organically com-\nbined with the functioning of the self-reg-\nulating market mechanism. 'The basic fea-\ntures of this reform are described in detail\nin Reform of the Economic Mechanism in\nHungary (ed. Istv\u00e1n Friss), Budapest,\nAkademiai Kiad\u00f3, 1969. Brief and com-\nprehensive appraisals were published also\nby American economists, as by Bela Ba-\nlassa in Economica, February 1970 and by\nRichard Portes in Te American Economic\nReview, May 1970. Because of this I can\nfocus attention here on the achievements\nand on some essential problems of further\ndevelopment of the Hungarian reform.\n\nThe almost three years which have gone\nby are not sufficient for a detailed and ex-\nact evaluation of the Hungarian experi-\nences, but there can be no doubt that our\nnew socialist economic mechanism has\nproven its superiority over the old one.\n\nIn 1970 Hungarian industry is expected\nto increase its output by 7-846 in con-\ntrast with 595 in 1968 and 396 in 1969.\nAn increase as rapid as this sometimes oc-\ncurred under the conditions of the old\nmechanism. But at that time it was caused\nprimarily by a large-scale increase in the\nindustrial labor force and led to unavoid-\nable difficulties in realization of the com-\nmodities produced, in supply of the popu-\nlation, and in foreign trade. Unsalable in-\nventories bulged and this damaged the ef-\nficiency of national economic accumula-\ntion. The supply of foodstuffs did not\n",

In 1970,\nhowever, the rapid increase in industrial\nproduction is taking place on a more\nhealthy basis. Sales for final use (for do-\nmestic consumption, investments in fixed\ncapital and exports) are increasing faster\nthan industrial production. Employment\nin industry is growing only about 196. As\na result of the increasing output in indus-\ntry and other branches of the national\neconomy, the national income is expected\nto be about 696 higher than it was last\nyear despite the poorer agriculture year.\n\nIt looks as if we have succeeded in\novercoming the chronic problem of exag-\ngerated increase in inventories. While\nprior to the reform the yearly increase of\ninventories came to 696 of the GNP, and\nthis was also true of the first year of the\nreform (1968) as well, this proportion\ndropped to 3.495 in 1969 and will be\nabout the same in 1970.\n\nBut the favorable effects of the new\nmechanism are developing most rapidly in\nthe field of foreign trade.

In this frame-\nwork, one examines the flow of information\nbetween a center (Portes! CPB) and a periph-\nery (Portes! enterprises). This flow will be\nsaid to converge when the messages in both\ndirections, after sufficient iteration, say (es-\nsentially) the same thing, so that center and\nperiphery are agreed on a course of action.\nThis process resembles actual planning prac-\ntices, and if the iterative process can be shown\nto converge, then a similar process, truncated\nafter a few iterations, should produce mes-\nsages which are approximations to the limit\nmessage.\n\nAn attractive feature of the general model is\nthat Walrasian general equilibrium is a special\ncase of it in which the *auctioneer\" plays the\nrole of the center. In this sense, the new litera-\nture is a true generalization of economic the-\nory. But there is one important reason for us\nto be careful about too rapid an application of\nthe model to planned economies.\n\nThe literature on competitive prices starts\nby defining and demonstrating the existence\nof an equilibrium price, and the stability of\nthis equilibrium. It then shows that a tatonne-\nment mechanism will converge to this equilib-\nrium. In a planned economy, an equilibrium\nplan is one which (if adopted) would not be\nchanged unless some exogenous part of the\neconomy changes. Presumably an equilibrium\nplan would be stable if small deviations of\nplan from the equilibrium would tend to be\ncorrected. A difficulty about discussions of it-\nerative planning is that they ignore the possi-\nbility that the iterations will converge to a\nplan which is not an equilibrium plan. We do\nnot know enough about equilibrium to investi-\ngate this possibility, even in simple cases like\nthose studied by Portes.\n\nThe practical importance of this question\n",

                    "EpwanRp Ars: Twelve years ago, I deliv-\nered a paper at these meetings which had\nprobably less impact on the profession than\nany other paper delivered before or since. It\ndiscussed the question of general equilibrium\nin Soviet-type economies, at a time when it\nwas thought possible to discuss such econo-\nmies without the use of any theory. It is a\ngreat pleasure to note the change that has\ntaken place in the last few years, and, in par-\nticular, to comment on Professor Portes! pa-\nper.\n\nPortes attempts to relate a new and growing\ntheoretical literature on the theory of eco-\nnomic systems to a literature on the planned\neconomies of Eastern Europe. There are at\nlast grounds for hope that a rapprochement\nbetween theory and fact may take place in\nthis corner of economics. Portes' paper makes\nit clearer what problems remain to be solved\nbefore the task is complete.\n\nIn recent years, theorists have developed a\nnumber of mode!s of economics which are not\ncompetitive price systems. These include the\ngreed and quasi-competitive processes (Hur-\nwicz), the D-process (Camacho), and the sto-\nchastic adjustment processes (Hurwicz-Rad-\nner-Reiter). These are the first artificial econ-\nomies designed by professional economists;\nwhile less flamboyant than earlier utopian\nwritings, they are at least intelligible. More-\nover, they are analytically interesting, and\nhave certain features which make them attrac-\ntive to students of Eastern Europe. Portes\nmakes a useful start in exploring their applica-\nbility as models of empirical planning systems.\n\n\"The theoretical literature started from Hay-\nek's conjecture that informationally decen-\ntralized economies were more efficient than\ncentralized economies. Hurwicz's first papers\nattempted to explore decentralized economies\nwhich were not competitive price economies.\nCamacho has recently challenged Hayek's\nconjecture, for he has constructed a number of\nvery similar systems, one of which is most effi-\ncient if completely centralized, a second if\npartially centralized, and a third if completely\ndecentralized. Since there are no theorems on\nthe conditions in which centralized (or decen-\n",

                    "When inquiring into the area implied by\nthe title of this paper, I first ran into\nthe problem of specifying what was meant\nby decentralization. My first thought was\nthat it was similar to the process undergone\nin recent years by the armed services and\nsome business firms. In this context\ndecentralization implies that the larger\norganization confines itself to setting the\nbroader goals of policy, while turning over\nauthority to make specific decisions to\ningredient units of the organization\nunder a well-defined set of rewards and\npunishments. For example, instead of\nallotting specific types of new equipment\nand supplies to its ships, the central com-\nmand in the Navy might allot sums of\nmoney, leaving the spending\u2014thus the\ndecision how those resources might be used\nmost effectively to increase the ship's\nworthiness\u2014to the ship's captain. The\nrewards and punishments used by the\nNavy to provide the necessary behavioral\nstimulus to the ship's officers are funda-\nmental to this process, but need not be\ndetailed here owing to their familiarity.\nBut a moment's reflection leads one to\nconclude that fiscal decentralization in the\nU.S. is quite different since it involves\nsovereign ingredient units. That is, the\nnature of the rewards and punishments by\nwhich the federal government imposes its\npolicy on states and localities is vastly\ndifferent from that internal to most orga-\nnizations. To be sure, the federal govern-\nment can offer carrots in the form of\nmatching grants, but it cannot compel the\nkind of tax-expenditure performance by\nstates and localities consistent with the\nusual notion of decentralization.\n",

GokErz: The Bradford-Oates\npaper rederived, in a public choice budgetary\nmodel, the theorem that matching grants are\nmore stimulative than lump-sum grants of\nequivalent amount. The essentials of their\nanalysis are correct, albeit perhaps more\ndrawn-out than necessary. Somewhat para-\ndoxically, the gist of my critique is that they\nclaim both too little and too much for their\nanalysis.\n\nThere are advantages in reframing their\nproof in simple opportunity-set terms. In\nswitching from the matching to the lump-sum\nform, each voter in effect exchanges the trian-\ngular set of opportunities FJC in their Figure\n5 for the set FAH. But the pivotal median\nvoter and all inframedian voters are known to\nhave rejected, under the matching grant, all\nother opportunities in favor of some point in\nFAH, namely one on line segment AF.\n\nThus, we can deduce that under the block\ngrant, when the only loss is the \"irrelevant\"\nset FJC, all voters in a controlling coalition\nmust again choose some point in FAZ. In the\nhighly improbable limiting case, the results of\nthe matching and block grants would be iden-\ntical; in all other cases, the matching grant\nwould be more stimulative because the median\nvoter finds some point in FAH preferable to\nthe matching grant equilibrium F. This alter-\nnative proof does not require convexity of\npreferences, an assumption Bradford and\nOates feel limits their results.\n\nHowever, even the original proof offered by\nBradford and Oates is not, as they claim, lim-\nited either to a single collective decision rule\nor to a single public good. If, for instance, a\nqualified majority rule requiring a two-thirds\nvote to alter the status quo were adopted, the\nalternative budget lines would merely be pi-\nvoted through the matching-grant optimum of\nthe voter whose preference marks the mini-\nmum required coalition. The rest of the analy-\nsis follows as above.\n\nWith respect to the multipublic good model,\na slightly modified version of the Hicks com-\nposite good theorem can be applied since we\ncan isolate a subset of goods whose relative\nprices remain constant.

Figure 5 can be interpreted as\na composite consisting of the suboptimized\nequilibrium bundles of all goods, public and\nprivate, except the public good eligible for the\nmatching-grant subsidy. Hence, the results of\nthe paper are not really restricted to the case\nof a single public good.\n\nIt is from a methodological standpoint that\nI would fault the authors for implying exces-\nsive generality. As they acknowledge in the\nopening section, multiperson public choice\nmodels are designed to supplant the inappro-\npriate, single-preference models of government\ndecision making. Also, they allude to the\nGoetz-McKnew paper which derives contra-\ndictory results. If the Bradford-Oates and\nGoetz-McKnew models are each internally\ncorrect, as I believe they are, the choice be-\ntween their contradictory results may be\nbased on the appropriateness of the models.\nThe Bradford-Oates model, as generalizable to\nn public goods, is Wicksellian in the sense that\ntax level and the mix of public goods are the\nsubject of a single voting decision. The Goetz-\nMcKnew model, by contrast, was explicitly\ndesigned to reflect so-called \"general funds\"\nbudgeting in which an overall public budget is\ndetermined in one decision, while the relative\nallocations to individual public goods are de-\ntermined in another decision. While I will not\nbe dogmatic about which model more nearly\nfits most of the cases in the real world, you\ncan guess the direction of my biases.\n\nFinally, while this is in no sense a criticism,\nI should point out that the Bradford-Oates re-\nsults are atypical of public choice models in\nthe sense that they are able to validate a theo-\nrem derived in the single-preference models.\n",

The Leontief results and\nthose from similar investigations of other\ncountries! effectively destroyed the com-\nfortable confidence of economists in the\nsimple version of the Heckscher-Ohlin\ntrade theory that had long been accepted\nmainly on the basis of casual empiricism.?\nHowever, the *Leontief paradox\" also\nstimulated extensive theoretical and em-\npirical research directed at providing alter-\nnative explanations for the commodity-\npattern of a country's trade. The purpose\nof this paper is to test the main alternative\nhypotheses that have been advanced for\nthis purpose, as well as the simple Heck-\nScher-Ohlin theory itself, by using 1958\n\n* Professor of economics, University of Wisconsin,\nMadison. Research for the paper was financed by a\ngrant from the National Science Foundation.\n\n1See Masahiro Tatemoto and Shinichi Ichimura,\nDonald F. Wahl, Ranganath Bharadwaj, and Karl W.\nRoskamp.\n\n? The simple Heckscher-Ohlin theory is a model in\nwhich only capital, labor, and natural resources are the\nfactors of production, and in which such factors as\neconomies of scale and differences in technology do not\nplay a part in determining comparative-cost differences\namong nations. It should be recognized, however, that\nBertil Oblin, even when presenting what he regarded\nas a simplified version of bis model, divided labor into\nthree skill groups and capital into long-term and short-\nterm capital. Nevertheless, over time most economists\nhave come to label trade models with a two- or three-\nfactor breakdown as simplified versions of the Heck-\nscher-Ohlin theory. More important, they have believed\nthat the broad pattern of a country's trade could be\nadequately explained with a simple two- or three-factor\nmodel. See, for example, Karl-Erik Hansson.\n"

The lifetime income\nof a zero-saver man 60 years old would have\nto be just half of the lifetime income of a\nzero-saver man 40 years old if this factor\nwere to explain savings behavior by itself.\n(Assuming that economic growth leads to a\nreal rate of growth of 2 percent per year in\nfamily income, the average lifetime income\nof a 40 year old is 44 percent higher than that\nof a 60 year old.) At the other end of the\nscale, the lifetime income of a zero-saver\nman 20 years old would have to be less than\nthe lifetime income of a zero-saver man 40\nyears old to explain the estimated results. I\ncan swallow the former but not the latter.\n\nGiven identical and homothetic prefer-\nences, I agree with Motley and Morley that\nequation (1) is the correct estimating equa-\ntion. Jt is exactly the equalion which I used.\nThe problem is to measure the general\naverage lifetime income (IW) and the average\nlifetime income of the zero saver (W*). In\n",
