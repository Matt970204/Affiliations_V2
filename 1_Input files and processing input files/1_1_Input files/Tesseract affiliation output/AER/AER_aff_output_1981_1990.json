Consider first the determi-\nnants of rapid export growth. Government\npolicies in all the superexporters were clearly\nset within the context of a commitment to\ngrowth through exporting. Several policy in-\nstruments were geared to those targets: the\nreal exchange rate received by exporters, the\nimport regime as it affected reexports, and\nthe infrastructure (ports, domestic transport,\ncommunications with the outside world by\nphone and mail) necessary for exporting all\nwere determined by the needs of the export\ndrive. (See Kwang Suk Kim, 1987, and\nRichard Snape, 1988, for documentation.)\n\nIn every country with a successful devel-\nopment-through-exporting strategy, export-\ners were exempted from whatever restric-\ntions prevailed in the import regime. This\nwas not only necessary for success in ex-\nporting, but it restricted the extent to\nwhich officials could monitor and regulate\nimports. Further, the government's commit-\nment to exporting was an implied assurance\nof the profitability for successful exporting\nfirms. While some of the NICS initially pro-\nvided export subsidies, subsidized credit, and\nother special privileges for exporters, all of\nthese became costly as the export drive suc-\nceeded, and there was therefore perpetual\npressure on government officials to increased\nreliance on the exchange rates and uniform-\nity of incentives. In Korea, for example, Kim\n(Table 2.10) estimates that the effective ex-\nchange rate for exports was within 6 percent\nof that for imports for every year after 1965;\nthe variation of incentives between import-\ncompeting and exportable commodities was\nfar smaller than in the typical import-sub-\nstitution regime.\n\nIt is certainly not correct to state that the\ngovernments in the export-strategy countries\n",

                    "The Asian experience with trade and\ngrowth has been highly varied. There is\na strong contrast between the success of\nthe East Asian \"superexporters,\" the still-\nimpressive but less rapid growth of South-\neast Asia, and the sluggish growth of much\nof the South Asian subcontinent, including\nespecially India, Burma, Nepal, and Bangla-\ndesh.\n\nNo observer of the success of the East\nAsian exporters can doubt that exports\nplayed a key role in accelerating growth.\nAlthough the relationship between growth of\nreal per capita GNP and of exports is cer-\ntainly not perfect, Korea's export growth\nrate of 22.9 percent accompanied an average\nannual growth rate of per capita income of\n6.4 percent over the 1965-87 period. Hong\nKong, Singapore, and Taiwan were also\nrapidly growing economies whose growth of\nexports outpaced that of income. By con-\ntrast, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Pak-\nistan all experienced annual rates of growth\nof per capita income of less than 3 percent,\nand had falling shares of exports in GNP.\nFor Bangladesh and Nepal, growth rate and\nexport performance were even worse.\n\nIt bears pointing out that the successful\nEast Asian countries had their earlier experi-\nence with inner-oriented trade strategies,\nquantitative controls over imports, and slow\ngrowth. In each case, the shift in trade strat-\negy was accompanied by a sizeable increase\nin the rate of growth of output, in the\nmarginal productivity of capital as judged by\nthe behavior of the incremental capital out-\nput ratio, and in total factor productivity.\n",

The\nensuing discussion centered on two issues\nraised by the report\u2014unbundling\" and\n\"open\" submissions.

It was under-\nstood that the JEP editor would continue to\nendeavor to insure that the contents of the\njournal are weighted heavily toward the pref-\nerences of the general membership rather\nthan *the establishment,\" that is, the editor\nshould continue to pursue the goal for which\nthe journal was founded.\n\nReport of the Editor of the American Eco-\nnomic Review (Ashenfelter). As his only item\nof business, Ashenfelter asked that John\nKennan's term on the AER's Board of Edi-\ntors be extended by one year. It was VOTED\nto accept his recommendation.\n\nReport of the Editor of the Journal of Eco-\nnomic Literature (Pencavel) Pencavel re-\nported that he was currently negotiating with\na firm to make the bibliographic material in\nthe JEL available on compact disc in addi-\nt\u00fcon to the Indexes and Dialog. He also\nraised the possibility of returning to the for-\nmer policy of paying authors for articles that\nthe JEL commissioned. He was beginning to\nrealize some competition for review-type ar-\nticles from the JEP. It was generally con-\nceded that review articles for the JEL were\nmore difficult and time consuming to write\nand that payment might be necessary. No\ndecision was made.\n\nReport of the Editor of the Journal of Eco-\nnomic Perspectives (Stiglitz). Stiglitz  dis-\ntributed the tentative Table of Contents for\nthe next few issues of the journal.

Judg-\ning from the formal and informal responses\nthe Editors have received, it seems to have\ncarved out a niche for itself in the world of\neconomics journals.\n\nThe main formal feedback the Journal has\nreceived was from an Ad Hoc Committee of\nthe AEA, headed by William Baumol, that\nwas set up to examine the contents and\nfinancing of this journal. To help inform its\ndeliberations, the Committee carried out a\nsurvey of about 1000 AEA members in mid-\n1988. The final report of the Committee was\npresented to the Executive Committee in\nMarch 1989.\n\nAmong other findings, the Committee\nnoted: *Most members of the AEA like the\nJEP. Its average approval rating is not sig-\nnificantly different from that accorded to the\nAER or JEL.\" This finding was especially\nencouraging to the Editors since, at the time\nof the survey, respondents had seen only\nthree or four issues of this journal. The Bau-\nmol report recommended that \"the Exec-\nutive Committee of the AEA reaffirm its\nsupport of the JEP,\" and the Executive\nCommittee did so at its March 1989 meeting.\n\nIn the four issues of 1989, the Journal has\ncontinued to touch upon a broad range of\ntopics in a broad range of formats. The\nissues of 1989 included seven symposia:\nwomen in the labor market, the budget\ndeficit, auctions, real business cycles, the sav-\nings and loan crisis, seniority and wages, and\nsocial norms. They also included 5 articles\nabout famous economists (Sen, two on\nSolow, Schelling, and Hicks); 15 articles on\nvarious other topics, ranging from chaos the-\nory and experimental economics to corpo-\nrate bankruptcy and environmental eco-\nnomics to the role of potential competition\nand the political economy of trade policy,\nand others. In addition, the Journal also\ncontinued publication of three regular fea-\ntures (^ Puzzles,\" *Anomalies,\" and *Recom-\n",

In 1990, the\nJournal intends to start two additional fea-\ntures, one of which will appear in each issue:\n* Retrospectives\" on topics in the history of\neconomic thought, and *Policy Watch\" on\ntopics of current policy interest.\n\nIn total, the 1989 issues of the Journal\nincluded 832 pages, consisting of 38 articles,\n5 introductions or very brief articles, 11 of\nthe features articles, plus Notes and Corre-\nspondence.\n\nAs this rich and varied flow of material\nindicates, the decentralized editorial proce-\ndures of the Journal have continued to work\nwell. The Associate Editors have produced a\nsteady stream of ideas and authors, enabling\nthe Journal to draw on a large group of\neconomists from different geographical areas\nand with diverse interests and perspectives.\nAfter several years of operation, a process of\nnatural turnover among the Associate Edi-\ntors seems to have begun, thus allowing sev-\neral new members to bring their ideas to the\nJournal each year.\n\nIn fact, the Associate Editors have been so\ndiligent that the issues of 1990 are almost\nfully booked already, and advance planning\nfor 1991 is well underway. The Editors are\ndelighted to report that this high level of\noutput has not meant any decrease in qual-\nity. Rather the reverse seems to be true: after\nten issues, authors for the Journal now have\nmodels of the sort of exposition the Journal\nis seeking, and they are working hard to live\nup to the standards of previous authors.\n\nThe incumbent Associate Editors who\nwill continue into 1990 are: Henry Aaron,\nThe Brookings Institution; Pranab Bardhan,\nUniversity of California-Berkeley; Dwight\nJaffee, Princeton University; Edward Lazear,\nUniversity of Chicago and The Hoover Insti-\ntution; Mark Machina, University of Cali-\nfornia-San Diego; N. Gregory Mankiw, Har-\nvard University; John Roemer, University of\nCalifornia-Davis; Kenneth Rogoff, Univer-\nsity of California-Berkeley; Bernard Saffran,\n",

The usual caveat\ndefinitely applies.\n\nl'The authors of Prospect Theory call their model\n\"descriptive\" as opposed to \"normative,\" but do not\nconsider it ad Aoc because of its connections with the\npsychophysical literature. However. no substantial con-\nnections of Prospect Theory with generally accepted\neconomic principles (for example, optimality) have pre-\nviously been demonstrated. It is in this narrow\neconomist's sense that I use the term ad Aoc.

The effect of additional determinants of motor vehi-\ncle fatalities have been investigated by others. Loeb\n(1985, 1987, 1988), Loeb and Benjamin Gilad (1984),\nVictor Fuchs and Irving Leveson (1967), and W. Mark\nCrain (1980) evaluated motor vehicle inspection; Philip\nCook and George Tauchen (1984), Peter Asch and\nDavid Levy (1987) and Loeb (1987) evaluated the mini-\nmum legal drinking age; Loeb (1987, 1988), Paul Som-\nmers (1985), and Thomas Forester, Robert McNown,\nand Larry Singell (1984) considered the impact of aver-\nage speed on rural interstate highways, alcohol con-\nsumption, and speed limits.\n\n?See, for example, Loeb (1985, 1987), Loeb and\nGilad, and Crain for a further discussion on this.\n\n? Disaggregated data, as used by Lave, provide an\naccounting of deaths based on the site of the accident,\n\n916\n\nfor example, whether it was on a rural interstate, urban\ninterstate, etc. It does not account for fatalities on a\nparticular roadway due to driving conditions on a dif-\nferent type of roadway prior to the accident. More\nprecisely, it does not take into consideration the \"speed\nadaptation effect,\" where drivers exiting a high-speed\nroadway tend not to reduce speed so as to match the\nspeed of the slower traffic on the newly entered roadway\nin a timely manner. (See Insurance Institute for High-\nway Safety, February 1987). It has been estimated that\nthe \"adaptation effect\" persists even after several miles\nof travel on a connecting road. (See Insurance Institute\nfor Highway Safety, January 24, 1987, p. 5). This effect\ncannot be minimized given that between 1978 and 1980,\n24.4 percent of all fatal accidents occurred at intersec-\ntions. (See National Safety Council, 1981, p. 46). Aggre-\ngate data obviously do not suffer from the dilemma of\nproperly assigning a particular fatality to the proper\ncontributing roadway.\n\nIn addition, the coefficients associated with speed in\nLave's study are always insignificant and they are nega-\ntive in ten of the twelve specifications. As such, one\nwould expect similar results using aggregate data. This\nis not the case. Rather, the coefficient associated with\nspeed is generally significant and always positive.\n\nFinally, Yehuda Grunfeld and Zvi Griliches (1960,\np.10) indicate, * that aggregation is not necessarily bad\nif one is interested in aggregates.\" They indicate that\naggregation not only leads to an aggregation error but\nto an aggregation gain as well. This gain due to aggrega-\ntion may be related to misspecification of the micro-re-\nlation as well as measurement errors in the regressors.\nLave's model may be affected by specification errors\ndue to the omission of the socioeconomic and driving-\nrelated variables.\n\n^A more disaggregated set of data and weights was\nnot available. The models, however, were evaluated\n"

Losses that\nare larger than 1 percent and usually larger than 3\npercent are reported by David Kamerschen, 1966, and\nKeith Cowling and Dennis C. Mueller, 1978, for the\nUnited States. The losses may be large in the UK\naccording to Cowling and Mueller, 1978, and Malcolm\nC. Sawyer, 1980, and in France according to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick\nJenny and Andr\u00e9-Paul Weber, 1983.

                    "BanRYv BLUESTONE, University of Mas-\nsachusetts-Boston: The New Industrial State\nhad the misfortune of being written precisely\non the cusp of postwar economic history. In\n1967, America was just completing two de-\ncades of unparalleled economic expansion;\nthe ratio of imports to GNP suggested that\nthe United States was equally as insulated\nfrom the rest of the world's economies as it\nhad been in 1929; and corporate profits were\nnear their post- World War II peak. In this\nshort-lived niche in time, American corpora-\ntions appeared to be in charge of their own\ndestinies\u2014to be in control of their markets\nrather than to be controlled by them.\n\nIn the following decade, of course, Amer-\nica's preeminence in the world was severely\nchallenged. Imports as a proportion of GNP\nnearly doubled and profits began a long-term\nslide that would not end until the beginning\nof the 1980's. In rhis environment, the cor-\nporation did lose much of the control it once\nexercised. The important point, however, is\nthat the chief function of the * technostruc-\nture\" that runs the firm has by no means\nbecome obsolete. Along the lines of the\ncentral theme in TNIS, corporate managers\nset out to develop new strategies that could\neffectively supersede, circumvent, or control\nthe market. From the vantage point of 1967,\nGalbraith would have had to possess ex-\ntraordinary powers of premonition to pre-\ndict exactly how managers would eventually\ncope with the changed environment. But\nwhat Galbraith did establish back then\u2014and\ncontinues to teach us today\u2014 is that in the\nface of inevitable change, the technostruc-\nture will not sit idly by, subject to rigid\nLagrangian constraints, but instead will use\nall of its power to develop fresh strategies to\ncope with new exigencies.\n\nTNIS was an early inquiry into what\nmakes corporate managers tick. Presumably\nunderstanding their motivation and their\nmodus operandi would provide a window\nthrough which the entire economy could bet-\nter be appreciated. While this particular\naperture might seem small, its central loca-\ntion in political economy suggested that,\npeering through it, we might gain more in-\n",

To make this\nenormous set of issues manageable, critics\noften reduce the debate over TNIS to the\nmore limited question: do corporations profit\nmaximize? Yet, even here, where the tradi-\ntional economist presumably has the home\ncourt advantage, Galbraith's insight survives.\n\nIn the environment of record profits dur-\ning the 1960's, it is altogether reasonable\nthat corporate management could and did\nallow other goals beside maximum profit to\ncreep into their calculus\u2014 maximizing share\nof market, paying bonuses to itself or to its\nworkforce, or even engaging in hedonisti-\ncally motivated philanthropic activity (i.e.,\ndonating other people's money!) But as rates\nof return on capital slipped from nearly 10\npercent in 1965 to an average of less than 6\npercent during the entire decade of the\n1970's, managers were forced to switch\nstrategy. From long-term profit *satisficing\"\nduring a period of extraordinary rates of\nreturn, firms had to shift gears to con-\ncentrate almost singlemindedly on short-term\nprofit maximization.\n\nWhile Galbraith admittedly failed to fore-\nsee the enormous impact of \"the invasive\nthrust...of Japan and the other Pacific coun-\ntries\" on profits or the degree to which cor-\nporate raiding would force the existing tech-\nnostructures to concentrate on the bottom\nline, the overall point still stands: when cor-\nporations are flush they can afford to pursue\nother goals beside pure profit maximization\nand they do; when profits are threatened,\nthey subjugate all other desires and motives\nto simple short-term greed. In fact, by the\nend of the 1970's, the shift in strategy from\nprofit satisficing to profit maximizing was\nsufficiently widespread to account for some\nof the stagflation that arose. In the face\nof shrinking demand, corporate managers\nshifted from a market share maximizing game\nplan to the standard neoclassical strategy, in\nthe process raising prices.\n",

His\nanalysis deals with the meaning of barriers to entry in\nindustrial organization. In that context, licensure is\nanalogous to trademark, copyright, and patent restric-\ntions (p. 56). As he points out (pp. 47-49), since costs\nare opportunity costs, the traditional concept of barriers\nto entry in industrial organization\u2014as certain firms\nhaving cost advantages due to the ownership of specific\nresources\u2014is meaningless. Even if specific assets are\nnot resalable between firms, their use still represents a\ncost to the extent that firms are ultimately resalable. I\nshall argue that while the traditional approach is usually\ninappropriate in analyzing firm behavior, it does have\nunrecognized implications for individuals since individ-\nuals are not salable. This dis\u00fcnction between firms and\nindividuals extends beyond licensing. For instance, an\nindividual's *goodwill,\" unlike a firm's brand name, can\nserve as a barrier to entry because of its nonsalability\n(see my 1986 and 1987 papers).\n"

The usual caveat applies.\n\n!A. L. Bowley (1928) recognized that bilateral mo-\nnopolists will agree to exchange the joint profit-maxi-\nmizing quantity of the intermediate product. Otherwise,\nthe firms will not be on the contract curve. Given this\nquantity, the firms must then negotiate the price of the\nintermediate good. This price will determine how the\nmaximized joint profits are divided between the two\nstages of production. For an interesting survey of the\nearly literature dealing with bilateral monopoly, see\nFritz Machlup and Martha Taber (1960). As Oliver\nWilliamson (1971, 1974) explains, each firm will expend\nresources on the price negotiation process up to the\npoint at which the marginal cost of further negotiation\nequals the marginal revenue that such negotiation yields.\nSuch expenditures represent a drain on the total profits\navailable. Thus, firms may vertically integrate to avoid\nthis negotiation.\n\n?7Vertical integration may involve managerial dis-\neconomies (Williamson, 1973), increased capital costs\n(Williamson, 1974), and substantial costs of negotiating\nthe price of the acquired firm.\n\n*On contractual alternatives generally, see our 1983\nstudy.

They have\nforced the Congress to fit the pieces together,\nto debate and vote on an overall taxing\nand spending plan\u2014a budget resolution \u2014 to\nwhich specific taxing and spending matters\nmust conform. No one can say that the\nCongress in the last few years has ignored\nfiscal policy! The creation of the Congres-\nsional Budget Office, moreover, has given\nCongress independent access to forecasts,\nprojections, and analysis of economic op-\ntions.\n\nThe downside of the budget reforms, how-\never, was that the budget process was super-\nimposed on the already complex responsi-\nbilities of authorizing, appropriating, and tax\ncommittees. It has added to the layers and\nstages of congressional policymaking without\nremoving any of them, has made the process\nof budget decision making nearly impossible\neven for members of Congress to understand,\nand increased the workload so much that\ndecisions are routinely made late and in an\natmosphere of crisis. Moreover, Congress\nnow frequently has to deal with two sets of\nestimates, those of the OMB and those of\nthe Congressional Budget Office, which may\ndiffer because they are based on different\nforecasts of economic activity, or for even\nless obvious technical reasons.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the separate world of\nthe Federal Reserve, monetary policy is being\ndecided and carried out. It is a curious\nparadox that a nation, which feels it needs\nmany more hands on the tiller of fiscal policy\nthan most countries regard as workable, is\ncontent to leave monetary policy to a central\nbank with fewer visible ties to the rest of the\ngovernment than the central banks of most\ncountries.\n\nThere is plenty of informal communica-\ntion, of course, especially between the\nFederal Reserve and the hydraheaded eco-\nnomic establishment of the executive branch.\nMore formal cooperation between the mone-\ntary and fiscal authorities, as in the United\nKingdom, might contribute only marginally\nto making monetary and fiscal policy deci-\nsions part of a more coherent strategy for\n",

This version is complete.\n\n*The Brookings Institution, 1775 Massachusetts\nAvenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. I am grateful\nto Edgar Browning for helpful comments on an earlier\nversion of this response, and to Charles E. Miles for\nprogramming the calculations.\n\n!Tn fact. if this procedure were accurate, it would be\nnecessary to prepare a MERGE file for only one year\nand then to project the incidence calculation for future\n\n232\n\nyears on the basis of changes in the relative importance\nof the various taxes used in the system.\n\n?The income shares can be thought of as a matrix\nwhose row entries add up to adjusted family income for\neach decile, and whose column entries add up to total\ncapital, labor, and transfer income, respectively. As\nmight be expected, when the 1970 shares are applied to\nlater years, the totals do not add up to the known totals\nof capital, labor, and transfer income (the columns).\nThese amounts were then adjusted proportionately to\nequal the known totals. This step yields incomes in each\ndecile (the rows) which differed from the known totals,\nand this difference was eliminated by a proportional\nadjustment. These adjustments were repeated alter-\nnately until the columns (the totals of the income shares)\nand the rows (the total adjusted family income in each\ndecile) added up to the known totals. For a proof that\nthere is a unique solution to this procedure, see Michael\nBacharach (1970, ch. 4). We have found that four or five\niterations will yield satisfactory results, but we actually\nused as many as twenty to obtain the revised weights.\n\n5I have not corrected the data base used in these\ncalculations, because the costs would have been prohibi-\ntive. However, I believe that the adjustments of the\nweights for the various income shares described above\nprovided a good approximation of the effective rates of\nthe various taxes.\n"

                    "During the 1980's, equal pay for compara-\nble worth has emerged as a major legislative\nissue, especially at the state and local level.\nIn the wake of increasing implementation of\ncomparable worth in the public sector, efforts\nhave been made to estimate the probable\neffect of nationwide implementation of com-\nparable worth-type legislation on the earn-\nings gap between women and men (see, for\nexample, George Johnson and Gary Solon,\n1984). These analyses have generally con-\ncluded that a comprehensive comparable\nworth policy would have very little effect on\nthe sex-based earnings gap. This paper offers\nalternative estimates of the effect of com-\nparable worth on the male-female earnings\ngap, based upon examination of four state-\nlevel comparable worth studies (Iowa, Mich-\nigan, Minnesota and Washington).\n",

They claim that all\nworkers would benefit from a comparable\nworth policy, except those employed in oc-\ncupations that are exclusively male. Conse-\nquently, Johnson-Solon overestimate the\neffect of comparable worth on male earnings,\nand underestimate its effect on the earnings\ngap between women and men.\n\nSecond, Johnson-Solon and comparable\nworth studies use different dependent vari-\nables. The dependent variable in comparable\nworth studies is the occupational salary, de-\nfined as one of the salary levels that an\nindividual could receive if employed in this\noccupation. On the other hand, Johnson-\nSolon use individual salaries of men and\nwomen as their dependent variable. But, in-\ndividual female earnings and the occupa-\ntional earnings of women are different.\n\nFemale earnings are affected by two in-\nequalities, unequal pay within an occupation\nand unequal pay for comparable worth. Un-\nequal pay within an occupation is negatively\ncorrelated with the proportion of women in\nan occupation. In other words, women in\nmale-dominated occupations face greater\nearnings disparities within their occupation\nthan women in female-dominated occupa-\ntions. Because of this additional inequality\nand its negative correlation with the propor-\ntion of women in an occupation, female\nearnings are rather insensitive to the propor-\ntion of women in their occupation.

The literature on rational balance-of-payments crises\nderives from Stephen Salant and Dale Henderson (1978),\nwho discuss the concept of a rational speculative attack\nin the context of the gold market. Salant (1983) provides\nfurther developments. The analogy between external\npayments crises and attacks in resource markets is closest\nin the continuous-time, nonstochastic setting explored\nby Krugman, by Robert Flood and Peter Garber (1984a,\nSection ID, and my article (1984), among others. The\nessential reason is that it is only in continuous time that\nan anticipated discrete exchange rate jump generally\nentails \"abnormal\" profit opportunities. My paper (1986)\npresents a discrete-time-maximizing model in which the\ncollapse of the exchange rate may involve two successive\nspeculative attacks: one on the first day of floating, and\none the period before. In stochastic models such as\nthose described below the notion of \"speculative attack\"\nbecomes even more blurred if one defines speculation as\nany reduction in private money demand in anticipation\nof the fixed rate's possible collapse. In this sense, there\nmay be any number of \"attacks\" before the rate finally\ndoes collapse.\n"

The research was supported by a grant from the\nNational Science Foundation.\n\nlThis may be a useful exercise by itself because, in\nmy opinion, any macroeconomic framework is mislead-\ning without an underlying model of the firm based upon\nimperfect competition. For an elaboration of this view,\nsee my 1982 and 1985 papers, Robert Solow (1985), or\nJames Meade (1984). While some contributors to the\nimportant market disequilibrium school have attempted\nto cope with imperfect competition in the product\nmarket, I think it is fair to say that the issue has not\nbeen addressed directly and developed from first princi-\nples in the spirit of the present paper\u2014 using the 'ac-\ntual,\" rather than \" perceived\" or *conjectural,\" demand\ncurves. For an admirable survey of the temporary fixed\nprice approach, see Jean-Pascal Benassy (1982) and the\nreferences cited there. Aside from the emphasis on\ndealing with monopolistic competition from first princi-\nples, the rest of this paper's framework is similar to\nwhat is adopted in much of the fixed-price literature,\nalthough that approach, so far as I know, has never been\nused to analyze profit sharing.\n"

More severe restrictions on\nthe strategy spaces can produce results. For example,\nRichard Cyert and Morris DeGroot (1970) use back-\nward induction to compute Nash equilibrium sequences\nof outputs for a finite horizon duopoly model in which\nfirms make output decisions in alternate periods. Fried-\nman's \"balanced temptation equilibrium\" is a Nash\nequilibrium for a supergame in which firms choose\ncontingent strategies that specify an equilibrium output\nlevel and a commitment to a permanent switch to the\nfirm's static Cournot output if another firm increases its\noutput above its equilibrium level. Edward Green and\nRobert Porter (1984) have analyzed a stochastic gener-\nalization of this balanced temptation equilibrium.\n"

Its value\nto the experimentalist is to force him to ask \"How canI\ndesign an experiment with the property that the set of\npotentially observable outcomes can be partitioned into\nthose that are consistent with one (or a given) theory\nand those that are consistent with other theory(ies) (or\ninconsistent with the given theory)?\" That experimental\nlife is such that his effort is about as likely to fail as to\nsucceed by no means detracts from the value of the\nexercise. Its value to the theorist (if he will just forgo the\ncareer-advancing primeval incentive to publish yet\nanother technically tractable extension of the existing\ntheory literature) is to force him to ask \"How can I\nmodel this question so as to suggest (as Martin Shubik\nwould say) a do-able experiment, and so as to yield\nobservable implications that do not exhaust the set of\npossible outcomes?\" That this effort will often fail does\nnot detract from the value of the exercise. Having said\nthis I would not want to leave the impression that\nexperiments that are fishing expeditions in the labora-\ntory to see what will happen are of no value; seeing\nwhat happens can be essential in defining an analytical-\nempirical research program. Similarly, when a theorist\nbuilds (as Buz Brock would say) castles in the air, this is\nnot necessarily useless, for it may lead to more oper-\national forms of theory. We should impute some non-\nzero probability to the proposition that Feyerabend's\n\"anything goes\" posture is right. But at this stage I\nthink it has become pretty obvious where our profes-\nsional weaknesses are concentrated. Economists, while\nspouting the rhetoric (Donald McClosky, 1983) of the\nfalsificationist, are in fact verificationist to the core. We\nall do it. We take a proposition, conjecture, or theory,\nthen search for supportive historical or empirical exam-\nples. As everyone ought to know, seek and ye are likely\nto find, whether one is a \"Keynesian\" or a *supply\nsider.\" What is not sufficiently appreciated is that this\nverificationist grubbing is a prescientific exercise in which\none asks whether there is any supporting evidence, and\n"

The last breakdown by area was\nfor 1961 (see Agricultural Statistics, 1972, Table 324). In\n1961, Florida produced 115,866,000 gallons while Cali-\nfornia and Arizona combined produced 2,369,000 gal-\nlons. It may surprise the reader to know that OJ produc-\ntion for frozen concentrate is mainly a Florida industry;\nmany table oranges do come from California. This\ndifference between Florida and California oranges is\nattributable to differences in their sugar and juice con-\ntent and in their exteriors. Florida oranges are sweeter\nand make better-tasting juice. California oranges, being\nless sweet, have a longer shelf life and they also tend to\nhave less juice but more appealing skins. Apparently,\nthere is not as much substitutability as might have been\nimagined. Actually, Florida produces the bulk of all\noranges for both table and juice. In 1972-73, for exam-\nple, Florida orange production by weight was about 80\npercent of the U.S. total. (See Florida Agricultural Sta-\ntistics, Table 3, p. 4.)\n"

The ap-\npropriate measure of benefits with collective risk, where\neveryone shares each state of nature together, is defined\nby a simple budget constraint. Benefits should be mea-\nsured as costs are distributed. As Graham (1981) notes,\nwhen costs are certain, collective risk benefits should be\nmeasured by option price.\n\n? Option price is the payment individuals would make\nfor the project independent of the state of nature. The\nconsumer's surplus payment is what the individual is\nwilling to pay for the project in each state of nature.\nNote that the expected value of surplus is a weighted\naverage of what people would pay across all the possible\nstates of nature. In contrast, demand studies, although\nunbiased, frequently measure the value of surplus at one\nmoment in time (one state of nature).\n"

Contrary to appearances, this\nproposition is completely consistent with the observa-\ntion that, for the labor market as a whole, the distribu-\ntion of wages is much more dispersed than the underly-\ning distribution of individual ability. Sherwin Rosen\n(1982) has recently shown, for example, that small dif-\nferences in ability multiply through layers of organiza-\ntional hierarchy to create large differences in marginal\nproducts. The proposition at issue here concerns how\nthe wage distribution within each firm relates to the\ncorresponding distribution of marginal products, not\nunderlying abilities. Moreover, the proposition I test\nhere does not contradict in any way the traditional claim\nthat wages and marginal products have the same average\nvalue within each firm.\n"

The indebtedness situation is particularly critical\nregarding Latin American debtors. For example, U.S.\nprivate banks have \"extended credit of more than U.S.\n$50 billion to Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, an amount\nthat exceeds 80 percent of the banks equity\" (Feldstein,\np. 2). The extent of the indebtedness crisis is reflected by\nthe fact that in 1982, twenty countries undertook debt\nrenegotiations, while in the second half of the 1970's, an\naverage of only four countries per year renegotiated\ntheir debts.\n"

We\nfind it useful to categorize earlier stories into two broad\nclasses: (i) banking system explanations such as ours;\nand (ii) explanations that stress central bank policy\nresponse. For example, James Tobin (1970) provides an\nanalysis of a model with endogenous money that em-\nphasizes central bank policy response.

                    "ROBERT J. BAnRO, University of Chicago:\nThomas Sargent's paper covers two issues\nthat are interesting, but I think largely inde-\npendent. The first is the Lucas critique of\npolicy evaluation, which involves the idea\nthat shifts in the form of the government's\nbehavior imply shifts in the form of the\nprivate sector's behavior. The second issue\nconcerns positive vs. normative theories of\ngovernmental actions\u2014an issue that has im-\nplications for the role of the economist as an\nadviser for policy.\n\nThe Lucas critique applies, for example, to\nchanges in governmental behavior that re-\nflect exogenous events, such as war, natural\ndisasters, and perhaps elections. These devel-\nopments likely imply shifts in the (condi-\ntional) probability distribution for future\ngovernment policies, which imply shifts in\nthe rational expectations of these policies,\nwhich lead to effects on the behavior of the\nprivate sector. The same conclusion obtains\nfor shifts in governmental behavior that stem\nfrom unobservable causes\u2014 or even, unlikely\nas it seems, from a response of the govern-\nment's actions to policy advice from econ-\nomists. (One can think of policy advice as a\nvariable that perhaps influences the actions\ntaken by the public sector.) In each case the\ncrucial matter is the change in the probabil-\nity distribution for future governmental be-\nhavior, combined with the idea that people\nunderstand this change. In particular, the\nLucas critique applies whether or not there is\na role for policy advice. However, if neither\nadvice nor anything else ever shifts the prob-\nability distribution for governmental behav-\nior, then the Lucas critique is not so interest-\ning. Also, it seems inconsistent to argue\u2014as\nChristopher Sims apparently has\u2014 that first,\nthe probability distribution for future gov-\nernment behavior does not shift much over\nshort periods, but second, it is conceivable\nthat policy advice could be offered that would\nlead to a sudden and substantial shift in\nactual governmental behavior.\n\nSargent also discusses positive vs. norma-\ntive theories of government, which is an in-\nteresting old issue. My main surprise was in\nlearning that Sims was a major contributor\n",

I\nwould have expected references to the sub-\nstantial work on public choice, including\nwritings by James Buchanan and Gordon\nTullock, George Stigler, and Earl Thompson,\namong others.\n\nIt is useful to carry out positive analyses\nof governmental behavior, possibly viewing\nthe people in the government as attempting\nto maximize something. Sargent's example\nabout deficits is a good one\u2014the sensible\nobjective of smoothing fluctuations in tax\nrates over time turns out to have great em-\npirical value in explaining budget deficits.\n(Having previously been criticized for ne-\nglecting Ricardo, I must mention that this\nidea appears in Pigou and should perhaps be\ncalled the Pigovian Theorem.) However, once\nwe think of the government as doing things\nsensibly\u2014or at least with calculation\u2014 then\nwe have to question where policy advice\ncomes in. As economists, we should face\nthat the answer may be nowhere, or at least\nnot much. Possibly there is some role at the\n*constitutional level\" of Buchanan-Tullock,\nwhere the choice is about the rules of the\ngame, rather than day-to-day operations. In\nany event, a positive analysis of what the\ngovernment actually does is a prerequisite to\nuseful policy advice. For example, we might\nwant to evaluate alternative monetary stan-\ndards or the draft vs. a volunteer army. In\neach case we should try first to understand\nthe existing policy\u2014 was it motivated by\nstupidity, or generated by a structure that\ncreates distortions, or was it possibly a reflec-\ntion of some good reasons that we should\nknow about? In many cases the understand-\ning of actual behavior will give us reasons\nnot to advocate changes in that behavior.\n\nI had more difficulty in appreciating\nGeorge Perry's paper. Basically, he seems to\nstart from knowledge about how the macro-\neconomy really operates and about what are\nuseful macro policies. When various theories\nand developments are evaluated to the extent\nthat they accord with these \"facts.\" For ex-\nample, micro foundations and rational ex-\n",

They distinguish between empty\nand credible threats and use the term commitment to\nrefer to the latter. I submit that the language of rivalry is\nwell serviced by reference to threats; and I suggest that\nthe term commitment be reserved to describe exchange.\nThus both credible and noncredible threats would be\ndistinguished in assessing rivalry. Similarly, credible and\nnoncredible commitments are distinguished in evaluat-\ning exchange. Alliances complicate matters in that these\nare organized in relation to another party. This could be\nwholly beneficial, but it need not be. Thus suppliers\ncould form an alliance in relation to buyers, with possi-\nble antisocial results. Credible commitments which\nsimultaneously support exchange and promote alliances\nthus sometimes pose tradeoffs.\n"

Abreu for their helpful comments.\n\nThe assumptions of identical firms and customers\nand no exogenous noise are made to show clearly that\nthe kind of price dispersion analyzed here is distinctly\ndifferent from that analyzed in the earlier models of\nprice dispersion (for example, Salop, 1977, and our 1977\narticle) where it serves to differentiate among different\ngroups of customers.\n"

The two outstanding nine-\nteenth-century thinkers on this question were,\nof course, David Ricardo and Karl Marx.\nRicardo did not believe that labor values do\nexactly correspond to prices, but he con-\ntended that they usually form a very good\napproximation. Ample bibliographical evi-\ndence of this position of Ricardo's has been\nprovided in the classic paper by George\nStigler, who coined the phrase * Ricardo's 93\npercent labor theory of value.\" As is well\nknown, Marx too was very well aware that\nrelative prices and labor values do not have\nto coincide, but he claimed that the direction\nof the divergences could be explained on the\nbasis of the magnitude of the value composi-\ntion of capital (VCC) of the different in-\ndustries. Marx would subscribe to the follow-\ning statement: the price ratio p; /p; of two\narbitrary commodities, j and i, is greater\nthan (equal to, smaller than) the ratio of\ntheir labor values, vj /;, if and only if the\nVCC of industry j is greater than (equal to,\nsmaller than) the VCC of industry i.

An anonymous\nreferee also made valuable comments.\n\n! With additional goods and factor-price equalization,\nthe theorem runs afoul of the indeterminacy of produc-\ntion and trade noted by Paul Samuelson (1953) and\nJames Melvin (1968). Without factor-price equalization,\ntrade impediments and intermediate production can\ncause reversals of the pattern of trade, as shown in my\n1979 article. If additional factors and countries are also\nadded, it becomes difficult even to state the theorem, let\nalone to prove it.\n\n?Melvin stated such a theorem for the three-good,\ntwo-factor case, and Jaroslav Vanek (1968) proved it for\nthe general case, but only by assuming factor-price\nequalization. Trent Bertrand (1972) and Jon Harkness\n(1979) were able to drop the factor-price equalization\nassumption, but replaced it with restrictions on con-\nsumption of either goods or factors by country of origin.\nIt is unclear to me, however, that these restrictions can\never be met in a model that is otherwise plausible.\nHarkness (1978) has also used the factor-content version\nof the theorems as the motivation for a regression\nequation relating commodity trade to factor intensities.\nThis bears some resemblance to my analysis below in\nSection V. See, however, James Anderson (1981) and\nEdward Leamer and Harry Bowen (1981), who have\ncriticized his result, with a reply by Harkness (1981).\n"

Therefore one must either use a two-sector\napproach or limit the third factor in the aggregate\nproduction function to imported oil.

And, second, the use of\ntotal output values for more than one industry at a time\nresults in multiple counting of the indirect effects. If the\ntotal output for the Steel and the Automobile sectors are\napplied at the same time, for example, at least a part of\nthe same steel output will be associated with both of the\nindustries. One should also recognize that estimates\nderived through application of total output values against\nthe inverse cannot be carried back through the A table\nto a balanced 7-O flow table.\n",

While the in-\nput-output (/7-O) tables and techniques are\npracticable for use in many problems, they\nare, unfortunately, of limited use in this case.\nBut, more significantly, the particular use\nMelvin makes is actually a misuse of the\ninput-output tables. Through a misinterpre-\ntation of the nature of the A table of in-\nput-output coefficients, Melvin accepts the\nstandard, published (7\u2014 A) ' inverse as a\nproper vehicle for price change analysis. That\nis, the U.S. inverse is used, improperly, to\nderive estimates of total price changes in the\neconomy which would result from initially\nimpacted cost changes in value-added.\n\nThe inability of the published inverse to\nprovide price change estimates is not gener-\nally noted in 7-O literature while, at the same\ntime, there are some unsupported allusions\nto the possible use of this table for price\nanalysis. Somehow the /-O inverse is accepted\nas a generalized economic tool that can read-\nily be used for analysis of a too-wide range\nof economic variables. The problem, I be-\nlieve, relates in part to shorthand references\nto the actual title of the inverse. As pub-\nlished by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Anal-\nysis (BEA), for the 1967 base tables, the\ncomplete title of the U.S. inverse is * Total\nRequirements (Direct and Indirect) per dol-\nlar of Delivery to Final Demand (Producers\nPrices), (Base Year Dollars) Too often\nonly the * Total Requirements\" part of this\ntitle is noted and considered. Yet this inverse\nactually treats all values applied to it as\nthough they are **final demand\" values, re-\ngardless of how they are characterized by the\nanalyst. If, perchance, the characterized use\nis consistent with the final demand concept\nthere is no problem; otherwise the conse-\n",

A long\ncourse could do the whole thing right.\n\nIf the economics major culminated in such\na course, it might discipline the teaching of\nmicro, macro, and statistics, to emphasize\nthe fundamentals of model building and the\nevaluation of all kinds of evidence, not just\nmultiple regressions. I do not mean that the-\nory courses should not be theoretical, but\nthat they should emphasize the capture of\nsome essential aspect of real life.\n\nI suspect that this kind of economics major\nwould do very well for future economists\ntoo. Most graduate schools would welcome\nstudents who had good grounding in micro\nand macro as live subjects, in data analysis,\nand in one or two broad applied fields. If\nyou want to do something extra for this\ngroup, go deeper in the fundamentals.\n\nFinally, I fondly believe that being forced\nto send our Ph.D.s into that kind of teaching\nworld would force us to train better Ph.D.s.\nThe undergraduate curriculum now reflects\nwhat graduate students learn and therefore\nteach. Of course, graduate study should con-\ncentrate more on technique, because one of\nthe jobs of economists is to make technical\nadvances. My feeling is that technique has\ndriven out substance: our graduate students\nwill believe the damnedest things if only they\nare fancied up. I would welcome the excuse\nto focus graduate training more on problem\nsolving and evidence-marshalling. I hesitate\nto say this, because I do not want to give aid\nand comfort to those who oppose technique\nsimply because it is technical. Technique is\nwhat distinguishes an economist from others.\nWe just have to be clearer about the dif-\nference between finger exercises and real\nmusic.\n",

I would like it to mean: (a)\nrealizing that it is possible to think rigor-\nously about some social problems, (5) under-\nstanding the interplay of facts, values and\ntheories in economics and in knowledge gen-\nerally, (c) knowing how to evaluate the co-\ngency of an argument in economics, to keep\nfrom being snowed, (d) having some sense\nof our economic institutions, and (e) having\nthought through at least one or two policy\nIssues in a serious way.\n\nA more controversial-sounding way of\nputting the same point is to say that we\nshould aim to teach our students the philos-\nophy of model building, because it is one of\nthe very important ways of knowing the\nmodern world: forming a simplified picture\nof the way the world works, reckoning what\nsort of evidence is relevant to doing it right,\nand judging the consequences of alternative\npatterns of policy. I would insist that that is\nwhat we have in common with \"science,\"\nand that it has Just as much claim to the\nliberal arts student's time and attention as\nliterature, history, etc.\n\nWhat does that point of view suggest about\nthe structure of the economics major? After\nthe principles course, the emphasis on inter-\nmediate micro and macro and statistics is\nprobably right. But the proliferation of *ap-\nplied\" courses is a bad thing. I suspect it\narises from faculty who want to teach their\nown special research interests, and from stu-\ndents who want to avoid hard analytical\nthinking in favor of picking up bits of canned\nknowledge. I would prefer to replace the\nsmorgasbord by a small number of blue plate\nspecials, probably whole-year courses which\nare genuine applications of the model-build-\n",

The remarks in this paper represent our\npersonal views and are not intended to be, and should\nnot be construed as, representative of the views of the\nFederal Trade Commission staff or individual commis-\nSioners.\n\nDewey assumes that more industry information pos-\nsessed by each firm is better, on welfare grounds, than\nless. This is true unambiguously only in the context of\npurely competitive markets (see Scherer, p. 449; David\nNewbery). But Dewey rejects pure competition, as he\nmust (see Kenneth Arrow; Franklin Fisher), as incom-\npatible with uncertainty. Dewey's rejection of antitrust\ndirected toward \"small-fry price fixers,\" based on\nbenefit-cost criteria, flows from a model which is not\ngenerally consistent theoretically. Generally, if monop-\noly is somewhere irremovable, then too many resources\nare shifted toward competitive sectors. Following Abba\nLerner's equation of relative price-marginal cost margins\nacross industries, raising the price of information may\nmove the general welfare equilibrium toward a second\nbest optimum. The anti-information sharing legal rule\nacts like the Lerner tax.\n"

George von Furstenberg's (Table 1) measure of\nTobin's 4 fell from 1.0 in 1967-68 to 0.7 at the end of\n1976. Because debt has been a roughly constant one-\nquarter of the replacement cost of real assets, this is\ntantamount to a 40 percent decline in the value of\nequities relative to the replacement cost of real assets\n[(1.0\u20140.7)/0.75]. Feldstein (19802) provides alternative\ndata supporting the 40 percent decline.\n"

Therefore, this richer view of tech-\nnology is ignored here. The neoclassical \"state of affairs\"\nconception of competition also can be called into ques-\ntion. The neoclassical view of competition leads to a\nranking of market structures along a continuum from\nperfect competition to pure monopoly. An alternative\nnotion of competition, more closely in step with\nRicardo's conception, would focus solely on capital's\nability to bridge profit rate differentials (see, for exam-\nple, James Clifton).

In the durable manufacturing\ninventory equation, the interest rate had a negative but\nstatistically insignificant sign while in the distribution\nsector inventory equation, the interest rate coefficient\nwas positive.
