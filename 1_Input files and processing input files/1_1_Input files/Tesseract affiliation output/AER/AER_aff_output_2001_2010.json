Special thanks to Guillermo Calvo, Alejandro Izquierdo, and Ernesto Talvi for sharing\nwith me their classification of Sudden Stop events.\n\n! The classification of Sudden Stops follows Guillermo A. Calvo, Alejandro Izquierdo, and Ernesto Talvi (2006).\nThey identified 33 Sudden Stop events in emerging economies since 1980. Other classifications (e.g., Calvo and Carmen\nM. Reinhart 2000; Calvo, Izquierdo, and Rudy Loo-Kung 2006; and Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti and Assaf Razin 2000)\nproduce similar listings of Sudden Stop events.\n\n? National accounts data are from World Development Indicators. Q is estimated for each country as the median across\nfirm-level estimates computed for listed corporations in Worldscope. Firm-level Q is the ratio of market value of equity\nplus debt outstanding to book value of equity. The event windows show cross-country medians of deviations from Hodrick-\nPrescott trends estimated using 1970\u20142006 data, except for Q which is not detrended because the data start in 1994.\n"

Admission rates in 2009-10 were Princeton 8.2 percent, Columbia 9.2 percent, Brown 9.3 percent, and MIT 9.7 per-\ncent. In 1999-2000, admission rates were: Harvard 11.1 percent, Stanford 13.2 percent, Yale 16.2 percent, Princeton 12.5\npercent, Columbia 13.0 percent, Brown 16.2 percent, and MIT 16.2 percent. These changes have been much remarked on;\nsee for example \"Elite Colleges Reporting Record Lows in Admissions,\" New York Times, April 1, 2008. The admissions\nnumbers for 2009-10 are from the New York Times \"The Choice\" blog (http://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/), accessed\nApril 11, 2010. The admissions rates may be slightly understated because they do not reflect admissions off the schools'\nwait lists. Admission rates for 1999-2000 are from the US News and World Report, \"America's Best Colleges 2002.\"\n\n? As just one example, Garey Ramey and Valerie A. Ramey (2010) argue that since the 1990s competition to secure\nslots for their children at selective colleges has led college-educated parents to substantially reallocate their time toward\nchild care. Caroline M. Hoxby (2009) has pointed out that increases in selectivity are limited to the most elite schools;\nlooking broadly at American colleges and universities, selectivity has not increased over the last few decades.\n"

Engel and Patricia A.\nMcCoy (2002), Oren Bar-Gill (2004), Elizabeth Warren (2007), and Bar-Gill (2008).\n\n? David I. Laibson, Andrea Repetto, and Jeremy Tobacman (2007) estimate that to explain a typical household's simul-\ntaneous holdings of substantial illiquid wealth and credit-card debt, the household's short-term discount rate must be\nhigher than its long-term discount rate. Complementing this finding, Stephan Meier and Charles Sprenger (2009) docu-\nment that low- and middle-income individuals who exhibit a taste for immediate gratification in experimental choices\nover monetary payments have more outstanding credit-card debt. Laibson, Repetto, and Tobacman (2007) calculate that\nmany households are made worse off by owning credit cards, so the fact that they get those cards suggests some degree of\nnaivete about future use. Consistent with this idea, consumers overrespond to the introductory \"teaser\" rates in credit-card\nsolicitations relative to the length of the introductory period (Haiyan Shui and Ausubel 2004) and the post-introductory\ninterest rate (Ausubel 1999), suggesting that they end up borrowing more than they intended or expected. Paige Marta\nSkiba and Tobacman (2007) find that the majority of payday borrowers default on a loan, yet do so only after paying\nsignificant costs to service their debt. Calibrations indicate that such costly delay in default is only consistent with par-\ntially naive time inconsistency. For further discussions as well as evidence for a taste for immediate gratication in other\ndomains, see Stefano DellaVigna (2009).\n"

Public politics takes place in the institutions of government, whereas private politics occurs outside, but often in\nthe shadow, of those institutions. Private politics pertains to individual and collective action to influence the conduct of\nprivate agents, including oneself, as in the case of NGOs that apply social pressure to change the conduct of firms.\n\n? Self-regulation could be motivated by self-interest as when a firm produces a green product because consumers are\nwilling to pay a premium for it. A firm could also self-regulate to deter public regulation as in John W. Maxwell, Thomas\nP. Lyon, and Steven C. Hackett (2000) and Lyon and Maxwell (2004) or deter private politics, as in David P. Baron (2009)\nand Baron and Daniel Diermeier (2007), where self-regulation can lead an activist to select a different target for a boycott.\n\n?

Normalization essentially implies representing the production function in consistent indexed number form.\n\n? This is termed the \"de La Grandville Hypothesis\" following Ky-Hyang Yuhn (1991) (i.e., the conjecture that the high\ngrowth rate of east Asian countries was due not to a higher rate of technical progress, but to a higher elasticity of substitu-\ntion). Also, in an earlier contribution, Robert M. Solow (1956) and John D. Pitchford (1960) showed in the neoclassical\ngrowth model that a CES function with an elasticity of substitution greater than one can generate sustained growth (even\nwithout technical progress) with due regard to the other parameters of the system. The critical threshold level for the\nsubstitution elasticity (to generate such perpetual growth) can be shown to be increasing in the growth of labor force and\ndecreasing in the saving rate, see de La Grandville (1989).\n"

For instance, there is evidence that small farms are more productive than large farms (e.g., Pranab K. Bardhan\n1973; Albert Berry and William Cline 1979; Hans P. Binswanger and Mark R. Rosenzweig 1986, 1993; Binswanger,\nKlaus Deininger, and Gershon Feder 1995), and that owner-cultivated farms are more productive than tenant farms\n(Clive Bell 1977, Abhijit Sen 1981, Radwan Shaban 1987), both of which imply agricultural output would rise following\nredistribution of land. Moreover, Abhijit V. Banerjee, Paul J. Gertler, and Maitreesh Ghatak (2002) argue that protection\nof sharecroppers against eviction and regulating sharecropping contracts in West Bengal during the period we study\ncaused significant growth in agricultural yields. Timothy Besley and Robin Burgess (2000) find that implementation of\nland reforms (particularly with respect to tenancy protection legislation) in Indian states between 1958 and 1992 led to\nsignificant reductions in rates of rural poverty.\n\n? The latter stem from poor state of land records, pervasiveness of legal loopholes and legal systems ill-equipped to\ndeal with large volumes of litigation.\n"

Nike's alleged reliance on exploitative labor practices in outsourced plants in developing nations during the 1990s\nprovides two examples. First, in response to complaints about labor practices in these factories Nike executives often\nclaimed to have limited control over the actions of the outside manufacturing firms. Second, Nike further responded by\noutsourcing investigation of these factories to consultants who were allegedly instructed to produce biased and favor-\nable reports (Dara O'Rourke 1997).\n\n?

Students that are not assigned a seat are asked to produce a second list containing only schools with vacant seats.\n\n?]n Spain and Hungary colleges are not strategic, for the priority orders are determined by students' grades. So college\nadmission in these countries is, strictly speaking, akin to school choice.\n\n^ Obviously, if the number of acceptable schools for individuals is smaller than the number of slots in the list there\nis no problem. However, in case the number of slots is restrictive, individuals will have to think out which schools to\ninclude and in which order. Abdulkadiroglu, Pathak, and Roth (2005) report that in New York City about 25 percent of\nthe students exhausted their list in academic year 2003-2004, which suggests that the constraint was indeed binding for\na substantial proportion of students.\n\n5 Haeringer and Klijn (2009) provide an equilibrium analysis for the constrained setting which makes clear that the\npredictions from the unconstrained setting do not carry over in a straightforward way.\n"

Our definition of crackdown is different from the conventional use of the term in the literature on policing (see,\ne.g., Rafael Di Tella and Ernesto Schargrodsky 2002, 2004) because we require that crackdowns be arbitrary. We will\nreturn to this point when we discuss the related literature.\n\n?

The average price of regular grade gasoline, without tax, to end users in California in 1997 was 86 cents per gallon.\nThe average wholesale price of regular gasoline in California in 1977 was 76 cents per gallon (Department of Energy,\nEnergy Information Service, gasoline prices by formulation, grade, and sales type; available at http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/\ndnav/pet/pet pri allmg c SCA. EPMR cpgal a.htm). Hastings's estimated price effect measured as a percentage of\nthe combined refining, wholesale, and retail margin of gasoline is sizable as well, since the average price of crude in\nCalifornia in 1997 was 38 cents per gallon (Department of Energy, Energy Information Service, California Crude Oil\nFirst Purchase Price; available at http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/f005006 \u2014 3a.htm).\n\n? [n addition to the specifications described herein, see Christopher T. Taylor, Nicholas M. Kreisle, and Paul R.\nZimmerman (2007).\n\n? Our results also cast doubt on the underlying model of consumer preferences (differentiated products with con-\nsumer brand loyalty) for which Hastings finds support in her data. Even if this model accurately depicts consumer\nbehavior, we note that its welfare effects are ambiguous because the introduction of a new brand increases gross\nconsumer utility. Hastings describes how rebranding can soften price competition but makes no claims as to welfare\neffects.\n"

Around the time the paper became public, TKZ contacted WL to purchase the data at the same time that they asked\nme to provide to them original raw datasets free. I was told by the vendor that the license agreement prohibited me from\nproviding copies of raw data to them. TKZ opted to use OPIS data that is available to them at no cost through the FTC. I\nhave worked with TKZ to assist them with their analysis, providing them with data and information as needed to compare\ntheir analysis with mine.\n\n? [n addition, with vendors that collect this sort of data, the data is not collected on the same date for all stations, but\nis instead collected on a rolling basis, which may add substantial noise to measures of station prices in large metropolitan\nareas or in periods of rapidly changing prices when the time over which prices for the sample are taken spans a consider-\nable period of time. I subsequently learned these industry data details from designing and collecting my own survey data\nfor Justine Hastings (2008).\n\n? For example, it can be shown that both the number of price observations at stations and the number of detectable\nerrors in the OPIS prices during the period used in TKZ are increasing in the overall gasoline price level, suggesting that\nprices are not observed at random. When I inquired about purchasing station level data from OPIS for a project in early\n2001, the vendor noted that their station level data from the late 1990s were not reliable for station level analysis but better\nsuited for aggregate analysis due to errors and sparse observations at many stations. More recently, OPIS collects prices\nfrom other data sources to augment its fleet card data and attempts to correct price errors using multiple prices at each\nstation per day when available, making the data more reliable and representative in recent years.\n\n* When comparing analysis with TKZ, we noted that the handful of brand labels in the OPIS data that were not one\nof these four brands were in fact stations with one of these four brands. It appears that the OPIS data often change the\nrecorded owner and brand of gasoline in historic data when a station switches brands at a later point in time. This has been\nmy experience as well when using OPIS data from later time periods.\n"

Kagel (forthcoming) for surveys of experi-\nmental evidence and complementary models of social comparison.\n\n? ^ number of field and survey studies investigate the social determinants of risk taking (e.g., Robert B. Barsky et\nal. 1997; Bas Donkers, Bertrand Melenberg, and Arthur van Soest 2001; Thomas Dohmen et al. 2008). Several find that\nlotteries are most appealing to the poor, probably because lottery tickets are seen as a vehicle to correct for low-income\nstatus (e.g., Charles T. Clotfelter and Philip J. Cook 1989; Emily Haisley, Romel Mostafa, and George Loewenstein\nforthcoming). Other studies find that low income or wealth levels decrease the willingness to take risks. probably\nbecause high income insulates against the impact of bad outcomes (e.g., Dohmen et al. 2008). One potential reason for\nthe seeming discrepancy is that field and survey studies typically do not (and perhaps cannot) control for the peer group\nthe respondent uses for social comparison in a given economic context. While there are other potential explanations,\none advantage of experimental studies is that social comparison effects can be induced by closely manipulating the peer\ngroup available for social comparison.\n"

Bentley (1908/1995) is an early study of interest group competition. More recent work by George S.\nStigler (1971), Sam Peltzman (1976), Gary S. Becker (1983), and Gene M. Grossman and Elhanan Helpman (2002) has\nspawned a vast literature.\n\n? Matsusaka (2007) documents that initiative states are 15 to 20 percent more likely to adopt the majority policy\nposition than noninitiative states for a set of high-profile issues. Gerber (1999) and Matsusaka (2004) contain less direct\nevidence. See Arthur Lupia and Matsusaka (2004) for a survey.\n\n? The view that voter incompetence allows interest groups to subvert the majority remains one of the central criti-\ncisms of direct democracy (Shaun Bowler and Todd Donovan 1998). Although a formal model of the idea remains to be\nwritten, the intuition is that interest groups may have an advantage in informing their supporters and motivating them\nto vote that allows them to pass laws that hurt the majority. (The idea that interest groups might be able to attain nonma-\njoritarian policies because of organizational advantages has been modeled\u2014Peltzman (1976) is an influential exam-\nple\u2014 but it has not been shown that the interest group's advantage increases when direct democracy is available.)\n"

For example, income given to women is more likely to be used for investments in education, children's nutrition,\nand housing than income in the hands of men (Duncan Thomas 1990, 1994; John Hoddinott and Lawrence Haddad\n1995; Esther Duflo 2003).

Small (2005) and the National Research Council (2002) examine the various\nexternalities from gasoline use and offer estimates of the overall marginal damages. The former study estimates the\noverall external cost from US gasoline consumption (including effects relating to local pollution, climate change, con-\ngestion, and accidents) to be about 75 cents per gallon in year-2000 dollars. This suggests that US taxes on gasoline are\nbelow the efficiency-maximizing level, since the federal tax plus average state tax totals 41 cents.\n\n? The extent of the health improvement from improved air quality depends on both the reduction in gasoline use\nand possible changes in pollution per gallon of gasoline used. Air districts currently in compliance with air pollution\nregulations under the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments might well respond to reductions in gasoline use by relaxing\n\"tailpipe\" emissions requirements, that is, on the allowable emissions per unit of fuel combusted. This would offset the\nair-quality and health improvements from reduced gasoline consumption.\n"

The code of conduct for the employees of a major bank (\"Group Code of Conduct: Leading by Example,\" Standard\nChartered Bank, 2005) reports the following apt illustration: \"Typically, mis-selling is associated with investment\nproducts when there may have been a failure to disclose all the associated risks or where an investment product is inap-\npropriate to a customer's needs. For example, a product with a long tenor [sic] (e.g., ten years) may have a guaranteed\nrepayment of principal only on maturity date, but if prematurely liquidated it may not repay the full principal.

With linear wholesale pricing, FM also show inefficient exclusion will not arise. As they note, this result depends\non buyers facing a small fixed cost to stay active. Without these fixed costs, FM correctly show there are both entry\nand exclusion equilibria. John Simpson and Abraham L. Wickelgren (2007) and Jose-Miguel Abito and Julian Wright\n(2008) show that if downstream competitors are slightly differentiated, exclusion equilibria become unique.

He wrote: ^Fifty, even\nthirty years ago, there was a rightful presumption regard-\ning the average immigrant that he was among the most\nenterprising, thrifty, alert, adventurous, and courageous of\nthe community from which he came. It required no small\nenergy, prudence, forethought, and pains to conduct the\ninquiries relating to his migration, to accumulate the neces-\nsary means, and to find his way across the Atlantic. To-day\nthe presumption is completely reversed.\" Walker's view\nwas disputed by Paul H. Douglas (1919).\n\n? See US Department of Commerce (2006).\n"

In a recent paper, Matthew Weinzierl (2007) studies age-depen-\ndent labor income taxation in such a model. Gregory W. Huffman (2008) shows that the fiscal authority may find it optimal\nto both tax capital income and grant investment tax credits in a model with endogenous investment-specific technical\nchange.

For instance, Lawrence J. Christiano, Martin Eichenbaum, and Charles Evans (1999) find, under a wide range\nof identifying assumptions, that following an unexpected monetary policy tightening, aggregate price indices remain\nunchanged for about a year and a half and start declining thereafter. Studies focusing on specific wholesale or retail\nitems have also found evidence in the United States of maintained fixed prices for a period of several months. See, for\ninstance, Dennis W. Carlton (1986), Stephen G. Cecchetti (1986), Anil K Kashyap (1995), Daniel Levy et al. (1997),\nJames N. MacDonald and Daniel Aaronson (2000), and Alan Kackmeister (2007). Surveys of firms suggest that a large\nfraction of prices remain constant for many months (Alan S. Blinder et al. 1998).\n\n? It has been argued that such models, sometimes augmented with mechanisms to increase the persistence in infla-\ntion, replicate many features of aggregate data, and in particular the delayed and persistent effects of monetary policy\nshocks on prices (see, e.g., Julio J. Rotemberg and Michael Woodford 1997; Woodford 2003; Christiano, Eichenbaum,\nand Evans 2005; Frank Smets and Raf Wouters 2007).\n"

For example, Robert H. Miller and Harold S. Luft (1997) review 15 studies of the effects of managed care on qual-\nity. They find no compelling evidence of a reduction in quality of care, although patients show less satisfaction with\nmanaged care than with traditional plans. David M. Cutler, Mark B. McClellan, and Joseph P. Newhouse (2000) con-\nsider the causes of the expenditure reductions achieved by managed care plans in the treatment of heart disease. They\nshow that virtually all the difference in spending between indemnity plans and HMOs comes from lower unit prices\nrather than the quantity of services or a difference in health outcomes.\n"

Kreinin 1961; Won Chang and Alan L. Winters 2002; Robert C. Feenstra 1989). This evidence generally\nattributes the effect to imperfect competition in specific industries. More importantly, these studies do not argue or\nestimate whether countries changed their trade policies to affect their terms-of-trade, much less if they did so taking\nthe export supply elasticity into account. Since our initial working paper, however, independent research by Bagwell\nand Staiger (2006) provides evidence for their theory by showing that WTO accession leads to greater tariff reductions\nin products with higher initial import volumes.\n\n?

Of course, if one manager already has a long position in a\nstock, he might wish to find a way to credibly communicate this to other managers, so that their buying pushes up the\nprice of his position.\n"

While this paper examines the importance of short-run (binding) constraints that may be present during college,\nthere exist other types of credit constraints that could influence higher educational attainment. For example, family\nconstraints during a child's youth could influence higher educational attainment of the child by affecting his/her human\ncapital accumulation at the time of high school graduation (Cameron and James J. Heckman 1998; Diego Restuccia and\nCarlos Urrutia 2004). In addition, the possibility that an individual may have difficulty borrowing money after college\nif he has difficulty finding employment quickly could influence both decisions about college attendance and, for reasons\nanalogous to those in Angus Deaton (1991), whether the person wishes to borrow money during college. Nonetheless,\nthe focus in this paper on (binding) constraints that are present during college is natural since these types of constraints\nreceive almost exclusive attention from policymakers concerned with higher education.\n"

Luoh: Department of Economics, National Taiwan University, 21 Hsu-Chow Road, Taipei, Taiwan (e-mail:\nluohmGntu.edu.tw.) We begin by thanking Steven Levitt and Emily Oster for the extremely helpful discussions on\nthis topic. Detailed comments from Douglas Almond, Josh Angrist, David Autor, Hoyt Bleakley, Monica Das Gupta,\nMichael Greenstone, James Heckman, Stephen Klasen, John List, Kelly Olds, Nancy Qian, the workshop partici-\npants at the National Taiwan University, Institutes of Economics and Institutes of Statistics, Academia Sinica, Lehigh\nUniversity, and two anonymous referees are greatly appreciated. We would also like to thank Chien-Jen Chen and\nYin-Chu Chien at the Graduate Institute of Epidemiology, National Taiwan University, for teaching us all the virology\nand epidemiology of Hepatitis B. The Center for Disease Control (CDC), Department of Health, Taiwan, provided\naccess to the National Hepatitis B Mass Immunization Program data. The conclusions drawn here are solely those of\nthe authors, and do not necessarily represent the views or opinions of staff at the CDC. Finally, all errors remain the\nsole responsibility of the authors.\n\n! The practices include infanticide, or providing fewer resources for newborn females. These cases are usually not\nreported as live births. Parents may also neglect a daughter's educational or nutritional needs later in life. However,\nAnsley Coale and Judith Banister (1994) argued this discrimination occurred primarily during the early stages. The\nsituation for women deteriorated further starting in the late 1970s because of sex selection technology and government\npolicy. For example, amniocentesis techniques were developed in India in 1975 and soon became a popular practice for\nsex selection. China launched its \"one-child\" policy in 1979, while ultrasound became popular in the late 1980s. As a\nresult, the sex ratio at birth rose from 107.1 in 1981 to 116.9 in 2000.\n\n? For example, it can generate disturbances in the future marriage market, and even cause international security\nproblems (Valerie Hudson and Andrea den Boer 2004).\n\n3 Using a diverse range of comparison criteria, Coale (1991) and Stephen Klasen (1994) modified this loss down to\naround 60 million. Klasen and Claudia Wink (2002) used more recent data and argued that the situation has improved\nin most countries, but has gotten worse in China and India.\n\n^ Basically, parents raise more sons if the rate of return to investment in daughters is lower than that of sons (Gary\nBecker 1981). For Example, Qian (2008) and Kelly Olds (2006) showed the increasing value of female labor due to the\nrise of the tea trade would increase the survival of female infants.\n"

[n the social psychology literature, Lawrence Kohlberg (1984) develops a framework of moral development in\nwhich individuals prefer to conform to norms established by their peers. Subsequent studies have developed psycho-\nmetric instruments that measure this preference and conclude that the majority of individuals within professional\norganizations of adults prefer to conform, although the strength of this preference varies from individual to individual.\nA related construct in psychology is the locus of control developed by Julian B. Rotter (1966).\n\n? An extensive accounting literature considers accounting (e.g, bookkeeping) manipulation. See, for example,\nRonald A. Dye (1988), Paul E. Fischer and Robert E. Verrecchia (2000), or the survey of empirical evidence discussed\nin Thomas D. Fields, Thomas Z. Lys, and Linda Vincent (2001). In addition, there is extensive evidence that managers\nmake real decisions (e.g., channel stuffing or foregoing research and development expenditures) to manipulate near-\nterm performance measures. See, for example, Jeremy C. Stein (1989) or David Hirshleifer (1993) or, for some empiri-\ncal evidence, Paul E. Oyer (1998) and Merle Erickson, Michelle Hanlon, and Edward L. Maydew (2004).\n"

With respect to the latter, the intuition is similar in spirit to models that examine trade between developed and\ndeveloping countries (e.g., Avinash K. Dixit and Victor D. Norman 1980; Elhanan Helpman and Paul Krugman 1985).\nMany of these models show that the type of trade in equilibrium (i.e., developed-developed or developed-developing)\nwill depend on the nature of the specialization and on the size of the economies. While we focus on specialization\nto explain our results, we acknowledge it is only one possible mechanism for differences of the observed effect of\nBitnet across qualities. Other possibilities include monitoring (George P. Baker and Thomas N. Hubbard 2003) and\nheterogeneity in research interests (Tanya S. Rosenblat and Markus M. Mobius 2004). The aim of this paper is not to\nidentify the particular mechanism, but to empirically measure the impact of Bitnet connection on different types of\ncollaborations.\n"

Schelling's (1956) seminal essay on bargaining is reprinted as Chapter 2 of Strategy of Conflict (Schelling 1960).\nThe book's other chapters, and especially Appendix B, contain substantial additional thoughts on commitments in bilat-\neral bargaining. In Arms and Influence (Schelling 1966), the ideas are used to shed light on international relations.\n\n? Crawford (1982, 610\u201411) argues, like John F. Nash (1953), Schelling (1960, 70; Appendix B), and John C. Harsanyi\nand Reinhard Selten (1988, 23-26), that such simultaneous-move bargaining games can capture the dynamic give-and-\ntake of bargaining and the role of expectations in determining outcomes. See also Crawford (1991).\n\n? Subsequent work by Abhinay Muthoo (1996) has investigated ways to obtain unique equilibrium selection in a\nrelated model when the cost of revoking a commitment is not prohibitive. Muthoo obtains an efficient compromise\nsolution as the unique outcome.\n\n^'This is a special case of Crawford's model, to which he devotes considerable attention. Note, however, that Crawford\nalso studies cases in which it is costly to revoke commitments and where players have private information about the\ncosts of revoking. Subsequent literature has tended to focus on issues that arise in the latter asymmetric information\ncase. (See, especially, the analysis of dynamic bargaining games with unobservable commitments by Shinsuke Kambe\n(1999), Dilip Abreu and Faruk Gul (2000), and Olivier Compte and Philippe Jehiel (2002).)

In the first half of the twentieth century, a few mathematicians began to formu-\nlate models for analyzing rational competitive decisions in more general frameworks, laying the\nfoundations for game theory (Emile Borel 1921, John von Neumann 1928, von Neumann and\nOskar Morgenstern 1944, John F. Nash, Jr., 1951; see also Myerson 1999).\n\nWithin economics itself, a substantive need for analytical models that go beyond the limits of\nprice theory gradually became evident. In particular, the inconclusiveness of economic theorists'\ndebates about socialism versus capitalism showed the limitations of price theory for evaluating\nnon-price institutions like the socialist command economy (Enrico Barone 1935, Oskar Lange\n1938, Ludwig von Mises 1935, Friedrich A. Hayek 1935). Price theory could show (under some\nconditions) that free markets will achieve allocative efficiency, but such results about free mar-\nkets did not prove that socialist command economies could not achieve similarly good outcomes.\nTo allow analytical comparison of fundamentally different forms of economic organization, a\nnew and more general theoretical framework was needed. In an widely influential paper, Hayek\n(1945) argued that a key to this new economic theory should be the recognition that economic\ninstitutions of all kinds must serve an essential function of communicating widely dispersed\ninformation about the desires and the resources of different individuals in society. That is, dif-\nferent economic institutions should be compared as mechanisms for communication.\n",

When US citizens vote for president and vice president, ballots show the names of the presidential and vice presi-\ndential candidates, although they are actually electing a slate of \"electors\" who represent them in each state. After the\nelection, the party that wins the most votes in each state appoints all of the electors for that state (except in Maine and\nNebraska). The number of electors equals the state's number of US senators (always two) plus the number of its US rep-\nresentatives (increasing in the state's population as determined in the Census). The electors from every state combine\nto form the Electoral College. The electors cast their votes and send them to the president of the Senate. On January 6,\nthe president of the Senate opens all of the sealed envelopes containing the electoral votes and reads them aloud. To be\nelected president or vice president, a candidate must have an absolute majority of the electoral votes for that position.\n\n?

Hussam and Porter acknowledge the financial support of the Dreman\nFoundation and the International Foundation for Research in Experimental Economics.\n\n! We refer to \"information\" on value, not \"knowledge\" of value as in SSW, because there is an important distinc-\ntion between the two terms that is particularly relevant in experimental science: the distinction between \"knowledge\nthat,\" which is a good synonym for \"information,\" and \"knowledge how.\" The latter also involves all of the individual's\nexperience, past information, and acquired tacit knowledge of how to function, plus discovering all you need to learn to\nfunction effectively in a new environment with new information. Thus, what the bubble experiments show is that, over\ntime (after two sessions of experience), people come to have common knowledge of fundamental value in the sense that\nsuch information has become integrated into the group's tacitly acquired knowledge of how to function effectively with\nthat information. These considerations are central to the conceptual distinction between constructivist and ecological\nrationality discussed in Smith (2003).\n\n? Lucy F. Ackert et al. (2006) alter the institutional design of their short sale feature from that of King et al. (1993)\nto better reflect short sale practice in real markets. They find that the allowance of such short sales drives prices toward,\nand often below, fundamental value, and conclude that short selling helps moderate bubbles in experimental asset\nmarkets. However, Ernan Haruvy and Noussair (2006), finding similar results of often \"negative\" bubbles in the pres-\nence of short sales, argue that the allowance of short selling tends to reduce prices absolutely rather than inducing any\nrational expectations in subjects that move them to trade at fundamental value.\n"

There has been similarly little work on estimating the price elasticity of demand\nfor credit in developed countries. Exceptions include Rob Alessie, Stefan Hochguertel, and Guglielmo Weber (2005) on\nconsumer loan borrowers in Italy; David B. Gross and Nicholas S. Souleles (2002) on credit card holders in the United\nStates; and Orazio P. Attanasio, Pinelopi K. Goldberg, and Ekaterini Kyriazidou (forthcoming) on car loan borrowers\nin the United States. Each of these studies exploits quasi-experimental variation from government or business policy\nrules.\n\n? Randomized controlled trials are standard practice among many US credit card companies, but the results of these\nexperiments are rarely made public (George S. Day 2003). Lawrence M. Ausubel (1999) is the only exception we know\nof, and it focuses largely on repayment effects, not on net profits and optimal pricing implications.\n"

But the main point would be\nunaffected were one to make a more accurate measure of\nall energy tax expenditures taking into account interac-\ntions: federal energy policy is driven more by off-budget\nsubsidies than by on-budget spending. This point is only\nreinforced if one takes into account implicit subsidies such\nas the Price-Anderson Act for nuclear power.\n\n?Tf the ethanol tax credit were included as a tax expendi-\nture, the renewables category would have the largest share.\n"

We take the 50 largest countries, measured by GDP in\n2000, with all others grouped into \"rest of world\" (ROW).\nPoor data forced us to move Saudi Arabia, Poland, Iran,\nthe United Arab Emirates, Puerto Rico, and the Czech\nRepublic into ROW. To mitigate the effect of entrep\u00f3t\ntrade, which our approach can't handle, we combined (1)\nBelgium, Luxembourg (which we pulled out of ROW),\nand the Netherlands, (2) Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore,\nand Thailand, and (3) China and Hong Kong into single\nentities.\n\n? Data for GDP are from the World Bank (2006), for the\nbalance of payments are from the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) (2006), and for trade in manufactures (from\nimport data) are from the United Nations Statistics Division\n(2006). Manufacturing consists of chemicals, materials,\nmachinery and transport equipment, and miscellaneous\nmanufacturing. Because of statistical error the World's cur-\nrent account and trade balances are not zero. We attribute\none-fortieth of each discrepancy to each country.\n"

This meant that choosing costs above\nm was not an option.\n\n? Recall that this is precisely what was not possible in\nCG.

One of the early statements was in Wallace Oates (1972,\np. 143): \"In an attempt to keep taxes low to attract business\ninvestment, local officials may hold spending below those\nlevels for which marginal benefits equal marginal costs, par-\nticularly for those programs that do not offer direct benefits to\nlocal business.\" George R. Zodrow and Peter Mieszkowski\n(1986) modeled how this could occur. Michael Keen and\nMaurice Marchand (1996) showed how capital competition\nmight distort governments! spending choices, causing them\nto invest too much in infrastructure (business centers and\nairports) and too little in other public goods (parks or\nlibraries). John H. Cumberland (1981) argued that inter-\njurisdictional competition to attract business investment\nweakens environmental standards. Mark C. Rom et al.\n(1998) discussed the \"race-to-the-bottom\" in U.S. welfare\npolicies and social services. On globalization, Dani Rodrik\n(1997) argued that increasing capital mobility has made it\nharder for national governments to provide social insurance\n(pp. 6, 73). Gunther G. Schulze and Heinrich W. Ursprung\n(1999, p. 298) contend that states \"competing for foreign\ninvestment will... restructure their expenditure towards\nmore privately productive public inputs at the expense of\ntransfers and nonproductive government consumption.\"\n"

For instance, in its recent decision to\nblock the merger between GE and Honeywell, the European\nCommission explicitly referred to GE's overall financial\nstrength as a major obstacle (Case No. COMP/M.2220, July\n2001).

The small number of schools which draw their student\nbody from a national pool have to use the admissions\nprocess to construct a diverse student body. The two most\ncontroversial aspects of this process are affirmative action\nand giving privilege to applicants who have a parent or\nother close relative who is a graduate of the school in\nquestion (\"legacies\").

DW (footnote 1) distinguish between parameters being\n(theoretically) *asymptotically identified,\" and being (nu-\nmerically) \"identified\" by the data (in conjunction with the\nnumerical characteristics of the estimation method). We\nthink this distinction is important, but we prefer to keep\nconditioning (a numerical notion) and identification (a the-\noretical notion) separate; the term \"identified\" already has\ntoo many uses. Perhaps it would be better to use a perfectly\nclear expression \"numerically estimable,\" reviving the older\nterm \"estimable\" for referring to the practical numerical\naspects of actually obtaining an estimate of the parameters\nthat are \"subject-matter identified\" or \"economically iden-\ntified.\" For example, R. C. Bose (1944) showed that even\nunder perfect collinearity, some linear combinations remain\nnumerically \"estimable\" while others are not; see also\nVinod and Aman Ullah (1981, p. 123).\n"

Historically disadvantaged groups are commonly de-\nfined as groups which have been systematically excluded\nfrom institutions and cultural practices that provide skills\nand resources. An important moral argument for directing\npublic policy at such groups is that historical discrimination\nagainst a group should not be allowed to perpetuate itself\nand inhibit the groups' right to well-being. Moreover, such\npolicies may enhance efficiency by improving the talent\nallocation across different occupations (Harry Holzer and\nDavid Neumark, 2000).\n"

Doing\nexperimental economics has changed the way I think about\neconomics. There are many reasons for this, but one of the\nmost prominent is that designing and conducting experi-\nments forces you to think through the process rules and\nprocedures of an institution. Few, like Einstein, can perform\ndetailed and imaginative mental experiments. Most of us\nneed the challenge of real experiments to discipline our\nthinking. In this paper I hope to indicate how my thinking\nhas been changed in some detail. I am indebted to Sid Siegel\nfor technical and conceptual inspiration; to John Hughes,\nStan Reiter, and the Purdue University faculty from 1955 to\n1967 for warm, tolerant support beginning with my first\nexperiment; to Charles Plott, Charles Holt, and Martin Shu-\nbik for many valuable encounters over the years on institu-\ntional and experimental issues; to students, visitors, the\ncurrent ICES team, and especially to my growing but tol-\nerating family who have made all these years the best years\nof my life.\n"

It may be difficult\neven to explain the details of performance to an outsider\nsuch as the court. In some cases, the best measure of\nperformance may be a subjective judgment. In other cases,\nshortcomings in the court system itself may prevent effec-\ntive contractual enforcement.\n\n? As an example of failed relational contracting, consider\nthe case of United Airlines in the summer of 2001. During\ncontract negotiations, the pilots' union urged its members to\nwork \"to the letter of our agreement.\" What followed was a\nsummer of delays and cancelled flights that cost United\n$700 million.

The Fund has long had a Compen-\nsatory and Contingent Financing Facility, which\nlends to countries adversely affected by changes\nin the terms of trade, but this facility is small.\n\nMore recently, the IMF developed the Con-\ntingent Credit Line (CCL) to lend to countries\nwith good policies affected by external shocks.\nThe Executive Board struggled to reach agree-\nment on the CCL, mainly because many mem-\nbers of the Board were concerned that, by\nprecommitting, the Fund would find itself lend-\ning to countries whose policies were not appro-\npriate to their changed circumstances.\n",

The\nmain reason seems to be a Groucho Marx-type\nproblem that no country that the IMF regards as\ngood enough to receive the CCL has wanted to\njoin the CCL club. Despite several attempts to\nsolve that problem, the prospects for the CCL\nare unfortunately dimming.\n\nTurning to Ricardo Caballero's (2003) paper,\nI read the suggestion that the Fund should have\ntwo departments, a Contingent-Markets Depart-\nment and a Crisis Department, as an argument\nthat the Fund should both lend in crises and\npromote the development of macroeconomic-\nshock-contingent markets. It would be a mis-\ntake to propose that these should be the Fund's\nonly activities, for the valuable non-lending\nfunctions of the Fund described above should\ncontinue.\n\nI am very sympathetic to the essential argu-\nment of the Caballero paper, that countries\nshould use the capital markets to hedge exoge-\nnous country risks. With this insurance in hand,\nthe government could run countercyclical fiscal\npolicies; and as the markets develop, both indi-\nviduals and firms could use them to hedge.\n\nCaballero argues for very large hedging\nagainst macroeconomic disasters, rather than\nthe hedging against \"daily wiggles\" provided by\nexisting shorter-term commodity price hedges.\nIn the Chilean case, he suggests the equivalent\nof a $6\u20148 billion put, which would come into\neffect when the price of copper falls by more\nthan two standard deviations for half a year.\nThis is more than 3 percent of Chilean GDP.\n\nThe large hedging approach suffers from a\ndisabling discontinuity: it would add to macro-\neconomic uncertainty, as it would for some time\nbe uncertain whether a particular shock is large\nenough to activate the put. Thus \"hedging\nagainst wiggles\" may be a useful rather than a\nnegative feature of the relevant derivative con-\ntracts. It is not obvious why Caballero confines\nthe insurance to major disasters; nor do we get\nany sense of how frequent these would be.\nHowever, that is merely an argument about the\ndesign of the instrument. No doubt an instru-\nment could be designed that would in principle\nremove much of the uncertainty produced by\n",

A one-to-one response is defined as complete pass-\nthrough, and a less than one-to-one response is partial or\nincomplete pass-through. Empirical studies tend to find\nincomplete pass-through, with the fraction averaging 60\npercent (Pinelopi Koujianou Goldberg and Michael M.\nKnetter, 1997 p. 1250). Differences in estimates of ex-\nchange rate pass-through are typically explained by industry\ncharacteristics such as market power (e.g., Knetter, 1993;\nRobert C. Feenstra et al., 1996; Anne Gron and Deborah L.\nSwenson, 1996; Jiawen Yang, 1997), and shifts in exchange\nrate expectations or hysteresis effects (e.g., Richard Baldwin,\n1988; Kenneth A. Froot and Paul D. Klemperer, 1989). As\nsurveyed in Goldberg and Knetter (1997), pass-through is\nclosely related to two other literatures: pricing-to-market\n(i.e., how an exporting firm price discriminates across des-\ntination countries given changes in exchange rates) and the\nlaw-of-one-price across international markets.\n"

The NLSY79 question used to iden-\ntify racial background is one that has the choice American\nIndian rather than Native American. The use of the term\nalso avoids the problem that sometimes arises when people\nconfuse the term Native American with native-born American.\n\n?

Regarding theoretical reasons to expect gains, a partic-\nularly interesting idea can be traced back 40 years to Gary\nS. Becker (1957) and Armen A. Alchian and Reuben A.\nKessel (1962). It may be that a firm or industry with\nmonopoly power may face restrictions on its ability to pay\npecuniary returns to itself. Given this constraint, the mo-\nnopoly chooses to take more return in nonpecuniary payoffs\n(like leisure on the job) than would otherwise be the case.\nAs competition increases, some of these nonpecuniary re-\nturns are rolled back (see more discussion on this below).\nGood surveys on other ideas are found in F. M. Scherer and\nDavid Ross (1990 pp. 667\u201472) and Stephen J. Nickell\n(1996). See Stephen L. Parente and Edward C. Prescott\n(1999) for an interesting model. Regarding the evidence\nsupporting the view that competitive pressure increases\nproductivity, Scherer and Ross (1990 pp. 667\u201472) provide\nextensive references but still conclude that \"the evidence is\nfragmentary,\" while Nickell calls the evidence \"very thin.\"\n\n? Recent theoretical papers illustrating connections be-\ntween tariff reductions and productivity include Marc\nMelitz (1999) and Thomas J. Holmes and Schmitz (2001).\n"

Correcting the other error that I made regarding the\nclassification of mayoral elections, while marginally im-\nproving the first-stage fit, does not materially affect either\nthe precision or the magnitude of the two-stage least-\nsquares estimates. The differences that do arise are the\nconsequence of McCrary (2002) using a different model of\nthe timing of elections affecting police hiring. The size of\nthe police force is reported as of October 31 each year, but\nmany mayoral elections occur in the first half of the year. In\nmy paper, I assumed that the increase in the police force\nwould occur in the months immediately prior to the election,\nand thus would not affect the reported police statistics until\nthe year of the election, whereas McCrary chose to model\nthe increase as occurring in the previous calendar year (in\nsome cases nine months or more before the election).\n\nAs an aside that illustrates just how difficult it is to gather\nreliable information on the timing of mayoral elections, I\ncontacted the mayor's office of the 13 cities in the sample\nwith the greatest discrepancies between my coding and\nMcCrary's coding of mayoral elections.

This implies that \"fair use\" does not involve the stan-\ndard economic trade-off of increasing consumption of cur-\nrent creative works at the cost of decreasing the incentive to\nproduce new creative works. Instead, it is more accurate to\nthink of \"fair use\" as a way to minimize transaction costs\nregarding uses the copyright-holder would otherwise autho-\nrize (Wendy Gordon, 1982). This is an application of the\nprinciple that, to minimize transaction costs, property rights\nshould be defined in the way they would ultimately be\nallocated in a costless-transactions world (see Harold\nDemsetz, 1966). This legal criterion for \"fair use\" makes\neconomic sense because, in contrast to patents, a copyright\ndoes not grant exclusive rights to an idea, but merely to the\nspecific expression of an idea. Hence, in spite of the fact that\nthe price of copyrighted works is greater than marginal cost, a\ncopyright generally does not create monopoly power.\n"

Both of these papers show\nthat autarky is an equilibrium for fairly large sets of param-\neters and therefore make the basic point that much interna-\ntional trade can be hampered by the anarchy that\ncharacterizes international relations. Models like that of\nJack Hirshleifer (1988), suitably adapted, could also make\nthe same point. In a different vein, Martin McGuire (2000)\nhas examined the effects of supply uncertainties on trade\npolicy.\n"
