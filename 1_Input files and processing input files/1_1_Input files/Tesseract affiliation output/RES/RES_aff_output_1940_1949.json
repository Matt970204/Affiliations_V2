Such a result may be sought as a conscious objective\n(as in the case of Mrs. Robinson, Mr. Lerner and numerous others), or it may come\nabout ''unconsciously \" (as illustrated by Mr. Smith's analysis of '' discontinuous\ncurves \") in the form of a misinterpretation of the analysis subsequent to the sub-\ntraction.

But the value of this bond-\nholding cannot be derived from the N-line without further information of how the\ntransactions are carried out. The N-line only indicates the cumulated bond purchases.\nBut moving down along the liquidity curve, the banks' bond purchases within each\nj$eriod can be performed at prices continuously rising from the minimum price pre-\nvailing at the beginning of the period to the maximum price prevailing at the end of\nthe period, or e.g. all the bonds can be bought at the maximum price. The liquidity\nfunction can be just the same but then implies different nwmbers of bonds sold to the\nbanks. And this makes a difference considering the actual value of the bond-holding\nof the banks at any given rate of interest.\n\nThe special problem considered has a bearing in general on the meaning of the\nliquidity function. The traditional liquidity function need not be unambiguous even\nwhen it can be supposed to be stable. It must be referred to an underlying relation\nbetween the numbers of bonds actually sold when moving discontinously along the\nliquidity curve. This relation explicitly states the way in which the bond transactions\nare carried out. Different numbers of bonds can be sold in such ways that they can be\nillustrated by a single liquidity curve. For that reason a discussion of the meaning of\nfrequency curves of bond sales actually carried out at successively moving prices is\nlogically primary to the drawing of liquidity curves. This whole problem of the nature\nof the liquidity function has not at all been considered here. The ambiguity of the\ncurve has only been discussed as an implication of the model sequence presented in this\npaper.\n\nUjjpsala, Sweden.

The\nliquidity function of the public cannot be used in the same way. Proving that in a\nnew equilibrium N finally corresponds to & according to the given relation simply\nmeans a second-hand registering. But even in this strong case for concentrating on\nthe liquidity function of the banks, the liquidity functions of the public can obviously\nnot be disregarded, but on the contrary has to be treated simultaneously and in\nparallel manner.\n\nAs a matter of fact the M-line can hardly be given independently of the N-line.\nThe bigger the speculative cash that the public holds at any given rate of interest,\nthe more bonds must the banks buy, until the primary increase of cash is finally\nabsorbed by their speculative cash-holding. This is sof reflected in the M-line (which\nis an imperfection), since the speculative cash-holding of the banks at any given rate\nof interest cannot possibly be assumed to be independent of their corresponding\nholding of bonds.! The flatter the N-line is, the flatter the M-line ought to be. In that\ncase it is not possible to use a given M-line if due regard has not already been taken\nto the slope of the N-line. A shift in the N-line causes a shift in the M-line too.\n\nWorking with a single, given liquidity function means that the combined holding\nof cash and bonds must be given for ary point of the liquidity curve. This presumption\nholds, e.g., in the case when a liquidity curve is used to describe the effect of open\nmarket operations. Expansive open market operations lower the rate of interest\nalong the liquidity curve and the cash increase just reflects the disappearance of bonds\ntaken over by the central bank. Such an unambiguous substitution is presupposed\nwhen using a determinate liquidity function describing the determination of the\nrate of interest. But in the model, the combination of cash and bond-holding of the\nbanks is not given for any point of the M-line independently of the N-line. (In Fig. 1\nthe sum of the increases of the cash and the bonds of the banks at any rate of interest\nis measured by the horizontal distance between the N- and the M-lines.) Therefore\nanother liquidity function of the banks has to be used when handling the model's\ncase as compared with handling the more simple case of explaining the effect of open\nmarket operations and disregarding the transactions of the public. It is to be noticed\nthat the suggested shiftability of the liquidity function of the banks appears al-\nthough expectations of the rate of interest are not assumed to have changed at all.\nBoth types of shifting calls for a dynamic analysis and in many cases certainly cannot\notherwise be taken into account.\n\nThe liquidity function of the public is in the model not ambiguous in the same\nway as the banks'. At any point on the N-line the sum of the public's holding of\nbonds and cash is independent of the M-line and can be treated as a datum. The\nbond purchases and sales of the banks act as a kind of open market operations along\nthe N-line. But since the primary increase of money does not even refer to the\nliquidity function of the public the N-line cannot separately determine the final\nequilibrium. The M-line determines the final equilibrium but depends on the slope\nof the N-line. There is thus no choice available between the two definitions of the\n\" quantity of money,\" for neither the banks' nor the public's liquidity function is in\nthis case by itself enough to describe the determination of the rate of interest.\n\nThe accumulation of the banks' bond-holding is measured along the N-line\n(Fig. x), which at the same time indicates changes in deposits and in the bond trans-\nactions of the banks. An increase of deposits means an increase in the banks' bond-\nholding calculated at cost ?rice.

This gives the same type of process\nas in the first application of equation (6) but without its inconvenient assumption\nabout the rigidity of the banks' reactions. This assumption was originally introduced\nto facilitate the illustration of the mechanism by model sequences as in the table\nand in Fig. 2.\n\nThe model does not claim to be a tool immediately applicable to handling credit\nmarket problems or even suited for statistical testing. The linear form of the equations\nemphasises its character of an arithmetical exercise. But the mechanism is founded\non an important phenomenon, i.e. the more or less unexpected reflux of money to the\nbanks. This mechanism certainly holds whether the banking system is integrated or\nconsists of a multitude of independent banks. It is also important to notice the\ndifferentiation of the model that makes it possible to consider this and other factors\nin the determination of the rate of interest. The model presented in this paper can be\nextended to a more complete picture of the price formation of the credit market\nwithout losing its main feature of putting the problem from a primarily '' monetary \"'\npoint of view. Introducing, e.g., investment (and thereby bank loans and the floatation\nof private bonds) as a function of the rate of interest new types of supply or demand for\ncredit can be treated systematically. But such an extension of the analysis goes far\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n\nSoME IMPLICATIONS OF THE MODEL\n\nA glance at Fig. 1 shows that the primary cash increase together with the banks'\nliquidity function determine the equilibrium position of the rate of interest, although\nthe liquidity function of the public immediately determines the rate of interest in\neach period. The cash-holding of the public only indirectly influences the final position\nvia the reserve cash needed by the banks. The flatter the N-line is, the bigger is ceteris\nfaribus the reserve cash that the banks must hold at every rate of interest and the\nhigher is the final equilibrium rate caused by any given cash increase. In this con-\nnection the question can be raised which is the most suitable definition of '\"' the\nquantity of money,\" i.e. which liquidity function shall be primarily used in interest\nrate theory. Keynes stressed the relation between deposits and the rate of interest.?\nScandinavian writers pay more attention to the banks' claims on the central bank?\nwhen explaining the determination of the rate of interest. As far as this model holds\nattention obviously ought to be paid simultaneously to both liquidity functions.\n\nThe M-line and the N-line separately indicate a relation between a '\"' quantity\nof money \"' and the rate of interest. In the model chosen we start with a change in\nthe banks' total cash, which then remains unchanged period after period. Disregarding\nreserve cash the liquidity function of the banks therefore directly indicates the final\n\n1 Even if the reflux of money is completely foreseen by the banks, they can hardly be assumed to\nanticipate the final equilibrium level of the rate of interest, and in any case can only reach it by disposing\nof the money reflux step by step.\n\n1 Cf.

As is indicated by the figure, the oscillation is enclosed\nby the first two values of the series and successively moves towards an equilibrium\n(R.) situated between them. This damped oscillation can be transformed to an\nexploding one by a slight change in the assumptions. Assume that c \u2014 o, 3 instead of\n\u20ac \u2014 0. The line in the right bottom quadrant will be only slightly moved to the right,\nbut this change is sufficient to get an exploding series of the rate of interest.\n\nThe oscillations are caused principally by the same mechanism as in the cob-web\ntheorem. The banks' demand (supply) of bonds is assumed to be fixed at the beginning\nof each period and cannot be corrected until a succeeding period. This assumption of\nrigidity has been made to facilitate the illustration of the mechanism in a model\nsequence. The assumption appears to be reasonable, at least as long as the revisions\nof the plans do not run opposite to the performed transactions. This holds for the\nsmooth movement towards a new equilibrium. In this case the banks find throughout\nthat they have bought too little bonds and never correct their previous bond purchases\nby selling bonds. The model will then give about the same picture of the development\nas when it is assumed that\u2014as in reality\u2014the reserve cash and the speculative cash\nof the banks are continuously adjusted to changes in deposits and in the rate of interest.\n\nThe lack of realism of the strict timing of the events appear in those cases where\none period's bond purchases are corrected by bond sales in the next period. The\nassumed rigidity of the speculative cash of the banks dominates the development.\nThese drawbacks of the model can be eliminated by a slight change in the assumptions.\nThis can be made keeping the main feature of the mechanism but at the cost of using\nillustrating model sequences. The assumption is removed that the banks adjust their\nspeculative cash not until after a lag to those changes in the rate of interest that their\nown bond transactions have caused. It is more reasonable to assume that the banks,\nwhen trying to get rid of the surplus cash, simultaneously adjust the speculative cash\nto changes in the rate of interest.! According to this assumption equation (1) is changed\nso that M \"; will be determined by the same period's rate of interest R;. As a consequence\n\n1 Notice the opposite case when the banks try to eliminate a primary deficit of cash by selling bonds\u2014\nas a matter of fact without being able to increase their total cash-holding at all. A process analogous to\nthat described before then occurs, but with a continuously increasing rate of interest.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:42:39 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In the first round the rate of interest is forced down to\nthe level where the public is willing to hold the banks' cash surplus as speculative cash.\nBut after the bond transactions have been carried out the money returns to the banks as\nthe increase in speculative cash of the publicis deposited. The banks have to keep a part\nof that reflux of cash as a reserve against the increase of deposits. In addition the rate\nof interest has fallen, which is an incentive to the banks to hold a bigger speculative\ncash as compared with the situation at the starting point. If the whole reflux of money\nis not absorbed either as reserve cash or as speculative cash, there is a surplus which\nthe banks will again use for buying bonds and thereby lower the rate of interest. So\nthe process goes on possibly until an equilibrium level of the rate of interest is attained.\nAt that level the total primary increase of money is totally absorbed by the banks\npartly as reserve cash and partly as speculative cash. The increase in the banks' and\nin the public's speculative cash-holding corresponds to the lowering of the rate of\ninterest according to the given liquidity functions. The increase in the banks' reserve\ncash corresponds to the increase of the public's speculative cash, i.e. of deposits accord-\ning to the given reserve ratio.\n\nThis outline of a process can be stated in terms of a model sequence. In order to\ndefine the mechanism of the model the timing of events has to be fixed within each\nperiod. It is assumed that the whole surplus cash of the banks at the beginning of\neach period will buy bonds from the public ?ndefendently of the changes of the rate\nof interest that the bond purchases themselves cause during the same period. This\nassumption is made in order to simplify the model and to isolate the driving forces. It\nwill be removed later. It implies that the banks bid up bond prices until the public\nhas absorbed the whole surplus cash of the banks. The change in the rate of interest\nduring each period is therefore immediately determined by the banks' surplus cash at\nthe beginning of the period and by the public's liquidity function. But when the\nbanks' supply of cash (inelastic during the period) has been fixed at the beginning of\neach period and the bond transactions afterwards have been carried out, the surplus\ncash of the banks is only temporarily eliminated. At the end of the period the banks\nfind their total cash unchanged as compared with the situation before the bond\npurchases, and this causes a new decision in the next period. This more or less unex-\npected reflux of cash marks off the periods and carries the process forward.!\n\nOf course the assumption of bond purchases of fixed amounts followed by a\nperiodical reflux of cash is rather unrealistic. But changing to more realistic assump-\ntions does not change even the outlines of the model very much. The artificial timing\nof events represents a special variant of the mechanism of the credit market. It is\nselected because it seems suitable for the illustration of the mechanism with the help\nof a model sequence.\n\nThe model can be defined by a system of equations. At the beginning of each\nperiod (/) the banks' d\u00e9cision about their speculative cash (M'') depends on the rate\nof interest (R) at the end of the preceding period.

                    "Two Liquidity Functions and the Rate\nof Intetest: |. A Simple Dynamic Model\n\nThis paper contains a model describing the determination of the rate of interest.\nThe model is in principle founded on the Keynesian theory of the interrelation between\nthe quantity of money and the rate of interest. When using this theory it is important\nto distinguish between different kinds of ''interest rates\" and different kinds of\n\" money.\" The model is concerned with the latter distinction, which is stressed by\nintroducing two sectors\u2014'' the banks\" and ''the public \"\u2014whose dispositions on\nthe credit market will be treated separately. In consequence two '' quantities of\nmoney \"' and two liquidity functions are obtained. The importance of this distinction\nis further stressed by introducing the banks' reserve ratio of cash to the public's\ndeposits as a link between the two liquidity functions. The model operates exclusively\nin terms of these two functions and thus the analysis of the determination of the rate\nof interest concentrates on the monetary sector of the economy. But in this respect\nthe model is to be regarded only as a first step towards a more complete treatment.\n\nThe aim of the analysis is not limited to giving a dynamic and differentiated\nmodel that still in principle runs on traditional lines. When trying to make precise\nthat model in a sequence there appear certain weaknesses in the use of given liquidity\nfunctions. The confusions partly concern the meaning of a successive movement along\nthe liquidity curve and partly the constancy of that curve itself when the successive\nmovements are carried out. The problems are raised when the given changes in '' the\nquantity of money \" have to be '\"' translated \" into those bond transactions that a\nmovement along the liquidity curve actually imply. This consideration is an out-\nstanding feature of the model. It will possibly give a more clear picture of price\nformation on the credit market and suggest some completions and modifications of\nthe traditional theory.\n\nDEescRIPTION or THE MopEL\n\nUsing Keynesian terminology the cash-holding of the public for transaction\npurposes is assumed to be constant since variations in income and employment are not\nconsidered in the model. Further, the speculative cash-holding of the public is assumed\nexclusively to take the form of bank deposits. The banks need a certain transaction\ncash determined by the amount of deposits. The amount of this reserve cash is assumed\nto bear a fixed ratio of total deposits (given by convention or by law). The banks are\nassumed to hold their cash in the form of money (liquid claims on the central banks).\nThe speculative cash-holding of the public and of the banks is assumed to depend on\nthe rate of interest. In equilibrium the amount of the speculative cash-holding, both\nof the banks and of the public, corresponds to the rate of interest according to individual\nliquidity functions. And at the same time that part of the banks' total cash which is\nnot held for speculation exactly amounts to the given quota of public's deposits.!\n\nWhat happens if in an equilibrium the total cash-holding of the banks is increased ?\nFor simplicity the primary change in cash-holding is assumed to concern only the\nbanks and, e.g., depends on a redemption of governmental bonds. The banks are\nconfronted with surplus cash which they try to place in iriterest-bearing paper. This\n\n1 It is a$sumed that the necessary reserve cash is primarily supplied out of total cash. The remaining\n\npart makes up for the speculative cash. The two types of cash cannot replace each other. (Cf. Keynes,\nGeneral Theory, p. 199.)\n\n98\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:42:39 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Families have been assumed\nto take the whole ration of cooking fats, one-third being in the form of lard. The subsidy on bread, flour\nand potatoes has been assessed on the basis of pre-war consumption.\n\nAt the rates of subsidy ruling in September, 1948, the subsidies shown in the table above would account\nfor an expenditure of about \u00a3300 million as compared with total subsidies of \u00a3471 million. The difference\nis accounted for by /74.8 million subsidies on feeding stuffs and fertilizers (these have not been included\nbecause their effect on retail prices is problematical) 437.9 million for the National Milk, Milk in Schools\nand ''other welfare foods \" schemes which are considered elsewhere, and finally that part of the food\nsubsidies which is paid on food which is not bought by households. (This would appear to be about \u00a360\nmillion.) The subsidy on meals out accrues almost entirely to adults or middle class children, except in the\ncase of that part of the subsidy which reduces the cost of school meals. This part of the subsidies is included\nin the value of school meals.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:43:54 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

This raises no difficulties in principle if total consumption is\nuniquely related to the volume of trade. But under free trade, patterns of international\nexchange represented by points off E's offer-curve cannot occur consistently with\nequilibrium, and it is therefore not possible to say what pattern of consumption in E\nthey would be associated with if they did occur. If the indifference curves are to have\nany clear meaning, we have to suppose that the various '' unnatural\"' patterns of\nexchange are made consistent with equilibrium by some departure from free trade.\nNow any given '' unnatural \" position can be brought about by a variety of measures :\ntariffs (or import bounties), export duties (or subsidies), quantitative controls, etc.\nEach of these methods will lead to a different pattern of production and consumption.\nIn drawing indifference curves in this context we have therefore to specify which form\nof commercial policy we are assuming, with free trade and sel\u00ed-sufficiency as special\ncases. The curves in the resulting system will be affected by costs as well as by tastes,\nand hence will be liable to be convex or kinked as well as concave.

This will be the case because only part of the total consumer expenditures\nare made by wage earners, and because only a part of the increase in wages is spent\non consumer goods.\n\nAs we have seen, the first wage increase of 3.5 per cent will cause the cost of\nliving to rise by 1.64 per cent. The second wage increase (i.e. 1.64 per cent of \u00a34,900 \u2014\n\u00a380.3 million) will raise consumer expenditures by fr million (ie. by f80.3 million\n\n. 6\ntimes 0.76) and will further increase the cost of living by 0.76 per cent (ie. Boo )\n\nThe total rise in the cost of living after the initial increase and two rounds of wage\nadjustments will be 5.9 per cent (i.e. 3.50 -4- 1.64 J4- 0.76).\n\nAfter the first two rounds of wage increases, the wage and price adjustments\ndecrease rapidly. The theoretical limit of the rise in the cost of living from an infinite\nnumber of rounds is 6.55 per cent.!\n\nIt should be remembered that our estimate of both the initial rise in the cost of\nliving and the further increases resulting from two rounds of wage adjustments are\nbased on the outside assumption of an absolutely inelastic supply of consumer goods.\nIn all probability, there will be some increase in the total output of consumer goods\nas prices and profits rise. Furthermore, the government has the option of effecting a\nshift of resources from the capital goods industries to consumer goods industries.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:48:35 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Similarly, in the case\nof imported goods, the quantity purchased will tend to fall, as their sterling cost rises.\nReduced physical consumption and increased prices may offset one another so that\nthe rate of consumer expenditures is unchanged\u2014or, if consumers strongly resist a\nlowering of real consumption, they may save less (or even dis-save) and thereby cause\nconsumption expenditures to increase. Thus, an increase in the cost of living can\noccur without any change in personal money income.\n\nHowever, the total amount and distribution of personal incomes might change\nas \u00e0 direct consequence of devaluation. Export firms are likely to expand, as a conse-\nquence of higher profits, and take on workers, but other firms producing chiefly for\nthe domestic market may be adversely affected by the increased cost of imported\nmaterials, and may discharge employees. There will be some lag in the movement of\nworkers from contracting industries to expanding industries. If unemployment is\ncaused, personal incomes of those who become unemployed will be reduced by the\ndifference between their former wages and the unemployment benefits they receive.\n\nCapital expenditures may also be directly affected by devaluation. The induced\nexpansion of firms which produce in part for the export market may exceed the cut-\nbacks of other firms. But the government can, by adopting restrictive credit policies,\ncounteract a tendency toward increased aggregate investment if it chooses to do so.\n\nIn summary, aggregate expenditure will tend to increase as a result of reduced\npersonal saving and of additional capital expenditures by export industries. On the\nother hand, aggregate expenditure will tend to fall as a result of reduced expenditures\nby persons who become unemployed and by reduced capital outlays in domestic\nindustries. These two tendencies may balance each other. If they do not balance, the\ngovernment can strengthen the weaker tendency.\n\nIt is in this setting that we assume a government policy of permitting wage\nadjustments every three months equal to the increase in the cost of living index.\n\nErrFECT OF WAGE ADJUSTMENTS\n\nAny increase in wages will tend further to increase the cost of living, but the\nimpact of wage increases is tempered by the fact that part of the increment is taxed\naway or saved and is thus not available for bidding up prices of consumer goods and\nservices. (Increased wage payments can always be wholly neutralised by appropriate\nfiscal and credit policies designed to limit disposable incomes, but it is assumed that\nno additional taxes or restrictions on private credit are imposed.)\n\nThe purpose of the following analysis is to assess the total increase in consumption\nexpenditures that two quarterly wage adjustments would give rise to, and the effect\nof such increases upon the cost of living.\n\nAs shown in the following tabulation, the increase of personal expenditure in\n1947 and 1948 was very large in relation to the rise of personal income. As consumer\ngoods reappeared in quantity for the first time after the war, consumers made abnorm-\nally large purchases to replace worn-out clothing and household furnishings.\nThe increase in expenditure of \u00a3724 million in 1947 and [539 million in 1948 was\nachieved mainly by a decrease in saving amounting to \u00a3493 million and \u00a3109 million,\nrespectively. But the decrease in saving was much less in 1948 than in 1947. As\nthis tendency continues and consumers complete the restocking of their inventories\nsaving out of current income will cease to decline and may increase in 1949.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:48:35 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Before considering the effects of\nwage adjustments, it is desirable to mention the immediate income and employment\neffects of devaluation and, in particular, to see what an initial increase in the cost of\nliving implies both with respect to the availability of consumers' goods and the rate\nof consumer expenditures.\n\nINCOME AND EMPLOYMENT ErrkECTS OF DEVALUATION\n\nAs the quantity of consumers' goods available for home consumption falls, their\nsterling prices will tend to rise. Indeed, a rise in prices is the means of restricting\n\nl'TThese estimates were obtained by multiplying the original estimates by 44/33.3 to adjust for the\n44 per cent appreciation of the dollar in terms of sterling instead of the assumed 33.3 per cent appreciation.\n\n? Based on Records and Statistics supplement to the Economist. Where specific commodities are selected\nto compare with our estimates for commodity groups, the item is indicated in parenthesis.\n\n3 No adjustment is applied because the price rise!is determined chiefly by the devaluation against the\nCanadian dollar.\n\n! Egyptian Giza 20 per cent; Mid-American 23 per cent. The large difference between the estimate\nand the actual price rise is probably due to the following two influences: (1r) the proportion of current\nimports of American cotton to total cotton imports is higher than the proportion in 1948 upon which our\nestimate is based ; (2) the existence of a fixed American reservation price supported by the Commodity\nCredit Corporation has a tendency to pull the cotton market up towards the American price level. This\namounts to an infinite price elasticity of dollar supplies, and application of our formula (18) would give a\nprice increase equal to the degree of appreciation of the dollar.\n\nSee Section TII on the relevance of raw cotton price increases to the price increase of clothing.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:48:35 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

            "found": "46 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\npricing,! but the subject was treated in a very cursory manner which did not consider\nany of the fundamental issues raised by Kahn.\n\nDuring the next few years, the development of the theory of marginal cost pricing\nwas given a new twist by a number of writers who concerned themselves with the\nrelation between the marginal cost pricing principle and the price system of a socialist\neconomy. Lerner in particular gave impetus to this turn of the controversy, writing a\nlengthy criticism? of E. F. M. Durbin's analysis? of price systems for a planned economy.\nDurbin had advocated an average cost pricing system. Lerner dissented from this\nopinion, saying that the one contribution pure economic theory has to make to the\nbuilding up of a socialist economy is that price must be made equal to marginal cost.\nLerner's article was one of the first general explanations of the marginal cost pricing\nprinciple which adequately treated the problem of defining marginal cost. His presenta-\ntion of the Viner envelope curves showing explicitly the relationship between long and\nshort run marginal cost served a very useful purpose. Although Viner's article on the\nsubject had been written six years before,* many of the writers (Durbin included)\nhad no very clear conception of what was meant by marginal cost.\n\nAbout this same time, Meade also advocated the principle of marginal cost pricing\nin the planning of industry. Meade proposed both the control of monopoly so as to\nforce production to take place at the point where marginal cost is equal to price, and\nalso the extension of subsidies to all those cases where marginal cost pricing would\nnot cover total costs. From Meade's point of view, the principle of marginal cost\npricing was by this time no longer a controversial question, but rather something to\nbe explained in a popular manner. Lange,9 writing at about the same time, adopted\nthe same attitude; the scale of output in a socialist economy, he indicated, should be\nfixed so that marginal cost is equal to the price of the product.\n\nThus by 1938 the marginal cost pricing principle had by stages evolved out of\nthe original Marshallian premise with reference to increasing and decreasing cost\nindustries. Along the way, the basis of the argument had shifted from the assumption\nof equal marginal utilities of income to the claim that interpersonal comparisons need\nnot be made, and the conclusions had shifted from the simple Marshallian premise\nconcerning increasing and decreasing costs, based on a comparison of geometrical\nareas, to a fairly subtle proposition of pricing at marginal cost. Although there still\nwas not full agreement on all of the reasoning involved\u2014for instance, Dobb's question\nwith regard to what it was that was being maximised\u2014there was a fairly general\nagreement among the majority of those writing on this subject that the principle of\nmarginal cost pricing was a valid principle for the achievement of an optimum alloca-\ntion of resources, and even, in the view of some, the only optimum. This history of\nthe origin and development of the marginal cost pricing thesis is largely ignored by\npresent-day writers on welfare economics, even though it has played a very real part\nin shaping the present form of the theory. There is a considerable gulf between the\nmarginal cost pricing thesis up to 1938 and its development after that period.\n\nNew Haven, Conn. NawNcvy RUGGLES.\n\n1C. L.

We cannot judge between them without making interpersonal\ncomparisons ; and their existence makes it rather difficult to attach significance to\nattempts at discovering the '* probable height \" of an optimum tariff.\n\nThe situation is precisely analogous to that encountered in a closed economy.\nThere we can formulate a rule such as '' equate marginal cost to price \"\" which is quite\ngeneral. But this rule will not tell us how high prices must be until we know something\nabout the pattern of demand, and therefore the distribution of wealth. Without a\ncriterion for judging between different distributions we cannot say at what level prices\nand marginal costs are to be equated ; and so we can say but little of the '' probable\nheight \" of the prices.\n\nThis does not, of course, mean that we can never obtain any idea at all of the\n'* probable height \"' of prices or tariffs, for it is at least conceivable that the infinity of\npossible heights will occasionally lie within a reasonably narrow range. But it does\nmake the task of determining the range rather difficult. For this reason it may be\nthought that the preceding analysis has yielded few positive results. To a certain\nextent that is true. What has emerged very clearly, however, is that what I take to be\nProfessor de Scitovszky's main conclusion is even more firmly based than his treatment\nmight lead one to suspect. His conclusion, the reader will recall, was that it is, generally\nspeaking, the rational thing for each country, acting separately, to try to turn the terms\nof trade in its favour by protection\u2014that there is nothing natural about free trade,\nand that if we want it to obtain we must see that it is 2mposed and enforced.! The\nanalysis of this paper has refined the argument somewhat. It has shown that its validity\ndepends in no way upon the possibility of making interpersonal comparisons of well-\nbeing,? or upon the absence of external economies and diseconomies in production and\nconsumption. It has unearthed the rather odd case where the optimum tariffs are, in\nfact, subsidies, and it has established that (whether tariffs or subsidies) their imposition\nis always at least potentially beneficial, unless it impairs the allocative efficiency of\nthe economy.?\n\nThus the force of Professor de Scitovszky's conclusion is considerably strengthened.\nThe moral to be drawn from it is too obvious to require emphasis.\n\nV. MATHEMATICAL NOTE\n\nConsider a community of N people. We adopt the convention that the services\nof productive factors are negative commodities, inputs negative outputs, and exports\nnegative imports. Denote by x;* the quantity of the th commodity consumed by\nthe ath citizen. Then the utility indexes take the form :\n\n\u00ab9 \u2014 \u00ab9 (x) (0\u20141,2,..., N) ....seseA (x)\nwhere x is the row vector of xi* (a \u2014 1, 2, . . ., N ; \u00a3\u2014 1,2, .. ., n).

Professor de Scitovszky's treatment does not make this quite clear, since he bases his welfare judg-\nments upon but two of the infinity of possible distributions of wealth\u2014viz. that obtaining in the free trade\nsituation, and that obtaining once the tariff has been imposed.\n\n? The reader familiar with Professor de Scitovszky's analysis of the optimum tariff problem will recall\nthat he employs Marshallian offer curves super- imposed on a set of community indifference loci; and\nthat he is careful to distinguish cases where the community indifference loci intersect between the points\nrepresenting free trade and the optimum degree of protection from those in which they do not intersect.\nIn the former event we can, on his welfare criteria, make no statement about the desirability of the tariff ;\nin the latter event we can say that it is desirable. What our analysis (which runs along lines rather different\n\u00cdrom Professor de Scitovszky's) has shown is, in effect, that the community indifference loci can never\nintersect in the relevant range, unless the allocative efficiency of the system is impaired.

They constitute\nan important qualification we should bear in mind when discussing the probable\nheight of the taxes.\n\nThe point just made is closely akin to the classical distinction between revenue\nduties and protecting duties.! The burden of the former can be thrown on the foreigner,\nthrough the movement in the terms of trade; whereas the latter \" are purely mis-\nchievous,\"' to use Mill's phrase. The distinction should not be pressed too far, however,\nfor any-actual duty cannot but be a compound of the two : it will affect the possibility\nand efficiency loci to different degrees.\n\nThe second problem of consistency is concerned with Mr. Kahn's revival of\nBickerdike's argument that the optimum tariff is likely to be '' large \" rather than\n\" small\" Bickerdike, it will be recalled, maintained that '' rather strong assumptions\nhave to be made . . . if the rate of tax affording maximum advantage is to come\nbelow ro per cent.'\"? We are not here concerned with the fact that the formula on which\nthis conclusion is based is itself dependent upon '' rather strong assumptions \"' about\n** cross-elasticities vanishing identically. The point is rather this: whatever the\nelasticities may be, there can be no escaping the fact that their magnitudes will depend\nupon the height of the tariff\u2014they are functionally related. One relation which must\nexist between them at the optimum point has been produced, but there are undoubtedly\nothers. Thus, consider the case where the foreign elasticity of demand is unity. This\ndoes not mean, as a simple substitution in Mr. Kahn's formula might seem to suggest,\nthat the optimum tariff is infinitely high\u2014for an infinite tariff is not consistent with a\ndemand elasticity of unity. As the tariff grew one would expect the elasticity to\nchange. Speaking very generally, there is perhaps a presumption that it will increase\nas the tariff grows ; and there is perhaps a further presumption that the foreign supply\nof imports will become more elastic too. Both these changes would tend to reduce\nthe height of the optimum tariff. It is not quite legitimate, therefore, to make deduc-\ntions about its probable height from so simple a formula as Mr. Kahn's\u2014one can\nnever be sure that the values one attributes to the elasticities are, in fact. consistent\nwith the tariff the formula indicates.\n\nOnce it is recognised that the elasticities depend on the height of the tariff, it is\nnatural to ask if it is possible to establish rather more precisely the nature of the\ndependence. Into this matter I do not propose to enter. But it is probably worth\npointing out that one of the obvious factors influencing the final result is the way in\nwhich the tariff affects the prices of imports and exports. This in turn depends in\npart upon domestic elasticities of demand and supply, and so upon the domestic distri-\nbution of income.\n\nWe have here the resolution of two paradoxes. The first is Mr. Kahn's?: that the\noptimum tariff formula should depend upon the foreign elasticities only. The second\nis one which may have troubled the careful reader : We have been making no inter-\npersonal comparisons of well-being ; we have merely been seeking a position on the\npossibility locus. There are an infinity of such positions, each corresponding to a\ndifferent distribution of welfare. How is it that we have been able to derive a unique\nformula for the optimum tariff structure? The answer is that, while the formula is\nunique, the actual tariff structure it indicates depends very intimately indeed upon\nthe initial distribution of wealth\u2014for this is one of the factors determining the con-\nsistency of the elements in the formula. Tus we have an infimity of optimum tariff\nsiructures, each corresponding to a. different. initial distribution of wealth, but all. deter-\n\n1 Cf.

Marshall, it is interesting to recall, did not do\nthis, In his Memorandum on Fiscal Policy! he suggested that the Giffen Paradox\nmight operate in respect of imports of wheat into England, and pointed out that if it\ndid the effect of a tariff on wheat would be to turn the terms of trade against her.\nBut the Giffen Paradox is not an everyday market phenomenon; and if it were it\nalone that could cause this perverse movement in the terms of trade, economists\nwould be justified in dismissing the whole matter as a mere curiosum.\n\nWe do not live in a two-commodity world, however, and so it is not necessarily a\ncuriosum. Our treatment has the advantage that it evades the difficult matter of\nwhat happens to the terms of trade and tackles the problem of the optimum taxes\nquite directly. It does seem, moreover, that when some of our optimum taxes turn\nout to be negative, those of us who are accustomed to think the matter through with\nreference to the terms of trade need not feel too suspicious. We need simply remind\nourselves that in a multi-commodity world the terms of trade is a rather elusive con-\ncept, and that\u2014however useful\u2014it may occasionally play us tricks.\n\nLeavirig the matter of the terms of trade, we might\u2014before concluding this section\n\u2014fpause for a moment to consider the modifications that would have to be introduced\ninto our earlier analysis if we were to relax the assumption that external economies\nand diseconomies are absent from both production and consumption. If they are\npresent in' production, our formula for the optimum taxes remains the same, but\ndomestic prices must be corrected by the imposition of proportionate taxes to bring\nmarginal private rates of transformation in domestic factories into line with the\nmarginal social rates\u2014otherwise the General Optimum will not b\u00e9 attained, even in\nthe closed economy. If they are present in consumption, our simple formula is no\nlonger correct, but it remains true that free trade will land us on the possibility locus\nin quite exceptional (one might almost say '' degenerate \"\") circumstances only. It is,\ntherefore, in general, always possible to approach the locus more closely by imposing\na suitable tariff structure. But the formula defining it is complicated, and little purpose\nwould be served in deriving it here. It is worth noting, however, that it is still true\nthat the attainment of the possibility locus requires that the marginal rates of trans-\nformation through foreign trade should equal the marginal social rates of transforma-\ntion at home.?\n\nFinally, it hardly requires emphasis that throughout the preceding analysis we\nhave stuck rigidly to statics, and ignored completely such important dynamic con-\nsiderations as the probability of retaliation and the chance of protection in an important\ncountry precipitating a world slump.\n\nIV. TWO PROBLEMS OF CONSISTENCY\n\nThere remain for consideration two problems of consistency. Both are related\nto the matter of estimating the probable height of an optimum tariff. The first is\nconcerned with the extent to which protection is consistent with the maintenance of\na high degree of allocative efficiency in an economy. In the welfare jargon of earlier\nsections, the problem might be phrased : Granted that the imposition of an optimum\ntariff structure will shift the possibility locus outwards, may it not twist, or even shift\ninwards, the efficiency locus\u2014for may not protection give birth to monopoly, and so\ndisrupt the allocative efficiency of an economy ? This is one of those questions we\ncannot answer theoretically. But it does seem probable that considerations of this\n\n! Official Papers (London, 1926), pp. 382-3.\n? Cf.

The assumptions which have to be\nmade to derive it are rather restrictive. In particular, it is, of course, extremely unlikely\nthat all '' cross-elasticities \" will ever vanish identically.! Even when all goods are\nindependent in production (i.e. when all productive factors are completely specific),\nthey still compete for the consumer's income. Indeed, only when all consumer demand\nschedules have unit elasticity is it possible for a change in the price of any one good to\nhave no effect at all on the demand for one or more of the others. When there is some\ndegree of substitutability in production, and demand schedules are not thus circum-\nscribed, the ''cross-elasticities \" must be taken into account. To neglect them is to\ncommit the unjustifiable act of carrying over into general equilibrium analysis assump-\ntions appropriate to partial equilibrium analysis only.\n\nThe objection to the use of formula (3) rather than formula (2) is twofold. Firstly,\nit may give an exaggerated idea of the height of the optimum tariff. And, secondly,\nit obscures the interesting fact that the optimum '' tariff '\" is sometimes a subsidy.\nThis fact is interesting because it throws light on the usual discussion on Tariffs and\nthe Terms of Trade, in which the possibility of a subsidy on imports being required to\nturn the terms of trade in one's favour is seldom considered.\n\nEconomists have been aware of the possibility of a country turning the terms of\ntrade in its favour by protection ever since the time of John Stuart Mill?\u2014if not\nTorrens and Ricardo. But the actual effect of a tariff on the terms of trade is a rather\ncomplicated matter, and has seldom been analysed in detail. The fullest theoretical\ntreatment available is probably that provided by Dr. Mosak, to whose monograph on\nGeneral Equilibrium Theory in International Trade* the reader may find it helpful to\nrefer. Briefly, the position is that if we make the simplifying assumption that the\ngovernment spends the proceeds of the tariff on exports only, the terms of trade\nmust, in a two-country, two-commodity model, move in favour of the protecting\ncountry\u2014unless the imported good is markedly inferior, so that the demand for it\nincreases as its price rises. In a multi-commodity world, on the other hand, it does\nnot seem to be possible to generalise about the direction of the movement in the terms\nof trade\u2014even when we abstract from the inevitable index number problem involved\nin saying what the terms of trade are when more than two commodities are traded\ninternationally. The crucial factors turn out to be the relations of complementarity\nand substitution existing between the traded goods. They can turn the terms of trade\nin either direction.\n\nThe two-commodity case, however, is the one most theoretical economists have\nin mind when discussing problems of international trade. It is the easiest to handle\ngeometrical ; and by talking of '\" two bales of commodities \" rather than '' two\ncommodities \"' it can be invested with a fictitious air of generality. It is not altogether\nsurprising, therefore, that they should have tended to ignore the rather odd case\nwhere imports are markedly inferior and the Giffen Paradox operates, and to have\n\n1 Mr. Kahn is aware of this when he warns that his elasticities are not true elasticities at all, but what\nmight be called ''elasticities in the Pigou sense.\" Cf. loc. cit., p. 17 and A.

In this exceptional case,\ntherefore, free trade establishes the General Optimum\u201434.e. lands us on the possibility\nlocus.\n\nIn the more usual case, however, it will be necessary to adjust domestic prices\n(since foreign prices are not within our control) to secure the satisfaction of equation (1).\nThe simplest method of adjustment is to put an ad valorem tax of a;[p; on the ;th good\nwhenever it crosses the frontier\u2014the tax being calculated on the foreign price. Then\nwe would have:\n\nvi \u2014 $i (1 c ailbi)\n\n7j \u2014 Bj (1 d ajlbj)\nwhich is what is required. In the welfare terminology of previous sections, these taxes\nlead us to the possibility locus, and are therefore at least potentially beneficial: once\nthey have been imposed wealth can be so redistributed that every citizen of our country\nis better off than he was under free trade. Stated in another way : compared with the\nfree trade situation, the imposition of the optimum taxes shifts the possibility locus\noutwards.\n\nThis scheme of taxing both imports and exports is essentially the same as the\none Professor Lerner suggests in The \u00c9conom\u00fccs of Control] The only difference\nresults from the fact that he implicitly assumes that all '' cross-elasticities '' of demand\nand supply vanish identically. It will readily be seen that whenever this procedure\nis legitimate our tax on imports reduces to the reciprocal of the foreign elasticity of\nsupply, and our tax on exports to the reciprocal of the foreign elasticity of demand.\nThis is Professor Lerner's elegant result. When the ''cross-elasticities \" cannot be\nneglected, however, it is likely to be a little misleading. For, in general, we cannot\neven say what the szens of the a; will be; and, as we shall see, cases can arise where\nthe attainment of the General Optimum requires subsidies (or negative taxes) on both\nimports and exports. Yet this phenomenon is in no way related to changes in the\nsigns of Professor Lerner's elasticities.\n\nOur formula is also very closely related to the Bickerdike-Edgeworth-Kahn-\nLittle formula for the optimum tariff. In fact, ours reduces to it in a world in which\nbut two commodities are traded internationally?, and where all the '' cross-elasticities ''\nvanish identically.

To adjust the domestic import-export\nprice ratio to it we need not tax both imports and exports: a single tax will do the\ntrick.

It is usually suggested that this is to be effected through the price\nmechanism : consumers equate their marginal rates of substitution, and producers\ntheir marginal rates of transformation, to given domestic price ratios. In an open\neconomy, however, the establishment of the General Optimum requires too that\nmarginal rates of transformation in home factories should be equal to marginal rates\nof transformation through foreign trade.

The answer, I think, depends upon the\ncontext. There is little point in bothering about possibility loci if there is no chance of\nthe community ever attaining them. A change will lead us from a point on one effi-\nciency locus to a point on another. Its potential desirability should normally be judged\non this basis. Then we can consider the further question of improving the allocative\nefficiency of the system so as to make the efficiency locus approach closer to its possi-\nbility boundary. Such an improvement is always at least potentially beneficial. But\nit cannot be taken for granted. Its achievement is a matter quite distinct from the\npotential desirability of the change. Thus an invention which shifts the efficiency\nlocus inwards should normally be regarded as potentially harmful, even if it shifts the\npossibility locus outwards. But it may well be that the same invention f/us a vigorous\ntrust-busting campaign would shift the efficiency locus outwards. In that case the\ninvention 2/us the trust-busting, as opposed to the invention alone, is to be judged at\nleast potentially beneficial. This would be true even if the invention were to involve\nan inward shift of the possibility locus\u2014although, in the latter eventuality, it might\nbe thought that the trust-busting without the invention might be potentially even\nmore beneficial. This would not necessarily be correct, however, for the success of a\ngiven trust-busting campaign might not be altogether independent of the invention.\n\nThe question to which the various exponents! of '' compensation tests \"' in welfare\n\ntheory have addressed themselves is essentially a part of the wider problem of deter-\nmining just what a particular change will do to the efficiency locus. But even the\nmost powerful of these tests\u2014 Professor de Scitovszky's well-known double one\u2014\ncannot always detect a twist in the locus. This the reader can verify by glancing at\nFig. 3. There we consider a move from R on the first locus to S on the second. It\nbenefits Alpha, but Beta suffers. Alpha can, how-\never, profitably bribe Beta into accepting the change f E P]\n(cf. Q), and Beta cannot profitably bribe Alpha into\nrejecting it. Yetthelocicross. Professor de Scitovszky's\ntest is not quite strong enough for our purposes. (It\nis, of course, perfectly correct to say that Q represents\na point of greater welfare than R, for both Alpha and\nBeta are better off in Q than in R. But this is not to\nsay that the change is even potentially beneficial.\nFor there is no reason what- soever why we should\njudge the old situation with reference to the single\npoint R. Nor is there any reason for judging the new Fre ET\nsituation with reference to Q alone.) |\n\nThe problem of determining the behaviour of the efficiency locus in any actual\nsituation is a very difficult one, and does not lend itself at all readily to theoretical\ntreatment. In discussing optimum tariff structures in the next section, therefore, we\nshall concern ourselves chiefly with the possibility locus. But we should bear in mind\nthat this is very much a second best, and that what we are really after is the efficiency\nlocus.\n\n1N.

Thus\nwe shall see that the erection of an optimum tariff structure can never twist the locus,\nbut must always shift it outwards.\n\nII. THE EFFICIENCY LOCUS\n\nIn any actual situation our community is unlikely to be on the possibility locus :\nit is likely to be well inside it. A redistribution of wealth by lump-sum taxes and\nbounties (which are assumed to cost nothing to collect and distribute) will normally\nmove it to another position inside the locus. Any such redistribution will normally\nalso affect the allocative efficiency of the system, increasing the degree of monopoly in\nsome parts and diminishing it in others. The locus of all points in the (a, B)-plane\ntraced out by redistributions of this kind we shall call the efficiency locus, because it\nindicates the allocative efficiency of the system for various distributions of welfare.\nOptimum allocative efficiency, for a particular distribution of welfare, is not attained\nunless the possibility and efficiency loci coincide in the point corresponding to that\ndistribution. But optimum allocative efficiency is seldom achieved, and the efficiency\nlocus will usually lie beneath the possibility one.\n\nThose steeped in the traditional surplus analysis may find it helpful to think of a\npoint on the efficiency locus as indicating the total consumer's and producer's surplus\nenjoyed by each of Alpha and Beta in any actual situation. A point on the possibility\nlocus, on the other hand, represents the maximum either could enjoy, given the amount\nenjoyed by the other, if the economic system were to be organised in an optimum\nmanner\u2014i.e. if the Paretean General Optimum were to obtain.\n\nTechnological progress, or a change of some other kind, is likely to affect both the\npossibility and the efficiency loci. It may shift one and twist the other, or affect both\nin the same way. There are, in fact, nine different combinations to consider: any\none of the three different types of movement of the possibility locus can be associated\nwith any one of the three different types of movement of the efficiency locus. For\ninstance, an invention which shifts the possibility locus outwards may confer on the\ninnovator monopoly power so great that the efficiency locus is given a twist, or even\nshifted inwards.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:49:31 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

That is the correct meaning of the phrase '\"' the ends must be given.\"\nBut, as can easily be seen, the phrase '' the ends must be given \" can have a different\ninterpretation. It may suggest that the welfare economist can say nothing until\nsomeone, or some committee, actually comes along and says '' These are my value\njudgments. Now get along with the job of making your deductions.\" But this is quite\nfalse. The word '' given \" in the sentence '' the ends must be given \" is, of course, a\nmetaphor. The welfare economist can make deductions from any value premises he\nchooses, and say '' These conclusions follow from these premises. Take them or leave\nthem.\" Or, if he wishes to make propaganda (and why should we even deny him that ?)\nhe can state his value conclusions, and carefully conceal the premises.\n\nIn his chapter on *' Welfare Economics,\" in The Foundations of Economic Analysis,\nProfessor Samuelson adopts a technique of exposition which, in view of his great\ninfluence, may possibly be unfortunate. -He holds that value judgments must be given,\nin the sense that, without value postulates, we cannot have welfare conclusions. But\nhe puts these value judgments into the mouth of some postulated being or Being.\nTo quote: '' Without inquiring into its origins we take as a starting-point for our\ndiscussion a function of all the economic magnitudes of a system which is supposed to\ncharacterise some ethical belief\u2014that of a benevolent despot, or a complete egotist,\nor ' all men of goodwill, a misanthrope, the State, race, or group mind, God, etc.\"\nThis may mislead people into thinking that the postulates of a logical system must\nliterally be given by someone. In fact, we can deduce conclusions from postulates\nwithout ever needing to suppose that they ar\u00e9 given by anyone or believed in by\nanyone. Postulates do not require to have \"' origins.\" Whether or not anyone believes\nin the truth of, or '' gives\" us, some sentences, called premises, is irrelevant to the\nquestion whether certain other sentences, called conclusions, follow from them.\nSamuelson's introduction of a benevolent despot, God, etc., is surely meant to be\nmerely a device for the purposes of separating off those sentences, which are value\nsentences, from those which are not. Value sentences are only '' put into the mouth\nof\" God, etc., for the purpose of distinguishing them from descriptive sentences.\nBut this purely expositional device might mislead people into thinking that the\neconomist really has to wait until someone, or some Government, comes along and\nhands him his premises on a platter (unless he is prepared to '' give \" them to himself).\nTaking the sentence '' The ends must be given \"' literally is thus a possible explanation\nof why some economists might be misled into accepting the rather servile view of\ntheir functions which Mr. Henderson puts forward. But, as I said above and wish to\nemphasise, this sentence means '' value conclusions can only be deduced from value\npremises.\"\n\nOxford. I. M. D. LirrrE.\n\n!'

Thus,\nthe strain in the balance of payments during the boom was probably due to the excess\nof the outflow of long-term capital over the surplus in the balance of payments on\nincome account, which was also increasing. Short-term capital movements were easily\ninduced through manipulation of the discount rate by the Bank of England, which\nhad managed to ensure sufficient control over the British money market in contrast\nwith the relatively passive policies of the Continental central banks.! Thus, short-\nterm capital movements and perhaps also reinforcements in gold supplies ensured\nequilibrium in the balance of payments and probably helped in the prevention of a\nshortage of funds during the boom years in the U.K.?\n\nLong-term foreign lending declined sharply in the advanced stages of the boom\nand continued to fall during the years of recession and depression, when the surplus of\nthe balance on current account was also declining. But the contraction in British\nlong-term foreign investment was apparently greater than the reduction of the surplus\non current account. An equilibrating outflow of short-term capital, supported by net\nexports of gold, was therefore probably necessary. At the same time the deterioration\nof the British net barter terms of trade was a factor offsetting, at least partially, the\ndepressing impact of the sharp reduction in the rate of British long-term lending and\nconstituted probably a condition stimulating the revival of activity in the primary\nproducing areas of the world.\n\nCambridge.

If they did, it\nwould mean frequent changes in output which would entail frequent calculations of\nthe worry which would be caused by such changes, as well as the possibility of increased\nprofits offsetting that worry. It may be that because of the worry involved in deciding\nwhat the net result of any change in output will be the business man finds it best to\ncarry on as long as possible at any given level of output, and only when this is patently\nimpossible does he feel the trouble of changing output worth while. Thus the effect\nof the entrepreneur's desire to avoid the worry of changing output may be to cause\ninertia. In small firms this tendency to inertia seems to be only too apparent.\n\nIt will no doubt be objected that the whole of this analysis is useless because the\nmagnitude of the '' anti-worry \" premium is, in any case, impossible to measure. But\nis this important if it can at any rate explain the wey in which equilibrium can be\nreached ? After all, what do we really know about marginal revenue and marginal\ncost? Yet economic analysis speaks blithely about equating them. There are good\nreasons for believing that the present analysis is at least as useful as the conventional\none.\n\nIt seems, then, that marginal theory suffers from three main defects: (ri) Many\nfirms do not attempt to maximise profits at all. (2) Subjective estimates and influences\nare very important, and marginal theory tends to overlook them. (3) It is largely a\nstatic theory.\n\nThe first defect is probably inevitable since it is difficult for such a theory to work\nefficiently unless it assumes a maximisation problem, but the other defects may well\nbe remedied. If our theory is to be brought more closely into line with practice, we\nmust develop a deeper understanding of business psychology and expectations and\nconstruct more fruitful dynamic analyses of the firm.\n\nUniversity College, London.

It is made up of\nthree parts, one attributable to each of the variables x, d and , and it seems desirable\nto discuss each of these parts separately.\n\nLA *| 7\nFIG. 3A. fiQG, 58. FIG. Sc.\n\n\u00ab\"zot\n\n4c\nio t-cunva\ne *\n\ne *\n\nOuTPuT ourTPu? ou*\u00bburt\n\n(N.B.\u2014These are all marginal curves.)\n\nThe x-curve (showing the amount of money needed to offset managerial worry\nat each level of output) is likely to be of the shape shown in Fig. 3A. This infers that,\nas output increases the intensity and quantity of the managerial worry needed to\nproduce it increases more than in proportion. The amount of money needed to offset\nthis worry increases similarly. At a certain level, perhaps where a new machine becomes\nnecessary, the amount of money needed to offset the worry of deciding whether to\nhave it may well increase rapidly, declining once the decision to install the machine\nhas been made. Thus the bulge on the curve may appear.\n\nFrom Fig. 3B the d-curve (showing the amount of money needed to offset the\nworry of actual or potential Government action at each output) seems likely to rise\nwith output. The greater the output the greater the worry of the forms to be filled in\nand the greater the worry arising from the danger of nationalisation. It seems reason-\nable to think that there will be different d-curves at different times. Here, the one\nd (C) represents the position under Sir Stafford Cripps, the other 2 (D) under Dr.\nHugh Dalton.\n\nIn Fig. 3C the \u00a3-curve (showing the amount of money needed to make taxes at\neach level of output worth paying) is seen, given the general tax structure and its\nprogressiveness, to change more than in proportion with profits, reaching a maximum\nvalue when profits do so. The hump in the curve will be accentuated by the fact that,\nas profits rise, the marginal utility of money to the entrepreneur declines, and so the\nprofits are less worth the effort needed to earn them. Strictly speaking, with our\npresent tax system there should be discontinuities in the curve where the rate of tax\nchanges. It seems reasonable to ignore these here.\n\nIt must be remembered that the position of all these curves will change with the\npassage of time. At any given moment, however, each will be related to either profits\nor output, and I feel that the relationship will be as suggested. Of course, all this\nassumes that entrepreneurs can attribute an objective value to subjective concepts,\nbut I feel that this is not, unreasonable.\n\nReturning to Fig. 2 and summing the three curves, it is possible to show the\n\" anti-worry \" premium by the curve PM which gives it a marginal value. Adding this\ncurve to marginal costs, as in the curve MC -- P, it can be seen that equilibrium\nwill be reached where output \u2014 OM' and price \u2014 OP'.

The following analysis is carried out on these\nlines, but it is intended to apply only to the '' one-man \" firm. It would be inappro-\npriate in other cases.!\n\nThe conventional analysis of the individual firm is, of course, carried out as\n\nfollows.?\nHere, equilibrium will be reached where output\nOM is sold at price OP, for then marginal revenue\nwill equal marginal cost. The analysis is based\non the assumption that entrepreneurs wish to\nmaximise monetary profits.\n\nFrom our survey, however, it seems reasonable\nto conclude that some entrepreneurs do not act\nin this way. Soit may well be useful to assume\nthat entrepreneurs fix output at the same level\nas they would if they mentally increased their\ncosts by a hypothetical allowance in respect of\nwhat I shall christen an '' anti-worry \" premium.\nThis premium represents entrepreneurs' estimates of the amount of money needed, in\naddition to cost (including \" normal\" profit), to persuade them to produce a given\noutput. Its purpose is to ensure that the sale of output amply repays entrepreneurs\nfor the worries and difficulties which arise from its production and sale.\n\nSymbolically, we may define the '\"' anti-worry \" premium (P) in any given circum-\nstances in the function :\n\n[I\n\nou?*\u00bbur\n\nP \u2014 \u00e0 (x, d, t)\n\nWhere x \u2014 the worry and difficulty involved in directing production,\nd \u2014 the worry caused by actual or potential Government action,\n? \u2014 the burden of the current rate of (progressive) taxation on profits.\nCarrying the analysis further, it seems likely that x, d and / are themselves dependent\nvariables, as in the functions :\n\nx\u2014g() . d\u2014f(o) andt\u2014F (9)\nwhere 0 \u2014 output and $ \u2014 profits.\n\nClearly, if we are to assess the magnitude of P, we must obtain a monetary\n\nestimate of each of the variables x, d and \u00a3. In\norder to see how this might be done in practice,\nlet us consider a concrete example\u2014Fig. 2\n(neglecting for the moment the curves PM and\nMC 4- P).\nHere we assume, to simplify the diagram, that\nmarginal costs are constant over '\" normal\"\nranges of output but rise quickly once \"' normal\"\ncapacity is exceeded. The position of equili-\nbrium, on the conventional assumptions, is where\noutput \u2014 OM, price \u2014 OP and \" supernormal\"\nprofits are OM x WP.\n\nFrom this information we can now make a\n\n\"o-\u00bb*\n\nOout*to\u00bbvut\n\n1!

                    "154 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nIt was generally agreed that prices would have to be reduced in slumps, but\nthough few, if any, of the firms studied had scientific policies for meeting conditions\nof depressed trade, it seems that there was little need to deviate from ''full cost \"\npolicies in the Black Country during the 1930's.\n\nIV. THE USEFULNESS OF MARGINAL THEORY\n\nIt is now possible to discuss marginal theory in the light of these results and to\ndraw the following conclusions :\n\n(1) The desire for maximum monetary profits, though it seems stronger in large\nthan in small firms, is not ubiquitous. The main reasons why some firms do not try\nto earn maximum profits seem to be (a) that some only want a '' reasonable \" income ;\n(b) that some prefer a smaller but more certain income, and (c) that non-pecuniary\nfactors are taken into account, e.g. output is not increased beyond a level where entre-\npreneurial effort and worry outweighs expected gains. In this last case, there is, of\nCourse, a maximisation decision, but it is of a rather different kind. All these factors\nare no doubt important, but it seems likely that since economic theory is best able to\ngive definite results when it is concerned with relatively simple maximisation problems,\nthe assumption of profit-maximisation may be as useful as any.\n\n(2) In practice, business men can base policy only on subjective estimates of cost\nand revenue. Prices are therefore usually based on accounting estimates of average\ncost adapted to conform to expectations of demand conditions. So, whilst many firms\nclaim to earn maximum profits, it is doubtful whether they have enough information\nto be sure whether they are doing so or not. As a result, an equilibrium position in\nthe real world may well be one where an entrepreneur \u00a3Ain&s he is earning maximum\nprofits and need not be one where he ;s earning them.\n\n(3) None of the firms studied attempted to equate marginal revenue and marginal\ncost as such. Some firms did not wish to earn maximum profits in any case, but even\nthose who did used other methods. This was either because they had never heard of\nmarginal analysis, or, where they had, because they found calculations of the relevant\nitems impossible. Profit-maximisation by balancing cost against revenue was, however,\ncarried out, but only on a long-term and unscientific basis. Short-run profit-maximisa-\ntion is usually unacceptable in practice.\n\n(4) Whilst, since they cannot calculate marginal cost and marginal revenue,\nbusiness men are forced to base their prices on estimates of average cost and average\nrevenue, this does not mean that they equate average cost and average revenue.\nIndeed, the main occupation of most entrepreneurs is keeping the margin between\nthese as wide as possible at any given level of output.\n\n(5) Business men are usually unaware of the true meaning of marginal analysis,\nand so, while some of them do realise that, in bad times, they should cover only\nvariable costs, most of them do not know what type of policy to follow in a depression.\n\n(6) Whilst marginal theory is not yet fully dynamic, it seems that if it is to become\ndynamic, it must show in particular how entrepreneurs' estimates of cost and revenue\nare derived, how they decide between earning different incomes with different prob-\nabilities of being earned and involving different risks! and how, when, and why changes\nin price and output are made.\n\nIt will be seen from these conclusions that, as Professor Boulding has said, '* The\nproblem * What does the entrepreneur maximise ?' . . . becomes an acute one.\"? It\n\n1See, however, ''Some Notes on Monopoly Price,\" R. H. Coase, REVIEW oF EcoNoMIC STUDIES,\n\nVol. 5, p. 17, where an outline of this kind of analysis is given.\n?

                    "ECONOMIC THEORY AND BUSINESS BEHAVIOUR I53\n\nHaving said something about price-fixing policies in general, we must consider\nhow they are applied in boom and slump. In times of boom, prices are, of course,\nstill based on '' full cost \" but the profit margins which they include are increased.\nSuch increases seem to be limited by entrepreneurs' fears of the effects of raising\nprices too far. No one likes to be the first to raise prices for fear of being branded a\n\" rob dog \" ora \" speculator \" and losing trade, for all fear the reaction of customers and\ncompetitors (see Table V). One business man said that in a boom he would aim at a\nprofit margin of 1o per cent to 15 per cent instead of the 10 per cent which he tried\nto earn normally.\n\nThere does, however, sometimes seem to be a quasi-moral objection to increased\nprices, and a statement by the owner of a small foundry puts this very clearly. He\nsaid, \"\" In a boom we should put some money away for a rainy day, but we should not\ngreatly increase prices. Indeed, it would be wrong for us to charge high prices to\ncustomers of thirty years' standing. Besides, there is what amounts to an unwritten\nlaw in the industry that sellers should not charge prices which are unnecessarily high.\nOur main fear is that if we did, buyers would retaliate in a slump.\"\n\nTo sum up, then, in times of boom the profit margins which '' full cost \" involves\nwill be increased as far as it seems safe and reasonable to do so. The main aim of\nbusiness men is to avoid making short-run gains at the expense of long-run profits.\nPrices would, of course, be raised to cover increases in cost.\n\nFinally, we turn to price policy in slumps. In such conditions '' fall cost \"\" policy\nis difficult to apply, and, to judge from the opinions of business men, policy becomes\nconfused, complicated and uncertain. Especially in small firms, there is little science\nin price-fixing during slumps. That is to say, while it is not unusual to find large firms\nrefusing to accept orders at prices which would not cover their estimated '' direct \"\"\n(or '* variable \"\") costs,! several of the small firms studied seemed to undertake blind\nslashing of prices.\n\nOn the other hand, there are very strong objections to charging less than \"' full\ncost,\" and this policy is not lightly abandoned even during a depression, but is often\npursued for as long as is humanly possible. Most interesting of all, however, it was\nfound that while entrepreneurs admitted that prices would usually be cut in slumps,\nthey not only seemed. to regard this as in opposition to a familiar and conventional\nmode of behaviour, but also as far less serious than many economists seem to assume.\nFor a very large proportion of the employers interviewed, though they \u00e0dmitted that\nprices would have to be reduced, spoke of this price change as entailing merely a\nreduction in the profit margin received. Very few of them envisaged actual losses.\nThere seem to be two reasons for this.\n\nFirst, the area studied was not badly hit by the slump of the 1930's and trade\nsoon improved. Second, the firms which did suffer big losses will by now have gone\nbankrupt and so cannot be surveyed at all !\n\nThere are, of course, some instances of prices being raised during slumps. For\nexample, T/e Autocar stated on. January roth, 1930, that \"' increased prices at the\nNew York Show are the result of excess production compelling lower output; hence\nthe cost per car is higher.\" Mrs. Robinson has given the plausible explanation? that\nelasticity of demand had fallen and this explained the price rise, but it seems quite\nlikely that adherence to '' full cost \" policy is the real explanation. As Lord Keynes\nhas suggested, '' it is rare for anyone but an economist to suppose that price is pre-\ndominantly governed by marginal cost.\"'?\n\n1 See, for example, an article by A.

There is no reason, however, to think that firms which seek maximum\nprofits in the long run do not fix output so as to earn them. One difficulty, of course,\nis that because business expectations are so uncertain, changes in output are usually\nmade hesitantly, and the time lags inevitable in a dynamic world are always present.\nAnother difficulty is that if firms were to seek maximum profits in the short run, the\ngymnastic display required to keep price and output always at the requisite level\nwould prove impracticable. It is interesting to note that one of the few firms which\ndid try to maximise short-run profits (ie. given its existing equipment, there being\nno desire to expand) was one making ladies' fashion goods. Here, there was no desire\nto avoid penalising the consumer, high prices were charged, and changes in the type\nof article produced were very frequent. In more stable industries, this type of behaviour\nwould soon alienate customers and a steadier policy is followed.\n\nThe following tables give the ostensible reasons why prices were not higher or\nlower.\n\nTABLE IV\nReason why $rices were not lower.\n\nLarge Small\n\nfirms firms\nFear of retaliation by competitors 2 I\nNo response by consumers e e. e \u2014 2\nActual or tacit agreement to maintain prices 6 2\nProfits good, price change would reduce them \u2014 7\n8 I2\n\nTasrE V\nReason why $rices were not higher.\n\nLarge Small\n\nfirms firms\nFear of reaction of consumers or competitors 3 IO\nActual or tacit agreement 5 \u2014\nNo desire to earn higher profits \u2014 2\n8 I2\n\nThese figures seem to support the view that a ''full cost \" policy and profit-\nmaximisation are not inconsistent. Most of the firms felt that lower prices would\nlessen profits and were therefore undesirable. In the large firms, there was often a\ntrade association to back up this policy, but in small firms it was carried out voluntarily.\nOn the other hand, prices were not higher because, in most cases, it was thought that\nthere was nothing to be gained from increasing them in view of the expected reactions\nof customers and competitors. It must, of course, be admitted that before the war\nprices would probably have been lowered more readily, and that it is inflationary\npressure which prevents price reductions now, but this does not invalidate the claim\nthat '' full cost \" policy and profit maximisation are quite compatible and consistent.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:56:21 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Where\nconventional or controlled prices were already fixed, the method adopted was different.\nHere, the controlled or fixed price was taken as a target, and the design and quality\nof the product altered to allow the conventional profit margin to be earned when this\nprice was charged.\n\nIf firms do calculate prices in this way, they will arrive at a final figure which will\nbe identical with ''full cost\" as defined by Messrs. Hall and Hitch. Full cost is\ndefined by them in this way: '\" Prime (or ' direct \") cost per unit is taken as a base,\na percentage addition is made to cover overheads (or 'oncost' or ' indirect ' cost),\nand a further conventional addition (frequently ro per cent) is made for profit.\"\nWhile there is no time to debate the matter fully, it may well be that accounting\nconventions provide the main force ensuring the continuance of '' full cost \"\" policies,\nfor what can be easier than to add 5 per cent or 1o per cent to accounting estimates\nof '' total cost \"\" and leave price-fixing at that ?\n\nBut while it is impossible to disagree with the conclusions of those economists\nwhose empirical researches have led them to the conclusion that business men pursue\na. '' full cost \"\" price policy, this does not lead inevitably to the conclusion that marginal\nanalysis is useless.\n\nFirst it must be remembered that business men are always working from incom-\nplete data; they must inevitably take estimated average cost as a basis for their price\npolicy, since this is usually the only figure which they can calculate. Nor is it very\ncom\u00edorting for business men to be told? that if conditions of demand and supply\nremain constant they will be able to find that output which maximises profit by trial\nand error. For in the real world conditions rarely are stable and even profit-maximisa-\ntion by trial and error may be a dangerous pastime. In practice, when there is any\nchange in price, all that the entrepreneur is certain about is the actual result. He\ncan hardly retrace his steps and see what results other price changes could have had.\nEven where the business man tries to maximise profits, he can only do so by taking\na risk, making a change which he assumes will be to his benefit, and seeing what the\nresult is. He cannot then compare this result with that of an alternative move, and\nwhilst he may think that his profits are now maximised, he may be wrong. To suggest\nthat he can do anything else is to imply superhuman knowledge about the results of\npossible moves on his part.\n\nSecond, as has been suggested, a number of entrepreneurs, especially in small\nfirms, did not wish to maximise monetary profits in any case. Where an entrepreneur\nonly tries to earn a '' reasonable \" income, he can hardly be maligned for refusing to\nfollow a line of action which would give him maximum profits !\n\nAllowing for these difficulties, however, there seems no reason to think that the\npursuit of a \"full cost \" policy is necessarily inconsistent with profit-maximisation.\nIn all the firms studied, where the entrepreneurs did aim at maximum profits, they\nclearly tried to keep the margin of profit included in '' full cost \" as wide as possible\nunder given market conditions. While it is quite certain that several entrepreneurs\nrefrained from price changes because they feared the results of such changes, this\nsurely implies nothing but that they thought that they were better off as things were.\nTheir reasons for refusing to change prices may result from incorrect or uncertain\nexpectations, or even purely subjective and non-pecuniary influences, but this merely\ncomplicates their maximisation decision and does not invalidate it.\n\nIt is true, of course, that even if a firm were earning maximum profits, given its\npresent output, this would be no guarantee that profits might not be larger at other\n\n1 Hall and Hitch, op. cit., p. 19.\n?

                    "150 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nwhile there is little doubt that in the long run large firms do try to maximise profits,\nthis can be done only on the basis of their expectations of cost and revenue. These\nmay be wrong, but in most cases it is impossible for the firm to be sure whether a\npolicy based on any other expectations would be more successful. Second, it seems\nthat the output policy of the large firms was, in essence, marginal. Expansion was\nundertaken only if the net result was expected to be increased profits. Admittedly,\nthe estimates of cost and revenue used were long-run ones, but that hardly invalidates\nthe whole of marginal analysis, though it does throw doubt on the importance of\nshort-run analyses of the firm.\n\nIt must be admitted, however, that the firms concerned were at the time chary\nof increasing profits because of trade union views, and developments since the '' wage\nfreeze \"' in 1948 have no doubt accentuated this feeling, but this is likely to be only a\npassing phase. There was also a tendency in large firms to put much money into\nwelfare and re-equipment schemes, but this is clearly not inconsistent with long-term\nprofit-maximisation.\n\nOne further difficulty in large firms is that the divorce between ownership and\ncontrol, which is greatest in such firms, lessens the personal interest of management\nin profit-maximisation. The quest for maximum profits is, therefore, probably carried\nout less diligently than it would be if the management were directly interested in\n\nrofits.\n\nP To sum up, two distinct types of output policy were found. In small firms output\nwas rarely fixed so as to equate marginal cost and marginal revenue, but by rule-of-\nthumb methods, and there was no widespread desire to earn maximum profits.\nObviously some profits had to be made, and just because these businesses did not seek\nmaximum profits, they were not thereby debarred from earning a great deal. Business\nmen are always the first to stress the fact that if they do not try to earn reasonable\nprofits, they will probably suffer losses.\n\nIn large firms, on the other hand, there was a greater desire to earn maximum\nprofits\u2014in the words of one manager, '' You can never earn too much for the share-\nholders \"\u2014but again there was no attempt at careful balancing of marginal revenue\nand marginal cost. In general these firms seemed to be satisfied that long-run profits\nwere maximised, but they had no scientific policy for ensuring this. There was only\na rough-and-ready application of whatever vague expectations of costs and demand\nthey happened to possess.\n\n(b PnRicE Poricv\n\nThe business men's views on price policy were found to be almost unanimous.\nWhere there was no conventional or controlled price for an article, almost all of them\nadmitted that its price was based on '' cost \" and this usually meant the accountant's\nestimate of '' total unit cost \"\u2014corresponding broadly to the economist's '' average\ncost.\"! This estimate usually made allowance for expected changes in the cost of\nmaterials or factors of production and was based on an expected level of output decided\nupon in advance. To this estimate of the '' total cost \" of each article was added a\nprofit margin, based largely on convention. This margin varied from 5 per cent to\nI5 per cent and was related to the turnovers of the different industries. These were\nfound to vary between a turnover of stock twice a year in some cases to one of five\ntimes in others, and it was invariably found that an industry with a low turnover was\n\n! Until further notice we shall use average cost to mean average cost excluding normal profits, since\nbusiness men do not include normal profits in their cost calculations. We shall also ignore the problems\nwhich arise from the fact that business men do not all calculate average cost in the same way. For example,\nwe shall ignore problems arising from different practices in calculating depreciation allowances, but it must\nbe remembered that these are very important in practice.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:56:21 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The chief reason for this seemed to be that the owners of these\nfirms wished, as a rule, merely to earn a comfortable and secure income, and once they\nhad done this they felt that the management problems involved in further expansion\nwould not be worth the returns which they would bring. These firms could almost\ncertainly make larger profits, not only by increasing output, but often merely by using\nmore efficient methods. Yet they did not consider this worth while.\n\nThe manager of a small leather firm gave a most explicit statement of his attitude.\nHe made it clear that he aimed only to secure a comfortable living for himself and\nhis workers, saying he had calculated a target figure for output sufficient to keep his\nmain plant, employing 150 workers, fully occupied. Another plant, which he con-\nsidered was not worth the trouble involved in its management, had been sold. The\ndirectors and workers now had a comfortable existence, free from the many worries\nwhich would exist if output were larger. Expansion was quite possible but was simply\nnot desired.\n\nThis attitude seems to typify that of many employers. They believe that man\nwas not made merely to work, and that the best aim in life is to combine the minimum\nof business with the maximum of pleasure. Another leather manufacturer, this time\nof finished goods, said that he had seen men come into the industry, make more money\nin a few years than he had made in his lifetime, and then leave it. Such a policy did\nnot appeal to him. Provided he had sufficient trade to keep his business running, he\nwas quite content.\n\nAnother important reason for this lack of interest in profit-maximisation is that\none of the reactions to the economic difficulties of the inter-war years has been the\ngrowth of a desire to make certain of a comfortable and stable income over a long\nperiod\u2014a sort of insurance policy. At the moment, also, there is a widespread feeling\nthat high profits are welcomed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and one or two\nfirms deliberately earned smaller profits just to spite him!\n\nPolicies such as these seem to be quite general among small firms, and it would\nbe interesting to discover how important they are in industry as a whole. To do this,\nhowever, it would be necessary to estimate the relative importance of the small firm\nin the modern economy\u2014a very difficult task. Nevertheless, it does seem reasonable\nto assume that the small firm, and this type of policy, is by no means unimportant.\nOne final point is important. Such an attitude is likely to be found in small firms,\nsimply because if they pursued a more progressive policy, they would, presumably,\ncease to be small.\n\nIn the large firms studied, as can be seen from Tables II and III, it was thought\nthat both output and profits were as great as possible, though it was usually long-run\nprofits which were maximised. There are two important facts to notice here. First,\n\nc\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:56:21 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The reaction to this\nwas one of immediate panic, and expectations changed radically. The firms now\ndoubted whether they would in future increase sales at all.\n\nThe ignorance among business men of the nature of marginal analysis and the\nobvious impracticability of calculating the magnitudes of the items involved, do not,\nhowever, necessarily mean that marginal analysis is unrealistic. We must discuss\nfirst the output and second the price policies of the firms investigated before we can\nsay whether these were in any way consistent with marginal theory.\n\n(e) OvrPvT Poricy\n\nIn the firms studied in this survey, output appeared to be determined by reference\nto rule-of-thumb methods and not by careful balancing of cost and revenue. The\nfirms studied claimed to try at all times to keep the whole of their existing plants in\noperation, the reasons for this being as much psychological as economic. Almost all\nof them felt that full employment of the plant was a level of activity at which every\nworker was happily occupied, and was therefore a desirable goal, if only for the sake\nof maintaining morale. For various reasons, they were unwilling to dismiss workers,\nand, as always, displayed a rooted objection to seeing any machine idle. Their aim\nwas to find sufficient orders to keep their factories comfortably occupied. If this\nproved impossible, they regarded it as a measure of their failure in their duty as\nemployers.\n\nDespite these statements, however, it does seem certain that no entrepreneur\nwill run his plant in accordance with these ideals if it means running at a loss, except\nfor relatively short periods. On the other hand, the facts that his expectations are\ninvariably very uncertain and that he does not understand the true nature of marginal\nanalysis, often make him unable to decide when it is best to go on running at loss, and\nwhen to close down altogether. Such decisions are usually made more or less arbitrarily\nand very hesitantly.\n\nIt must be clear that if employers do behave in this way, monetary profits need\nnot be maximised. It will, therefore, be interesting to try to find how often maximum\n\nprofits were sought and how often maximum output was produced. The information\ncollected on these points is summarised below :\n\nTABLE II\n\nFirms!

This\nclearly does not matter very much so long as the tariff which the formula suggests\nwill at least cause an improvement. It seems to be true that too small a tariff cannot\ndecrease '' welfare\"' (always assuming that any real income redistribution is not\nunfavourable), but too large a tariff can obviously do so. Even at the static level of\nanalysis there is, therefore, something to be said in favour of aiming at erring on the\nsmall side. The argument from retaliation would certainly support this view.\n\nThere is, however, another consideration to be taken into account. This concept\nof an *' optimum \" tariff depends on many assumptions. We require a purely com-\npetitive system of fully employed economic individuals, who preferably never die.\nAll dynamic elements are also excluded. Thus our static '\"\" welfare \" model hardly\nfits the world like a glove. When could we, in practice, be at all confident that the\npotential losers really would be unable to bribe the potential gainers ? Surely only\nwhen the conceivable gains were large. But our theory says nothing about the size\nof the conceivable gains. This can only be estimated in some very unscientific way.\nYet one requires to be able to say how large the gain would be if our model did fit the\nworld, in order to be able to make an intelligent guess as to whether there would be\nany gain at all, in view of the fact that the model cannot be said to fit very well. Unless\nthe divergence from '' optimum efficiency \"' is startling, it is, in fact, anyone's guess\nas to whether the change would be good, even assuming that everyone accepted the\nvalue judgments involved.\n\nThere is also the fact that it may be rather difficult to describe what the distri-\nbutional effects of a tariff would be. In which case it would be very difficult for anyone\nto decide whether he regarded the probable redistribution as good or bad. To com-\npensate for this uncertainty the conceivable net gains would need to be all the larger.\n\nOur conclusion is then as follows. If it is not considered a bad thing to harm\nthose who consume relatively most imports, then if the '' optimum \"' tariff formula\nsuggests a large general tariff one might, rather tentatively, recommend a small tariff.\nIf only a small tariff were suggested by the formula one could have very little confi-\ndence that it would be worthwhile. This is all, of course, quite apart from specific\ntariffs for specific purposes, or even a general tariff for a specific purpose.\n\nOxford. I. M. D.

But this rate is itself influenced by the rate in the\npreceding period. As it becomes clear that the rate of interest is not going to return\nto its former level, the public presumes that a permanent fall in the rate of interest has\ntaken place. Each time the expectation as to the future rate of interest is changed\nin this way, the curve will be lowered a trifle.\n\nThe conclusion, therefore, seems to be that the speculation curve itself is nearly\nright-angled, falling vertically until it reaches the level of the expected future rate of\ninterest, and then becoming more and more horizontal. It can therefore be said that\nif this statistical investigation gives the correct result, we have confirmed those theories\nof the shape of the liquidity-preference curve, which are based on Keynes' General\nTheory. The only difference, I think, is that the curve is even more right-angled than\nhas previously been supposed. Furthermore, there is no negative amount of speculative\ncash at very high levels of interest, as has sometimes been assumed.\n\n(9) Before we finish this investigation, a brief account should be given of possible\nerrors in the analysis, and the importance of such errors.\n\nIt will be seen immediately that MT is determined in a rather arbitrary way. It\nseems reasonable, however, to assume that all notes, MN, are used for transaction\npurposes. Within the transaction motive we have also included all those extra-\nordinary motives for holding cash in a war period. A great deal of money was needed\nin Danish as well as German illegal transactions. All such transactions had to be paid\nwith notes, as it was too risky to use cheques, which would disclose by whom and\nto whom the payment was made.\n\nA further difficulty in the above calculation of MT is that we have assumed that\nxM p is independent of the rate of interest. Only more detailed investigations can\nshow if this assumption is correct; but it is fair to assume beforehand that the cash\nwhich the banks hold in order to meet daily outlays is very little affected by small\nchanges in the rate of interest they could obtain by placing the money at current\naccount in the central bank. It is possible that some influence can be demonstrated,\nbut as the amount used for transaction purposes in the case of M p is very small, it is\nnot of any importance for the final result, even if M p, T should have been somewhat\nhigher at low rates of interest.\n\nA third objection to the investigation is that it is pure coincidence that the rate\nof interest and Ms are so highly correlated as is the case.\n\nIt might be maintained that the reason why the correlation is nearly perfect is\nthat both of them are correlated with a third phenomenon. We cannot deny that this\npossibility exists, and, of course, our result would have been more convincing if we\nhad had observations from many up and downward movements, instead of for one\nperiod only. That the result, however, is not merely coincidental is shown by the\nfact that our result is in agreement with theoretical considerations.\n\nA more thorough investigation of this problem would require a comparison with\nsimilar investigations for other periods and other countries.

For suppose that it were true. Then\nwe would be back at our system (i) to (ro) above. This system presumably has a\nsolution, C \u2014 C (t), R \u2014 R (f), X \u2014 X (t), etc., for all the ten variables involved.\nThese solutions contain only one arbitrary constant, which, for example, may be the\nvalue of K at! \u2014 fo. Only under special assumptions could these solutions be such that,\nfor all values of \u00a3, wN \u2014 constant, and PK \u2014 constant.\n\nHence, we reach the following conclusions : (2) An expansion, or contraction, of\nthe total wage bill and the value of the capital stock takes place only as long as the\npoint of maximum profit is not yet reached. (b) If, at a point of time when marginal\nproductivity of labour is equal to the real wage rate, N is not zero, this must be due\nto the fact that w is z^ zero. (c) If, at a point of time when the marginal productivity\nof capital is equal to the rate of interest, K (i.e. real investment) is not zero, this must\nbe due to the fact that P is z^ zero.\n\nEquation (44*) brings out the '' high-volatility \"\" nature of the rate of real invest-\nment. It depends, at any given moment upon the degree to which profit has been\nmaximized and upon the type of price movements that the system permits. Further-\nmore, it is likely that a, is a rather unstable parameter.\n\nThe '' high-volatility \" nature of the demand for investment and its influence\nupon employment can also be described in another way : The su$ply of goods depends\non the presence of a certain sock of labour and a certain stock of capital and, thus,\nimplies\u2014on the part of the producers\u2014essentially a demand function for N and a\ndemand function for K. But the demand for the outbut, X, depends on the demand\nfor D and the demand for K. Since the essential parameters of action of the producers\nare their shares of K and not of K, an effective demand for all the investment goods\nthat the producers want to supply can be insured only by the presence of some stable\nelement of '' inertia \" as suggested by the dynamic relation (44*).\n\nAs a further expansion of the system considered above one might add to the\nright-hand side of (44) a term representing autonomous investment purchases due\nto innovations, etc. This term could then keep the system \"' alive\" (i.e., K z& 0) even\nif the system should otherwise have only damped solutions.\n\nOslo, November, 1948.

According to the same source, the yearly average rose from 93.7 in\n1946 to rIO in I947.\n\nA certain number of favourable circumstances have contributed to bring about\nthis quick and remarkable recovery. Active fighting in Belgium was short and the\ndestruction caused by the Liberation fighting was not so serious as in France or in the\nNetherlands. The country's industrial equipment, although it had to some extent\ngrown old and obsolete, had been fairly well maintained, and could be used to its full\ncapacity as soon as raw materials became available. Modernisation could, without\ngreat inconvenience, be postponed until the greatest shortages had been alleviated.\nThe main body of the labour force had been preserved. The country's large gold\nreserve had been kept intact during the war. Important dollar and sterling payments\nwere received from the Allies in reimbursement for the troop pay advances, while\nother income accumulated from investments abroad and the repatriation of short-\nterm capital also provided substantial exchange receipts. These ample resources in\ngold and foreign exchange enabled Belgium to import large quantities of food, raw\nmaterials and new industrial equipment. The supplies received from the Allies in\ncompensation for the Belgian Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid contributions also brought\nvaluable help. These big imports, allowing production to restart and leading to a\nquick return to normal of supply conditions, were probably the most decisive factor\nin the whole recovery process.\n\nThe orderly relations which were restored in the monetary system through the\nmonetary and fiscal programme, by increasing confidence in the currency and pro-\nmoting at least a relative stability, helped to create a climate propitious for the ex-\nploitation of the country's economic potentialities. The reflationary monetary policy,\nthe flexible and moderately expansive policy followed in respect of prices and wages,\nthe fairly liberal attitude adopted towards production and consumption, should\nalso be considered favourable factors. The general opinion in Belgium is that a com-\nparison of the results achieved so far, with those arrived at in countries like Great\nBritain or the Netherlands, where policies of restriction and control of prices and\ndistribution were applied with much more rigidity, argues in favour of the more\nflexible attitude adopted in Belgium. Personally, we think that it is premature to\ncome to a definite conclusion in this respect, which could only be reached on the basis\nof a thoroughgoing investigation of all the factors involved.\n\nIt would be futile to make any guess as to the specific part which should be\nattributed to the monetary experiment in the Belgian recovery process. The quan-\ntitative monetary aspect seems to have had little or no direct influence on the volume\nof production. The increase in output was determined primarily by the real economic\nfactors which were fundamental to the recovery (availability of industrial equipment,\nfood and raw materials in reasonable supply, undamaged labour force). Actually,\nthe severe money cut may even have hampered production in some cases during the\nearliest phase of the contraction, although this can hardly have been of much im-\nportance. The main merit of the monetary operation as it concerns production and\neconomic recovery, is rather to be sought in an indirect and more general direction in\nproviding that feeling of confidence, order and stability which is indispensable to the\nrestoration of a sound and vigorous economy. In this sense, the monetary and fiscal\nprogramme undoubtedly played a major r\u00f3le in the process of recovery.\n\nBrussels, Belgium. A. V.

In\npractice, the presence of oligopolistic competition between the banks makes for a\ndegree of rigidity in the rate on deposits which may have a certain bearing on our\nproblem ; for it means that the rate on bank loans indeed varies within certain limits\nwithout the deposit rate being affected. Any considerable rise in the rate on bank\nloans, on the other hand, should be and usually is followed by a similar rise in the\ndeposit rate, so that this objection to the theory is only of limited importance.\n\nMr. Wilson has pointed out! that one consequence of the rigidity of the deposit\nrate makes for greater instability in the system. By shifting balances from deposit to\ncurrent account, money can be '' borrowed \" from the banks without any effect on\nthe rate of interest. Or, looking at it from another point of view, the quantity of money\ncan be increased by such a shift, even though the banks are unwilling themselves to\nexpand credit (using the phrase in the customary sense).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn opposition to the views of Mr. Wilson,? I would submit that the Keynesian\ntechnique is still very much the simpler and more elegant method of presenting as a\nwhole the theory of the rate of interest and of effective demand, even though it relies\nfor its simplicity perhaps too much on an assumption which is at best only an approx-\nimation to the truth.? This is not to deny that the loanable funds approach may be\nmore useful in the analysis of particular problems. Indeed, it will probably be found\nto be more capable of taking into account those refinements which will bring the\ntheory into closer relation with the institutional practice of the capital market. If the\ntwo techniques are to continue to be used in the analysis of related problems, however,\ntwo dangers should be guarded against. First, it is inadvisable to change techniques\nin the middle of a piece of analysis. I agree entirely with Mr. Tsiang when he criticises\nMr. Kaldor for using a '' flow \"\" approach in his analysis of the securities, but reverting\nto a \"' stock \" approach in his analysis of the short loan market. Such a procedure\nis very likely to lead to confusion. The second danger we have already discussed :\nit is that the simultaneous use of the two approaches may give rise to controversies\nwhich rest on misunderstanding rather than any fundamental difference of opinion.\nThis can be prevented only if the language of the one approach can be made more\nreadily translatable into that of the other. I hope the foregoing paragraphs may have\ncontributed something to this end.\n\nOxford. CHARLES KENNEDY.\n\n1 Op. cit., p. 288. Cf. also Kaldor, op. cit., p. 14n.\n\n?

For the\nsame reasons, the exemptions granted were small: 40,000 francs per family head,\nplus 40,000 francs for the wife, plus 10,000 or 15,000 francs per child. A further\nexemption up to 20,000 francs was allowed on savings deposits.\n\nSuch were the main features and phases of the reform technique as finally adopted.\nBy blocking initially all the old purchasing power and releasing immediately only a\nsmall fraction, the new money circulation was reduced to the level considered as\njustified in relation to the current volume of economic activity, the new exchange rate,\nand the planned price and wage level. By transforming a large fraction of the with-\ndrawn purchasing power into temporarily undisposable balances which would be\ngradually released as output and imports improved, a desirable elasticity in the money\nsupply was provided for. Finally, by first neutralising through blocking and forced\nloan, and then destroying through exceptional taxation, the fraction of old purchasing\npower considered as being ultimately in excess, the operation was completed and a\nnew monetary and financial equilibrium in accordance with the country's productive\ncapacity and its new price and exchange rate structure could be reached.

The various reports so far published by the C.P.B. all\nemphasise the necessity for the programme contained in the above five points by\ntrying to give them a numerical value.\n\nApart from the strict rationing of consumers' goods which is still enforced, and\napart from the rigorous price and wage regulations still prevailing, the following\nsuggestions have been made by the C.P.B.: (r) In order further to stimulate labour\nproductivity, an extended application of piece-rates on the one hand, and of modern\nlabour management methods on the other. (2) In order to stimulate industrialisation,\nfurther concessions in respect of the taxation of profits. Taxes on profits, which\namounted to about 70 to 80 per cent during the war, have been reduced to 40 per\ncent; important tax concessions are also already available for new investment. In\naddition to these alleviations further industrial freedom seems to be called for in order\nto stimulate the process of readjustment. Accordingly, the C.P.B. considers that its\nfuture task lies especially in the field of employment policy. It is believed that within\nthe framework of a good tax system and a well-advised employment policy (factors\nwhich partly overlap) ; and within the framework of existing international regula-\ntions (or those to be expected) the restoration of free enterprise would probably be\nall to the good. Experiments will probably be made in this respect through the indus-\ntrial organisations which have lately been proposed. The activities of these bodies\nmay either extend over rather a broad field or over only a restricted area, as seems\nmost convenient after a process of trial and error. The preparation of a modern em-\nployment policy along these lines has already been begun. Apart from the tax proposals\njust mentioned, further proposals are now being investigated which would tend to\nconcentrate the tax burden on boom years, and to create facilities for investment in\ndepression periods.

Although uncertainty\nwill still be present in a collectivist economy, there seems no reason to expect such\nserious changes in yield-expectations as to nullify the influence of the rate of interest.\nThe propensity to consume will almost certainly be higher in a more egalitarian society.\nWhat experience we have of socialism suggests that the planners will more often\ncomplain of shortage of investment resources than of investment opportunities.\n\nFirm believers in the '' stagnation thesis \" may still shake their heads gloomily\nand continue to insist on the likelihood that the lowest conceivable rate of interest will\nfail to stimulate sufficient investment to fill the vast. gap between full employment\nincome and consumption out of that income in a very rich country. As a hypothesis,\nlet this possibility be admitted. Does it mean that the rate of interest cannot be\nrelied upon to equate saving and investment at a full-employment level? Not at all.\nIt merely means that the rate of interest would have to be negative, expressing the\nfact that in such a society the postponement of consumption involves a cost, while\nthe facilitating of such postponement through capital expenditure confers a benefit\nand deserves reward. A carrying cost would then have to be attached to money, as\nwell as a charge imposed on lending. It is actually very difficult to imagine a society\nin which the marginal efficiency of capital is less than zero, a society in which, in\nKeynes' phrase,?

These intervals have one advantage over the intervals usually developed\nfor the cost-of-iving index from indexes of the Paasche and Laspeyres type. The\nlatter intervals provided only an upper limit for the index on one base and a lower\nlimit for the index on another base; they do not provide upper and lower bounds for\na given index simultaneously. On the other hand, our intervals give upper and lower\nbounds for the index on any base; and, furthermore, it is possible to calculate the\nprobability that the true value of the index will be covered by our interval in repeated\nsamples.\n\nIt should be pointed out, however, that our index is subject to the restrictions\nthat apply to all indexes based on the theory of consumer behaviour. In addition to\nthe fulfilment of the obvious restriction that the base period indifference map remains\ninvariant in other periods, there are moore subtle restrictions connected with the\ntransformation from individual to market data. What the economic theory of the\ntrue cost-of-living index really gives is a cost-of-living index for an individual. This\nmeans that to use our method of calculating the index on the basis of parameters of\nthe demand functions, we must have a knowledge of the properties of the demand\nequations of an individual. The demand equations that we customarily estimate\nstatistically are demand curves based on market data that refer to an entire group\nof individuals.\n\nThe following interpretation of our results, and, for that matter, the results of\nother methods of calculating the true cost of living, seems to be the most satisfactory\nsolution. Regard the indifference map as pertaining to an average individual, say, a\nfamily head earning an average wage in a typical urban area. This is specifically the\nsituation that is claimed for many official cost-of-living indexes. Estimate the demand\nequations from fer capita market data, and regard these statistical demand equations\nas pertaining to the average individual whose cost-of-living is being measured. This\nis the usual interpretation of fer capita demand equations. Then use the estimated\nparameters of the fer capita demand equation to calculate the cost-of-living index\nfor the average individual whose utility level is to remain constant.\n\nChicago. L. R.

But it is nevertheless probably worth mentioning.\n\nTwo separate approaches have been made to the general problem of determining\nthe changes in real income resulting from the introduction of rationing. One is to ask :\nAssuming his tastes to remain unaltered, by how much must a particular consumer's\nmoney income be changed when rationing is introduced to leave him just as well off\nas he was in the pre-rationing situation ? Methods of answering this question, under\nvarious simplitying assumptions, have been devised by Messrs. Kaldor! and Nicholson.?\nThe other is to ask: By how much would it have been necessary to have changed his\nincome in the pre-rationing situation to have made him just as well off as he is, in fact,\nunder rationing. This was the question Erwin Rothbarth tackled.? He introduced the\nidea of a virtual $rice system\u2014one under which the consumer would have exactly the\nsame pattern of consumption as he, in fact, has under rationing\u2014and showed that if\nsuch a virtual price system could be found ordinary price index number theory could\nbe applied to it to obtain the limits within which the required income-change must lie.\n\nIt hardly requires emphasis that the virtual price system is unlikely to be the same\nfor any two consumers; or, if we assume \u2014as is customary in this field\u2014that con-\nsumers have identical tastes, that it will differ for consumers with different money\nincomes (assuming point incomes to be the same for all). And the problem of finding\nthe virtual price system for consumers with a given money income is likely to be\ndifficult enough. Moreover, the very large changes in relative prices, compared with\neither the rationing or the pre-rationing situation, that the virtual price system would\nrepresent, seem at first sight to enhance this difficulty considerably. It is this latter\nsource of difficulty that the Slutsky equation helps us to avoid. We proceed as follows :\n\nUnder the virtual price system the pattern of consumption of our consumer is\nidentical with his actual consumption under rationing. Hence the equilibrium marginal\nutilities of the commodities must be unchanged. Denote the marginal utility of money\n\nunder the virtual price system by \u2014p, and the virtual prices by \u00ab; (/ \u2014 1,2, .. ., ^;\nnote that Z7; x; \u2014 I). Then the equilibrium marginal utilities are given by the\nequations :\n\nUi -- umi \u20140 (21,2,...,n*).\nUnder rationing these are given by the equations (2) of 2 (1), so we must have :\n\nuri \u2014 Mi XNpPid...dd Mf (21,2,...m) ........

And so the problem of determining the virtual prices resolves\nitself into that of estimating the ratio M/As.

(4) It is clear from the foregoing summary that if, in the usual way, we define\ncomplementarity with reference to the sign of the substitution term, we are spared\nsuch concepts as ''point complementarity \" and ' money independence.\" For, as\n\nstated at the end of 2 (3): .\n(0x4 [05* 2. \u2014\u2014MX D(Ug|D .(5j\u201412,...m)......

And so we can\nspeak of ; and j being complementary, independent or competing goods (at the\nprevailing set of point and money prices and incomes) quite unambiguously.\n\nIt is not a very difficult matter to show that, when rationing is effective, all the\nsubstitution terms obey the six rules commonly stipulated for them in the absence of\nrationing.? We shall not prove this here, but it is worth mentioning one of its implica-\ntions. Suppose tea and sugar to be effectively priced in terms of the kth group of\npoint prices, and suppose them to be the only goods \"' on\" these points. Then one\nof the six rules tells us that tea and sugar must be substitutes\u2014although, in the\nabsence of rationing, we might expect them to be complementary. This illustration\nsimply serves to emphasise that the introduction of rationing may change the relations\nexisting between goods.\n\n2. (5) The reader may easily verify that the matrix of income-effect terms is\nthe north-east partition of A\u2014t, after this submatrix has been premultiplied by the\nscalar (\u2014 xj) ; and he will see that there exists no simple relation between, say,\n\u2014 Xj (0x;[01*) and \u2014 x; (Ox;[0Is). And so, although we are fortunate enough to be\nspared such concepts as '\"' point complementarity,\" it will be clear to him that we\ncannot escape the following ones : goods which are inferior or non-inferior with respect\nto a particular point-group income, those which are inferior or non-inferior with\nrespect to another point-group income, and those which are inferior or non-inferior\nwith respect to money. An every-day example of this is not difficult to find. A large\nnumber of to-day's unrationed luxuries, for instance, which are surely non-inferior\nwith respect to money, are very probably inferior with respect to points. For a large\nnumber of these unrationed luxuries are bought precisely because rationing has blocked\nother channels of expenditure. When a point income is increased, therefore, we should\nexpect to find a reduction in the quantity purchased. If this is indeed the case, they\nare inferior goods with respect to that point income.\n\n3. Apart from its purely theoretical interest, the significance of the preceding\nanalysis lies in the fact that it\u2014or, more specifically, the Slutsky equation\u2014seems to\nprovide a possible line of approach to the very difficult, and not unimportant, problem\nof determining the magnitude of the changes in real income brought about by the\nintroduction of point-rationing. It should be emphasised at the outset that the solution\nsuggested in the lines that follow is not altogether satisfactory. It depends upon the\npossibility of estimating, or '' guessing intelligently \" (3r 4- 1) elasticities\u2014where \u00bb\nis the number of different sorts of points that are effective for a particular consumer ;\n\n1'This concludes our summary of those of Professor Samuelson's results we require.\n?

It may\nreasonably be objected, however, that in the purchase of rationed commodities the\ncareful distribution of expenditure through time, which\u2014in the absence of rationing\n\u2014probably helps to smooth out discontinuities quite appreciably, is limited by the\nperiod of currency of the points, and is the more difficult to achieve the shorter this\nperiod. While probably valid, it is unlikely that this objection is of much importance.\n\nFinally, provided that at least one commodity is not rationed, the consumer\nwill spend the full amount of his money income. (Saving may, if desired, be numbered\namong the commodities). But he need not spend fully his point incomes. He may,\nfor instance, be too poor to afford it; or he may be unwilling to consume the rationed\ncommodities under any circumstances whatsoever. When this is the case, one or\nmore inequalities will hold in (1), the corresponding Lagrange multipliers in (2) will\nbe zero, and the consumer will be unaffected by the corresponding groups of point\nprices. Professor Samuelson calls these prices ineffective) And when an equality\nsign holds in (1) he calls the corresponding group of point prices effective. It seems\nto me, however, that it is both more natural and more convenient to say that a\nparticular group of point prices is effective when, and only when, the corresponding\nLagrange multiplier is not zero\u2014i.e. when, and only when, it brings about a re-\nadjustment of the consumer's equilibrium pattern of expenditure in accordance with\nthe equations (2). It is easy to see that this is a stronger condition than Professor\nSamuelson's. For if a consumer is given a number of points just sufficient to maintain\nhis pre-rationing pattern of expenditure, the corresponding Lagrange multiplier will\nbe zero and yet the equality sign will hold in the relevant equation in (r)?.\n\n2.

The notes that follow are based on excerpts from a lengthier paper on the\ntheory of consumers' choice under rationing,! most of the results of which had\u2014I\nfind\u2014been anticipated by Paul A.

The matters primarily discussed are: (7) the interpretation of the\nSlutsky equation when point-rationing is in force, and (i?) the use of this equation in\nconnection with the measurement of changes in real income resulting from the intro-\nduction of point-rationing. First, however, we shall summarise some of Professor\nSamuelson's results. This is done in 2 (1) and 2 (3) below. 2 (2) contains some com-\nments on them.

When an inequality\nholds, the corresponding Lagrange multiplier is set equal to zero.\n\n2. (2) A few comments may be interjected at this stage. Firstly, Mr. K. W.\nRothschild has suggested? that a commodity may stand high in a consumer's\npreference-scale simply because it is rationed ; or, alternatively, that the bother\ninvolved in buying a rationed commodity may lower its position in the scale. Since\nneither point nor money prices appear among the independent variables in our utility\nfunction, we must consider a different utility function for each different set of point\nand money prices if we want to take cases such as these into account. Generally,\nhowever, little harm will be done by abstracting from these complications.\n\n1 Towards an.

The\ngain is entirely (indeed more than entirely) at the expense of the rest of the world,\nand is therefore immoral. But if this argument is to be taken seriously it points to\npositive subsidies on imports (or on exports), which will benefit the rest of the world\nby turning the terms of trade in favour of the rest of the world. When it comes to\nmorality there is no particular virtue in stopping at free trade.\n\nIt remains, of course, true that in an equilibrium position in which each country\ncharges the optimum tariff most, if not all, countries would be worse off than they\nwould be with universal free trade. In just the same way as monopolistic combination\nbetween competitive producers will benefit all of them, so can the countries of the\nworld benefit themselves by a restrictionist agreement to maintain free trade.? But\nthe success of a policy of universal free trade is seriously prejudiced by the belief that\ncountries which indulge in protection are acting contrary to their own economic\ninterests. It is because the /a2ssez-faire economist has so often believed that free trade\nis the natural state of affairs which, in the absence of stupidity and wickedness, would\nprevail that his attempts to establish it have not been more successful. As Mr. de\nScitovsky has said: '\" It is not enough to declare the desirability of free trade and\ntrust that enlightenment will bring it about : nor is it enough to create initial conditions\n\nfavourable to it: it must be imposed and enforced. . . .

The\ncontingent liabilities against which a certain minimum degree of liquidity in this\nsense provides a buffer are represented by possible net deficits arising from disequili-\nbrium in all the spontaneous items of the balance of payments, whether on current\nor capital account. On this definition, therefore, the \"' liquidity position \" of a country\nwould apparently not be affected by an increase in its short-term foreign indebtedness\nwhich would merely imply an increase in its contingent liabilities and therefore in its\nneed. for liquidity. This, however, would lead to absurd conclusions. For any given\nbalance of payments disequilibrium can be offset either by a reduction in the deficit\ncountry's foreign balances in the surplus country or by an increase in the surplus\ncountry's foreign balances in the deficit country. The former case would imply a\nreduction in the deficit country's holdings of international liquid assets, the latter\nmerely an increase in its foreign short-term indebtedness. Which types of trans-\naction takes place in any particular situation is of no economic importance. Yet\naccording to this definition, it would seem that the former would and the latter would\nnot affect the country's \"liquidity position.\"\n\nClearly, there is something wrong. The answer suggests itself if we consider once\nagain the case of a bank in a domestic economy. It is usual to define the \"' liquidity\nposition \"' of a bank, not in terms of the disposition of its assets only, but in terms of\ncertain va/ios of assets to liabilities, especially the ratios of cash to deposits and of\nliquid assets (or, conversely, advances) to deposits. It is clear that this is also the\nonly feasible approach to the concept of \"liquidity position \" in the international\ncontext.\n\nIf we wished to compare the relative \"' liquidity positions \" of two countries, it\nwould be meaningless to compare the absolute amounts of their holdings of inter-\nnational liquid reserves, even in conjunction with all other items on the credit side of\ntheir international capital accounts. Their respective holdings would be significant\nonly in relation to their respective need for liquidity, in other words, to their contingent\nbalance of payments deficits. A logically satisfactory definition of international\n*']iquidity position \" must, therefore, run somehow in terms of a country's holdings\nof actual and '' potential\" international liquid assets i4 relation to its actual and\ncontingent international liabilities in the form of temporary balance of payments\ndeficits.! In practice, if the concept is to be of use, it will be necessary, internationally\nas much as in domestic theory, to devise some rough and ready measure of liquidity\nposition, in the form of some significant ratio. This, however, is another question\nconsideration of which must be left to another occasion.\n\nThis interpretation must also be applied to Dr. Balogh's use of the term '' liquidity position \" when\nhe, in effect, defines short-term balance of payments equilibrium as a state in which the '' liquidity position\nof a country remains unchanged (see Note 5, p. 22). On that definition, any disequilibrium will show itself\neither in a change in the country's holdings of '* international liquid assets \" (though not necessarily in the\nnarrow sense of official gold and foreign exchange reserves) ov in a change in its foreign short-term debt.\nFor practical purposes, it can be assumed that the effect on the country's \"liquidity position \" will be\nequal in either case ; although, strictly speaking, this will hold only if the ratio between assets and liabilities\nwhich is selected as the most appropriate measure of a country's liquidity position is 1 : 1.\n\nSydney.

While I do not\nwish to defend my article in toto, as I should now present the point somewhat\ndifferently, I am also not willing to accept the whole of his criticism. This falls into\nthree parts: he argues that I have misunderstood and misrepresented a section of\n\" 'The Theory of Monopolistic Competition\" ; that my own suggested technique is\nbased upon error; and that the problem created for economic analysis by the fact\nthat advertisement creates interdependence between cost conditions and demand\nconditions cannot be eliminated by devising a technique of subtraction.\n\nOn the first of these points I am prepared to let the case rest; both texts are\navailable, and where difference arises it is only reasonable that Professor Chamberlin's\ninterpretation of his own works should be accepted. On the third, I am in complete\naccord, and only the clumsiness of my presentation could have conveyed a different\nimpression, particularly, as Professor Chamberlin notes, in view of my subsequent\nwork in the same field. I therefore devote the greater part of this note to developing\nthis more fruitful theme. The second I cannot accept. In a note in the Qwarterly\nJournal of Economics for May, 1935, \" Discontinuous Demand Curves and Mono-\npolistic Competition,\" quoted in the bibliography to the fifth edition of '' Monopolistic\nCompetition\", I present the full diagram of which only a part appears in my REvIEW\narticle, and from it the argument is self-evident. Or it can be proved in the following\nmanner, for which I am indebted to Dr. E. G. Phillips of this University.\n\nIf & is the total expenditure on advertising, ? the price, and x the quantity\ndemanded for any combination of ? and &, then the height of the curve PQ on my\ndiagram is y \u2014 $ \u2014 \" when $ is given.\n\nIf k is given, this equation gives a family of curves, each for a value of ?$. The\nenvelope of the family is given by:\n\nie., \u2014rictxz . ap^ when\n\nmeans the derivative when x is kept constant in the fundamental relation between\nx, k and $.

It thus denotes, for any given quantity of sales, the point of maximum revenue.\n\nI should not now claim that the conditions of full equilibrium were to be derived\nfrom my diagram. My object in presenting it was not to remove advertising costs and\nthe results of advertisements from the picture, but indeed to emphasise the extent\nto which the entrepreneur in an imperfect market must always give simultaneous\n\n40\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:20:02 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

If some coupons are unused in\nthe absence of legal sale, then the right to sell them means that coupon prices must be\nraised. Even in this case the losers could be compensated so that no consumer was\nworse off and some people were better off than before.! The problems revealed by\nreports of people who could not afford to use their clothing coupons and who have\nbeen prosecuted for selling them, suggest strongly that the present position is failing\nto maintain the goal of greater equality. But it soon becomes apparent that legalised\nsale of coupons would not necessarily aid in the achievement of either of the purposes\nit has in view.\n\nIn terms of equality, it is not possible to say of a given change whether it increases\nor decreases equality in cases where it affects different income ranges in different\nways; this is the case here. The poor gain relative to the middle group, so that\nequality in this range is increased, but the rich also gain relatively to the middle group,\nso that here equality is reduced. There is no meaning to be given to the question as\nto whether, on balance, there is greater or less equality. There is one policy available\nwhich would be free from this objection and which would reduce the Black Market\nsupply of coupons. If the government were to purchase from their owners surplus\ncoupons it would raise the satisfaction obtainable by the poorest without increasing\nthat of the rich. At the same time it would reduce the tendency to use up coupons\nsimply because they are available. Finally, it would ensure that for the poor the\nrates of substitution between products.did not diverge greatly from the ratio of their\nmarginal costs.\n\nBut even this one-way convertibility of coupons into money is subject to con-\nsiderable disadvantages. The first is the administrative difficulty and the encourage-\nment of fraud. The experiment of making bread units convertible into points showed\nthe danger of making it possible to convert a surplus of one form of coupon into some\nother form ; those who were in a position to cheat the rationing system for one product\nwere enabled to extend their advantage to other commodities. Besides this, such a\nsystem would run counter to the paternalist element in rationing ; it would weaken\nthe incentive which rationing provides to consume what is good for us rather than\nwhat we happen to prefer. To many this would seem a major reason for refusing to\nredeem any ration coupons in money.\n\nThese considerations are presented to show that even an adequate theory of\nrationing cannot provide complete answers to policy questions. Once the state takes\non the task of restricting consumer demand, it cannot take consumers' preferences\nas the sole relevant data and the problems are complicated by administrative problems\nand by specific social ends which are not those of the individual consumer.\n\nManchester.

                    "NATIONAL CENTRAL BANKING THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY 75\n\nThe main result of such policies is, therefore, to propagate to the world at large\nany cyclical disturbance arising in a major economic area. Balance of payments\ndeficits may be corrected in the end, but mostly as the result of a general decline in\nincome and economic activity. Furthermore, the accompanying price changes will\nleave in their wake a basically unbalanced structure of international prices when the\ncyclical depression subsides and more normal conditions are restored.\n\nWhenever balance of payments disequilibria are due, not to international price\ndisparities, but to accidental factors or to cyclical fluctuations in foreign income and\ndemand, compensatory policies should be followed to the fullest possible extent. This\nrequires a high level of international reserves, especially in raw material and food\nproducing countries, and the willingness to spend these reserves liberally in times of\ncrisis and to accumulate them during prosperous years. When reserves are insufficient,\nforeign or international assistance\u2014such as contemplated under the International\nMonetary Fund\u2014would be necessary. Failing this, exchange control should be used\nas a third line of defense, in order to continue compensatory policies and avoid the\ngreater evils inseparable from deflation or currency devaluation. The disadvantage of\nthe latter policies, as compared to exchange control, is that their corrective effect on\nthe balance of payments is likely to depend on an income contraction several times the\nsize of the international deficit to be plugged.\n\nExchange control, however, should be restricted to periods of temporary exchange\ndifficulties, and should not be used to elude readjustments to fundamental disequilibria.\nEven more important, the system of controls to be adopted should preserve the multi-\nlateralism and flexibility of international trade. It should not lend itself to adminis-\ntrative arbitrariness, rigid and uneconomic allocation of exchange, discrimination and\nbilateralism. These historical evils associated with exchange control as used in the\ninter-war period, should not lead to a blind and dogmatic rejection of exchange control\nas such, but to concrete efforts to dissociate it from such abuses, and make it a fit\ninstrument for the protection of the economy and the currency against temporary\npressures on the exchange.\n\nWashington.

                    "74 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nselective policies designed to plug the main leaks in the balance of payments, with a\nminimum impact on basic economic activities and on production and living costs.\n\nDevaluation is also of limited value as a remedy for pervasive maladjustments,\nwhether cyclical or fundamental, affecting simultaneously a large number of countries.\nAgricultural over-production, for instance, may disrupt at the same time the inter-\nnational balance of all the competing countries whose exports are largely concentrated\non the overproduced commodities. Concerted international action designed toward\nreadjustment would be preferable, in this case, to cut-throat competition through\nlower prices or currency devaluation. The lack of balance between supply and demand\nshould be gauged, moreover, not with relation to abnormally low levels of demand\nassociated with a world depression, but in terms of normal requirements. The ever-\nnormal granary concept should be extended beyond national borders through inter-\nnational commodity agreements. It is true that such agreements may lead to opposite\nabuses and to artificial efforts permanently to maintain prices at higher than com-\npetitive levels. The dilemma, however, is an inescapable one. Unfettered competition\nin a market dominated by a few large sellers cannot ensure competitive prices. It may\nvery often lead either to cut-throat underselling, or to monopolistic pricing through\nformal or informal cartel agreements, price leadership, etc. This is true at the inter-\nnational level as well as at the national one. International commodity agreements\nshould be so organised as to prevent domination of policies by vested interests of the\nproducers or of their governments. Broad representation of consuming countries,\ntogether with the adoption of some automatic or semi-automatic indicators, may help\nto avoid'major errors. In the long run, however, policy decisions can never be dis-\nSociated from responsibility. The refusal to take action is no solution in the face of the\nbreakdown, or unavailability, of the impersonal, competitive mechanisms which, in\nclassical theory, justified non-interference with market forces.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe classical theory of international balance and of readjustments to balance of\npayments disequilibria centres around disparities in a single country's price and cost\nlevels with relation to the rest of the world. Under such conditions, domestic deflation\n\u2014if costs are not too rigid\u2014or currency devaluation may be able to bring about\nreadjustment, through the restoration of the country's competitive position in world\nmarkets.\n\nThis doctrine was mistakenly extended, especially by the '' rules of the game \"\"\nadherents, to world-wide cyclical disequilibria, originating in one, or a few, highly\ndeveloped and industrialised countries. Efforts by other countries to correct resulting\nbalance of payments deficits, either through price deflation or exchange devaluation,\nare then thwarted because such action by any one country or group of countries\naggravates the difficulties in their supply and export markets, as well as in competing\ncountries, and leads to similar, and mutually self-defeating, measures of defense.\nPrice deflation and devaluation spread from country to country without increasing\nexport receipts, especially if world demand for a nation's exports is relatively inelastic.\nThe situation presents a strong analogy with that of oligopoly, where each effort by\none seller to cut into the competitors' markets is thwarted by the competitors' price\nretaliation. Thus, the actual elasticity of demand for one country's exports is merged\nwith the much lower world's elasticity of demand for those products. Sales can be\nexpanded only in so far as lower prices stimulate consumption, and not through inroads\ninto the competitors' sales.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:22:47 UTC\nAI use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "NATIONAL CENTRAL BANKING THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY 73\n\nto 13.7 billions at the end of 1933.! The impact of the disequilibrium was thus felt,\nnot in a deficit in the balance of payments, but in a drastic decline in economic activity\nand incomes, especially in the so-called '' non-sheltered \" industries, in competition\nwith foreign firms in the national or international markets.?\n\nIt has recently been argued that a country subject to such pressures should attempt\nto protect itself through domestic compensatory policies, but should not be allowed\nto devalue its currency unless, and until, these policies have led to an actual deficit\nin the balance of international payments.? This attitude is open to serious objections.\nFirst of all, it would lead to unnecessary disruptions, since labour and other economic\nfactors would have to be uprooted and transferred into temporary activities, such as\npublic works, for instance, and then returned to their normal field of employment,\nwhen currency devaluation makes it again profitable and economic. Secondly, the\nScope of compensatory action may be relatively limited, especially in undeveloped\ncountries heavily dependent on the exportation of primary products. For such\ncountries, currency devaluation will often be the most direct, or even the only effective,\nway of maintaining domestic levels of income.\n\nWhat is true, however, is that devaluation should not be regarded as a proper\nand legitimate remedy for any domestic depression, whatever its origin ; but neither\nshould it be regarded as legitimate and desirable merely because a country is experienc-\ning balance of payments difficulties. The Belgian case showed clear evidence that\nexternal pressures resulting from the undervaluation of the pound with respect to the\nfranc, were at the root of a severe domestic depression, but this evidence did not\nemerge from balance of payments data. On the other hand, balance of payments\ndeficits are often the result of cyclical, rather than fundamental disequilibria, and\ndevaluation, in that case, would usually be a most undesirable remedy, from a national\nas well as from an international viewpoint.\n\nFinally, not every fundamental disequilibrium should be ascribed to, or corrected\nby, currency devaluation. For instance, the difficulties of the nitrate industry in\nChile, following the development of synthetic nitrates, were of a fundamental character\nand have had a deep impact on the international balance of the country. Devaluation,\neven though probably unavoidable under the circumstances, could not be expected to\nrighten by itself the Chilean economy. Domestic monetary and fiscal policies, changes\nin the tariff structure, diversification of production and modernisation of industrial\nand agricultural techniques, possibly with foreign help, may prove better remedies\nthan, or the indispensable complement of, currency readjustments. A specially\ninteresting case is the one of colonial economies in which income expansion may lead\nrapidly and directly to balance of payments disequilibria, because of its effects on\nluxury imports, tourist expenditure abroad, capital exports and the like, rather than\nbecause of any upward pressure on domestic wage and cost levels. Devaluation is a\nvery blunt and indiscriminate instrument and may often be a less efficient tool than\n\n! A decline to 12.5 took place in the latter part of 1934, but is to be ascribed primarily to capital flight,\nprompted by the approaching devaluation of the currency.\n\n3 See Robert Triffin, '' La th\u00e9orie de la sur\u00e9valuation mon\u00e9taire et la d\u00e9valuation belge,\" Bulletin de\nl'Institut de Recherches Economiques, Louvain, Belgium, November, 1937, pp. 19-52.\n\n* See Gottfried Haberler, ' Currency Depreciation and the International Monetary Fund,\" Review\nof Economic Statistics, Vol. XXVI (November, 1944), pp. 178-81. A draft of the present paper was sub-\nmitted to Professor Haberler, who commented as follows on this point, in his reply : '* As to your discussion\nof what is meant by fundamental disequilibrium, I would make this concession : If it could be shown that\nincome effects in fact operate so fast that depreciation will not lead to an appreciable balance of payments\nsurplus, I would not object to it. I still believe, however, that that is a rather fanciful case. I would agree,\nhowever, that depreciation on the part of a small country need not be ruled out even if it led to a temporary\ninflow of gold, especially if that inflow was only to compensate for an outflow which has taken place some\ntime in the past. I think I could handle all those cases with appropriate and reasonable interpretations of\nthe balance of payments criterion.\"\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:22:47 UTC\nAI use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The country's indebtedness would then grow without lasting\nbenefit to it, and the resources of the Fund would be wasted in a manner directly\ncontrary to the objectives of the institution.! The Fund, however, can protect itself\nagainst such abuses, not only through the ceilings placed on each country's presumptive\nborrowing rights, but also through the application of Article V, Section 5 of the Fund's\nCharter.\n\nThe diagnosis of a fundamental disequilibrium, however, is not an easy task. A\nmere deficit in a country's balance of payments is, of course, no evidence of an excessive\nand untenable level of domestic, as compared with international prices. Contrary to\nthe '' rules of the game \" concept, it should not, therefore, be taken as a signal for\ndeflationary policies. Compensatory action should be preferred, and supported by the\nFund, whenever the deficit can be ascribed to accidental causes, such as a crop failure,\nor to a cyclical world depression. Similarly, a favourable balance of payments, not\nassociated with international cost and price disparities, should not be viewed as\nrequiring expansionary policies disruptive of domestic stability and conducive to\ninflationary price rises.\n\nBefore assuming the existence of a durable disqeuilibiurm calling for corrective\nmeasures, additional evidence should be studied and weighed. Any fundamental\ndisequilibrium should manifest itself, not only in a deficit in the balance of payments,\nbut also in monetary and banking statistics, price and production data, etc. Such\nseries, as well as the performance of the balance of payments, should be compared\nwith the experience of other countries, and especially of those of similar economic\nStructure, but subject to different domestic influences and policies. Only in this\nmanner can a proper diagnosis be arrived at, and an adequate policy determined.\n\nWhere clear evidence is lacking, empirical decisions are unavoidable. The deficit\ncountry would probably be given the benefit of the doubt, and allowed to pursue, for\na time, compensatory policies with the help of the Fund and, possibly, under the\nadditional protection of exchange control when needed. This interpretation would\nlater be confirmed by events if the deficit does in fact disappear within a normal period\nof time. It would have to be reversed, however, and corrective policies would have to\nbe applied, if the deficits continue, piling up the country's indebtedness to the Fund,\nor if the need for exchange control persists, with sustained and substantial premiums\non the auction and free exchange markets.\n\nJust as a mere balance of payments deficit is no evidence of a fundamental dis-\nequilibrium, the absence of such a deficit is no conclusive proof of a fundamental\nequilibrium in a country's international position. In the absence of compensatory\naction by the monetary authorities, a fundamental disequilibrium may fail to be\nreflected in any balance of payments deficit, owing to the prompt transmission of\nexternal deflationary pressures to domestic prices and incomes. One of the clearest\ncases, in recent years, of a fundamental disequilibrium due to currency overvaluation\nis the experience of Belgium following the devaluation of the British pound. And yet,\nboth the balance of trade and the balance of payments improved, rather than deteriora-\nted, during most of the overvaluation period. The average import surplus fell from\n4.3 billion francs a year in 1929-30 to o.8 billion in 1932-34, and the international\nreserves of the central bank rose from 12.3 billions on the eve of the British devaluation\n\n3 Article I (iv) states as one of the purposes of the Fund '' to shorten the duration and lessen the degree\nof disequilibrium in the international balances of payments of members.\"\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:22:47 UTC\nAI use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

It would indeed, be absurd to\nenforce general restrictions against all imports because of the unavailability of one,\nor a few, currencies only,! and the scarce currency clauses of the Fund Charter? accept,\nin such a case, an exception to the general principle of non-discrimination and\nmultilateralism.\n\nThe abuses and discriminations resulting from the blocking of some currencies\ncannot be blamed on the country subject to, and suffering from, the blocking.\nResponsibility for the maintenance of interconvertibility and multilateralism properly\nbelongs only to the International Monetary Fund and to the blocking countries\nthemselves.\n\nThe Fund will also want to guard against the permanency of exchange restrictions\nbeyond the period in which they are required by the balance of payments situation.\nThe system outlined above solves this difficulty without making necessary any further\naction by the Fund. Indeed, the control system is self-liquidating, since the auction\nand free market premiums would automatically decrease and vanish, as the exchange\nsituation improves. If such improvement does not take place within a reasonable\nperiod, the disequilibrium of the balance of payments should be recognised as funda-\nmental, rather than temporary, and corrective measures, rather than exchange control,\nshould be regarded as the proper remedy to adopt. The Fund might enforce this\nviewpoint by reviewing periodically, let us say once a year, the authorisation which\nit grants to resort to exchange control schemes.\n\nThe above proposals are not merely theoretical.

The Guatemalan law, especially, indicates, in greater\ndetail, the precise mechanism in which the suggestions made here can be embodied\nin a practical manner. Both legislations, however, express only the limitations to\nwhich these countries subjected their freedom of action on their own initiative. Further\nsafeguards might, of course, be desirable on an international plane, through the\nadministration of the Fund's own powers with respect to exchange control.\n\nB. FUNDAMENTAL READJUSTMENTS\n\nThe main emphasis of this paper has been on the inappropriateness of traditional\nreadjustment policies as a remedy for temporary or cyclical disequilibria. The opposite\ndanger, ie. the failure to adopt readjustment policies in the case of fundamental\ndisequilibria\u2014also faces the Fund, but has been so widely discussed already that a\nfew comments will suffice here.\n\nIn the case of a persisting disequilibrium in one country's economy, due to inflated\nprice or income levels, corrective measures should be applied. Neither the use of the\ncountry's reserves, nor borrowings from abroad, nor exchange control bring to bear\nany remedial influence on the disequilibrium.

It presents, on the other hand, the tremendous advantage of eliminating,\nor restricting considerably, the opportunity for favouritism or discrimination on the\npart of the exchange authorities.\n\nThe supervision of exchange control by the International Monetary Fund will not\nbe limited to the avoidance of discriminatory administration of the controls. The\nFund will also want to judge whether exchange control as such is justified in the\nconcrete circumstances under which a member country requests permission to implant\nit.. As the Fund gets under operation, it will have to develop certain general and\nobjective criteria for granting, or denying, such requests, in order to avoid arbitrary,\ndiscriminatory or merely haphazard decisions, which would soon breed ill-will among\nthe members and endanger their loyalty to the institution. The problem is most acute\nfor the smaller countries, whose vote in the Fund's councils will necessarily have\nlittle weight in reaching a decision. These countries should be guaranteed an impartial\ntreatment based on as objective rules and principles of policy as can be practically\ndevised by the Fund.\n\nOne of the first criteria to be taken into consideration would obviously be the\nlevel of international reserves of the country requesting the authorisation for the\nimplantation of exchange restrictions. The appraisal of the adequacy or inadequacy\nof these reserves, from the point of view of balance of payments needs, obviously\ncannot be gauged with reference to the traditional reserve ratios, relating gold and\nforeign exchange holdings to note circulation or sight obligations. What is here\nrelevant is the ability of the country to finance from its own reserves foreseeable\ndeficits in its international transactions. From this point of view, reserves should first\nbe expressed as a percentage of the normal requirements for payments abroad, i.e. of\ntotal annual sales of exchange by the banks. A reserve ratio of 30 per cent, for instance,\nwould mean that the central bank could maintain a free and stable exchange market\nfor one year in the face of a 30 per cent deficit in the balance of payments, or for two\nyears, in the case of a 15 per cent deficit. The level of reserves, calculated in this way,\nwould indicate the breathing spell which the monetary authorities will have, while\nwaiting for an automatic improvement in the balance of payments, in cases of tem-\nporary disequilibria, or for the readjusting effect of any corrective policy which they\nthink advisable to adopt when the deficit is deemed to be of a persistent or fundamental\nnature. If the length of such breathing spell is too short, the country might be given\nauthorisation for direct restrictions over exchange sales.\n\nWhether a 15, a 30 or a 50 per cent reserve is deemed sufficiently critical for the\nintroduction of exchange control would, of course, depend upon the previous balance\nof payments experience of the country in question. A country subject to sudden and\nviolent fluctuations in its export trade should be recognised a higher critical reserve\nlevel than a country with more stable sources of foreign exchange receipts. Maximum\nvariations in exports, or exchange receipts, in the past might serve as an objective\nindication in helping to determine the critical reserve level.\n\nA weaker, but still possibly valid, claim for measures of control might be made\nwhen gold and foreign exchange reserves experience a violent and sufficiently sustained\ndecline, even though they still remain, for the time being, above the critical level\nagreed upon between the Fund and the member country. The argument, in this case,\nwould be based, as in the Chapultepec discussions, upon the desirability of limiting\nthe expenditure of reserves for luxury imports, capital flight, etc. Milder controls\nwill suffice in this case, while stronger controls might prove unavoidable if the intro-\nduction of the controls must wait until the critical level has been reached.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:22:47 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Indeed, as long as currency inter-convertibility is maintained, the central\nbank would have no justifiable incentive to sell one currency in preference to another.!\n\nObjection is likely to be raised, however, to the differential rates implied in the\nfunctioning of the auction and free exchange markets. This might be interpreted as a\n** multiple currency \" practice, specifically outlawed by the Fund Articles of Agree-\nment.?\n\nIt should be noted, first of all, that provision is also made, in the Fund Agreement\nfor the approval of such practices by the Fund (VIII, 3). Indeed, the Fund's approval\nis necessary, not only for this case, but for the more general one of any system of\ncontrols on current transactions (except as applied to scarce currencies, or under the\ntransitional arrangements of Article XIV).\n\nMore than that, however, the exact meaning of the '' multiple currency \" stricture\nis open to question. First of all, the system here proposed does not constitute a multiple\ncurrency practice, if the term is interpreted to imply the setting up of different exchange\npremiums as between currencies. As pointed out above, no distinction is allowed as\nbetween currencies, but only as between different categories of transactions, irrespec-\ntive of the currencies involved.\n\nSecondly, the auction and free market premia are completely flexible, and do not\n\u2014as would rigid multiple rates\u2014introduce any effective restriction on exchange\ntransactions, independent from, and additional to, the basic and inevitable restriction\nresulting from the allocation of a limited quota of exchange among various claimants.\nSince the monetary authorities are forced, under the proposed system, to sel] fully\nthat quota for whatever rate the auction brings about, the rate itself does not constitute,\nin any way, an independent or additional restriction. Foreign exports to the country\nare limited only by the application of the quota, and in no way influenced by the fact\nthat the exchange rate diverges from normal. The only significant effect is a purely\ndomestic, and entirely desirable one, 7.e. the recapture by the monetary authorities\nof the unjustified windfall profits that would otherwise accrue to importers. It should\nbe kept in mind that any scarcity of exchange which reduces imports below the normal\ndemand at the official exchange rates, tends to drive up domestic prices, no matter the\nexchange rate charged to the importers to which exchange is allocated. In the absence\nof price control and rationing, the importers will be led to charge what the traffic will\nbear, or will distribute their short supplies in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\nWhile price control and rationing might reasonably be expected for essential goods of\nmass consumption, they will not, in most countries, be normally extended, and\neffectively enforced, to sales of luxuries and semi-luxuries. Under the auction system,\nthe importers would be forced to compete with one another for the exchange offered\nfor sale. Such competition would drive the rate to, but not beyond, the point at which\ntheir profits will again be close to competitive levels, under competitive pricing\nconditions. Special problems may, of course, arise in the case of collusion or mono-\npolistic practices by the sellers, but these would also arise under a system of adminis-\ntrative allocation, and can be taken care of, as far as is administratively and politically\nfeasible, without modifying the basic mechanism of control suggested above.\n\nIt might be observed, in passing, that any system of tariff duties is equivalent to\nvery real and rigid multiple currency practices. The very fact that objections to\ntariffs are so much milder than the objections to multiple exchange rates again suggests\nthat we often tend to fight words rather than realities. Looking at the problem without\ndogmatic preconceptions, it will be realised that the allocation of scarce exchange\nthrough a free auction system does not add any further restrictive element, beyond\n\n!

Such a procedure,\nhowever, is by no means inevitable. A promising alternative would be to enforce\nexchange restrictions through flexible, and impersonal, market forces, leaving the\nimporters free to buy whatever they please wherever they please (presumably from the\ncheapest source of supply), subject only to such automatic restrictions as would norm-\nally result from the free interplay of supply and demand. More concretely, what is\nhere suggested is that all the exchange currently available to the monetary authorities\nbe offered for sale in the following manner.\n\nExchange would be freely obtainable, without previous permit or restrictions of\nany sort, at the normal exchange rates, for payment of all essential and urgent imports\nor services and of contractual obligations, dividends or reasonable amortisation on\napproved foreign investments. The monetary authorities would undertake to sell the\nbalance of all their current exchange receipts for payment of deferrable or unessential\nimports and services, again without quantitative restrictions or imports permit, but\nthrough the functioning of one, or a few, auction markets. In other words, the limited\nsupply would be distributed among the buyers, not by administrative decision, but\nas a result of an impersonal pricing mechanism.\n\nIn order to provide the central bank with sufficient exchange to assure the\nfunctioning of these two markets\u2014the normal, and the auction, markets\u2014all exchange\nproceeds from exports or other easily controllable sources would have to be sold, at\nthe normal exchange rates, to the monetary authorities. On the other hand, exchange\nproceeds from unimportant or practically uncontrollable transactions, could be freely\nsold and bought in a free exchange market. This would avoid giving a premium to\nillegal evasion, where evasion cannot be effectively checked, and would, at the same\ntime, provide an escape valve for the control system. Capital exports, beyond those\nwhich have access to the official market, could be channelled here without harmful\nrepercussions on the rates applying to more essential exchange requirements. The\nhigher rates prevailing on the free market in times of crisis would, moreover, tend to\ndiscourage capital exports and encourage capital imports.\n\nThe advantages of such a plan are obvious. It would eliminate at the root\narbitrary and discriminatory allocation of exchange, drastically simplify the adminis-\ntrative machinery, red tape and delays, and bar most of the possibilities for graft or\nfavouritism in the distribution of exchange permits. From the international point of\nview, the main objection raised, quite properly, against the traditional forms of\nexchange control would also disappear. Nothing in the above system would tend to\ndestroy, or even weaken, a multilateral system of world trade. No distinction need be\nallowed between the various currencies bid for on any auction market and, on the\ncontrary, all auction premiums should be uniform, in percentage terms, for any one\ncategory of transactions, no matter what foreign currency is involved. The exact\ncurrency requested need not even be specified until the bidding is over and the exchange\n\n1 International acceptance of a '' previous representative period \" criterion as an objective guide for\nallocation might help to some extent, but would be of limited value. First of all, it could not serve as a\npattern for commodity allocation, since any rationing of scarce exchange should change the '' representa-\ntive\" pattern of imports in favour of more essential, and against less essential, imports. Secondly, the\n*' previous representative period \" criterion tends to freeze the channels of trade in a very arbitrary and\nuneconomic manner. The resulting distortion and unreality will be the more marked as one must go further\nand further back into the past to discover a '' representative \" period. Structural changes brought about\nby the war make it extremely difficult to accept as representative not only war-time, but even pre-war\npatterns.

The\ngeneral tenor of the Chapultepec discussions on the desirability of husbanding, for\nthe purpose of economic development, reserves acquired in war-time would lead to\nthe same conclusion.\n\nThe creation of the International Monetary Fund, therefore, should not be inter-\npreted as definitely removing, even after the expiration of a transitory period, all\njustification for, and possibility of, exchange control measures by member countries.\nThe Fund will greatly reduce the need for exchange control, and set up safeguards\nagainst unnecessary or discriminatory restrictions. It will not, and should not, prohibit\nblindly and flatly all uses of legitimate controls as an instrument of monetary policy,\nwhen temporary exchange shortages make them the only alternative to drastic defla-\ntionary policies or currency devaluation. As indicated above, price or currency\nadjustments may often be wholly inadequate to correct balance of payments deficits\n\u2014especially in the case of agricultural or raw material producing countries, faced with\nan inelastic demand for their exports\u2014except through the resulting contraction of\nnational income and effective import demand. Moreover, since only a fraction of total\nincome is spent abroad, the balancing of foreign transactions will normally call for a\ndecline in the income level several times greater than the deficit to be resorbed.? This\nis clearly undesirable on national grounds and does not, in any way, lessen the un-\nfavourable impact of import contraction on world trade. On the contrary, it aggravates\nthe difficulties of competing exporting countries. Finally, it corrects a temporary\ndisequilibrium at the cost of creating a fundamental one, in the other direction, once\nthe transient factors of disturbance have disappeared. Under such circumstances,\ntemporary and selective controls on expenditures abroad are preferable by far to\nindiscriminate, and multiple, income adjustments.\n\nThe efforts of the International Monetary Fund should thus be directed, not\ntoward the simple abolition of all exchange controls, but toward the elimination of\nthe abuses which have so often characterised them in the past.\n\nThe most patent and most crucial defect of exchange control lies in the discrimina-\ntory policies, or practices, to which it lends itself.

Gold coin does not, in practice, circulate to-day as\nmoney, and bank notes have become the ultimate legal tender for domestic payment.\nThe only purpose of a gold or foreign exchange reserve is to provide available resources\nto meet, without undue pressure on the currency, a deficit in the balance of payments.\nAll member countries should be induced to accept this viewpoint, and to liberate their\nreserves for effective use in case of need.\n\nThe second alternative is the recourse to foreign borrowings from other sources\nthan the Fund itself. This would be especially valuable to meet specific rehabilitation\nor developmental expenditures, the financing of which is outside the scope of the Fund,\nand can be secured through private investments or through the help of such institutions\nas the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and Export-Import\nBank, etc.\n\nThe third alternative is the husbanding of reserves for the most urgent needs,\nthrough some priority system of exchange distribution. The very name of '' exchange\ncontrol\" unfortunately suffices to raise such emotional reactions with many people\nas to prevent any serious discussion of the subject. The history of exchange control\nin the last two decades is such as to justify fully the condemnation of most exchange\ncontrol systems used in the past. It does not, however, justify a blind excommunication\nof exchange control as such, irrespective of its concrete forms and of the circumstances\nleading to their adoption. Exchange control was, in some cases, wilfully resorted to as\na weapon of economic blackmail and aggression. In other cases, however, it was only\na measure of despair, reluctantly accepted as a lesser evil under the pressure of\nnecessity. The statesmen who introduced exchange control in so many countries were\nnot all malevolent blackguards or stupid fools. Their motives should be understood,\nand every effort should be bent to prevent abuses, or unnecessary restrictions, without\nsacrificing the real purposes which non-discriminatory controls can justifiably serve.\nConstructive criticism may succeed where dogmatic and purely negative opposition\nhas failed, and would probably remain as sterile in the future as it has proved in the\npast.\n\nSelf-denial through exchange restrictions may be preferred, both by a member\ncountry and by the Fund, to excessive borrowings, internal deflation or exchange\ndepreciation. Provision is already made for some such cases in the Fund agreement\nitself. First of all, the Fund gives the members full freedom '' to exercise such controls\nas are necessary to regulate international capital movements \" not connected with\npayments for current transactions or settlement of commitments.? Members are even\nprohibited, in principle, from making net use of the Fund's resources '' to meet a large\nand sustained outflow of capital, and the Fund may request a member to exercise\ncontrols to prevent such use of the resources of the Fund. If, after receiving such a\nrequest, a member fails to exercise appropriate controls, the Fund may declare the\nmember ineligible to use the resources of the Fund.''?\n\nSecondly, the demands made upon the Fund for a member's currency may exceed\nthe Fund's ability to supply it. In that case, the Fund may ultimately be forced to\ndeclare such currency scarce and to ration its supply among the members applying\nfor it. Such a declaration '\" shall operate as an authorisation to any member, after\nconsultation with the Fund, temporarily to impose limitations on the freedom of\nexchange operations in the scarce currency.'4\n\n!'The '' war chest \" argument falls within the scope of this definition, although recent procedures of\nforeign funds controls weaken greatly the value of gold for purchases in enemy, or even neutral, countries.\n\n?

It is certain that the use of an analytic\ntool of such power will reveal possibilities of combinations and arrangements which\nhave either not been observed in the economic world, or the nature of which has been\ninsufficiently understood; and thus give deeper insight into the workings of real\nmarkets.\n\nOne other aspect of the ''indeterminateness \" of the solutions offered by this\nnew theory remains to be mentioned. In our introduction, we discussed problems like\nthe duopoly problem (page 2), in which no solution can be given by the traditional\ntheory which does not depend on the use of an arbitrary element. In the case of the\nduopoly problem the reaction function of one of the rivals must be specified if the\nproblem is to be solved. This specification may be relieved of '' arbitrariness \"' if the\nstudy of actual markets can lead to an analysis of the forces determining the nature\nof this reaction function. Thus, it may be that a consideration of the relative sizes,\nfinancial structures, and cost conditions of two firms will provide enough information\nto enable the economist to specify the reaction function of one of the rivals to moves\nof the other. The question then arises, whether, by incorporating these same '' facts \"\ninto a game-theoretical description of the market, or constructing with their aid a\nnew game based on the '' solution \" of the previous game which did not use them,\nanother '' solution \" can be reached which is free of indeterminacy. If this in fact can\nbe done, then it seems justifiable to conclude that this new method of analysis does not\nrepresent the revolution in economic theory which its authors (and Prof. Marschak)\nthink it does. Rather, we would then have an isomorphism between this theory and\nmore familiar analytical techniques, analagous to the isomorphism between analysis\nand geometry. It would make little sense to argue the virtues of analysis over geometry\nfor the solution of the problems of economic theory. If a solution can be found in one\nway, its isomorph can be found in the other. But, of course, for any particular problem,\nit may be better, that is speedier and more convenient, to use geometry rather than\nanalysis, or vice versa. Similarly, then, some problems of monopolistic markets which\ndo not readily yield to the ordinary tools of economic analysis, may fruitfully be dealt\nwith by the theory of games. This is, of course, a speculation ; the author hopes to\nbe able to treat the problem further at another time.\n\nWe may conclude, then, that the '* Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour \"\ndoes not seem to offer the promised revolution in economic theory. Nonetheless, it\noffers, along with its formidable mathematical apparatus, some new insights into\neconomics, and opens paths which will be well worth exploring.\n\nCambridge, Mass.

Whether this income-distribution will, in fact, be the most desirable\none, or whether other distributions are even more desirable, is a question that cannot\nbe answered without ''political postulates.\" I fully agree that it is impossible to\npursue a particular line of policy without bringing in politics. But I still think that\neconomics has much to gain, and nothing to lose, from a clear demarcation between\nthe two\u2014from showing, in other words, which aspect of a particular line of action is\ndependent on '' political postulates \" and which is not.\n\nAll this is independent of the criticism made by Mr. Scitovszky in an earlier\narticle of this REviEW!\u2014that in order to be certain that a particular measure will in\nfact (potentially) increase welfare, the simple test originally suggested by me was not\nsufficient. The test, in order to be fool-proof, must be a double one ; not only must the\nnew situation show itself superior to the old one, when looked at on the basis of the\nincome-distribution of the old situation, but the old situation must also be inferior to\nthe new one, when looked at on the basis of the income distribution of the new situation.\n\nLondon.

                    "66 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nand those in the quantity of exports. But, in general, the export-elasticity is well\nbelow unity.\n\nFor the countries in the agricultural and mining groups, the income-elasticity, in\nmost cases, tends to be over two. The differences among them broadly reflect the\nvarious stages of development of manufacturing industries in these countries and,\nhence, the relative composition of their imported manufactures.\n\nNow let us turn to discuss the size of the price-elasticity for different types of\ncountries. It seems that the difference in their magnitude as shown in the table is\nrandom ; and no generalisation can therefore be made on them. But, with the excep-\ntion of the case of Canada, all the elasticities tend to be less than unity. This, however,\nmay be explained by the fact that, as imports are generally the goods which cannot\nbe produced at home, their fluctuations would tend to be inelastic with respect to the\nfluctuations in the prices. Moreover, in most cases, the partial correlation between\nimport quantity and price is not high. This is partly due to the defect of using either\nwholesale or cost-of-living index to represent the prices of home-produced substitutes ;!\nand, more particularly, it is due to the fact that the cyclical fluctuations in the quantity\nof imports is predominantly determined by the changes in income.\n\nV\n\nThe elasticities given in Table IV concern the individual countries' demand for\nlola] imports. It has been found that they generally reflect the predominance of a\ncertain group of commodities in the total imports, which is in turn determined by the\neconomic set-up of the country in question. In this way, our calculations fail to reflect\nthe difference in a country's demand for different groups of commodities. If, for\ninstance, a country importing mainly foodstuffs tends to have a less elastic income-\ndemand for imports than a country importing mainly manufactured goods, do we also\nexpect that a single country's income-elasticity of demand for imported foodstuffs\nis smaller than that for manufactured goods ? Or, in other words, do '' horizontal \"'\ncomparison and '' vertical '\" comparison tend to give more or less the same conclusions ?\nOur expectation that this will be so is confirmed by the results of further calculations,\nwhich are given in Table V.\n\nThe American and the British data yield parallel results. The income-elasticity\nof demand for foodstuffs tends to be less than unity. This is in accordance with the\nfact that consumption expenditure on food, though closely related to income, change\nless than in proportion to income. For price-elasticity, the U.K. has a low value. This\nis natural because she is deficient in foodstuffs and is therefore bound to buy abroad.\nThe presence of home-produced substitutes will not have much influence upon the\nmagnitude on this price-elasticity, as their total quantity is small in relation to total\nhome consumption. The U.S.A., which is self-sufficient in staple foodstuffs, tends to\nimport some crude and manufactured foodstuffs which in general are not produced at\nhome. An examination of the trade statistics reveals that the main items in these\nbroad groups are tea, cocoa and drinks. Consequently, the American price-elasticity\nof demand for foodstuffs tends to be low too.\n\nBoth countries import raw materials which in general have no home-produced\nsubstitutes ; and, therefore, their demands are inelastic with respect to changes in\ntheir respective import prices. But, as expected, the raw materials show elastic\nchanges with respect to home income changes. Moreover, as the U.K. isdependent upon\n\n! Even if the substitution between imports and home-produced goods is regarded as a competition for\nthe purchasing power of the home consumer, the correlation coefficient may not be expected to be high,\nbecause such substitution is rather remote and insensitive.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:36:40 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON OF DEMAND FOR IMPORTS 65\n\ndifferent types of country, the results are in conformity with our a $riori expectation.\nFor the industrial countries as a group, the income-elasticity though greater than unity\ndoes not tend to be very high ; and, moreover, it is well below that for the agricultural\nand mining countries as a group. It is interesting to compare the income-elasticity\nfor the two groups with the income-elasticity calculated for the world as a whole. In\nour calculation, the world's income-elasticity of demand for imports is given as J4- 1.5,\nwhich means that the cyclical fluctuations in the quantity of total world imports\ntend, on the average, to be 1.5 times more violent than those in the world real income.\nThe value, 1.5, stands just between the averages for the two groups. This is equivalent\nto saying that, given a uniform economic expansion or contraction all over the world,\nthe quantity of imports of the industrial countries tends to fluctuate less than that of\nthe world average ; and, that of the agricultural and mining countries tends to fluctuate\nmore. This fact, however, can be easily explained. As the imports of the industrial\ncountries consist of smaller percentage of capital equipments and other manufactured\ngoods than total world imports, the former should remain more stable than the latter\nduring trade cycle; and, the converse is true for the case of agricultural and mining\ncountries. However, this comparison, ?n/er alia, points out another feature of cyclical\nmovements of world trade. It is the inherent tendency of the distribution of world\ntrade to shift during the trade cycle. It would seem that, as the quantity of total\nworld trade is rising during world prosperity, the total imports into agricultural and\nmining countries will be rising faster than those into the industrial countries ; and,\nthat, in times of world slump and recession, the former will be falling faster than the\nlatter. On a $riori grounds, we would expect opposite cyclical shifts on the side of\nexports of different types of country. These two facts taken together provide a very\nimportant clue to the cyclical pattern of change in the balance of payments of different\ntypes of country in the world.\n\nFurthermore, it seems that the difference in the size of the income-elasticity of\ndifferent countries in the same broad group also reflects the relative composition of\nthe imports of that particular country. We have to divide the industrial countries\ninto three sub-groups. So far as their respective compositions of imports are con-\ncerned, the highly industrialised and self-sufficient type of country tends to import\nmainly those raw materials which have no substitutes at home. The figure given in\nTable IV shows that the U.S.A., though having a very low marginal propensity to\nimport, still has an elastic demand for imports. The imports into the highly indus-\ntrialised and deficient type of country consist not only of raw materials, but also of\nfoodstuffs; and, consequently, the income-elasticity for them would tend to be\nrelatively low among the industrial group. This is confirmed by the cases of the U.K.\nand Germany. For the less industrialised type of country whose imports consist of a\nfairly high percentage of manufactured goods and capital equipments, the income-\nelasticity would necessarily be the highest of the group. Switzerland, Japan, France\nand Sweden support our argument. Moreover, some industrial co\u00fcntries are dependent\nupon imported raw materials for making domestic exports. Therefore, we find that, in\nthese cases, there is correlation between the fluctuations in the quantity of imports\n\nmade because it seems reasonable to use the index of a country to represent also the countries whose internal\neconomic activities are closely connected with it. For instance, we use British index to represent India and\nother British colonies; American index to represent Latin-American countries; Hungarian index to\nrepresent the south-eastern European countries, etc. The fourteen countries included and their respective\nweights are as follows: Australia 10; Canada 8; Denmark 5; France 15; Germany 20; Hungary 20;\nJapan ro; Netherlands 6; New Zealand 6; Norway 5; South Africa 5; Sweden 5; the U.K. 30 ; and\nthe U.S.A. 75. Estimates for Germany covering 1924 and for New Zealand covering 1924 and 1925 are\nextrapolated on the basis of the aggregate for other countries. Estimates for Australia and New Zealand\nare converted from a fiscal-year to an approximate calender-year basis by averaging successive pairs of\nfiscal-year figures.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:36:40 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON OF DEMAND FOR IMPORTS 63\n\nIV\n\nThe foregoing discussion reveals that the cyclical change in the quantity of imports\nof a country is determined by four elasticities : (r) the income-elasticity of demand\nfor imports; (2) the price-elasticity of demand for imports (with tariff corrected) ;\n(3) the price-elasticity of substitution of home-produced goods for imports; and\n(4) in some cases, the export-elasticity of demand for imports. We can use partial\ncorrelation analysis to get all these elasticities.\n\nFor the total imports of a country, the tariff changes may be corrected in the\nfollowing way. The Customs revenue is first reduced to an index number with the\nbase year similar to those of import quantity and price indices. This index is then\ndivided throughout by the quantity index of the same period. The resultant ratios\nrepresenting the tariff changes are added to the price index for the corresponding\nyears; therefore we get the import prices including tariff for a country. This pro-\ncedure is only an approximation ; but it is thought that it would be sufficient for our\npresent purpose.\n\nIn general, we use a wholesale price index or cost-of-living index to represent the\nprices of home-produced substitutes. Moreover, in order to simplify our statistical\ncalculations, we divide the corrected import price of a country by its home price to\nget relative prices; and, consequently, the elasticity means a relative-price-elasticity\nof demand for imports.\n\nLet log x, \u2014 quantity of imports ;\n\nlog x, \u2014 real income or home employment ;\n\nlog x4 \u2014 relative prices; and\n\nlog x, \u2014 quantity of exports.\nThen, the partial correlation equation, with the trend of all these series eliminated,\nis of the form :\n\nlog x; \u2014 b,sa4 log x, \u2014 Pisa log Xs -- Dicas log X4.\nHere, 545.54, \u20140453.94 and 5,454 give respectively the income-elasticity, the relative-price-\nelasticity and export-elasticity of demand for imports of a country. The square of\nthe multiple correlation coefficient will then give the percentage of the sample variance\nof the quantity of imports which can be explained by the variations of these three\nfactors.\n\nOne point should be borne in mind. Our estimates of elasticities are made by the\nusual regression analysis, which assumes the whole error-variation concentrated in\nthe dependent variable. Theoretically, the estimates are therefore not the best estimates\nof the true structural relationships existing in the data.? However, the error is prob-\nably not large; and the method is simpler.\n\nThe results of our calculations of the various elasticities of imports for different\ntypes of country are given in Table IV. Moreover, for the sake of comparison, the\nelasticities of demand for imports of the world as a whole (i.e. the sum of imports of\nall countries) are also calculated.\n\nThe countries chosen for each type are confined to the cases in which all the\nseries involved in our statistical calculations are available for the period under study ;\nbut, it is expected that, in general, they would form representative samples of their\nrespective types. Therefore, any generalisations based upon them would seem justified.\n\nWith regard to the magnitude of the income-elasticity of demand for imports of\n\n1'That is: Price Customs revenue\nuantit\n\n1 Cf.

The international com-\nparison of such crude values provides only imperfect guide to the understanding of\nthe cyclical behaviour of demand for imports of different types of country during a\nperiod of world-wide economic expansion or contraction.\n\nFirstly, this is because the marginal propensity to import calculated in terms of\nmoney, does not take into consideration the effect of cyclical change in the terms\nof trade. The difference in the magnitude of cyclical changes in the import and\nhome prices tends either to overestimate or to underestimate the marginal propensity\nof a country. For instance, for a country whose import prices relative to home prices\ntend to rise more in times of general world prosperity and to fall more during world\ndepression and recession, the marginal propensity to import is likely to be relatively\nover-estimated in the above calculation ; whereas, on the other hand, for a country\nwith the opposite pattern of cyclical change in the relative prices, it is likely to be\nunderestimated. Therefore, the import series and the income series should be deflated\nby their respective price indices. Or, in other words, we should study the relationship\nof their cyclical changes in real terms.\n\nMoreover, the magnitude of the change in real imports associated with a change\nin real income may be better judged by relating them to their respective absolute\nlevels in the initial period of equilibrium. When the proportionate changes of these\ntwo variables are correlated, we get the income-elasticity of demand for the imports\nof a country.\n\nSecondly, in addition to income, there are other factors which are equally important\nin determining the cyclical change of imports. The quantity of imports of a country\nchanges also with changes in price levels during the cyclical fluctuations ; or, in other\nwords, we have to calculate the price-elasticities of demand for imports. (r) There\nis the change in the level of import prices. However, the notion of import prices is\nnot a simple one. From the point of view of home consumers, the cost of buying\nimported commodities is not the price quoted by the foreign sellers, but the quoted\nprice, cif, plus import duties. Any change in tariff is equivalent to an increase or\na decrease of import price. Therefore, when we discuss the price-elasticity of demand\nfor imports, we have to correct the absolute level of import price by the change in\ntariff. (2) There are price substitutions of home-produced goods for imports. Any\nincrease in the prices of similar home-produced goods would generally induce an\nincrease in the quantity of imports; and conversely. Moreover, the substitution of\nhome-produced goods for imports can still be conceived to take place even if there are\nno close substitutes produced at home. In this case, the substitution is through the\ncompetition between imports and home-produced goods for the purchasing power of\nthe home consumer.\n\nFurthermore, some countries are dependent upon imported raw materials for\nmaking exports. Therefore, the change in the quantity of imports is also determined\nby the change in the quantity of exports. Accordingly, we have a further elasticity,\nie. the export-elasticity of demand for imports.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:36:40 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Therefore, comparing the industrial countries as a\nwhole with the agricultural countries as a whole, we find that the marginal propensity\nto import of the former tends to be lower than that of the latter.\n\nSecondly, with the exception of the U.S.A., the marginal propensities of the\nindustrial countries cluster along the value of 0.3. The U.S.A. stands by her own\nwith a marginal propensity to import well below o.r. This is no doubt due to her\nnatural self-sufficiency in foodstuffs and most of the important raw materials for her\nhome industries. In contrast, the marginal propensities of agricultural countries vary\ngreatly ; and the mean value for the group lies probably in the range from 0.45 to\n0.5; and the median is 0.475.\n\nLastly, within each group, there is also a regular distribution of the marginal\npropensities. Of the industrial group, the countries which are less industrialised than\nthe rest and consequently import relatively more investment goods, tend to have\nhigher marginal propensities.

The relationship between the value of total imports and that of total national\nincome depicts the result of historical development ; ^ whereas the relationship\nbetween the changes in imports and those in national income tells the cyclical\nbehaviour of demand for imports of a country during a short period of time.\n\nThe relationship between changes in imports and national income can be expressed\nin two ways. If we set out the change in imports that typically result from a unit\nchange in income, the relationship being measured is the marginal propensity to\nimport of a country. Whereas, if we correlate proportional changes in imports and in\nincome, we are measuring the income-elasticity of demand for imports.! In this section,\nwe shall attempt to make an international comparison of the marginal propensities\nto import.\n\nThe imports of a country can be divided into three broad groups: (1) goods\nmainly purchased by consumers for the purpose of immediate or '' deferred \" con-\nsumption; (2) goods mainly entering into the production of consumers' goods ; and\n(3) mainly producers' goods. The relationship between the change in national income\nand the change in expenditure on any one of these groups is obvious and direct. With\nregard to (ri) and (2), that the change in the consumption expenditure is related\npositively to the change in national income is an established fact; and, in an open\nsystem, a part of any increase in consumption expenditure is necessarily devoted to\nimported goods. Therefore, so far as these are concerned, the marginal propensity\nto import is the application of the marginal propensity to consume to the field of\ninternational trade.\n\nMoreover, the demand for imported producers' goods is directly determined by\nthe fluctuation of basic economic conditions at home, which are in turn reflected in\nthe changes of national income. Since this group of goods is generally investment\ngoods, the '' aggregate \" marginal propensity to import measure the changes in expen-\nditure not only on imported consumers' goods but also on imported investment goods.\n\nIn general, the change in national income does not equally affect the expenditures\non these groups of goods. For instance, with a given change in national income, the\nconsumption expenditure changes less than investment expenditure ; and, moreover,\namong the consumption expenditure, the demand for immediate consumption goods\nchanges less than that for '' deferred \"\" consumption goods.? Therefore, the magnitude\nof the marginal propensity to import of a country is, ?nter alia, very much dependent\nupon the relative composition of its imports, which is in turn determined by the type\nof economic set-up of that country. In accordance with the main characteristics of\nthe economic set-up, we may roughly divide the countries in the world into two groups :\nagricultural and industrial. The imports of the countries in the former group tend to\nhave a relatively higher proportion of investment goods and '' deferred \" consumption\ngoods; while in the case of the countries in the latter group, imports consist less of\nthese goods but more of goods for immediate consumption and raw materials for\nmaking consumption goods. Looking at this fact broadly, we would expect that the\nmarginal propensity to import of agricultural countries tends to be larger than that\nof industrial countries. The result of our statistical calculations is shown in Table IIT.\n\nIt must be noted that, in some cases, the period covered is rather short and the\nincome indices used are, in the strict sense, not very reliable ; and, therefore, the\nresults may fail to be precise. However, this defect will not invalidate our attempt\nto discuss the general relationship among the marginal propensities of different coun-\ntries in the world.\n\n1!

All the countries tend to lie along a straight line with a\npositive slope; and the correlation is fairly high. This is in conformity with our\nexpectation. The higher the degree of specialisation, the larger the value of the average\npropensity to import; and conversely. For the purpose of comparison, Diagram III\nis drawn by correlating the average propensities with the '' degree of specialisation in\nhome production \" (as given in Column 3 5\u00bb). The.result is broadly the same, but the\ncorrelation is much improved. This is due to the fact that the ratio of specialised\noutput to total output generally provides a better measurement of a country's degree\nof specialisation than the ratio of specialised exports to total exports. .\n\nAs compared with Diagram 1, the relative position of different countries in\nDiagram II has not materially changed. Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, Norway\nand Eire still stand in the right top corner, while China is still at the opposite end.\nMoreover, when the countries with the same degree of specialisation are compared,\nthose which have higher average propensities to import are generally the richer coun-\ntries, and conversely. This fact is complementary with that revealed in Diagram I.\nThere, the average propensities of the more specialised countries tend to be higher\nthan those of less specialised countries-with same real income Per carita.\n\nIn conclusion, the two fundamental factors, which deterniine the economic self-\nsufficiency of different countries in the world, are the level of real income fer cafita\nand the degree of specialisation of home production in exports.

This it is possible for 7 to vanish, even when the separate income-effects on\nthe separate commodities do not vanish ; this will happen if the change in prices is\nsuch that the sum of\n\nOx.

This seemed to suggest the presence of some factor or factors other than\nmigration in the results of column (4), and led us to consider further the question of\nan increase in distributive and allied industries and the factors likely to affect it.\n\nOn this subject P. Ford, in an article on *' Decentralisation and Changes in the\nNumber of Shops, rgor-1931;\" published in the. Economic Jowrnal of June, 1936,\ncame to the following conclusion : '' The rigidity of distributive costs in a period when\nmassive retailing was extending, for which ' excessive competition ' has been largely\nblamed, is thus seen to be partly due to decentralisation. Housing the population at\nlight,densities over wide areas increases the cost of services which reach to the home.\nWhether it be postal delivery, water, gas or electricity service, or refuse disposal, the\nmileage per home to be covered by personnel, capital equipment, or vehicle is greatly\nincreased. Retail distribution is no exception.\"\n\nIn order to estimate how far this factor of decentralisation has been influential in\nthe places in our sample, we have added, in column (5), the change in the number of\noccupied houses per r,000 of the population between 1921 and 1931, as given in the\nCensus Returns. From this it can be seen that decentralisation has probably not been\nan important factor in the declining areas, where new building has not been very\nextensive. Thus if, as Ford's calculations have shown, decentralisation is an important\nfactor contributing to the increase which has taken place in the distributive and allied\nindustries, then the absence of decentralisation to any great extent in the declining\nareas could well explain the discrepancy between the actual and the expected changes\nin these industries in these areas\u2014as shown in column (4).\n\nFrom this it would appear that any conclusions regarding the effects of emigration\non the distributive and allied industries must be based on the actual changes occurring\nin the numbers employed in these industries\u2014i.e. column (2). These, as has been\nalready noted, show that in only two cases out of ten did the numbers so employed\ndecline as much as or more than the population.\n\nTo sum up, while the results of these calculations have not been decisive, they do\nseem to justify the conclusion that migration will tend to leave the distributive and\nallied industries with excess capacity in the declining areas, while its effect on the\nexpanding areas will depend, among other things, on the extent to which it stimulates\ndecentralisation. If this conclusion is correct, it would appear that the usual arguments\nin favour of bringing industry to the workers rather than the workers to industry,?\nare strengthened by considering the effects of migration on the distributive trades.\nTo stimulate employment in these trades in the expanding areas while distributive\nagencies in the declining areas work below capacity leads to unnecessary duplication,\nwhich will tend to reinforce the already disproportionate trend towards an overgrown\n\"' tertiary \" sector.\n\nSanaH C. GILLESPIE.\nGlasgow. K. W. RorHsCHILD.\n! Ford further points out that decentralisation would not lead to an increase in shops like drapers and\nchina and glass dealers, where people go to central places.

These may well be\nthose goods which are created largely out of themselves, (4e. in whose production\nprocesses input and output mainly consist of the same commodities), as, for example;\nwhales or mathematical wranglers. The point of these examples is that the com-\nmodities with the lowest rate of expansion may be trivial goods.

It is expressly assumed that\nevery good is involved (either as input or as output) in every process. Hence it is not\npossible in the model to reduce below a certain proportion the part played in the economy\nby such goods as whales and wranglers, and eventually the expansion of the system\nmust be slowed down to their own pace. v. Neumann states that his assumption\nthat every good enters every process does not really matter because they may be\nsupposed to do so in very small quantities ; nevertheless the implications of this\nassumption need bearing in mind.\n\n(7) 1t should be noted that although in the model the equilibrium rate of interest\nis uniquely determined, the system of prices and outputs are not wniquely determined :\nthere may be any number of possible equilibrium positions. But each must satisfy\nthe rules set out in section 2 above.\n\nThe ease with which these rules could be established once the existence of an equi-\nlibrium position was known, was due to tlie choice of assumptions which enabled con-\nstant prices and stable relative outputs to exist together under competition. The whole\nprocess of mathematics would become greatly complicated if increasing returns c:\nmonopoly were introduced.\n\nIt will be noted, of course, that the '' equilibrium \" of v. Neumann's model i$\na very long run equilibrium ; it may take many decades or even centuries for the\nsystem to settle down to the rate of expansion of the least expandable goods ; and over\nthis period, the basic assumption of known technical possibilities remaining unchanged\nloses all reality. An important question, therefore, is how far v. Neumann's results\nare applicable to systems which are only in an approach to equilibrium ; and any\nrigorous examination of the properties of such a system would be bound to be most\ncomplicated.\n\nYet it is in the problems of the approach to equilibrium that economists are most\ninterested. How can a country acquire the equipment needed to achieve the best\nsystem of production ? What prices should be used in its accounting system bya\nplanning authority seeking to make the best use of its resources ?

Accordingly, non-interference in the spontaneous operation of the\ncapitalist economy is considered to be the best way of assuring the '' ideal\" use of\nresources. Most contemporary students of welfare economics consider this claim to be\nfalse and point out many conflicts between the private rationality of business enter-\nprises and social rationality as postulated by welfare economics. The private ration-\nality of business enterprises is also in conflict with the social objectives accepted by\nmost citizens of modern democratic society. This accounts for the increasing tendency\ntoward planning under contemporary capitalism and also for the socialist movements\npresent in most capitalist countries.\n\nA final observation has to be made about the procedure of verification of the\npostulate of rationality. There is some difference in procedure between firms, on the one\nhand, and households and public services on the other. Money profit is a quantity\nwhich can be observed empirically (like, for instance, velocity in physics). The\ntheoretical concept of money profit, therefore, can be easily identified with corres-\nponding empirical observations (the procedure of identification involves an inter-\npretation of book-keeping categories). Direct observation tells, then, whether firms\ndo or do not maximise money profit. Utility and public welfare, instead, are purely\ntheoretical constructs; there are no empirical observations which would serve as\ntheir counterparts (just like in the case of the concept of potential in physics). But\nthis does not preclude verification by indirect devices. The uniformities of decision\npatterns are different when utility or public welfare, respectively, are maximised than\nwhen they are not. This difference in the uniformities mentioned makes it possible\nto verify empirically the hypothesis of rationality of acts of households and of public\nservices.\n\nWashington, D.C. O.

This was a jealously guarded preserve of G\u00f3ring, who steadily\nrefused to allow any share of control to the Speer Ministry. At the end of February,\n1944, however, the Allied Air Forces succeeded, in a series of blows, in knocking out\n70 per cent of fighter assembly plants. As a result, the control of the fighter aircraft\nproduction was handed over to Speer. Extremely energetic rationalisation measures\nwere put in hand immediately : the number of models in production was severely cut,\ncomponents were standardised, and designs simplified (though not, according to the\nMinistry's claim, at the expense of performance) ; while the salvaged machine tools of\nthe destroyed plants were set up under canvas. As a result, the pre-raid level of pro-\nduction was exceeded by April and nearly doubled by July, with a no more than\nI5 per cent increase in the industry's labour force.?\n\nThe picture that emerges from a study of the years 1942-44 is that of an economy\nrapidly trying to build up its war effort to the stage of total mobilisation, but never\nattaining the stage at which the country's war potential would have been fully exploited.\nFrom September, 1944, onwards, the disorganisation caused by the air attacks on the\nrailway system, and the loss of territories in the West and East caused a decline in\nproduction, followed by a complete industrial collapse in the early months of 1945.\nAccording to the officials of the Speer Ministry, war production was still expanding\nrapidly when these factors supervened, and in their absence, the level of munitions\nproduction would have risen by another 20-30 per cent before capacity output, as\ndetermined by raw material supplies, would have been reached. The factors, therefore,\nwhich really limited German war production in the last three years of the war are to\nbe sought simply in those elements of inertia in the economic system which set a limit\nto the rate at which adjustment and expansion can proceed, rather than in any absolute\nshortage either of man-power, equipment, or raw materials. No doubt, with a better\nsystem of co-ordination, a greater readiness to sacrifice civilian standards and to\nmobilise labour, the process of expansion could have been speeded up further. But\nthe basic fault was the failure to plan for expansion and total mobilisation in the\nearlier years. It was due to a breakdown of strategy at the highest level, caused by\nthe virtual absence of any effective machinery for thorough and systematic discussion\nof requirements and potentialities.\n\nIt would be a mistake to conclude from this analysis that the German war economy\nprovides any evidence of the inefficiency of '' planned \" or '' controlled \" economies.\nIts failures were due to the absence of planning and co-ordinated control, and not to\nany abandonment of a /aisser faire system. But it will stand as a monument to the\ninefficiency of a system of personal dictatorship. Those of us who are fortunate enough\nto live in a free society will take comfort from the fact that even in the matter of\nefficiency of administrative control and co-ordination, the '\"' cumbrous \" methods of\ndemocratic government should prove so superior to systems based on the ruthless\nexercise of personal power.\n\nLondon. NicHOLAS KALDoR.\n\n1The saving of labour was accompanied by equally impressive savings in raw materials. Thus in the\ncase of weapons, the overall ratio between the required input weight and finished weight of steel was reduced\nfrom 4: 1 to 2 : t, between 1942 and 1944.\n\n3 No doubt this performance was greatly aided by the fact that the industry was previously highly\ninefficient, measured by any standard. This is evident also from a comparison of the labour force engaged on\naircraft production in Britain and Germany as shown in Table 9, if account is taken of the fact that the\nBritish production was considerably in excess of the German, as measured by numbers or structural weight ;\nand that the German figures, unlike the British, do not include all the workmen engaged on armament orders.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:52:27 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

At the same time, in doing so, such a housing policy would\nsecure the pre-condition for a Population Policy aiming at maintaining something like\nthe present size of the population.

The answer to this\nis that rent subsidies would, according to this scheme, only be given to the compar-\natively low income classes up to say \u00a36 per week. So far as old houses are concerned,\nrent restriction will prevent any benefit for the landlord for the time being and, it\nmay well be, for a long time to come.\n\nAs for new houses: only those builders should be given loans or mortgages at a\nreduced interest rate who are prepared to comply with the stipulations and control, of\nwhich rent control is one.\n\nIt is essential that the tenant should know the amount of the subsidy to which\nhe is entitled : for this reason tables for various incomes and family size could easily\nbe worked out and handed to the tenant which would immediately show the amount\nof the subsidy.

We may conclude, therefore, that the danger of retaliatory action by individual-\nistic export surplus countries is not in the field of commercial policy so much as in\nusing the weapon of foreign lending in order to cause diversions in the channels of\ntrade.

The offer of long-\nterm reciprocal purchase agreements, on the other hand, by its promise of economic\nstability, would increase the advantages to third countries of trading with the '' full\nemployment ' block. Unless and until satisfactory world-wide agreements can be\nconcluded which safeguard employment policy and potential export surplus countries\ncan be induced to renounce the right to \" tie\" foreign loans it would be suicidal for\npotential deficit countries to renounce the right to conclude reciprocal (bilateral)\nbulk-purchase agreements.

'' The fact that in\nthe real world the demand curve and the cost curve of individual firms are not inde-\npendent presents a very formidable problem to economic analysis.\" Indeed it seems\nobvious that hardly a firm in the '' real world \"' is without selling costs of some kind,\nand hence that there is hardly a firm whose demand curve is not functionally dependent\nupon its cost curve. How, then, can one explain the fact that in the world of economic\ntheorizing there exists hardly a firm for which the two curves are not treated as\nfunctionally independent ? How, above all, can this procedure be explained on the\npart of those who otherwise have seemed to accept a revision of economic theory in\nthe direction of monopolistic competition ; and finally, even among so many of those\nwho have contributed to the development of substantial portions of this field ? The\nproblem zs formidable, without any question, but this is surely not the reason. A good\npart of the explanation lies in the fundamental character of the change, and the over-\nwhelming psychological barriers to casting off established modes of thought which\nare so much a part of our theoretical tradition. The remainder lies, I believe, in con-\nscious avoidance: the interdependence in question is not admitted because it badly\nmesses up what is otherwise a more tractable theoretical model.

However, from the notes Rothbarth left behind the method of the inquiry\nis perfectly clear and judging from the results obtained further research in this direction\nis very much worth continuing.\n\nShortly before joining the Forces, Rothbarth was at work on an article on the\ninfluence of cost dispersion in an industry under conditions of imperfect competition\nupon the relative share of wages in the product of that industry. He shows that\non certain plausible assumptions this influence is likely to be small.\n\nEven when on active service Rothbarth continued to think and to write of\neconomic problems. He wrote in Holland a brilliant essay on the reasons for high\nproductivity in the U.S.A. as compared with Europe, which, I hope, will be published.\nIn the last letter I received from him he described an ingenious system of full employ-\nment in a developed economy based on assuring to everybody a minimum income.\nThis measure would both increase effective demand (if financed properly) and reduce\nthe supply of labour because people could afford to work shorter hours for their living.\n\nRothbarth planned to write sometime a book (or a few books) which would cover\nall the wide field of economics and politics in which he was interested. Such plans\nfrequently instil into people a strong instinct of self preservation. They stick to life\nin order to accomplish their life work\u2014or so they think..

He volunteered for the Forces as soon\nas it was possible to do so on equal terms (up to 1943 German refugees were accepted\nonly for the Pioneer Corps). He hardly spared himself too much when on active service.\nIn his last letter to me, after the description of the full employment system mentioned\nabove, there is the following passage : '' Since I last wrote to you we had a fairly grim\ntime. I came through it better than most.

It might, for instance,\nrestrain us from advocating, in a phase of the boom when the demands for commodities\nand for bonds are still antagonistic, a policy of money-creation which would be appro-\npriate enough-if we had reached the crisis phase at which they have been precipitated\ninto sympathy.\n\nCambridge. D. H. ROBERTSON.\n\n1. Since the discussion which Professor Robertson has reopened does in a sense\ngo back to Value and. Capital, I should like to be allowed to make some remarks on\nhis note, without (I hope) standing in the way of a reply by Professor Lange.\n\nMy own feeling, which I expressed at the time Professor Lange's paper appeared,\nis that although his terminology (of sympathetic and antagonistic shifts) is a useful\nway of describing certain sorts of economic phenomena, we should be careful to notice\nthat it does not in itself explain anything. It is a way of classifying the changes which\ncome into the economic system from outside\u2014the exogenous changes, as Professor\nHayek used to call them. The change from summer to winter is an exogenous change\nof this sort. It has no economic causes, but it has economic effects. It sets up changes\nin consumers' demands, increases the demands for beefsteaks and plum-puddings,\ndiminishes the demands for salads and ice-creams. It we like, we may say that with\nrespect to this change the demands for beefsteaks and plum-puddings are sympathetic,\nthe demands for salads and ices are sympathetic, while the demands for salads and\nbeefsteaks, or for ices and plum-puddings, are antagonistic.\n\nIt is, however, already apparent from this example that Professor Robertson has\nsomewhat underestimated the flexibility of the Lange terminology. Sympathy and\nanatagonism are always to be read with reference to some particular parameter (the\nparameter in my example being temperature, or some similar seasonal index). The\nnumber of parameters which we may introduce into our demand functions are legion ;\nthey may include absolutely anything on heaven or earth which has any relevance for\nhuman conduct. And there is no reason why two commodities which are sympathetic\nwith respect to one parameter, should also be sympathetic with respect to another.\nTo return to my example. Suppose that instead of taking temperature as our para-\nmeter (and therefore concentrating attention on rather short-period changes), we\nhad taken a longer view, averaging consumption over longer periods, and had investi-\ngated the changes in demand which might result from an increase in the average age\n\n1 See my Essays in Monetary Theory, p. 24.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 11:23:34 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

This shows that the decrease in the volume of consumption\nof about 17 per cent is mainly due to a decrease in the total supply of productive\nresources and to a lesser extent to the shifting over to the Government sector. The use\nof substitutes, the bad weather conditions for the harvests in 1940 and 1941, the lack\nof concentrated feeding-stuffs and fertilisers has lowered the productivity of consump-\ntion goods industries and agriculture. We have here a good illustration of the point\nmentioned earlier concerning the difference between Sweden and Great Britain, not\nonly in the magnitude of the war economic problem, but also with regard to the blockade\nand to the trend of Government expenditure. The space for the expansion of Govern-\nment expenditure has been provided for by a decrease in private investment from\n14 per cent to 1o per cent in 1942. The volume of private investment has been reduced\nto two-thirds of the pre-war level. In this connection it may be of interest to study\nthe amount of disinvestment. Part of consumption has been made possible through\nthe reduction of stocks. Estimated at pre-war prices, the reduction of stocks of food-\nstuffs and raw materials for food industries and agriculture comes to about Kr. 200\nmillions and of industrial raw materials to about Kr. roo millions. At the same time,\nhowever, there has been a big increase in stocks of fuel which are estimated at Kr. 200\nmillions. It would thus seem that there has been no substantial reduction in the total\ncapital of the country, held in the form of stocks of raw materials and finished goods.\nA correction of the total consumption figure (in 1939 about Kr. 7,700 millions) for\nchanges in stocks, is therefore hardly necessary.\n\nWith regard to fixed capital, any estimates are hazardous, partly because some of\nthe new investment, being temporary investments for the war period, should not be\nreckoned an addition to the fixed capital of the country. There are also great differences\nbetween different industries, but the Report which I have been quoting draws the\nconclusion that there has been no reduction in the fixed capital of industry, even if\ntemporary investment for special war purposes and for the production of substitutes\nis excluded.\n\nIn agriculture, however, there has been a substantial decrease in livestock, due to\nthe bad harvests and to the blockade. This has resulted in an increase in the liquid\nresources (deposits and cash) of the farmers. The value of this reduction has been\nestimated at about Kr. 180 millions. The stock of automobiles has been reduced,\nsteamers have been sunk (about Kr. roo millions over and above the value of new\nships built), etc., but in other fields there have been new investments, especially in new\npower stations (about Kr. 400 millions) and new houses (about Kr. 500 millions). On\nthe whole, there is reason to believe that there has been a net increase in the fixed\ncapital of the country.\n\nWith incomes growing, the problem of managing the price level becomes more\nand more difficult. There is a surplus of purchasing power which takes the form of\nsavings in bank accounts and an increase in cash reserves. This creates a tension\nbetween the potential demand for and the supply of consumption goods, which at\npresent, however, does not lead to an increase in prices because of a stringent control\nof prices, production and consumption. The control will probably be effective during\nthe war.: The stability of the price level since the autumn of 1942 shows the effective-\nness of the control and has had favourable reactions on expectations. But the danger\nof this latent purchasing power becoming a driving factor in the transition period after\nthe war is very great. We have here a very important motive for retaining control of\nproduction and consumption for a considerable transition period.\n\nStockholm.

The Group concentrated mainly on the case\nof oligopoly, where there are so few competitors in a market that no single firm can\nact without provoking reactions among the others, and where, consequently, from the\nuncertainty of human behaviour, it is impossible to predict the results of a change of\nprice: in terms of theory, each firm sees the demand curve for its products as kinked,\nand is afraid to move prices in either direction for fear of provoking a movement\nwhich might cause serious losses. Clearly, a similar situation might arise from other\ncauses of uncertainty\u2014e.g. political uncertainty, a particularly important point for\nthe building trade, or uncertainty about the way in which the general economic situation\nwill change\u2014in all trades where individual firms can affect the price level. In all such\ncases, there is a presumption in favour of sticking to what is commonly regarded as a\nfair price level to avoid provoking undesirable reactions, or simply to avoid the risk of\njumping the wrong way. The basis of the accepted price in such cases will always tend\nto be \"full cost \"\" or *' cost plus \"\u2014the extreme case arising, of course, at the stage of\nuncertainty where a rational basis for estimating money prices for any length of time\nahead ceases to exist, and the normal price becomes '' cost plus '\" pure and simple.\n\nSince ethics and self-interest lead in certain circumstances to the same conclusion,\nit is obviously likely to be extremely difficult to disentangle what, in any particular\ncase, are the actual motives. It is not directly relevant to this inquiry into rating\nproblems to know whether landlords acted from ethical or financial motives\u2014all that\nis relevant is to know that many of them did act on the full cost or cost-plus principle\u2014\nand I have not tried to disentangle their actual feelings. I can only point out that\nthere is $rima facie evidence that both ethical and self-interested motives were at\nwork. Certain public utility societies were building entirely from philanthropic motives.\nOrdinary landlords and builders, as a class, are presumably neither better nor worse\nthan other men, and they must in many cases have shared the public dislike of high\nhousing prices and the desire of so many employers for a just price rather than maxi-\nmisation of receipts. On the other hand, there was a period after the last war when\nthe housing market was extremely uncertain: there has always been the possibility\nof political reaction if rents were raised, particularly in an area like Birmingham where\ntenants' organisations have been strong: there may well have been elements of\noligopoly in the housing market, particularly in the market for selling new houses :\nand the behaviour of certain landlords and builders suggests that something more\nimmediately affecting their pockets.than morality must have existed to restrain\nsome of the others.\n\nClearly, though not relevant here, this question of the motives of landlords and\nbuilders is extremely relevant to a number of other important questions. As the\nsupply of houses increases to equilibrium levels, the principle on which landlords and\nbuilders fix prices will for a time determine the incidence of rates : and, again, the\nmotives of landlords and builders must very largely determine what is the right policy\nover such matters as rent control and self-government in the building trade. It would\nbe worth while to follow out these points when there is time and opportunity.\n\nOxford. M. P.

It has already become apparent that the most serious\nerror in the older conception of consumers' surplus (how far Marshall shared this\nerror I shall not presume to discuss) lay in treating it as an absolute magnitude, in\nmaking statements such as that a consumer, just because he is in such and such a\nposition, is getting so and so much consumer's surplus. The newer conception is quite\ndifferent from this. Consumers' surplus is relative, not absolute. We are always\nconsidering the movement from one defined situation to another defined situation ; we\nare asking what is the gain (or loss) of money income which would measure the gain\n(or loss) of economic welfare resulting from the movement. This gain or loss of income\nmust itself always refer to one or other of the two situations ; otherwise it is meaning-\nless. We have now seen that even in this restricted sense consumers' surplus is not an\nunambiguous magnitude; but we have now cleared up the ambiguities (so far as can\nbe seen at present) and they are not after all so very formidable. Consumers' surplus\nremains a usable instrument of analysis\u2014as usable as it ever was; and we ought now\nto be enabled to use it with more security and greater confidence.\n\nI hope, in yet another article, to employ my present technique to clear up the\nparallel ambiguities in the concept of producers' surplus.\n\nManchester.

In such a case, therefore, the assumption of a\nzero income elasticity of supply of entrepreneurship will be perfectly justified, and it\nwill be correct to ascribe to the entrepreneur the desire to maximise his profits. Only\nwhen he is more susceptible to the attractions of leisure than to those of his work\nand is consequently induced by a higher income to take life easier, will the entre-\npreneur's optimum behaviour be, not to maximise profits, but to keep his exertions\nand output below the point at which profits would be at a maximum.\n\nThe puritan psychology of valuing money for its own sake, and not for the enjoy-\nments and com\u00edorts it might yield, is that of the ideal entrepreneur as he was con-\nceived of in the early days of capitalism. The combination of frugality and industry,\nthe entrepreneurial virtues, is calculated to insure the independence of the entre-\npreneur's willingness to work from the level of his income. The classical economists,\ntherefore, were perfectly justified in assuming that the entrepreneur aims at maximising\nhis profits. They were concerned with a type of businessman whose psychology\nhappened to be such that for him maximising profits was identical with maximising\nsatisfaction.\n\nThe entrepreneur of to-day may have lost some of the frugality and industry of\nhis forefathers ; nevertheless, the assumption that he aims at maximising his profits\nis still quite likely to apply to him\u2014at least as a first approximation. lor this assump-\ntion is patently untrue only about people who regard work as plain drudgery: a\nnecessary evil, with which they have to put up in order to earn their living and the\ncom\u00edforts of life. The person who derives satisfaction from his work\u2014other than that\nyielded by the income he receives for it\u2014will to a large extent be governed by ambition,\na spirit of emulation and rivalry, pride in his work, and similar considerations, when\nhe plans his activity. We believe that the entrepreneur usually belongsto this\nlatter category.\n\nHowever, we set out, not to justify or criticise the assumption that entrepreneurs\naim at maximising profits, but to make its implications explicit. Many of us have\nbeen in the habit of regarding this assumption as similar in every respect to the assump-\ntion that the individual maximises his satisfaction. We have shown above that this\nis not so. For to say that the individual maximises his satisfaction is a perfectly\ngeneral statement. It says nothing about the individual's psychology or behaviour,\nis, therefore, devoid of empirical content, and is true by definition. As against this,\nthe assumption that the entrepreneur maximises his profits is based on observation\nand implies a special hypothesis concerning the businessman's psychology. It is,\ntherefore, an empirical law, which need not apply to every businessman, and may\nconceivably be untrue even about the representative entrepreneur. Its justification\nlies in its usefulness, which should be enhanced by a better understanding of its exact\nmeaning and limitations.\n\nStillwater, Oklahoma.

It is clear that the two levels of output\nneed not coincide. For we used one indifference curve to determine maximum profits,\nanother one for determining maximum satisfaction: and as long as we make no\nspecial assumption about the individual's psychology or behaviour, there is no definite\nrelationship between the shape or position of the various indifference curves in his\nindifference map. In order, therefore, that maximum profits should maximise his\nsatisfaction, the entrepreneur must have a special type of psychology, and, corres-\nponding to it, a special type of indifference map.\n\nThe geometrical nature of this condition will be immediately obvious to the\nreader. For the net income curve to be tangential to an indifference curve at the same\nlevel of output at which its slope equals that of indifference curve 7, the tangents to\nthe two indifference curves at that level of output must be parallel. In order that\nthis condition may be satisfied for any and every kind of net income curve, all\nindifference curves must have the same slope for each abscissa. In other words, the\nseveral indifference curves must be vertical displacements of each other.\n\nThe economic meaning of the above geometrical condition is that the entre-\npreneur's choice between more and less activity\u2014or between more income and more\nleisure\u2014must be independent of his income. This is equivalent to Marshall's familiar\nassumption of a constant marginal utility of money ; or, to use more up-to-date\nterminology, to a zero income elasticity of supply of entrepreneurship.\n\nAt first sight it may seem strange and unrealistic to attribute to the entrepreneur\na type of behaviour that would fulfil this condition. For, if his aim is to make money,\nit seems natural that the amount he is already making should affect the ardour and\nenergy with which he seeks to make more. But the assumption that the entrepreneur's\nwillingness to work is independent of his income need not imply that he is not interested\nin the material rewards of his work. It may also mean that he is so keen on making\nmoney that his ambition cannot be damped by a rising income. The latter inter-\npretation seems to be the more realistic one of the two. Businessmen regard the income\nthey earn as an index of their success and efficiency ; and their ambition of excelling\nin their profession manifests itself in the desire to make more money. We claim that a\nbusinessman's entrepreneurial activity will remain unaffected by a rise in his income\nif he makes money, not in order to have more to spend, but for its own sake, because\nit is an index and token of his success in life.\n\nThe man who aims at raising his standard of living tends to relax his efforts when\nthey meet with success. This is so, not only because material demands are satiable,\nbut also because leisure is an essential ingredient of a good life. He, however, who\nwants success for its own sake, and measures it in terms of money, is likely to keep\nworking unabated even after his income has risen. This is likely to be the case, partly\nbecause the desire for success is more insatiable than the demand for material goods,\nand partly because it is not a high but a rising income that is a sign of business success.!\n\nFor the supply of entrepreneurship to be independent of income it is not necessary\nthat the entrepreneur's psychology should be such that he save the total increment\nof a rise in his income. He may devote part or all of it to raising his standard of living,\nprovided that he regards this as no more than a by-product of his business success\nand its outward manifestation. As long as raising his standard of living does not become\n\n1 A high but constant level of income can be a sign of past business success.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:22:45 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

But for an indifference\ncurve to be tangential to the income curve at this point, it would have to be horizontal\nor even upward-sloping over\npart of its range. This is very\nunlikely and conflicts with our\ngeneral notions of the shape of\nindifference curves.\n\nWe must bear in mind,\nhowever, that what the entre-\npreneur is supposed to maxi-\nmise is not his total net income.\nHe is assumed to maximise the\ndifference between his total\nreceipts and total costs; and\ntotal costs are always assumed\nto comprise, not only the entre-\npreneur's outlays, but also the\nwages of routine management\nand supervision, which he is\nsupposed to pay to himself\nand include in his regular cost\ncalculations. In other words, the entrepreneur's income consists of two elements.\nThe wages of routine management, which form part of costs; and the profits of\nentrepreneurship proper, which are his residual income. Marshall called both elements\nprofits: the one normal, the other extraordinary, profits. For our purposes it will be\nmore convenient to refer to the former as the entrepreneur's wages, and to apply the\nterm profit only to his residual income. But irrespectively of terminology, it is always\nhis residual income only that the entrepreneur is supposed to maximise. That this\ndichotomy of the entrepreneur's income is always implied in the orthodox theory will\nbecome plain to the reader when he recalls the full equilibrium conditions of perfect\ncompetition: the equality of price with marginal and average costs. While the latter\ncondition eliminates the entrepreneur's residual income completely, he is still supposed\nto earn wages for supervision (normal profits) in this situation. These must conse-\nquently be included in costs ; and they are supposed to represent the entrepreneur's\nminimum (ie. marginal) income. Profits, therefore, the entrepreneur's residual\nincome, are of the nature of a rent.!\n\nIn our diagram (Fig. 2) we can separate the two elements of the entrepreneur's\nincome by drawing the indifference curve that goes through the point \u00ab. This indiffer-\nence curve represents the minimum satisfaction that will keep the entrepreneur in\nhis profession. If his satisfaction were to fall below this level he would cease being an\nentrepreneur and do something else. That part of his income, therefore, which brings\nthe entrepreneur to this level of satisfaction is his minimum income, the wage of\nroutine management.? Only the part of his income that brings his satisfaction above\nthe indifference curve I can be regarded as profit proper.

                    "A Note on Profit Maximisation\nand its Implications.\n\nThat the entrepreneur aims at maximising his profits is one of the most fundamental\nassumptions of economic theory. So much so that it has almost come to be regarded\nas equivalent to rational behaviour, and as an axiom, which is self-evident and needs\nno proof or justification. Doubts have been raised by several writers whether maximis-\ning his profits is always the entrepreneur's best policy.! But such doubts were few\nand have died away without reverberation ; mainly, I think, because it has never\nbeen made clear what exactly profit maximisation implies ; and perhaps also because\nwe have a vested interest in maintaining this assumption\u2014it makes economic analysis\nso much simpler. In the following we set out to show that by attributing to the entre-\npreneur the desire to maximise his profits we also attribute to him a particular\npsychology, which, though very plausible, is rather special.\n\nLet us draw the entre-\nm preneur's indifference map\nbetween money income, ;,\nand entrepreneurial inactivity,\ni? (Fig. 1)?. Entrepreneurial\nactivity is the negative of 7\nP and is measured from right to\nleft along the horizontal axis.\nAssume next that entrepre-\nneurial activity is a limita-\ntional factor in the manu-\nfacture of the entrepreneur's\nproduce and can, therefore, be\nmeasured in terms of output.*\nPoint c represents zero output\nor total entrepreneurial in-\nactivity.\n\no E T\u201474 Since the unit of measure-\n\nFig. r. ment along the horizontal\n\naxis is the unit of output,\n\nwe can draw the entrepreneur's total receipts curve and total outlays curve in this\ndiagram. The vertical difference of the two curves shows, for each level of output, the\nentrepreneur's total net income from operating his firm. Taking these differences as\nordinates we can draw the entrepreneur's net income curve (Fig. 2). The point at\nwhich the net income curve is tangential to an indifference curve is the entrepreneur's\npoint of maximum satisfaction and determines his optimum rate of output. This\noptimum rate of output may or may not maximise his profits; and our problem is to\n1 Cf. J. R.

It is not however\nunique since it depends on the definition of direct and indirect taxes. I shall not pursue this\nmatter here.\n\nAPPENDIX VII.\n\nThe quarterly data given in the tables of Appendix I above are stated to be at seasonally\nadjusted annual rates. In calculating the quarterly changes in certain ratios and, in particular, the\nratio of private savings to private disposable income, it became apparent that the method of\nseasonal adjustment used was of a kind which did not fully allow for the trend of the series. As\na result the savings ratios took the form of a saw edge rising throughout each calendar year and\ndropping abruptly between the fourth and first quarters. In order to calculate smooth series for\nthe diagrams it seemed desirable to remove this residual seasonality.\n\nSince these residual seasonalities may be useful to other workers in this field, I set them out\nbelow. They were obtained by the median link relative method from the data for the quarters of\n1939, 1940, 1941 and the first quarter of 1942.\n\nResidual seasonality.\n\nI II Il IV\nY 1.013 1.003 0.992 9.993\nc I.021 1.002 0.991 0.986\nT 1.017 I.O0I 0.999 0.983\nS 0.908 0.957 I.031 I.105\nL 1.019 0.997 0.992 0.993\n\nAPPENDIX VIII.\n\nThe phrases ''tax liabilities \" and \"tax accruals\" perhaps need some explanation. Tax\nliabilities may be understood in two senses. The first '' estimated tax liabilities \" in the case of,\nsay, income tax means the liability at current tax rates which will finally have to be met in respect\nof the possession of current income. This will be different from current payments in so far as\n(a) these payments are in respect of assessments based on a higher or lower past income, (b) the\nfluctuations in payments throughout the year do not correspond to the fluctuations in income,\nand (c) the rate of tax at which current payments are being made is different from the current\nrate of tax. This is the most useful sense I think in which the term is used.\n\nThis concept must be distinguished from final or true tax liabilities which makes allowance\nfor the fact that tax in respect of the income of a given period may finally be levied at a rate\ndifferent frcm that current in the period.\n\nSimilarly there are two forms of tax accruals which are respectively the excess of the first\nor the second kind of tax liabilities over tax payments in a given period.\n\nIna tax system in which both the period of collection and the lag in assessment are one year,\ntrue tax accruals summed over the whole of the past through this year will be equal to this year's\ntax liabilities. This is obvious, since if true tax liabilities, row (1) say, are to date a, b, c, d, e then\ntax payments row (2)say, are o, a, b, c, d and the sum of the differences (1) \u2014 (2) is identically\nequal to e. The amount c would eventually flow into the tax authority even if no tax were levied\nin respect of income earned after the current period.\n\n1\u00e1 Vol.9/10\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:24:12 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

These proportions were moreover independent of\nthe level of income.\n\nThe concept of private disposable income (Y) differs from the net national income at factor\ncost in that it excludes miscellaneous income from public property and includes transfer payments.\nStrictly therefore the proportions just given do not relate to marginal factor shares. They may\nhowever be taken as fairly close approximations of these since in the figures taken from the\nDepartment of Commerce, miscellaneous income from public property is zero throughout the\nperiod while transfer payments vary hardly at all apart from a slight upward trend. It is of\ninterest therefore to note that there is no evidence that the shares of R, P and L are constant at\ndifferent levels of income as is shown by the fact that the constants c4, c3, and c$, are not near\nto zero.

This procedure does not count as part of the burden taxes\non goods bought by the government or payable on government income from property. This\nomission can be seen to be reasonable from the fact that such taxes are equivalent only to inter-\ngovernmental transfers which could be struck out from both sides of the consolidated account of\npublic authorities. Put another way, if the government only raises from the private sector enough\nmoney to pay the cost of the factors employed in providing the goods and services it buys, then\nthe indirect taxes in the market value of these goods and services are self-financing.\n\nThe correctness of this result can be seen from an example! from which, on the simplified\nassumptions employed, can also be deduced the appropriate income concept if it be desired to\ntreat the total revenue as the numerator of the proportion of private incomes going in taxes.\n\nConsider a simple economy in which the only forms of expenditure are consumption and the\npurchase of goods by the government. Further suppose the whole of government purchases to be\nfinanced out of indirect taxes.

Second, other factors, of which the distribution of income may be an example though\nlittle is known on this point, clearly affect the relation of C to Y but may be supposed normally\nto be highly correlated with Y apart from a trend factor. If the distribution of incomes had not\nbeen highly correlated with income over the period 1929-41 then either its independent variation\nmust be unimportant, which on general grounds is unlikely, or its variation must have been small\nso that it can be subsumed in the trend factor. For if neither of these facts were the case over the\nperiod it would have been impossible to express C in terms of Y and / with a high degree of\naccuracy.\n\nIt Dan be seen therefore that in so far as previously existing correlations of this kind are\nbroken down in the future it may turn out that the partial differential of C with respect to Y is\ndifferent from the value given by the equation since to some extent this may really be the differen-\ntial of C with respect to Y and the distribution of income, the relation between the last pair of\nvariables having been stable over the period of observation.,\n\nReturning to the question of independent variables other than Y and / which may be\nsupposed to influence C, it may well be that the equation of normal relationship is slightly affected\nnumerically by the inclusion of the latter part of 1941, since at this time the progress of the war\nmay have introduced new factors.\n\n(3) I have chosen to study the relationship between certain variables because they enable\ncertain relations to be seen simply and are adequate for my particular purposes.

This is obviously not an ideal assumption though it may give\nreasonable results over a fairly wide range of values of Y. A disadvantage of this assumption is,\nfor example, that the estimated value of C will reach a maximum as Y increases, though in fact\nthis is most unlikely to happen. This maximum will be reached at the point where\n\nDu\n2bis\n\u2014 \u2014 174(appr.)\nFurther, the calculated value of T reaches a minimum at the point where\n\nY-2-\u2014\n\n2b,\n\u2014 \u2014 So(app) | .. .\n\nThis is clearly unsatisfactory since it is not to be expected that tax payments in fact rise\nwith every fall in Y below 5o. Thus, while the simple equations used are adequate for a general\ndescription of the data it must be borne in mind that their form is not ideal.\n\n(2) The coefficients in the equations were obtained so as to give the best fit in a least squares\nsense to the data over the period 1929-41. Since the fit obtained is very good, it is to be presumed\nthat other factors which might be supposed to affect C, T or S were either highly correlated with\nY over the period or remained constant or changed slowly so that their variation could be sub-\nsumed in the trend factor. This raises two questions.

Il assumed that they were\nall specific, realising that this was probably not the case but thinking that anyhow the equations\nwould not be greatly affected whatever plausible assumption was made. Information which has\nmore recently become available? enables a better estimate to be made for recent years. It is\nstated that in order to deduct what I have called general indirect taxes from war expenditures the\nprocedure was to allocate all indirect taxes other than those specifically on consumption to war\nexpenditures in the ratio of these expenditures to national product. It is not stated how national\nproduct is defined in this context but it is to be presumed that it is after deduction of specific\nindirect taxes since otherwise consumption would bear an undue share of general indirect taxes.\nIf therefore we write :\n\nI; - specific indirect taxes on consumption\nIg - general indirect taxes\nI | \u2014 I;-- Ig \u2014 total indirect taxes\nP - national product\nW - war expenditures\n4 -\u2014 general indirect taxes falling on war expenditures\nthen\na \u2014l Wo\n*(P\u2014 n)\n\u2014 gl,\nand therefore\na(P \u2014 I)\nI \u2014\u2014wy\u2014.a\nFor 1941 in milliards of dollars\n\u00e1 \u2014 04\nP -\u2014 119.5\nI - 104\nW \u2014 i2\nSo that\nI -\u2014 73\nand\nIl \u2014 34\n\nFor 1939 and 1940 Ig was 6.2 and 6.8 while I, was 1.9 and 2.2 respectively.\n\nMy assumption was evidently not a good one. But in peace time this was not of great import-\nance since the greater part of I; had also to come off consumption.\n\nLet us now return to the two methods.

Sum of items 40 and 41.\n\nAPPENDIX II.\n\nIn the S.C.B. for august, 1942! an attempt is made to allocate indirect taxes, other than those\nspecifically on consumption goods, to the components of the national product. Since for my\npurposes it is necessary to make this allocation on the same basis in each country, I shall set out\nwhat seem to me to be the admissible solutions to this problem.?\n\nIt is convenient to distinguish between specific indirect taxes which are levied on a single\ncommodity, such as the tobacco duty, and general indirect taxes which fall, possibly in varying\ndegrees, on the whole of output. Examples of this class are, on the definitions employed in this\npaper; employers' contributions to social insurance, compulsory premiums paid under war risks\ninsurance schemes and local rates.\n\nAlthough not perfectly general, it is unlikely that any of these taxes have a very marked\neffect on relative prices and for this reason it might be convenient to regard them as direct taxes\npaid out of income rather than as indirect taxes to be deducted from the sales proceeds of output.*\n1f this treatment were adopted there would clearly be no problem of allocation since only specific\nindirect taxes would be left to be deducted from expenditure.\n\nLet us suppose however that we decide not to do this and so require to know the principles on\nwhich the allocation should be made. There are two quite distinct concepts which we may wish\nto measure. First, we may wish to determine the proportion of current factors of production used\nin producing investment goods (whether or not these be for the replacement of assets currently\nused up) and the remaining proportion of current factors used together with capital equipment in\nindustries producing consumption and government goods and services. Second, we may be\ninterested in the proportion of current factors used to produce additions to the stock of capital\non the one hand and to produce other goods and services including all capital goods necessary for\nreplacement purposes on the other.\n\nIf it is the first alternative that we are interested in then it is necessary first to distribute\ndepreciation allowances, etc., between gross investment and the remaining part of the gross\nnational expenditure at market prices less specific indirect taxes (assumed to fall only on con-\nsumption) and then to allocate general indirect taxes over these two parts of output. If we are\ninterested in the second, then we must simply allocate general indirect taxes between net invest-\nment and the remainder of the net national expenditure at market prices less specific indirect\ntaxes (assumed to fall only on consumption).\n\nThis distinction may be made clearer by an example. In it I shall assume, for want of\ninformation, that where any allocation is to be done in the case either of depreciation allowances or\nof general indirect taxes it may be done fro rata.\n\nE\n\n1 p. 15 statistical note to table I.\n\n1T am indebted to Mr. J. M. Fleming who, I think, was the first to see the correct line of\napproach here and to Mr. Meade for discussions on these questions.\n\n3 For a further discussion of the implications of this treatment in the case of social security\ncontributions, see pp. 2 and 3 above.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:24:12 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The definition depends\nmaterially on the assumption that each of the anticipated-receipts functions\nof the several entrepreneurs remains wnchanged throughout the period between\nthe initial and final factor price regimes.\n\nThe combinatorial laws developed in section 5 apply to al] types of index\nnumbers. Combined individual and joint anticipated-profits production-cost\nindices are calculated in keeping with formulae (5.2) and (5.3). Adhering to\nthe convention of denoting anticipated-profits production-cost indices by I, we\ncan make these formulae apply formally to the indices of the present section by\nintroducing bars over all /'s occurring in them.\n\nThe entrepreneur, avid for profits though he is, usually prefers safe\nmoderate short term gains to risky large long term ones. He feels there is a\nbottom to commodity prices and that he can generally command a minimum\nsum for given physical quantities of products ; whereas anticipated net profits,\ndepending as they do on future supply and demand, are highly uncertain. He is,\ntherefore, persuaded that his Jong term profits will be greater if at each turn he\nminimises the production cost of fixed physical quantities of products than if,\ntrusting to hypothetical estimates of the future, he minimises the cost of produc-\ning stated levels of (short term) anticipated net profits. Most people will agree\nthat this is a reasonable attitude to take. Accordingly, an entrepreneur's\nactivities are more likely to conform to section 4 than to the theory of the\npresent section. As a result, physical production-cost indices are likely to prove\nmore realistic and important than anticipated-profits production-cost indices.\n\n7.

R.R. as every female spends five years in the age group. It is\nseen that the 1938 G.R.R. is 0.905 against the figure of 0.897 given by the\nRegistrar-General, and the N.R.R. is 0.816 against the official figure of 0.805.\nThe discrepancy is due to the fact that the Registrar-General proceeds from a\nslightly different age distribution, and also that his life table shows a slightly\nheavier mortality than ours. However, the differences are not very large, and\nas our figures are only very rough estimates, they will serve. We note that the\nN.R.R. remained practically unchanged in 1939, but fell by about 5 per cent\nbetween 1939 and 1941. If the high level of births, which was shown in the\nfirst quarter of 1942 continues, the N.R.R. for that year will be higher than in\n1938, but there is no reason why births should continue at that level, and we\nwould do well to wait for further figures before assuming that fertility is\nstabilised.\n\nHowever, the net reproduction rates alone do not tell the whole story.\nThe war has brought an appreciable increase in marriages, and we should\nordinarily have expected an increase in the net reproduction rates, for the\nRegistrar-General's figures show that the average interval between marriage\nand first birth is less than two years for younger women. The fact that fertility\nhas actually decreased in r94r in spite of increased nuptiality, shows that\nnuptial fertility must have decreased rather more than is shown by the net\nreproduction rate. The high number of births in the first quarter of 1942 may\nsimply be a reflection of previous high nuptiality, and if this hypothesis is true\nthe reproduction rate may be expected to decrease heavily in the near future.\n\nWe therefore see that fertility has not so far shown any sign of remaining\nstable during the war. If the war lasts much longer, the number of ' unborn\ncasualties '\"\" will become larger and will have an important effect on the post-\nwar development of population. The optimism of the Registrar-General and\nof those associated with him seems to be unfounded. One cannot escape the\nconclusion that a decline in the population of this country is imminent, and\nthat it may assume disturbing proportions unless action is taken very soon.\n\nThe problem of formulating a population policy is beyond the scope of this\npaper. It is nevertheless clear that such a policy will have to be very compre-\nhensive, and involve extensive changes. Such changes will necessarily involve\ntreading on many people's toes, and one cannot help suspecting that the\ngovernment's reluctance to face the problems involved may be due to this\nfact. Nevertheless the present ostrich-like position in which people who refuse\nto face the facts find themselves, can only have disastrous consequences.\n\nLondon. E.

That is, they will lead to welfare expenditure, the\namount of which will be determined by the usual standard of profit maximisa-\ntion, though the forces involved are far too complex to allow any accurate\napproximation to that standard. Into this category falls the improvement of\nconditions with the aim of increasing the efficiency of labour (while wages\nremain unchanged or rise proportionately less than efficiency). Then, welfare\nexpenditure might be incurred as part of the selling expenditure of a firm.\nGood working conditions will help to increase sales to a socially interested body\nof consumers.! Finally, as we have shown, buying expenditure can take the\nform of welfare improvements.\n\nThese factors are summarised in the following list :\nA. Institutional Factors.\n\ni. Pressure from Trade Unions and other bodies.\n2. Benevolent motives on the side of employers.\nB. Economic Factors.\n\nI. Increase in the efficiency of labour.\n\n2. Selling expenditure.\n\n3. Buying expenditure.\n\nThis classification seems to me to have some practical bearing on welfare\npolicy in war-time. For three of the five factors listed above have lost much\nof their power under present conditions. With the prohibition of strikes,\nessential work orders and conscription of labour, the strategic position of\ntrade unions has been somewhat weakened. With increased purchasing power,\nlimited supplies and controlled prices, the factor '' selling expenditure \"' loses\nmost of its importance. And '' buying costs \"' are also less important in times\nwhen a large proportion of the labour supply is centrally controlled and cannot\nbe engaged in the usual ways.\n\nThus we see that some of the forces which induce welfare expenditure are\nnow '' out of order.\" There is therefore a strong case in favour of a legal\nimposition of welfare standards in order to secure satisfactory conditions of\nwork for the many thousands who are now in the war industries. This has\nalready been partly recognised by the Ministry of Labour which demands a\ncertain minimum amount of welfare conditions from every establishment that\nis scheduled under the Essential Works Order. But it seems the above points\nshow the necessity of introducing further minimum welfare standards for all\nindustrial establishments for the duration of the war, and a strict supervision\nof conditions by factory inspectors who might work in co-operation with shop\nStewards, trade unions and the new joint production committees.

For these are more suitable\nfor affording protection in the above defined sense; while those would have\nbeen more natural and more efficient had the monopolistic exploitation of\nforeigners been the primary aim.! In more recent times, changing the terms of\ntrade and creating employment were probably more important considerations\nwith public opinion and legislative bodies in determining tariff policy.\n\nVIII\n\nWe have tried to show in the foregoing that to impose tariffs on inter-\nnational trade is generally in the rational interest of single countries for more\nthan one reason. This does not conflict with the fact that free trade is the best\npolicy for the universe as a whole. For just as each entrepreneur's competitive\nbehaviour diminishes the profits of all entrepreneurs, so each single country's\neffort to increase its national welfare tends to diminish the welfare of all.\n\nFree trade leads to the best allocation (most efficient utilisation) of the\nworld's resources, provided that full employment is somehow ensured. It leads\nto a distribution of welfare among nations that, if ethically neutral, is at least\nbased on historically and geographically determined inequalities and not on\ninequalities of political and military power. Any corrections of this distribution\nthat may be considered necessary or just, are better made openly (preferably in\nkind), in the form of payments of tribute or assistance, than surreptitiously,\nunder the cloak of tariffs or barter agreements. That is a better guarantee of\neconomic efficiency and justice.\n\nBut it is not enough to declare the desirability of free trade and trust that\nenlightenment will bring it about: nor is it enough to create initial conditions\nfavourable to it: it must be imposed and enforced. Whether this should be\ndone with the aid of the more effective sanctions of a new League of Nations,\nor through the political prestige of a British Empire, or in any other way, is\nbeyond the economist's competence to decide. We can only tell that some form\nof compulsion is necessary to ensure free trade. The truth of this statement is\nattested by the past history of international trade as much as by our rationalisa-\ntion of it. Both show that independent states, in possession of their full\nsovereignty, will keep on erecting and raising tariffs in order to increase their\nshare of the world's resources, to achieve fuller employment, and to protect\ntheir growing industries. Of these three aims only the last is likely to be\nrealised ; the second will generally defeat itself as tariffs are erected all round ;\nwhereas the first will not only defeat itself but every country will actually be\nimpoverished as they all raise their tariffs. It is to guard against this general\nimpoverishment that free trade must be enforced and each country kept from\nseeking more than its share of the world's resources. Employment can be\nmaintained and infant industries subsidised by other means than protection.\nThis, from a single country's point of view, is probably the cheapest way of\nachieving those aims ; but it is against the general interest to let one country\ndo what would be detrimental to all if generally practised.\n\n1 This is in apparent contradiction with footnote ?, p. 95. But Mr. Lerner's demonstration\nthat the effects of import and export duties are identical in all respects only holds good of duties\nthat are levied at a uniform rate on all commodities.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:28:33 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "108 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nwould be an argument in favour of free trade. If however we recognise, as I\nthink we should, that specialisation among countries is to a large extent a\nmatter of historical accident, we would have to draw a different conclusion.\n\nSince the progress of our material welfare depends mainly on technical\nadvance, our civilisation offers the greatest rewards to industrial skill and\ntechnical ingenuity, and the nations specialising in these fields will inevitably\nlead, and agricultural nations lag behind. Hence, the best long-run policy a\nnation can pursue is to create an atmosphere favourable to industry and\ntechnical progress. But, it may be asked, if industry is more profitable than\nagriculture, why does it need special stimulus ? The answer to that question\ncan best be put in the language of external economies. The produce of industry\nconsists of goods and services sold for money, and of benefits for whose use no\ncharge can be made by their very nature, but which nevertheless contribute to\nthe social product. These benefits are called external economies from the\npoint of view of those benefited : they consist in the training of workers, the\ncreation of a labour market and of markets for bye-products, the stimulus\ngiven to transport facilities, the arousing of interest in science and engineering,\nand the like. In an industrial community, a new firm or industry will not only\ncontribute to, but also benefit by, the external economies already in existence.\nThe free benefits he makes use of repay, so to speak, the entrepreneur for\nhis free contribution to the community's welfare. No free benefits com-\npensate the first firm or industry to be established in an agricultural community\nfor the advantages it confers on the firms and industries to follow. Yet, those\nadvantages may be very important and valuable from society's point of view,\nand should be accounted for when calculating the firm's or industry's marginal\nproductivity. A firm's or industry's economic right to live, therefore, should\nbe based not on its private but its social marginal productivity, which takes\naccount of intangible factors! and products. In an industrial community these\ntwo are likely to cancel each other out, making private and social marginal\nproductivity approximately equal. In an agricultural economy the difficulties\nof beginning may make an industrial firm's private marginal productivity\nsignificantly lower than its social marginal productivity ; and to make up for\nthe difference, protection or the payment of subsidies is economically justified.\n\nThis is, I think, what writers like Carey, List, and Sch\u00fcller really meant.\nThe above argument shows that to extend public assistance to infant industries\nis economically fair and proper, provided it does no more than equate\nprivate to social marginal productivity. Tariffs are the cheapest way of giving\nsuch assistance from the point of view of the country imposing them, which\nadds yet another rational reason for imposing tariffs, at least in the special\ncase of industrially backward countries. This, of course, is not incompatible\nwith the fact that from the universe's point of view, direct subsidies, paid out\nof general taxation, would be more efficient.\n\nProtection, in this restricted and true sense of the word, was probably the\nmain factor motivating the first tariffs of capitalism. One gains that impression\nnot only when perusing the writings of early Continental and American writers\non the subject ; but also from the fact that the export duties of the mercantilist\n\n!

It is therefore an increasing function of the price of the\nindustry's output, and a diminishing function of the price of capital equipment\nand co-operating factors. Tariffs will affect the marginal efficiency of invest-\nment if they alter the relationship of these prices. The prices relevant here are\nthose including the tariff. Hence, an import duty raises the prices of the goods\non which it is imposed. To a lesser extent, it also raises those of their substitutes\nand lowers the prices of their complements. An import duty, therefore, will\nincrease the marginal efficiency of investment in industries producing goods\nidentical with or similar to those hit by the duty ; it will diminish the marginal\nefficiency of investment in industries that make \u00abse of such goods and that\nproduce goods complementary to them. This argument, therefore, together\nwith that of paragraph (3) of this section, does not enable us to make general\nstatements about the effect of tariffs on national welfare, though it is very\nimportant in considering the effects of farticular tariffs.\n\nVII.\n\nThe preceding argument, concerning the effect of duties on the marginal\nefficiency of investment, has an important bearing also on the secular aspects\nof the free trade versus protection controversy. First of all, it provides an\neconomic explanation of why England was for such a long time the champion\nof free trade. In eighteenth and nineteenth century England free trade, by\nlowering the price of labour? and raw materials, meant a higher rate of profit\nin industry, greater investment opportunities, more prosperity, and fuller\nemployment. It depressed agricultural production ; but possibilities of expan-\nSion being more restricted there, it increased national prosperity and income\non balance. In all other countries the situation was the reverse during the same\nperiod : it was protection that raised the marginal efficiency of investment in\nindustry and, may be, depressed agricultural production.? This is so because\nfree trade favours whichever line of activity is already best established in a\ncountry. If we believed that the division of labour among nations is the outcome\nof inherent and unalterable national and geographical characteristics, that\n\n1Cf. P. B. Whale: ''The Working of the Pre-War Gold Standard,\" Economica, N.S.,\nvol. 4, 1937.\n\n? Via cheapening foodstuffs, the primary wage good.\n\n3 | am doubtful about this last statement, because historically, the transition from agricul-\ntural to industrial production was invariably accompanied by drastic institutional changes, which\nprobably gave a stimulus to agricultural production more important than the depressing effect\ntaken account of by more formal analysis. Such a stimulant, for instance, must have been the\ntransition from barter to a money economy. By introducing the new habit of expressing welfare\nin terms of money, and thereby minimising the importance of those elements of welfare that\n\ncannot be so expressed (leisure, a comfortable life, etc.), it must have stimulated farmers to\nproduce more for the market.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:28:33 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

They are:\n(1) the value of imports net of tariffs; (2) the value of exports; (3) the shape\nof the propensity to save function ; and the two determinants of the level of\ninvestment activity ; (4) the rate of interest ; and (5) the marginal efficiency\nof investment.\n\n(1) The imposition or raising of tariffs always diminishes the \u00abe value of\nimports, and on that count always increases employment and income. It\nincreases them to the extent that is needed to raise the community's saving,\nand expenditure on imports (net of the tariff), by the amount of the initial\nfall of imports. The ratio between the value of additional income and the\nprimary fall of imports may be called the foreign multiplier. Its value is equal\nto that of the investment multiplier in the same economy.\n\n(2) The impact effect of tariffs to create an export surplus is sometimes\nsaid to be of short duration only. If it is based on the belief that exports\nautomatically tend to be equal to imports, that statement is wrong, as has been\nshown above. While trade is relatively free, that statement is also wrong if it\nis based on the consideration that one country's export surplus is the import\nsurplus of other countries, who may retaliate. For the argument of section IV\nabout the danger of retaliation holds good here just as much as it did there.\nexports, that may be due not so much to retaliation as to the existence\nabroad of the same motive to diminish imports (i.e. other countries, also suffer-\ning from depression, might have thought of the same way of relieving it). This\nargument also shows that our long-period theory of tariffs is not dependent on\nthe assumption that trade policies are determined by welfare considerations of\nthe kind discussed in section I. If the desire to increase employment and to stop\nimport surpluses and resulting depression were the sole motive force behind\nrising tariff walls, it would still be true that the rational behaviour of each\ncountry, aiming at fuller employment and greater internal prosperity, tends to\ndefeat that aim and only results in ever-mounting tariffs.\n\n(3) The form of the propensity to save function depends on the distribution\nof income ; for rich people generally save a larger proportion of their income\nthan the poor. Hence, we can say that the more unequal is its distribution, the\ngreater the proportion of the national income which will be saved. A change in\ntrade policy, therefore, will on this account tend to raise or to lower the level of\nemployment according as it makes the distribution of income less or more\nunequal. This is a purely economic argument in favour of trade policies that\ntend to make the distribution of income more equal.\n\n(4) Since tariffs always diminish the value of imports and do not directly\naffect that of exports, they always enhance the liquidity of the banking system\n\u2014or at least alleviate the drain on its reserves. Increased protection, therefore,\nwill always lead to lower interest rates, provided that the banking system\nallows its interest rate policy to be at all influenced by its liquidity. But too\nmuch importance should not be attached to this as a factor stimulating\nemployment. Our preoccupation with the rate of interest is probably explained\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:28:33 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

As such it is more efficient than, say, the reparations\nimposed in the Versailles treaties were, because it presents no transfer problem.\nOn the other hand it imposes tribute in a veiled form, and is therefore less open\nto the critical scrutiny of public opinion.\n\nVI.\n\nSo far we have been concerned with the theory of tariffs on the classical\nassumption of full (or a given level of) employment. We now proceed to con-\nsider the effect of tariffs on employment ; such effect to be added to or sub-\ntracted from the effects of tariffs on national welfare hitherto discussed. For\nan increase in employment increases national welfare in exactly the same way\nas a. tariff does when the foreigners' reciprocal demand is inelastic. It increases\nthe quantity of all goods except that of involuntary idleness, and thus makes\nit possible for everybody to be better off than he was before, whatever the\ndistribution of welfare. Before examining how tariffs affect employment,\nhowever, it will be necessary shortly to recapitulate the theory of employment\nin a closed community.\n\nIt is generally agreed to-day among economists that it is most convenient\nto think of the level of employment as being determined by the equality of\ninvestment and saving. If we consider investment activity in the short period\nas a datum\u2014a convention based on the consideration that capital equipment,\nhaving the longest gestation period, is the commodity whose rate of production\nis least dependent on present and most irrevocably determined by past\ndecisions\u2014employment and income must be such as to make saving equal to\ninvestment. The function showing the proportion of income the community\nsaves out of each level of income is called the propensity to save function. If\nits form is approximately linear, the process by which additional investment\ngenerates additional income can be illustrated by an infinite geometric pro-\ngression, well known as the theory of the multiplier.\n\nIn a closed community saving must equal investment in short-period\nequilibrium, because that is the condition for the equality of anticipated and\nrealised receipts in current production. In an open economy, the condition for\nshort-period equilibrium is still the equality of anticipated and realised receipts\nin domestic current production. But since in the latter case there are two\nalternatives to spending on home produced goods: saving, and spending on\nimported goods ; and the receipts of domestic producers originate not only in\ndomestic expenditure but also in exports, it follows that, in an open economy,\nthe condition for short-period equilibrium is the equality between the sum of\nimports and saving and the sum of exports and investment. In other words,\nan open economy has no inherent short-run tendency to equate either saving\nwith investment or exports with imports ; but only to make the discrepancies\nin these two equal to each other.! Only to the extent that the central bank\nallows changes in its reserves (caused by the export or import surplus) to\ninfluence its interest rate policy, and to the extent that this affects investment\n\n1Cf.

Anyone acquainted with the derivation of offer curves from\nindifference maps will see at once that the tangent to the two indifference\ncurves going through 5, is the locus of all such initial situations; for it is the\nlocus of the origin of all pairs of offer curves that intersect in 5. It follows\nfrom this that the barter agreement leading to f, is equivalent in its effect to\nfree trade between the two countries, after the payment of a tribute from A\nto B that brings them from the origin of the barter diagram to any point of\nthe tangent drawn through $,. In the figure, the new offer curves are drawn\n(broken line) from o' as origin, assuming that the tribute is paid in terms of y.\nBut the tribute could just as well be paid in terms of x, bringing the origin of\nthe offer curves\u2014still intersecting in $,\u2014 to o\"; or it could be paid in any\ncombination of x and y, as long as the rate of transformation between them\nremained equal to the slope of the indifference curves tangential to each other\nin /,. Barter trade agreements, therefore, represent the exploitation of one\ncountry by the other, just as tariffs do; but with the difference that to the\nextent that they bring the trading point nearer the contract curve, they are\nmore efficient.\n\nSo far we have only considered barter trade agreements that are volun-\ntarily entered into and therefore do not increase the exploitation of one country\nby the other but only render existing exploitation more efficient. If, however,\none of the countries can bring political or military pressure to bear on the\nother country, it can force it into a barter agreement that brings them onto a\ntrading point outside the area enclosed by the indifference curves going through\nthe point reached under existing trading conditions (5,). In an extreme case,\na barter agreement may bring the trading point outside the indifference curves\ngoing through the origin of the barter diagram (not drawn in the figure),\nindicating that trade under such circumstances would be worse for the exploited\ncountry than no trade at all.? Barter agreements, of course, need not neces-\nsarily be efficient in the sense of leading to the contract curve. They do, if\nafter their conclusion the relative prices of the bartered goods are the same in\nthe two countries ;? and \u00a3e conformity of that brice vatio in the two countries 1s\nan index of the efficiency of the agreement.\n\nTo sum up the above argument, barter trade agreements are a method for\none country to exploit another, more efficient potentially than tariffs. They\nare equivalent to free trade $/us the payment of a tribute from one country to\nanother, if efficient.A A barter agreement may be to mutual advantage if it\nsupersedes protective tariffs, provided that it does not increase already existing\nexploitation but merely makes it more efficient. To the extent that it increases\nthe degree of exploitation, it may be regarded as a method of turning political\nascendancy to economic account by exacting tribute from defeated conquered\n\n1! In Fig. 4 the intersection of the axes of the two indifference maps gives the total quantity\nof the two goods jointly possessed by A and B, while the origin of the barter diagram itself shows\ntheir initial distribution between \u00c0 and B. Cf. A. L. Bowley: Mathematical Groundwork of\nEconomics, Oxford, 1924, for the best description of such a diagram.\n\n? In a happier age, Edgeworth and Marshall have not even drawn the contract curve beyond\nthese limits.\n\n?

So in either case, heterogeneous\ncompetition leads through the rational behaviour of each competitor to\n** paucilateral'\" and bilateral monopoly ; and tariff autonomy will, in time,\ngive way to tariff clubs and bilateral trade agreements.\n\nV.\n\nBilateral trade agreements are a matter of higgling and bargaining and\nhave little interest for the economist. Nevertheless, it may be worth our while\nto make a short digression and discuss barter agreements, a special form of\nthem, which has recently acquired some importance. Barter trade agreements\nnot only set the terms on which indefinite amounts of goods are to be traded\nfor each other, but also fix the exact amounts to be exchanged. They have\nbeen introduced by Nazi Germany in her trade with South American and\nSouth-East European countries, and declared by a Nazi spokesman to be the\nprinciple on which trade in Hitler's '* New Order \" would be based. Since by\ntheir very nature they overrule all existing tariffs, it is to be expected that\nthey should be able both to improve and to worsen the situation they replace.\nWe set out to prove that barter agreements may be to the mutual advantage\nof countries whose trade was previously conducted across tariff walls; but\nthat at the same time they are a convenient way of exacting tribute from\nconquered or intimidated countries.\n\nLet us draw a pair of Marshallian offer curves belonging to countries A\nand B, and assume that owing to the existence of trade barriers between them,\ntheir trading point is not at the intersection of the offer curves but, say, at\npoint 2, (Fig. 4). We shall not bother to draw the two tariff-distorted offer\ncurves that intersect at that point. The two countries' community indifference\ncurves going through $, and corresponding to their distributions of income\nbrought about by this particular set of tariffs intersect one another, as shown\nin the figure, since they could not be tangential under any combination of\ntariffs. That means, however, that a new trade agreement bringing the\ntrading point within the area enclosed by the two indifference curves would\nbe likely to be beneficial to both countries.\n\nThe qualification '' likely \" is that accompanying all arguments based on\ncommunity indifference curves. For, if the new trade agreement resulted in a\nvery drastic redistribution of income as between social classes in either or both\ncountries, either or both of the indifference curves pertaining to the agreement\nmight intersect the corresponding indifference curve or curves going through\n$,, and therefore not signify an increase in national welfare. After this last\nwarning we shall leave it to the reader to make the qualifications incumbent on\nthe use of community indifference curves and proceed for the rest of this\nargument pretending that each country is a single person. That will simplify\nthe argument considerably, without qualifying its results more than turning\nthem from certain into probable statements. We also wish to emphasise once\nmore that the intersection of community indifference curves cannot reverse\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:28:33 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

That the two\nassumptions have nothing to do with each other is well known ; and the\nimportance of keeping them strictly apart has recently been emphasised.!\nThe difference\u2014real and supposed l\u2014between a country's produce and its\nforeign substitutes determines the elasticity of the foreigners' reciprocal\ndemand, and hence the size of the optimum initial tariff and of subsequent\ntariff raises. The more perfectly identical are in the estimation of foreigners\ntheir substitutes for our country's produce, the more elastic will be their\ndemand for its exports, and the smaller will be the tariff it can profitably\nimpose upon foreign trade. If foreigners produced perfect substitutes, their\nreciprocal demand would be perfectly elastic? and the optimum tariff rate\nwould be zero, and would remain zero even after other countries have imposed\ntariffs of their own. Perfect competition refers to this limiting case alone.\n\nAt this stage we may attempt to sketch a long-period theory of inter-\nnational trade. Imagine an initial situation where trade is free, or at least\ntariffs are low and the most-favoured-nation clause is in vogue ; and where\neach country trades with most of the others, and there is some triangular trade.\nCountries that believe themselves to be sufficiently small to erect or raise\ntariffs unpunished will do so as soon as they discover that they can thereby\nincrease their national welfare. When a number of countries have followed this\ncourse, those still on a free trade basis will find themselves monopolistically\nexploited and will be perfectly justified in saying that they are being forced\ninto erecting tariff walls too. That they can thereby improve their position\nwe have shown above; and this should be as obvious as that a mono-\npolistically exploited consumer can improve his position by charging mono-\npolistic prices in his capacity of producer.\n\nWhen tariff walls have been erected all round, those who started the\nprocess will find some of their initial advantage gone ; but they are also likely\nto find that they can improve their position by raising tariffs further, even if\ninitially they made full use of their monopolistic position. As tariff walls rise,\nconferences on international trade may be called to arrest the process, which is\nobviously harmful to all concerned. Yet, as long as it remains in the individual\ninterest of each country separately to raise tariffs, such collective attempts are\nbound to be ineffectual if not backed by international sanctions ; just as cartel\nagreements are ineffectual if there is not a large producer with enough authority\nto enforce them.\n\nAs tariff walls mount and international trade dwindles, the number of\ncountries each country trades with will diminish. That will tend to destroy\nthe atomistic nature of international trade and lend increasing reality to the\ndanger of retaliation. In other words, it will lead to the realisation of the\ninterdependence of the various countries' tariff policies. That may cause the\nmost-favoured-nation clause to fall into disuse and tariffs to be determined\nby bargaining, before equilibrium had been reached. If, on the other hand,\n\n1Cf.

The low value of the income-elasticity of the demand for\ntobacco may be accidental, but the fact that it lies below unity is not as\nparadoxical as it may seem at first sight.\n\nThe five groups ''Transportation,\" ''Other household operations,\"\n\"' Recreation,\" \" Clothing \" and '' Miscellaneous \" which have the highest\nincome-elasticities have at the same time necessarily a price-elastic demand, if\nwe can trust our method. They are the only goods having a price-elastic\ndemand, if 4 \u2014 o.14, a case which seems quite plausible. Again it seems\nhighly probable that A \u2014 r, as otherwise the demand for each good would be\nprice-elastic. But, as emphasised, this cannot be decided on ground of the\nfamily budget data which fit equally well all these possibilities.\n\nFinally, a few critical remarks on the significance of the results may not\nbe out of place. As already stated, the elasticity of demand shows the change\nin demand in consequence of a price change, after such a time has passed that\na new equilibrium is established. The short run effects may be different, as\ntotal expenditure need not always be equal to income. For certain income-\nlevels, especially for high ones, it is even doubtful whether this equality exists\nor will be established within a measurable period. The crucial point seems\ntherefore to lie rather more in the well-known assumption (II) than in the\nassumptions (III) or (IIIa) which are peculiar to the present analysis.\n\nFor these and other reasons, it is obvious that we cannot expect to obtain\nexact results by the simple method developed here. But it is suggested that\nthe method gives a fair approximation and a useful check to results derived in\nother ways.\n\nCambridge. C. E. V.

The price of Y will rise if X and Y are substitutes, fall if they are\ncomplementary.\" In respect of the indirect effects through third markets this\n\" rule \" will also hold true.! In fact, it is taken as one of the '' rules about the\nway in which the price system will react to changes in tastes and resources.\"'?\n\nThis application of the '' rule \" appears startling. Have we not been told\nthat by definition the demand for complements always works in the same\ndirection as that for X ? How is it possible that an increased demand for X\nshould effect a fall in the price of its complement Y ? Apparently refuge is\ntaken in the assumption that the demands and supplies for all other commodi-\nties, whether complements or substitutes, are being unaffected.? Yet, far from\nbeing helpful this assumption renders the analysis all the more abtruse, if not\nunintelligible. For, in the first place, even if we granted this assumption, how\ncould it be that the prices of complements and substitutes would move in\nopposite direction ? If the increased demand for X acts upon X alone, and not\nupon others, the prices of all these latter should move, if at all, in the same\ndirection, i.e. tend to fall. Then there would be no point of differentiating goods\ninto complements and substitutes at all.\n\nBut the objection goes deeper than that. After all, is this assumption\nlegitimate ? Does it involve contradiction to the very definition laid down for\ncomplementarity ? At one place, Professor Hicks points out that the effect as\nenvisaged by the \"' rule \" may frequently be masked '' in practice by a simultan-\neous rise in the demand for these complementary commodities.\"^ But is this\nsimultaneous rise in demand for complements not a necessary condition of\ncomplementarity by definition ? The common instance of tennis rackets and\ntennis balls as complementary to each other well demonstrates that increased\ndemand for one necessarily entails increased demand for the other.5 In another\nplace, it is said that as a result of the increased demand for X, the '' fall in the\nprices of the complements will in its turn increase the demand for them (and\ntherefore for X itself).'* Then is it justifiable that whereas this increased\ndemand (itself a secondary effect) for the complements consequent upon the\nfall in their prices is permitted to communicate to the demand for X, the\ninitial increase in demand for X is assumed to be confined to itself alone ?\n\nThe present writer believes that in considering these price changes we must\ndifferentiate the case where the initial cause of disturbance is a change in the\nrice of X from the other in which the initial cause is a change in demand. In\nthe first case, Professor Hicks' rule holds: the price movements of X and Y\nwill be in opposite direction when they are complementary, and in the same\ndirection when they are substitutes. In the second case, however, assuming\n\n! Value and Capital, p. 42-5. Income effects are abstracted in this analysis.\n\n? Ibid, p. 74 ; see also p. 106\n\n* Ibid, p. 62.\n\n* Ibid, p. 73.

The simultaneous rise of the price of the comple-\nment follows from definition.? As to substitutability, assuming (as Professor\nHicks does) the expenditure of this group of consumers on other goods has nof\nbeen curtailed, the prices for substitutes will also tend to rise as a result of a\nshift, by the erstwhile marginal buyers of X and Y, of their expenditure to\npurchases of these substitutes. In any case there will be a relative rise of the\nprices of X and Y as compared with the prices of substitutes. Looking at the\nmatter this way, an increase in demand, if of considerable importance, for any\ngood or group of goods may produce an upward effect upon prices in general.?\nThe increased expenditure for X as well as for Y being financed apparently\nfrom dishoarding, and not through diminished demand for other goods, such\nan up-lifting effect on prices in general need not appear strange as it is in fact\nwell-established in monetary theory. But is there any reason to hold the effect\nin the first case any more than that in the second as the '\"' rule \" for price\nbehaviour of complements and substitutes ?\n\nIf the foregoing analysis is valid, then it may be suggested that not only\nwill the '' rules about the way in which the price system will react to changes\nin zastes and resources \" be modified, but the conditions for the stability in\nmultiple exchange must also be reconsidered.

REviEw or Ecowowuic SruDpirEs, October, 1940). But it is clear that\nProfessor Lange's note, and Professor Hicks' reply had not penetrated to\nChungking when Professor Li wrote his note.

                    "88 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nbuted as to make the distribution of welfare similar to that of the second\nsituation.\n\nVIII\n\nMr. Kaldor and Professor Hicks have asserted that it is always possible:to\ntell whether a given change improves general welfare, even if not all people\ngain by it and some lose. The test suggested by them : to see whether it is\npossible after the change fully to compensate the losers at a cost to those\nfavoured that falls short of their total gain, is fundamentally identical with\nthe first of our two criteria. The objection to using this criterion by itself is that\nit is asymmetrical, because it attributes undue importance to the particular\ndistribution of welfare obtaining before the contemplated change. If the\ngovernment had a special attachment to the s/atus quo before the change and\nwould actually undertake to reproduce that welfare distribution by differential\ntaxation after the change, then Mr. Kaldor's test would be sufficient. For then,\nthe economist could regard that particular welfare distribution as the only\nrelevant one and would be entitled to use it as his sole standard of reference.\nBut in the absence of such a governmental policy there can be no justification\nin attaching greater importance to the welfare distribution as it was before\nthan as it is after the change.\n\nTo illustrate the pitfalls of this one-sided criterion, imagine a change, say\nthe imposition of a duty on imports, that brings the welfare of 4 and B from\nP, (Fig. 2) on the contract curve of diagram r onto m; on the contract curve of\ndiagram 2. According to Mr. Kaldor's test this change is desirable, because by\nredistributing income we could travel from z, along the v curve to z,, which\nis superior to P,. But once the tariff has been imposed and situation m estab-\nlished, it will be free trade and the resulting (original) situation P, that will\nappear preferable by the same test, because starting from P,, income could be so\nredistributed (travelling along the PP curve in the first diagram this time) as\nto reach Ps, which is superior to v. So the two situations can be shown each\nto be preferable to the other by the identical criterion : an absurd result, which\ncan only be avoided by using our double criterion.\n\nWashington, D.C. T. pnE Scrrovszkv.\n\n! We say that the distribution of welfare is similar in two situations if every member of the\ncommunity prefers the same situation. A more exact definition would be unnecessary for our\npurposes; besides, it is also impossible, since welfare cannot be measured.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:39:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

If the first is\npossible and the second impossible, we shall say that the new situation is better\nthan the old was. If the first is impossible but the second possible, we shall say\nthat the new situation is worse; whereas if both are possible or both are\nimpossible, we shall refrain from making a welfare proposition.!\n\nWe can illustrate this procedure in Fig. 2 for the special case when allocat-\ning efficiency is at its optimum both before and after the change. Each situation\ncan then be represented by a point on its respective contract curve and com-\npared with the corresponding point on the other contract curve. If both points\nlie to the left of P, on their respective contract curves, the change will increase\ngeneral welfare, because starting from the new situation on the second diagram's\ncontract curve it is always possible to travel along that curve by redistributing\nincome and arrive at a point which is superior to the initial situation from\neverybody's point of view ; whereas starting from the initial situation on the\nfirst diagram's contract curve, it is impossible by travelling along that curve\nto reach a position superior to the new situation. If on the other hand, both\npoints lie to the right of the common point P,, the change can be said to diminish\ngeneral welfare on the same reasoning ; while if one point lies to the left and the\nother to the right, we can make no welfare propositions relative to our group.\n\nVII\n\nOur two criteria for making welfare propositions bear a close resemblance\nto Paasche's and Laspeyre's formulae in the theory of cost of living index\nnumbers. There, just as here, the difficulty lies in comparing averages whose\nweighting is different ;? and the solution is sought in comparing the two real\nsituations not one with another, but each with a hypothetical situation, which\nresembles it in weighting but is otherwise identical with the other real situation.\nIn the theory of index numbers, budgets of different dates or places are com-\npared each with the cost of the identical bundle of commodities at the prices\nof the other date or place; and these two comparisons, expressed as ratios\n(Paasche's and Laspeyre's formulae), are the limits within which the true\ndifference in the cost of living must lie.? In welfare problems, of course, we can\naim neither at a \"' true \" answer nor at its quantitative expression without\nmeasuring satisfaction and comparing different people's. But our two criteria\nare exactly analogous to Paasche's and Laspeyre's formulae. For we compare\nthe first welfare situation with what general welfare would be if the satisfaction,\nyielded by the physical income of the second situation were distributed as it\nwas in the first ; and contrast the second situation with the welfare that the\nfirst situation's physical income would yield to each person if it were so distri-\n\n1 It need hardly be recalled that in the situation discussed in section 5\u2014that is, when the\nquantities of goods and services all change in the same direction\u2014this last case can never occur,\nand we can always make welfare propositions.\n\n? Because the general welfare can be conceived of as average welfare.\n\n* Cf. Henry Schultz: '' A Misunderstanding in Index Number Theory,\" Econometrica, vol. 7\n\n(1939), P. 1; and A. A.

Imagine members of a com-\nmunity divided into two groups according to their preference for goods Y and X\nrespectively.! Then assume a change that increases the quantity of Y and\ndiminishes that of X, but leaves the distribution of money income between\nour two groups unaffected. From the point of view of individuals, the change\nwill appear as a shift in relative prices ; which, given the distribution of income,\nwill be likely to make those with a special preference for Y better off, and those\nwith a liking for X worse off, than they were before. Assume next that the\nmembers of our first group are rich and those of the second poor. Then the gain\nof the first group expressed in money (or in terms of any single commodity)\nwill be greater than the money equivalent of the loss suffered by the second\ngroup. Therefore, if we so redistributed income as to restore approximately\nthe initial distribution of welfare, there would be a net gain, making members of\nboth groups better off than they were before. Conversely, if the people favoured\nby the change were poor, and those prejudiced by it were rich, the money\nequivalent of the former's gain would be insufficient fully to compensate the\nlatter's loss, so that a redistribution of income tending to restore the initial\ndistribution of welfare would result in a net loss of satisfaction for everybody.\n\nWhat significance are we to attach to this case ? To refrain altogether, as\nthe classical economists did, from making welfare propositions relating to it,\nseems unduly restrictive. It is true that as we have seen such a change would\nimprove general welfare for some welfare distributions and worsen it for others ;\non the other hand, we are not interested in all possible welfare distributions.\nThere are only two distributions of welfare that really matter. Those actually\nobtaining immediately before and after the change contemplated.? It seems\ntherefore sufficient to concentrate on these and to investigate how the change\nwould affect general welfare if it were to leave the distribution of welfare\nunaffected and if that were both before and after it, first what it actually is\nbefore, secondly what it actually is after, the change. Whenever these two\ncomparisons yield identical results, we can make welfare propositions of almost\nthe same generality and significance as the allocative welfare propositions of\nthe classical economists; especially since the identical results for the two\nwelfare distributions imply a strong presumption in favour of the same result\nholding for all intermediate welfare distributions as well.\n\nWe propose, therefore, to make welfare propositions on the following\nprinciple. We must first see whether it is possible in the new situation so to\nredistribute income as to make everybody better off than he was in the initial\nsituation ; secondly, we must see whether starting from the initial situation it\n\n1 The term '' preference \"' is used in a loose sense. It denotes the whole shape of indifference\nsurfaces and not only their slope at the relevant point, which in equilibrium conditions is the\nsame for everybody.\n\n? The reader's attention is called to the fact that in reality the distribution of income is not\ngiven as we have assumed in the argument above. As a rule, the change will affect the distribution\nof welfare not only by shifting relative prices but also by boosting some industries and depressing\nothers, and thereby redistributing money income.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:39:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

From the fact that the second\ndiagram's .contract curve is superior to that of the first, it follows that the\nlatter can be represented on the second diagram by tracing the locus of the\npoints of intersection of all the indifference curves that in the first diagram are\ntangential to each other. This will give us a curve on each side of the second\ndiagram's contract curve, and the area between them represents welfare\npositions that are superior to the first diagram's contract curve. Hence, a\nchange that brings the welfare of our groups from a point of the first diagram's\ncontract curve onto a point of the second diagram's contract curve (or at least\nwithin the area between the broken lines), can be said to be desirable with the\nsame generality and significance with which perfect competition or direct\ntaxation are said to be desirable on the ground of their allocating efficiency.\nIn other words, while it need not actually improve everybody's position, it\nwould do so for every possible distribution of welfare if the change tere to leave\nthat distribution unaffected.\n\nThe above argument is an explicit formulation of the statement that\ngetting more of some (or all) commodities at no cost of foregoing others is a\ngood thing. This may be considered as overpedantic, since that statement seems\nto be obvious; on the other hand, it is subject to the same limitations that\nqualify allocative welfare propositions (cf. section 3 above) ; and besides, it is\nnot even always true. Increased plenty is a good thing only if it is not linked\nwith a redistribution of welfare, too retrogressive from the point of view of\nsocial justice ; and if it does not lead to a serious deterioration of the allocating\nefficiency of the economic system. For the former there exists no objective\ncriterion, but there is a simple test for the latter. To test whether a diminution\nin allocating efficiency has not obviated the advantages of increased plenty, we\nmust see if after the change, it is possible fully to compensate people prejudiced\nby it out of funds levied on those favoured by the change, without thereby\ncompletely eliminating the latter's gain.

The former may be due to the\nimposition of a duty on international trade, which from the point of view of an\nindividual country alters the quantities of imports and retained. exports\navailable for home consumption ; while the latter may be caused by this or any\nother change, if it affects the propensity to save or the inducement to invest\nand thereby changes employment. Analytically there is no difference between\nthe two cases. In both, the quantities of resources available for consumption\nare changed, hence the relative position of the indifference maps is altered ;\nwhence it follows that welfare propositions in the wider sense must involve the\ncomparison of two diagrams. Since these are constructed from the identical\ntwo indifference maps and differ only in the latter's relative position to each\nother, such comparisons are not the hopeless task they might seem at first sight.\nFor we can represent some (not all) welfare positions on both diagrams ; and\nit is possible to represent on one diagram the welfare positions corresponding\nto all those points of the other diagram's contract curve that are inferior to its\n** own \" contract curve. This follows from the fact that our diagrams admit\nthe representation of all welfare situations that are inferior (worse from the\npoint of view of at least one of the two persons) to their contract curve, while\nwelfare positions superior to the contract curve cannot be represented on them.\n\nOur welfare propositions may necessitate the comparison of points on the\ncontract curves of the two diagrams, or of points suboptimal to them, or of a\npoint on one contract curve with a point suboptimal to the other contract\ncurve. The first case is that where the system's allocating efficiency is at an\noptimum both before and after the given change; the second, where it is\nsuboptimal both before and after the change; the third, where the change\naffects allocating efficiency. Taking an example from the theory of inter-\nnational trade, the first case may be illustrated by the imposition of an import\nduty by a country in which taxation is direct and domestic markets are per-\nfectly competitive ;* the second case can be represented by a duty imposed in\na monopolistic world ; and the third by a duty which favours the formation of\nmonopolies or is linked with an excise tax on the home production of import\nsubstitutes.\n\nV\n\nLet us draw two diagrams (Fig: 1r), both consisting of the superposed\nindifference maps of individuals A and B, but with the difference that in the\nsecond, B's map has been shifted by opop ; so that the joint possessions of 4\nand B have increased by xqx, of X and yoy, of Y compared with what they were\nin the first. This shift will bring into a position of tangency indifference curves\nthat in the first diagram have neither touched nor intersected, and will thus\nmake the second diagram's contract curve superior to that of the first diagram\nthroughout its range. This follows from that fundamental postulate of economic\n\n1 A tariff on foreign trade is not incompatible with the tariff imposing country's domestic\ntrade and production being of optimum allocating efficiency. The reader must not let himself be\nconfused by the fact that similar diagrams have been used for illustrating the waste caused by\ntariffs from the point of view of the universe as a whole. We are here solely concerned with the\n\neffects of a tariff on the welfare of a single country, consequently the indifference maps that\nconstitute our diagrams belong to inhabitants of the same country.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:39:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "A NOTE ON WELFARE PROPOSITIONS IN ECONOMICS 79\nIII\n\nWe have: seen above that allocative welfare propositions are based on the\ncriterion of economic efficiency. They state that of alternative situations,\nbrought about by different institutions or courses of policy, one is superior to\nthe other in the sense that it would make everybody better off for every\ndistribution of welfare, 7f that were the same in the two situations. This is\ndifferent from saying that one situation is actually better than the other from\neverybody's point of view, because a change in institutions or policy almost\nalways redistributes welfare sufficiently not to have a uniform effect on every-\nbody but to favour some people and prejudice others. It follows from this that\neconomic welfare propositions cannot as a rule be made independently of\ninterpersonal comparisons of utility.\n\nIt would hardly be satisfactory, however, to confine the economist's value\njudgments to cases where one situation is superior to the other from the point\nof view of everybody affected. It is doubtful if in practice any choice comes\nwithin this category ; besides, there would not be much point in soliciting the\neconomist's expert opinion when everybody is unanimous, except in order to\nenlighten people as to their true interest.\n\nFavouring an improvement in the organisation of production and exchange\nonly when it is accompanied by a corrective redistribution of income fully com-\npensating those prejudiced by it might seem to be a way out of the difficulty,\nbecause such a change would make some people better off without making\nanyone worse off. For instance, it might be argued that the abolition of the\nCorn Laws should not have been advocated by economists in their capacity of\npure economists without advocating at the same time the full compensation of\nlandowners out of taxes levied on those favoured by the cheapening of corn.\nYet, in a sense, and regarded from a long-run point of view, such propositions\nare not independent of value judgments between alternative income distribu-\ntions either. For, going out of their way to preserve the existing distribution\nof income, they imply a preference for the s/atus quo.\n\nThere seem to be two solutions of the problem. First of all, in addition to\nadmitting his inability to compare different people's satisfaction, the economist\nmay postulate that such comparisons are impossible, and that therefore there\nis nothing to choose between one distribution of income and another. He may\nthen make value judgments on the sole criterion of efficiency without bothering\nabout concomitant shifts in the distribution of income, since he considers one\nincome distribution as good as any other. In this case, however, he cannot\nclaim that his value judgments are independent of interpersonal utility com-\nparisons,-because they depend on the assumption of their impossibility.\n\nSecondly, the economist may put forward his welfare propositions with due\n\n1'This, I think, was the attitude of the classical economists ; at least of those who did not,\nlike Bastiat, impute ethical values to the distribution of income under perfect competition. It\nseems to be the correct interpretation of that fairly representative statement of Cairnes': ''...\nstandards of abstract justice . . . are inefficacious as means of solving the actual problems of . . .\ndistribution. . . . If our present system of industry (perfect competition) is to be justified, it\nmust . . . find its justification . . . in the fact that it secures for the mass of mankind a greater\namount of material and moral well-being, and provides more effectively for its progress in civilisa-\ntion than any other plan,\"\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:39:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Attempts to rationalise retail trade (begun at the\nend of the \" New Economic Policy \"\") were resumed during the First Five Year\nPlan, apparently with fairly satisfactory partialresults. But on the whole these\nefforts were nullified in their effects by the inherent deficiencies of rationing.\n\nIn connection with wholesale trade Party and Government adopted a\nnumber of measures with a view to counteracting '' Leftist \" practices. The\nrevival of wholesale trade assumed three main forms: (r) the organisation of\nspecialised wholesale supply bases under the charge of the various productive\nCommissariats ; (2) the formation of wholesale centres for the express purpose\nof facilitating the sale of ' non-deficit \" goods; and (3) the setting-up of\ninter-regional universal wholesale bases of the co-operative and State trade\nsystems. The Authorities also tried to bring about a more even distribution of\nthe wholesale network, so as to avoid the concentration of wholesale trade in\nbig cities and in regions where the commodities were actually produced.\n\nThe economic measures to mitigate the hardships caused by the shortage\nof goods were based on the belief that, although the paucity of consumers'\ngoods in relation to the soaring demands of the population was unavoidable\nunder the period of industrialisation, the output of consumers' goods could be\nincreased by methods of enhancing the utilisation of the existing resources\n(local supply, Kolkhoz and bazaar trade, decentralised collections, expansion\nof handicraft co-operatives in local centres of raw-materials, fostering of small-\nscale fishing, production of consumers' goods out of waste material from the\nheavy industries, etc.)\n\nEfforts were also being made in the direction of diminishing intra-industrial\nconsumption by means of rationalising production and cutting down unreasonable\nand excessive demands, especially as regards working clothes and footwear. In\nthe course of 1932 the Authorities succeeded in bringingabout a slight reduction\nof intra-industrial consumption anda corresponding increase in '' market-funds.\"\"\n\nLastly, the Government and the Communist Party began to take steps\nto narrow, as much as possible, the number of commodities and commodity\ngroups under rationing. The Joint Appeal of the Central Committee of the\nC.P.S.U., the Soviet of People's Commissars and the Central Co-operative\nUnion, dated May r2th, 1931, which scourged the utopian schemes to proceed\nat once to direct commodity distribution and which warned co-operative\nofficials not to interpret the elimination of private trade as the elimination of\ntrade as a whole, succeeded in stopping the tendency to widen the range of\nrationed goods and after that date the number of such goods began to diminish,\nthough it remained high enough in the course of the second half of 1931. In\nApril, 1932, Party and Government published a decree according to which\nthe number of rationed foodstuffs was reduced from thirteen to six, viz., bread,\ngroats, sugar, meat, herrings, animal and vegetable fats. This number remained\nunaltered until January, 1935, when the scheme was, in the main, terminated.\n\nA somewhat clearer picture of the attitude of the Soviet State towards\nthe functions of distribution and the relation between production and con-\nsumption will, we hope, emerge when we come to pass under review the\nde-rationing of Soviet trade.\n\nGlasgow.

(Since in the\nactual system the working day is likely to shorten, this relative lengthening of\nthe working day in the reference system may not amount to an absolute one.)\nBut if output increases more rapidly than the available labour, unemploy-\nment in the reference system will disappear and an absolute lengthening of the\nworking day will become necessary. This, however, would be resisted by trade\nunions and a further rise in output would be prevented by scarcity of labour.\nThis. makes clear the point that although technical progress does not promote\nby its '' pure \" effect an increase in outp\u00fct, in certain cases it clears the ground\nfor it by overcoming the scarcity of labour.\n\nIt is further important to state that the features of technical progress from\nwhich we abstracted in order to obtain its '' pure \"' effect are by no means\nunimportant. For instance the Industrial Revolution did increase output\nbecause the tremendous outburst of new inventions and their applications\ncreated a. '' secular boom.\" (In our reference system there would correspond to\nit an equivalent wave of optimism.) But the significance of our theorem is to\nshow that technical progress influences output only through the channels of\ninvention stimulus, oligopoly, and the general price level (or by overcoming the\nscarcity of labour.)\n\n2. Another problem of this type is that of the ratio of output to capital.\nIf in the actual system the utilisation of equipment is not increasing\u2014and such\nseems to be the case in reality\u2014there must occur a permanent fall in the ratio\nof output to capital. But this does not mean that the capital using type of\ntechnical progress is responsible for this change. For the same fall of the ratio\nof output to capital occurs in the reference system, taking there the form of\ndiminishing utilisation of equipment. Thus there must exist some factors other\nthan the fall in the ratio of capacity to capital which account for the fall of the\nratio of output to capital both in the actual and in the reference system.\n\nOne of these factors may be the rise in the degree of oligopoly. But it must\nbe stated generally that the degree of utilisation of plant in the reference\nsystem is constant only in the case of uniform trend. If the pace of secular\ntrend is permanently slowing down the utilisation of equipment is in general\ndeclining.\n\nIt must be added that if the ratio of output to capital were constant in the\ncourse of the dynamic process so would be the utilisation in the reference\nsystem, while in the actual system the utilisation would rise. (If in the latter\nthe ratio of output to capital wc is constant and the ratio of capacity to capital\nc falls the utilisation w rises). Thus after a certain time a point would be reached\nwhen the marginal cost curves cease to be horizontal and our assumption about\nthe actual system would not. hold good any more. The complete parallelism\nbetween the actual system and the reference system would then break down\nand our theorem would cease to be true. It is likely (although it cannot be\ndemonstrated quite rigorously) that the output in the actual system would\nthen start diminishing as compared with that in the reference system because\nof the adverse influence of the '' shift to profit \" upon effective demand.

But this is a double-edged weapon because at the same\ntime it also creates technological unemployment, and it is not impossible that\non balance it sometimes increases rather than alleviates unemployment.\n\nTo review shortly the main results of this paper, we have shown firstly,\nhow in a non-capitalistic economy people's desire to save leads to unemployment\nif prices are perfectly rigid and to instability when they are perfectly flexible\n(and when a rise in the interest rate leads to a higher rate of saving !) : and we\nhave also determined the optimum degree of price-flexibility which yields the\nhighest level of employment compatible with the stability of the system. We\nhave then proceeded to study the capitalistic economy and have found that it\nbehaves similarly to our non-capitalistic model, except that it is less stable\n(requires greater price-rigidity for stability) and that its instability does sot\ndepend on the assumption that saving increases with the real rate of interest.\nFinally, we have shown that the secular accumulation of capital equipment and\nof securities is likely to lead to increasing unemployment even if prices and\ncosts are not perfectly rigid (but their flexibility is limited by the requirement\nof stability), unless employment is maintained by population growth, technical\nadvance, increasing quantity of money, or by at least one of these factors. As\nregards the more general problem of economic change, the conclusion to be\ndrawn from our results is that on the assumption of fixed prices or limited\nprice-flexibility, there need be no inh\u00e9rent tendency in the economic system\ntowards the full (optimum) employment of productive resources ; whereas it is\nimpossible to base a theory of economic change on the assumption of perfectly\nflexible prices. It is inadmissible even to start out from the assumption of\nflexible prices as a limiting case, for it is very dangerous to argue or to draw\nconclusions about our economy on the basis of a model which is essentially\nunstable. It also follows from this that the criticism of the methods and\nconclusions of Mr. Keynes and his followers on the ground that they assume\nrigid money wages is totally unwarranted ; not only because this assumption is\nprobably less unrealistic than the classical assumption of perfectly flexible\nwages and prices, but also because the model of rigid wages\u2014fulfilling the\ncondition of stability\u2014is unlikely to differ significantly from the real economy\nin its essential features, whereas the same certainly cannot be said of the model\nof perfectly flexible prices and wages which is unstable.\n\nChicago.

Furthermore, the system will be the less stable the greater is the\nimportance of fixed-interest-bearing securities.\n\nThe maximum time-rate of price-fall compatible with the stability of the\nsystem is unlikely to be sufficient to counteract completely the secular fall in the\nmarginal productivity of capital and the secular rise in market rates of interest,\nand thereby to maintain the level of employment in the long run. It is more\nlikely that even in the case of (limited) price-flexibility, the long-run level of\nemployment will fall in a progressive economy, although, of course, at a smaller\nrate than when prices are perfectly rigid.\n\nIt is often said that the contrast between the relatively smooth working\nof our economic system during the nineteenth century and the chronic unem-\nployment of the 1920's and '30's is explained by the increasing rigidity of our\nprice- and cost-structure. While personally I do not think that this factor is\nvery important, it has been shown above that it is a possible explanation, yet\nit does not follow from it that measures aiming at increasing the flexibility of\nprices and costs would be the proper remedy. For hand in hand with the\nincreasing rigidity of prices went another development: the community's\ndiminishing willingness to bear risk. This tendency manifested itself partly in\nthe increased care and caution with which investments were planned, and\npartly in the shift in investors' tastes from ordinary shares to preferential stock\nand fixed-interest-bearing securities. Both these changes were shown above to\nmake for lesser stability of the system so that the greater rigidity of present-day\nprices and costs may well be necessary to maintain the stability of our economy.\n\nOther, and probably more important factors that have contributed to the\nspectacular progress and relatively high average level of employment of the\nnineteenth century were population growth, the increase in the quantity of\nmoney (in the form of gold rushes and of the development of the means of\npayment other than gold), and, possibly, technical advance. Population\ngrowth raises the marginal productivity of capital by diminishing its quantity\nrelatively to that of labour; it diminishes the propensity to save by lowering\nreal income per head (owing to the law of non-proportional returns) ; and it\nincreases the willingness to bear risk by making misinvestments pay.!

Consequently, investing entrepreneurs will, if\nthey are prudent, base their decisions on their experience over a much longer\npast period than do expenditure-planning consumers; and the longer the\nperiod taken into consideration, the sooner are changes in prices noticed.\nSome may argue here that human beings always base all their decisions on their\nwhole past experience\u2014or on what they remember of it. Yet, I believe, that\ndecisions relating to investment, being more momentous because less easily\nrevocable than consumption and saving plans, will be made more carefully,\nafter a more thorough examination of one's memory and consultation of\nstatistics and other people's opinion and forecasts.\n\nThis train of thought could be developed further by the consideration that\ncorresponding to differences in the economic lifetime of various forms of capital\nequipment, different investment decisions will be made with varying care and\ncaution and based on varying lengths of past experience. Moreover, there are\nalso differences in the rigidity of prices and costs relevant for different industries.\nFor both these reasons it is possible that some sections of the economy should\nbe unstable while others are stable. A detailed analysis of this problem would\nlie beyond the scope of this article, but because of its importance for business\ncycle theory (where its significance is somewhat different !) we may give an\nillustration. Consider an economy in which the past experience of fairly regular\ncyclical changes in prices and employment is given as a datum. Then assume\nan initial increase in prosperity and employment, coupled with a rise in prices\nand a slight rise in interest rates. In industries where equipment is relatively\nshort-lived, entrepreneurs will have a tendency to extrapolate the initial\nprice-rise linearly (i.e. to expect a further rise) and to increase their investments,\nthereby further increasing prosperity and employment and raising prices. As\nagainst the destabilising behaviour of these entrepreneurs, those whose equip-\nment is of such longevity as to compel them to base their investment policy\non past experience over at least one complete trade-cycle will consider the\nincreased prosperity and price-rise as cyclical and temporary and will only be\naffected by the increase in investment-costs and interest-rates which tends to\nreduce their investment plans. Two practical examples of such industries,\ndisplaying an anti-cyclical and, therefore, stabilising behaviour, are the railway\nindustry and residential building.!\n\nAfter this digression we may sum up the foregoing argument by saying\n\n1Cf.

Since, however,\nthey will be lowered only slightly, we can say approximately that an economy\nin which the issuing of fixed-interest-bearing securities is the main form of\nraising capital (we include bank-advances under fixed-interest-bearing securi-\nties) will only be stable if prices are so rigid that a primary price-change does\nnot lead to the expectation of a further change in the same direction. For if it\ndid, the primary excess of savings would, by lowering the inducement to invest,\nlead to a yet greater excess of saving, and instability in the form of a cumulative\nprice-fall would result.?\n\nThe market rate on shares will, in the neutral case when no future price-\nchanges are expected, be lowered more than that on fixed-interest-bearing\nsecurities ; while price-change expectations will affect it in exactly the same\nway as they affect the marginal productivity of capital, but always to a much\nlesser extent. The compound effect of the price-fall and of future price-change\nexpectations will be such as to raise the inducement to invest (i.e. widen the\ngap between the marginal productivity of capital and the market rate of\ninterest) and to diminish the excess of savings when the elasticity of price-\nexpectations is unity, below unity, or slightly above it, whereas it will lower it\n(and lead to instability) when the elasticity of expectations exceeds a certain\ncritical value which is somewhere above unity. While this result is fundamen-\ntally identical with that which we have reached in the case of fixed-interest-\nbearing securities (cf. the footnote on this page), it also shows that a system in\nwhich shares are the dominant form of securities is likely to be more stable than\none in which fixed-interest-bearing stocks and bonds are the favourite form of\ninvestment. This is due partly to the fact that a price-fall always depresses the\nmarket rate on shares more than that on stocks and bonds, and partly to the\nfact that elastic price-change expectations lower the rate on shares still further,\nwhile leaving that on stocks and bonds unaffected.\n\nAs to the formation of expectations, the reader is referred to our discussion\nof the subject on pages 75 and the following. There are, however, important\ndifferences between the two cases. There, we were concerned with the expecta-\ntions of consumers in relation to their planned expenditure and saving; here, it\nis the expectations of entrepreneurs when they plan their investments that are\nrelevant. There, we have argued that past price-changes will affect saving plans\nand make the system unstable only if they are sufficiently general to be recog-\nnised as changes in the value of money. Here, no general price-change is\nnecessary to affect expectations relevant to investment plans, because the\ninducement to invest depends only on the price of the produce of the equipment\nto be built and on the cost of co-operating factors. The significance of this\ndifference is that less general and smaller price-changes will be sufficient to lead\n\n1]t will be noticed that our definition of the elasticity of price-expectations is somewhat\nnarrower than Professor Hicks'.\n\n? This statement is only approximately true because in order that the inducement to invest\nbe lowered, it is not enough that the marginal productivity of capital should fall; it must fall by\nmore than the market rate of interest has fallen. Hence, the elasticity of expectations which\nforms the limit between stability and instability is not unity, but slightly greater than unity.\n\nB\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:46:34 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The disparity between saving and investment will,\ntherefore, lower employment before the accumulation of excess savings would\nhave had time to eliminate this disparity by depressing interest rates. The fall\nin incomes and employment will lower the rate of saving directly and also, by\ncausing interest rates to fall, indirectly. It will also depress the marginal\nproductivity of capital, but this will, to a certain extent, be counteracted by\nthe fall in interest rates. On balance the level of investment is likely to fall, but\nat a slower rate than the rate of saving.! Hence the fall in employment will\nre-establish short-period equilibrium, and the trend of short-period equilibria\nwill be one of diminishing employment, approaching the point of long-period\nequilibrium, at which capital accumulation will have ceased, and the commun-\nity's desire to save will have been obliterated by unemployment and the\naccumulation of wealth.\n\nFlexible Prices. We can now turn to the case where the incipient unem-\nployment leads to a fall in prices. We know that, as long as prices keep on\nfalling, saving can exceed investment by a quantity which, expressed as a\npercentage of total national income, is equal to the percentage fall of prices over\nthe period of consumers' reaction-time. But the fall of prices might affect\ninvestment activity and saving, so we must first of all see how these quantities\nchange.\n\nSaving as we know, depends among other factors on the reward for pure\nabstinence, i.e. on the real rate of interest on money (the perfectly riskless and\nliquid security) ; and on the reward for risk- and illiquidity-bearing, i.e. on the\nmarket rate of interest on securities. The fall in prices raises the real rate on\nmoney only if it leads to the expectation of a further general price-fall, while it\nalways lowers market rates of interest on securities. We shall see presently\nthat our capitalistic model already becomes unstable at a degree of price-\nflexibility below that at which an initial price-change begins to undermine the\nnotion of a normal price-level ; hence we will not have to consider at all the\neffect of expected changes in the value of money. As to the fall in market rates\nof interest, that is likely to leave the rate of saving unaffected in the short run,\nwhile it may lower it in the long run. Since we shall mainly be concerned with\nproblems of stability for which short-run considerations alone are relevant, and\nalso because changes in interest rates are unlikely to make a great difference\nto saving even in the long run, we feel justified in simplitying the argument by\nassuming the rate of saving to be constant and by concentrating on the induce-\nment to invest.\n\nThe marginal productivity of capital will remain unchanged by the fall in\nprices if that is regarded as permanent and non-recurring (unit elasticity of\nexpectations), it will be raised if the latter leads to the expectation of a future\nreturn towards the previous higher level of prices (elasticity below unity), and\n\n1Cf, however, N. Kaldor: ''A Model of the Trade-Cycle\" (Economic Journal, May, 1940),\n\nwhere it is contended that the inducement to invest is a steeper function of the level of employment\nthan the propensity to save, and this fact is presented as a possible explanation of the trade-cycle.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:46:34 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

While this is true, I believe that the level of employ-\nment of existing equipment is bound to have a strong psychological influence on\nthe mind of new investors, whereas investment in the duplication of already\nexisting equipment (the \"' widening \"' of capital) is altogether unthinkable as\nlong as there is excess capacity. More strictly relevant to our special problems\nis the question how the marginal productivity of capital is affected by a change\nin prices. Recalling its definition, we see that the marginal productivity of\ncapital is an increasing function of the expected future prices of finished goods,\na diminishing function of expected future costs (because expected net profits\nare the difference between expected receipts and outlays), and a diminishing\nfunction of present replacement costs. It also appears that a proportionate\nchange in all the three of these quantities leaves the marginal productivity of\ncapital unchanged, whence it follows that the latter is independent of the\nabsolute level of prices. It is not independent, however, of expected changes in\nprices since these will affect the relationship between present costs and expected\nfuture net profits, and will raise the marginal productivity of capital when a\nprice-rise is expected and lower it when a price-fall is foreseen by the expected\ntime-rate of change of prices.\n\nRigid Prices. We are now fully equipped for the analysis of the behaviour\nof the capitalistic economy. We shall consider the case of perfectly rigid prices\nfirst, and we shall start from initial conditions that make for full employment.\nIt will appear presently that this last assumption makes no difference to the\nargument and that we could equally well have started from any degree of\nunderemployment. Assume that with given tastes, production functions,\nsaving and risk-bearing propensities, and with given quantities of money,\nsecurities, and equipment, the market rates of interest and the marginal\nproductivity of capital are such that the level of investment determined by\nthem exactly equals the rate of saving performed at full employment. We know\nthat this leads to full employment. But as time goes on, the accumulation of\ncapital equipment will depress the marginal productivity of capital, the\ncorresponding increase in the quantity of securities will be likely to raise market\nrates of interest,! and both effects will tend to lower the level of investment.\nThe propensity to save\u2014that is, the rate of saving as a function of the level of\nemployment\u2014will rise on account of rising real incomes (due to the increasing\nquantity and roundaboutness of equipment) and rising interest rates, but this\ntendency may be partly offset by the increase in the stock of wealth. As the\ninducement to invest falls and the propensity to save rises, the level of employ-\nment will have to fall to ensure the equality of saving and investment, but first\nthere will be an excess of savings for a short time. This is due to the fact that\nsince present investment activity is determined to a large extent by past, and\nto a small extent only by present investment decisions (ex amie investment),\nemployment and the level of incomes will not start falling immediately after the\nrate of investment decisions has fallen. But the excess of savings so accumulated\n\n!

If, however, the initial price-fall leads to the expectation of a further\nprice-fall, and a corresponding fall in money profits and dividends, then the\nexpected time-rate of fall (p.a.) must be deducted from the market rate and\nmay easily make it negative. This tendency, however, will be partially counter-\nacted by the diminution in the demand for holding shares due to their diminished\nattraction. One would, indeed, be tempted to argue that it would be totally\ncounteracted were it not for the fact that shares are held not only for the\nincome they yield but also for the control they give over industry. This\nestablishes a significant difference between them and fixed-interest-bearing\nsecurities and lowers their elasticity of substitution. (The argument is perfectly\nsymmetrical for the case of an expected price-rise). It is important to notice\nthat the market rate on fixed-interest-bearing securities is entirely unaffected\nby price-change expectations.\n\nThe Marginal Productivity of Cajital. The marginal productivity of\ncapital may be defined as that rate of interest at which the stream of expected\nfuture marginal value products (net profits) of a capital-good must be dis-\ncounted in order to make its (the stream's) present value equal to the cost of\nbuilding an equivalent capital-good. This rate will fall with capital accumula-\ntion, because the greater is the quantity of capital relatively to that of other\nfactors of production, the smaller will be its marginal productivity. Besides\nthe relative quantity of different factors of production, the marginal pro-\nductivity of capital-goods also depends on the relative demand for different\nfactors. Variations in the level of investment constitute changes in this relative\ndemand if the various factors are not combined in the same proportions in\ninvestment-good industries and consumption-good industries respectively.\nE.g. if investment-good industries are capital-intensive, the marginal pro-\nductivity of capital-goods will rise as the rate of investment increases, it will\nfall if investment-good industries are labour-intensive. But the marginal\nproductivity of a capital-good is not the same thing as the marginal pro-\nductivity of capital. The latter also depends on the replacement cost of capital-\ngoods. This is likely to rise with increasing rate of investment, thereby tending\nto lower the marginal productivity of capital. On balance, therefore, an increase\nin the rate of investment is more likely to lower than to raise the marginal\nproductivity of capital, although the latter is not impossible.! Another factor\naffecting the marginal productivity of capital is the degree of utilisation of\nexisting equipment. For one of the most significant differences between the\nproductive factors: capital and labour is that the former must be hired for a\nmuch longer period than the latter. Labour can usually be dismissed at a\nweek's notice, but equipment, when once bought or constructed, remains on\nthe hands of the entrepreneur who will have to pay interest on the capital\ninvested irrespective of whether and to what extent he makes use of it. It may\nbe argued that this consideration enters the determination of the marginal\nproductivity of already existing equipment only, and not at all that of new\n\n1 But even that would not lead to instability, because the risk of investment is likely to rise\nfaster than the marginal productivity of capital, so that even with a fixed rate of interest there\nwould always be a stable equilibrium level of investment at which the difference between the\n\nmarginal productivity of capital and the money rate of interest is exactly equal to the cost of\nbearing the risk of that rate of investment.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:46:34 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The way in which these two rates are compounded is given by the\nformula\n(1--i5) \u2014 (1--m) (1-Fia),\nor approximately by\niym --1a.\n\nHence, What we customarily call the market or money vate of interest on fixed-\ninterest-bearing securities (im) $s the difference between the veal vate om securities\n(iv) and the veal rate on money (ia). It is the additional attraction of securities\nnecessary to induce people to bear the risk and. illiquidity of holding them instead\nof money and can, therefore, be vegarded as the veward thereof. This shows the\nmistake of the classical economists who thought of the market rate of interest\nas composed of the reward for abstinence and the reward for risk-bearing.\nThat indeed is true of the real rate on securities, but the market rate is always\nthat part of the real rate which is the reward for risk- and illiquidity-bearing\nonly.\n\nThis argument does not necessarily imply that the proportion people\nsave out of their income depends only on expected changes in the value of\nmoney and not at all on market rates of interest. For it is in the nature of risk-\nand illiquidity-bearing that they cannot be separated from abstinence, in the\nsame way as butter cannot (with any propriety) be eaten without bread. Thus,\nwhen higher market rates make risk-bearing more attractive, not only will\npeople try to keep a greater proportion of their already accumulated wealth in\nsecurities, they may also be induced to save more out of their income. But it is\nimportant to realise that the relationship between the market rate of interest\nand the rate of saving is comparable to that between the price of butter and the\ndemand for bread, and not to that between the price of, and demand for, the\nsame commodity. The indirect nature of this relationship explains its looseness,\nand it seems to me that it also provides a satisfactory explanation of the\ninsensitivity of the rate of saving to shori-rwn changes in the market rate of\ninterest.\n\nAfter this digression we can proceed to the analysis of the effects of price-\nchanges on the market rate of interest on shares. We define the market rate\non a share as the ratio of its expected dividend payments to its market value.\nSince dividend payments are likely to move together with the general level of\nprices, the store (or stream) of future purchasing power represented by the\nstock of shares will remain approximately unchanged when a general price-fall\n(price-rise) increases (diminishes) the store of purchasing power represented by\nmoney and fixed-interest-bearing securities. As this is equivalent to a diminu-\ntion (increase) in the quantity of shares relatively to that of money and fixed-\ninterest-bearing securities, it will lead to a fall (rise) in the market rate on\nshares in exactly the same way as a diminution in the supply of a consumers'\ngood leads to a rise in its price.!\n\nThus far we have computed the market rate on shares on the implicit\nassumption that the change in prices is regarded as permanent and non-\n\n! We have seen above that the fall in prices also lowers the market rate on fixed-interest-\nbearing securities, but\u2014as a comparison of the two arguments will show\u2014always to a lesser extent.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:46:34 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

But\nin a modern industrial community the value of net investment made during\nthe short period is an insignificant and negligible fraction of the total stock of\nequipment already in existence, and its influence on the average level of interest\nrates can, therefore, be neglected. In the long run, of course, the quantity of\nsecurities will increase absolutely and\u2014what is more important\u2014relatively to\nthe constant quantity of money, causing market rates of interest to fall. But\nwe emphasise once more that owing to the relative smallness of the volume of\nnew investment per short period this is a secular phenomenon and can be\nneglected in short-run arguments.\n\nSo far we have assumed a constant level of employment. This was\nnecessary because given the total quantity of money, the higher is the level of\nemployment, the higher will be the demand for money for transaction purposes\nand the less money will be left available for investment.? Hence, a rise in\nemployment has the same effect as a diminution of the quantity of money :\nboth raise market rates of interest. Another factor which may cause changes in\ninterest rates is a change in the purchasing power of money. A fall in the\ngeneral price-level means an increase in the store of purchasing power repre-\nsented by the fixed quantity of money, but it also means a proportionate\nincrease in the store of future income represented by the stock of securities that\npromise the future payment of predetermined sums of money. There is no\nspecial reason why people should continue to hold money and fixed-interest-\nbearing securities in the same proportions\u2014or rather that they should be\ninduced to hold them in the same proportions by the same structure of interest\nrates when the real value of their total stock of wealth has increased. Neverthe-\nless, a proportional increase in the quantities of purchasing power represented\nby money and fixed-interest-bearing securities would be unlikely to affect\ninterest rates significantly. The fall in the price-level, however, diminishes the\ntransaction demand for money and, setting free a greater proportion for\npurposes of investment, will cause a slight fall in interest rates.\n\nBefore proceeding to the discussion of the influence of price-changes on\nthe market rate on shares, it may be worth our while to make a short digression\nand to inquire into the exact nature of the market rate on fixed-interest-\nbearing securities. In the first part of this article we have seen that under a\nsystem where money is the only form in which purchasing power can be stored\nthe appreciation of money is the '' reward for abstinence.\" When money and\nsecurities exist side by side as alternative forms of holding purchasing power,\nthe real rate of interest on holding money will still be its rate of appreciation,\nwhile the real rate of interest on a fixed-interest-bearing security will be\ncompounded of its market rate (determined by the relation of the security's\nmarket value and its promised future money payments) and the rate of apprecia-\ntion of money over its life-time. This is due to the fact that the fate of fixed-\ninterest-bearing securities is tied up with that of money : representing definite\n\n! Taking six months as our short-period, the ratio that the value of new investment bears to\nthe value of already extant equipment is probably of the order of magnitude of 1-2 per cent.\nCf. S.

Hitherto we have assumed that the quantity of\nmoney, the sole medium in which value can be stored, is fixed. This assumption\nwill be retained throughout this article, but we now introduce other, alternative\nmedia of storing and holding wealth: securities. These are imperfect substi-\ntutes for money because they involve risk and (potential) illiquidity. To\ncounteract this relative disadvantage and to induce people to hold them in\nspite of this deficiency, their prices must always be lower than that of money,\nin other words they must earn a positive rate of interest in terms of money.\nWe distinguish between securities that promise the future payment of definite\nsums of money (fixed-interest-bearing securities) and those that promise\nindefinite payments (shares). With the now fashionable policy of dividend\nstabilisation there is little difference between the two as long as prices are\nstable or show only temporary fluctuations, but fundamental differences arise\nwhen there is a permanent shift in prices. Accordingly we shall treat them\ntogether first, and separately when we come to the consideration of the effects\nof price-changes.\n\nIndividuals form (subjective) judgments of the risk and illiquidity\nembodied in different securities and have a certain preference for safety and\nliquidity. Given these judgments and preferences, each individual will\u2014when\nconfronted with the system of market rates of interest\u2014choose a definite\ncombination of different securities and money in which to hold his wealth.\nThe parallelism between the individual's behaviour in the securities market and\nin the market where he buys consumers' goods is complete. There the consumer,\nfacing market prices which to him are given, aims at spending his income on\ndifferent goods in a way that will maximise his total satisfaction. Here the\ninvestor, facing market rates of interest, aims at investing his stock of wealth\nin different securities and in money so that they should yield him the maximum\nfuture income compatible with his limited willingness to bear risk and\nilliquidity.\n\nFrom the point of view of the community as a whole it is the quantities of\nsecurities and of money that are given, and they, together with the given\njudgments and preferences of investors, determine the market rates of interest\nin the short period.!\n\nThe greater is the quantity of any particular kind of security the higher will\nbe its market rate of interest since, given their tastes and judgments, people\nneed an ever-stronger inducement to increase their holdings of any one type of\nsecurity.

In the following we shall only be concerned with the average or\ngeneral level of market rates; the determination and interdependence of\ninterest rates on different kinds of securities has been discussed in detail in my\n\" A Study of Interest and Capital\"?

Each existing\ncommodity is given its right to exist by the mere fact of its being profitable to\nproduce it. But when we start from a position where there is an excess of price\nover marginal cost in the related industries, the social cost of producing a\nparticular article is no longer represented by its marginal cost curve. We have\nto mark up the marginal cost curve, in the manner described in the last section ;\nso that it becomes possible for production to be profitable when the social\nsurplus accruing from production of the article is negative. The social surplus\n\u2014 consumers' surplus J- producers' surplus \u2014 loss of potential surplus on other\ncommodities ; this may well be negative, when producers' surplus is positive.\n\nThis is the possibility which has been uncovered by the modern theories\nof Imperfect Competition ; it is in fact the correct and general statement of\nthe possibility of loss due to Imperfect Competition. In order to compress it\ninto the marginal analysis, all the writers on the subject have made simplifica-\ntions which are unwarrantable, and to some extent misleading. The different\nproducts of the different firms in an imperfectly competitive industry do\ngenerate consumers' surpluses, by the mere fact that they are different. To\nemphasise the differences between the products for the purpose of getting a\ndownward sloping demand curve for the individual firm, and then to neglect\nthe differences between the products (irrational preferences !) for the purpose\nof neglecting the consumers' surplus, is both inconsistent and practically\ndangerous. To neglect the producers! surplus for the purpose of equating\nprice with average cost imports quite unnecessary difficulties into the theory.\nThese two simplifications together have been responsible for the quite incorrect\nidea that the number of firms in an industry ought always to be reduced when\nan industry is imperfectly competitive\u2014an idea which we should at once\nrecognise as absurd if we were not bemused by diagrams, and whose practical\nrealisation could only lead to universal monopoly. One may remark, in paren-\nthesis, that it is particularly absurd when it is applied (as it often is) to the\nproblems of retail trade ; in retail trade both the consumers' surpluses (due to\neconomy of shopping time) and the producers' surpluses (economy of living at\none's work) which are derived from multiplicity of shops are abnormally large,\nso that the technical advantages of a concentration policy have to be abnormally\nlarge if there is to be a case for it.\n\nAnd so one might go on. But enough has perhaps been said to show that\nConsumers' Surplus is not a mere economic plaything, a curioswm. It is the\nfoundation of an important branch of economics, a branch cultivated with\nsuperb success by Marshall, Edgeworth and Pigou, shockingly neglected in the\nlast twenty years, but urgently needing reconstruction on a broader basis.\nBeyond all doubt it is still capable of much further development ; if economists\nare to play their part in shaping the canons of economic policy fit for a new age,\nthey will have to build on the foundation of Consumers' Surplus.\n\nManchester.

If the\nrate of toll is not sufficient to pay for the cost of the bridge, how much is it\nworth paying to supplement the toll? The answer depends on the source from\nwhich the supplement is to come. If it comes from the consumers by a poll\ntax on them, it will be worth their while to pay the tax so long as it does not\nexceed M A,. On the other hand, if the supplement is financed from national\nfunds (to which the consumers' contribution is supposed not to be significantly\naffected by the extra expenditure) then the gain to the consumers will exceed\nthe cost so long as the supplement does not exceed PR.!\n\nTaking the most common application of the concept, the comparison\nbetween direct and indirect taxation, the consumer would prefer a direct tax\nof any amount less than 44, (Fig. II) (even though greater than CD) rather\nthan an indirect tax which would raise the price from P, to P,, or, alternatively,\nhe would gain from any increase in direct taxation of less than 4 4, if it were\ncoupled with the removal of indirect taxation lowering the price from P, to P,.?\n\nIt will thus be seen that, in at any rate most of the cases where we are in\nthe habit of using the concept of consumer's surplus, it is the compensating\nvariation which interests us, so that Hicks' restatement does not quite go far\nenough\u2014though the Marshallian consumer's surplus is a concept which, within\na more restricted field, may still remain a useful tool.\n\n6. The solution here suggested is that there are four alternative expressions\nof the consumer's surplus from which we have to choose one in each particular\ncase according to the problem with which we are dealing. This solution certainly\nhas the disadvantage of introducing complexity into a field where it is of\nsingularly little practical importance, since we shall normally expect the four\nresults to lie so close together that it would not matter which we chose and, in\nany case, when we use the concept we do so without making any pretensions\nto accuracy of measurement. This further refinement of the concept is only\nput forward here in the belief that the attainment of precise logical accuracy\nhas some small value for its own sake and that occasionally it may indirectly\nconduce to some other results with some practical importance.\n\n1 [t was necessary to assume that a toll would be charged if the bridge is built, since otherwise\nthe consumption is likely to be independent of income so that the two interpretations of con-\nsumer's surplus coincide.\n\n? Hence the familiar proposition that the cost of indirect taxation to the consumer must\nexceed the revenue to the state (unless supply price is rising sufficiently fast) can be proved. The\nrevenue to the state, if the price net of indirect taxation remains constant, is BK which is necess-\narily smaller than 4 4, and 44, but may be greater than CD.\n\nEdinburgh. A.

Although the control\nwas not very efficient, the registration of property, when it was completed, pre-\nvented any further capital flight. Again, it was patent to all that the alterna-\ntives to the levy were few, and probably even more undesirable. It would have\nbeen manifestly unfair to repudiate the bank-note debts. On the other hand\nneither internal credit conditions northe stateof theinternational capital market\ngaveany hope of raisingloans for funding or conversion. Nor wasthereany pros-\npect of improving the tax yield by other measures. The tax system inherited\nfrom the Dual Monarchy was in any case a very poor one, and the fiscal\nadministrations were completely disorganised. Such new taxes as could be\nimposed and collected were at least as unsatisfactory as the levy.!\n\nRecords, so far as available, do not indicate conspicuous administrative\ndifficulties in valuation and collection. All three states had previous experience\nof property taxation, and the relatively simple structure of wealth simplified\nthe valuation problem. Capital assets, such as securities, deposits, life insurance\npolices, proprietary rights and intangible property in general, accounted for a\nvery small part of total wealth. It was the valuation of land holdings of\nperpetual corporations, ecclesiastical foundations, etc., which caused the worst\ndifficulties. It seems that there were no unusual delays in valuation and assess-\nment. Delay was mainly in collection, which was hampered by the rapid changes\nin money values. In Czechoslovakia there are good reasons to believe that both\nthe unexpected delay over the innumerable instalment payments and the low\nproportion of total collection were almost entirely due to general economic\nconditions and to the fluctuations in the value of money, and not to the negli-\ngence of the administration. There is no reason to doubt the competence and\nfairness of the Czech administration in the use of their discretionary powers,\nthough some discrimination in favour of Czech nationals cannot be excluded\naltogether. It must always be remembered however that compared with Great\nBritain, Continental fiscal administration meant and still means, '' a lower level\nof equity, yield and efficiency.\"\n\nPost-war failure did not prove sufficiently discouraging to prevent the\nreimposition of a capital levy in recent years. War and rearmament created a\nnew state of national emergency, new extraordinary requirements and a new\ncry for shifting the burden onto the wealthy. It is noticeable that at least two\ncountries (Hungary and Italy) where post-war levies failed, have not resisted\nthe attractions of a more successful '' repetition.\" This is not surprising in an\nage of increasing state omnipotence, refined state intervention and highly\nefficient state control. The differences in the type and conditions of these\nrecent levies make however separate consideration necessary.\n\nManchester. L. Rosras.\n\n! A conspicuous example was the coal tax in Czechoslovakia, an ad valorem tax of 42.89, on\nthe price of coal, which badly hampered industrial activity. Income tax was of little use because\nit was still imposed on the different sources of income, and not on the global income of the tax-\npayer. In the event, apart from the levy, most reliance had to be placed on turnover and sales\ntaxes in all three states.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:53:33 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

As this\npaper is already rather long, I propose to confine myself to pointing out certain\nconflicts between the financial interests of Local Authorities and their duties\nto improve the housing of their areas, which are suggested by our earlier\nanalysis.\n\nAs owners of houses Local Authorities have a direct interest in high rents,\nbut as recipients of rates they are indifferent to whether the high rents are due\nto the discouragement of building by the rates, or to some other cause.! In this\nthey differ from private house-owners who only benefit from high rents due to\nthe limitation of building by the rates, if the excess rent more than compensates\nfor the fact that the incidence of the rates is on them. It seems then that when\nthe Local Authorities are competing as house-owners with private owners they\nhave an incentive to limit the volume of new building by the imposition of\nrates. It does not follow that Local Authorities do in fact pursue this policy,\nbut if they were to behave as profit-making bodies they might very well take\nadvantage of the opportunity afforded them.\n\nIn the case of subsidies on new houses Local Authorities appear to be in\nthe same position of natural opposition as other owners of existing houses, a\nfortiori i any part of the subsidy comes out of the rates.\n\nSome alleviation of the apparent conflict between the financial interest of\na Local Authority and its duty as housing authority, may be found in the\npossibility that an increase in the number of houses may increase the rateable\nvalue of its area. An increase in total rateable value does not necessarilly\nfollow, however, from an increase in the supply of new houses. The increased\nnumber of new houses may be partly offset by demolitions of old houses and\nthis may result in a loss of rateable value if, for example, the site is used for\nsome building not liable to rates; on the other hand admittedly the new\nbuilding may have a higher rateable value than the demolished house had.\nApart from demolition, however, an increased supply of new houses will have a\ntendency to lower rents and thus rateable values of old houses, since rateable\nvalues are proportionate to rents.\n\nIt would take us to far afield to discuss the full implications of the\npoints raised here, and we must also ignore the problems which arise if Local\nAuthorities happen to be monopolists in any particular house market. It must\nbe sufficient to conclude by suggesting that the whole question of the suitability\nof the authority which receives the rates to be the housing authority requires\nexamination.\n\nDundee. MantAN BOWLEY.\n\n!'The fact that in general the incidence of the rates is on the Local Authorities with respect\nto their own houses does not of course constitute a disadvantage, it merely involves a book-keeping\ntransaction.

On the contrary, the expectation\nof income is greater, in the face of uncertainty, under a flexible than under a\nrigid plan. What happens is that one contingent income (that corresponding to\nthe \" most likely \" course of markets) is reduced to raise other contingent\nincomes (those corresponding to more and to less favourable states of markets) ;\nand if the latter have a high probability relative to the former the value of the\nwhole set of contingencies rises. Refusal to strive for flexibility is not the mark\nof a business man who is '' neutral towards risk,\" but of one who positively\nrelishes danger\u2014of a '' plunger.\"!\n\n4. Applied to the theory of investment, the principle of flexibility is in the\nfirst instance a guide to qualitative elements of investment. A family which\nknows it will live in a house for a generation can afford to build a house very\nspecifically adapted to its peculiarities ; but if the family is uncertain of\ncontinued residence in the town, a less specialised house (with lower rental\nvalue to the family) will be worth a larger capital outlay. In general, uncer-\ntainty points toward less specialised equipment, even at the expense of having\nhigher operating costs if things go as thought \"' most likely \" ; certainty points\ntoward fuller specialisation.\n\nFor a particular firm, a diminution of uncertainty (decreased dispersion of\nanticipations) calls for increase of specialised as against unspecialised equipment.\nIt does not necessarily call for net investment on the part of that firm, inasmuch\nas resources will be released from holdings of unspecialised assets. But for the\neconomy it calls for net investment, since it involves a qualitative shift in\ndemand. Some of the assets released, moreover, are apt to be monetary : i.e.\nthe firm's valuations of physical goods of specialised character will rise relative\nto valuations of money, which favours net investment for the economy.\n\n5. The theory of investment thus involves the dispersion as well as the\nmean value of market anticipations. Dr. Shackle's model offers us no measure\nof dispersion except the range of the '' likely \" class of contingencies. But if the\nbusiness man's habit \"splitting the difference \" is evidence, the degree of\nprobability attributed to values toward the middle of the range is higher than\nthat attributed to extreme values. If this is the case, the choice of the boundary\nbetween '' likely \"\" and '' surprising \" contingencies is arbitrary, and the range\ndinal probability estimatesas the standard assumption in anticipations analysis.\nuseless asa measure of dispersion.

An increase in liquidity preference is an increase in the\ndemand for cash in terms of securities, i.e. a decrease in the demand for\nsecurities in terms of money. The demand function for commodities in terms\nof money, which is classified under the headings of the propensity to consume\nand to invest (the latter being determined by the equality of the marginal\nefficiency of investment and of the rate of interest) is assumed to remain\nunaltered. Thus the demand for commodities is thought to be neutral toward\nshifts in the demand for securities. An increase in liquidity preference results\ndirectly only in a rise of the rate of interest (i.e. a fall of security prices). The\ndemand for commodities is affected only indirectly via the rate of interest.\nSince commodities and securities are substitutes the rise of the rate of interest\n(i.e. fall of security prices) diminishes the demand for commodities and causes\na fall of commodity prices or (if factor prices are rigid) of employment.\n\nThere seems, however, good reason to believe that the demand for com-\nmodities is sympathetic toward shifts in the demand for securities. Since cash\nbalances can be increased at the expense of commodities as well as at the\nexpense of securities a desire to hold more cash may be expected normally\nto lead to a substitution of cash for both securities and commodities. Thus the\nfunctions of the propensity to consume and to invest appear to have common\nparameters with the liquidity preference function and cannot be supposed to\nremain unaltered when the latter changes. In consequence an increase in\nliquidity preference affects commodity prices and/or employment not only\nindirectly via a rise in the rate of interest, but also directly through a down-\nward shift of the demand function for commodities. The recognition of the\nfact that the demand for commodities is sympathetic toward shifts in the\ndemand for securities enables us to bridge the gap between the '' classical \"'\nand the Keynesian doctrine concerning the effects of changes in the desire to\nhold cash.\n\nChicago.

To say that\npork and beans are sympathetic must mean that in our experience, changes in\npreference increasing or decreasing the demands for both pork and beans are\ncommoner than changes affecting either singly, or affecting them in opposite\ndirections. This is only partly a question of the relation between the com-\nmodities ; it is also a question of the sorts of changes in preferences we have to\ndeal with.\n\nSeasonal influences would be an obvious cause of \"sympathy\" in\nDr. Lange's sense ; politics (war and peace) might be another; the cyclical\napplication made in the latter part of his note seems to me more doubtful. To\nsay that the rate of interest tends to rise when prices rise because commodities\nand securities are ''antagonistic\" tells us nothing useful about the causal\nprocesses involved. And in any case it will not serve to resolve the dilemma.\nSuppose, as I was supposing (Value and Cafital, p. 276) that there is an\nincreased demand for a particular commodity in terms of money. This implies\na change in the scales of preference of a particular section ; as usual, it is\nnecessary to assume that the preferences of other people remain unchanged if\nwe are to deduce an \"economic law.\" But the increased borrowing, which\nraises the rate of interest, does surely come from other people, not from the\npeople who made the initial disturbance. ' Antagonism \" will not explain it.\n\nI did try to offer an explanation (pp. 276-9); it may be wrong, but\nDr. Lange has not shown why he rejects it. In a dynamic problem, so I should\nSay, we must consider the dependence of people's conduct, not only upon\ncurrent prices, but upon price-expectations also; if these expectations were\nto be unaltered by the change in current prices, then I think it is plausible to\nclaim that a rise in the demand for commodities in terms of money would tend\nto lower the rate of interest, as strict theory would indicate. The observed fact\nthat prices and interest rates so frequently move in the same direction is to be\nexplained, in my view, by assuming that there is a strong tendency for price-\nexpectations to be shifted in the same direction when there is a change in\ncurrent prices ; this hypothesis is obviously plausible, and seems to account for\na wide range of observed phenomena. While it is no doubt capable of more\nrealistic elaboration than I gave it, I do claim that it uncovers something of the\ncasual connection involved, and therefore takes us much further than we can\npossibly be taken by an empirical classification.\n\nManchester.

For it is a commonplace in international economic theory that wage\ncuts in any country encourage capital imports and commodity exports, while\ndiscouraging capital exports and commodity imports. The effect on the balance\nof payments is a favourable one, the effect of wage cuts may be to put the cut-\nting country in a position to hoard without danger to its income and employ-\nment level. Moreover, Mr. Keynes to the contrary notwithstanding, cuts in\nmoney wages lead to declining real wages as well\u2014if any foreign goods are\nconsumed by working men, if Mr. Keynes' '\" wage goods \"' are not exclusively\ndomestic.\n\nThis argument does not, in the writer's opinion, detract seriously from the\nreliability of Mr. Keynes' practical conclusions for wage policy. Any cut in\nwages initiated in country A4 may spread to all competing countries, and leave\nno competitor better off than before as regards its balance of payments. In\npractice, there may well be two groups of net losers. At one extreme will be\ncountries such as Great Britain, in which strong trade union organisation\nprevents or retards wage cuts, and at the other countries such as \u00cdndia and\nChina, in which bald biology will probably prevent any substantial decrease in\nreal wages. No country is apt to be a large net gainer unless her income\nelasticity of demand for imports is low, and her relative price elasticity of\ndemand for imports! high, while foreign income and relative price elasticities\nare higher and lower, respectively. On the supply side, a relatively high\nelasticity of substitution of labour for capital would also tend to increase her\nnet gain. The writer does not believe that any of these conditions apply in\nmarked degree to any of the major free-enterprise economies to-day. For all\npractical purposes, then, we may say that in no case will any free country A\ngain greatly by inaugurating or following a policy of competitive wage cutting.\nWhereas, on the other hand, a programme of monetary expansion in country A\nwhich is aimed at increasing employment rather than domestic prices, and which\nis kept from raising the prices of foreign currency by monetary authorities,\nneed inspire no retaliatory measures whatever, and lead to no long-run reper-\ncussions undoing its original beneficent effects.\n\nChicago, Illinois.

But when he says that he made '' insufficient allowance for\n\n1]f an individual's expectations are abnormally high, it may of course be a reason for his\nnot hedging.\n\n? Technical uncertainties would, however, be hedgeable, where fluctuations in an individual's\ncrop were closely associated with fluctuations in the total crop coming to the market. The hedging\nwould be either by sales, or by purchases, of futures, according as the market demand function\nwere elastic or inelastic. If there were no correlation between changes in the individual and the\ntotal crop, futures sales would be better than no hedge; though where fluctuations in the size\nof the crop were great, the unhedgeable risks would be large relative to the hedgeable price risks.\n\n?* Kaldor, p. 197 above, footnote 3.

Such a condition of the market tends to evoke sales\nof spot supplies, till the fall in the spot price restores the normal condition in\nwhich every forward price provides a sufficient premium to cover carrying\ncosts. But this process may be interrupted by a shortage of spot supplies. That\nreally means that traders' stocks cannot be further reduced except at the cost\nof some loss of convenience. The inconvenience may take the form of a lower\nminimum holding, involving a greater risk of the trader's operations being\ninterrupted by an exhaustion of his stock, but is more likely to be the incon-\nvenience of smaller and more frequent purchases for replenishment. The higher\nspot price has the same effect as a rise in the short-term rate of interest on those\ntraders who hold goods with borrowed money.\n\nIt iswhen thisshortage of spot supplies becomes severe enough to outweigh\nthe entire carrying cost that a \"backwardation,\" or excess of the spot price\nover the forward price, appears. Such temporary scarcities are, of course, not\nuncommon. The scarcity must be '' temporary,\" for it is only the prospect of\nbetter supplies that justifies either the lower future price or the present release\nof goods from stock. But it need not be a fAysical scarcity at all; a scarcity\nof spot supplies may arise merely because the forward sales by which the\nholders have covered the available stocks are not maturing in sufficient amounts\nto release the supplies required for use. An inducement is needed for the\nholders to undo their forward sales by forward purchases and meet the\ndemand for spot sales.\n\nMr. Kaldor, while recognising the objections to the ''expected price,\"\ncontinues to employ it. He says that '' for certain problems in the theory of\nspeculation \" the concept of '\" representative expectation \" is a legitimate\nsimplification. The representative expectation is that which ''if held by all\nindividuals participating in the market, would lead to the establishment of\nthe same current price as that actually reached.\" But surely if all held the same\nexpectations there would be no speculation. The professional dealers would\nconfine themselves to satisfying the requirements of the hedging traders and\nmaking their profit out of the turn of the market.\n\nNor is the hypothesis of a representative expectation complete unless it is\nsupplemented by a hypothesis as to people's views of the probability of the\nexpectation being fulfilled. If all hedging traders are supposed to have expecta-\ntions, they are all potential speculators, and they will be more likely to abstain\nfrom incurring some probable loss on hedging if they are very confident that\nthe expected price will be realised.\n\nIn fact, the introduction of the expected price in any form, far from being\na simplification, is an additional complication.\n\nLondon.

According to our hypothesis, if he continues\nto operate the old machine now for the rest of its accounting life, i.ee. for the next a years, he\nwill receive a series of greater-than-abandonment rents. We shall assume that these rents are all\nequal and that the scrap value is nil.

These nine cases can be developed in exactly the same\nway as was done in the text. In a note on '' Premature Abandonment and the Flow of Invest-\nment,\" Q. J. E., Nov., 1939, the present writer criticised the Burns' proposition on the ground that\nit implied that the wAole ex-ante life of the new machine equals the remaining ex-ante life of the old\nmachine.

MARX 135\n\nabove-noted differences between Keynes and Marx with respect to the depend-\nence of the marginal efficiency of capital on the rate of real wages and on the\npropensity to consume. Dobb maintains! that neither the state nor the banking\nsystem could be depended upon to bring about a distribution of income contrary\nto the interest of the capitalist class as a whole. Thus this difference of opinion\nis reduced to a problem of the practical feasibility of a zero rate of interest in a\ncapitalist system.? I think it is more than this. It is a disagreement on the\nfundamental working of the economic system, the Marxian view being that a\nsystem motivated by profit will not function well, as profit goes toward zero.\nThis remains a question of theory, however great its practical importance.\nThe line between a theoretical and a practical question is limited only by the\nlimits of the theoretical framework.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFrom the general Marxian framework, criticism of Mr. Keynes' system\nwould fall under two headings: (r) Mr. Keynes fails to recognise a law of\ncapitalist development, i.e. his system regards human institutions as data,\nchanging independently, and hence he fails to recognise that the limitations on\nproduction are imposed by the capitalist mode of production :/self. (2)\nMr. Keynes' fundamental relationships, as represented in his schedules are not\nindependent of each other nor even of the values of the variables they relate.\nAnalytically this means, for example, that even with the slope of the liquidity\npreference schedule given as negative, we cannot then say that an increase in\nthe quantity of money will lower the rate of interest. We must first find the\neffects on the other variables in the system. Pragmatically, it means that these\nschedules may be altered by the alteration of property and income relationships,\nalthough, say the Marxists, to do so would be to transform the capitalist system.\n\nCambridge, Mass. S. S. ALEXANDER.\n\nlop. cit., p. 110. He also refers to Harrod's view that the banking system may be unable to\n'' influence appropriately \"' the long term rate of interest.\n\n? Of course there is another solution which solves the riddle in a most direct way. The solution\nis to convert that portion of the total surplus value which is not consumed by the capitalists nor\nused for replacement, into articles which the state finds desirable and which are capable neither\nof glutting the market, nor of increasing the amount of capital. Armaments may be considered\nthe archetype of this form of commodity. The state may acquire these commodities either by a\ndirect requisition in the form of taxation or by purchase through funds obtained by inducing the\ncapitalists to convert their unconsumed surplus-value into money-capital (interest-bearing\ncertificates of indebtedness of the state). This inducement may be facilitated by obstructions to\nor prohibitions of conversion of the surplus value into other forms of capital. This seems to have\nbeen the policy of the Nazi state. The essential background of the solution is a transformation\nfrom a dynamic into a static state, or a state dynamic only with regard to the accumulation of\nmoney-capital. It is a divorce of the profit motive from the accumulation of capital goods. It is\nin a very real sense, therefore, that the totalitarian state may be said to '' preserve capitalism.\"\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 13:12:02 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

H. M. SowEns.\n\nA COMMENT ON THE ABOVE\n\nWith Mr. Somers' new note, this controversy may be said to have been\nbrought to an amicable conclusion. We are all agreed that Professor Pigou's\nanalysis is equally valid, irrespective of whether the demand for money varies\nwith the rate of interest or is independent of the rate of interest\u2014excepting a\nlimiting case where this demand is infinitely elastic with respect to the rate\nof interest. Professor Pigou's error is confined to not having made the existence\nof this limiting case explicit.\n\nIt would have helped matters, however, if Mr. Somers had made it clear\nfrom the start that by '' the introduction of liquidity preference considerations ''\nhe meant the assumption that the elasticity of the demand for money with\nrespect to interest is less than infinite, and not that it is higher than zero. It\nis more appropriate (and usual) to define '' absence of liquidity preference \"\nas a state of affairs where this elasticity is zero.\n\nLondon.
