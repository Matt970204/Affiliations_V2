Compared to traditional empirical research in economics the experimenter\nhas considerable control over the design of the markets within which his economic agents\noperate, and he can exclude some influences from which he wishes to abstract while con-\ncentrating on others he wishes to study. Anyone questioning results within the experi-\nmental framework is able to replicate an experiment performed by someone else and\nanalyze entirely new and independent data. On the other hand, the world of the experi-\nmenter is artificial and of his own design; so the extent to which experimental results\nmay be taken as a clue to behaviour in real life markets is uncertain.\n\nThe two conclusions on oligopolistic behaviour which emerge from these studies are:\nthe Cournot solution characterizes behaviour in incomplete information situations, and,\nunder complete information, a subject is more cooperative, the more cooperative is his\nrival. It is not obvious whether these conclusions will obtain under more intensive examin-\nation, or how more comprehensive experiments will find them modified; however, they\nare interesting results and suggestive of what might be done experimentally.\n\nUniversity of Rochester J.

If the curves did not coincide, the subject\nwould be shown the divergence and allowed to redraw the curve(s).\n\nSuch a sensitivity test is in some sense a type of validation of the curves drawn, but\nmore direct validations could be proposed. The indifference curves obtained could be\nused to predict choices among commodities not lying on one of these curves. This could\nbe done by simple extrapolation or interpolation. Another possible attempt at validation\ncould be performed if a constant marginal utility of a common commodity could be\nassumed and two sets of indifference curves would be used to predict the third set, as\nThurstone attempted to do.\n\nA more interesting test would be to form pairs of individuals and put them together\nin a barter situation with some fixed amount of two commodities and allow them to leave\nwith whatever division they agree upon. By putting their indifference curves together\ninto an Edgeworth box one could see how close they come to the contract curve. That is,\none would predict that in a one-shot situation they would form a division on the contract\ncurve and the actual division would form a test of the accuracy of the individual in-\ndifference curves. Alternatively, they could be started on the contract curve and any\nmovement away would be noted and would be evidence of the lack of validity of the\nindifference curves.\n\nAnother attempt to validate the indifference curves by direct prediction would be to\nmake the appropriate assumptions to get numerical utilities and then these could be used\nto predict choices. Any discrepancy though could be attributed to either poor indifference\ncurves or the invalidity of the assumptions made. \"This topic will be explored in some\ndepth in a forthcoming paper (MacCrimmon and Toda [8]).\n\nMost of the discussion above is directed to determination of indifference curves in\nsituations that an experimenter constructs. However, we might wonder whether these\nprocedures can be used in real world choice situations where preferences could be reflected\nby indifference curves, for example, the bombs and bombers trade-off of Hitch and McKean.\nIt should be obvious that the emphasis on training, reflection, and checks on consistency\ncould be part of any consideration of preferences. Also, the complexity reduction tech-\nniques based on admissibility can easily be used. This, then, only leaves the question of\nwhether the payoff part of the method is useful in real world choices. Note that as we\nuse it in experiments it is particularly effective because the subject will actually receive a\ncommodity bundle based on his positioning of the indifference curve. Clearly there are\nmany situations, not only bombs and bombers, in which we are not prepared to give the\nindividual one of the commodity bundles. This leads to the question of whether the payoff\npart of the method is of any use when applied hypothetically\u2014for example, ** suppose\nafter you draw the indifference curve we randomly select a combination of bombs and\nbombers, if it is in your accept region we will give you that combination, if it is in your\nreject region you get the reference bundle.\" Whether such hypothetical payoffs are\neffective is an empirical matter, but in any case it is probably as good as any other pro-\ncedure in these contexts. Since all important decisions involve a representation of prefer-\nences in some form or other, it would be useful to explore the possibilities of applying these\nexperimentally based procedures in real world choice situations.\n\nCarnegie-Mellon University K.

Thus cost variability\ncan influence behaviour in the strategist's dilemma, but its influence varies with the risk\nattitudes of participants.\n\nIt should be noted that although preliminary games were played to reduce its effect\nin the joint cooperation experiment, learning is apt to have greater effect in some conditions\nthan in others. In the joint cooperation experiment, risk averse subjects are often re-\ninforced in their behaviour because they are always paired with subjects who also tend to\ncooperate. Risk tolerant subjects find their competitive behaviour unrewarded, because\nthey are paired with other risk tolerant subjects. Thus, the design of the joint cooperation\nexperiment gives risk tolerant subjects more motivation to depart, based on experience,\nfrom the behaviour expected of them.

We have noted\nthat the RTP of a bargainer has a significant impact on his bargaining process itself as\nwell as on the outcomes consequent to this process. \"These effects of RTP seem to be\nsignificantly moderated by the structural context within which bargaining occurs; namely,\nthe environment of information, communication and power.\n\nViewed from an additional perspective, bargaining as a theoretical construct and\nbargaining behaviour as an empirical focus play an important role in organizational\nbehaviour and organizational theory. In this regard, the research reported in this paper\ncan be viewed as relevant to several current issues in organizational behaviour and theory.\nFirst, much of the recent work by Homans [6], Adams [1] and Weick [10] has indicated\nthe powerful role that the equity of a reward plays in influencing attitudes and performance\nin organized settings. The role of differential attitudinal and behavioural results in a\nbargaining task is central to this stream of work. Our results on the differential affect\ntoward the bargaining task and toward earnings generated by the power and information\nvariables generally support this stream of research and add to the task generality of\nprevious results. Second, an important issue in organizational behaviour and organiza-\ntional theory is the relative value to be attached to increments in information available to\nbargainers in an organizational setting. Our results, generated through experimentally\nvarying the amount of information available to a bargainer regarding the possible monetary\npayoffs to his opponent associated with any given bargaining contract, are relevant to this\ntheme. Our data support the suggestion in the literature that under specified bargaining\nconditions information regarding a counterpart's payoffs may possess negative value.\nThird, the role of personal characteristics in determining the bargaining behaviour of a\ntriad is a critical area for research in organizational behaviour. We view the risk-taking\npropensity of the participants as particularly relevant to understanding their behaviour on\nbargaining tasks. Our results indicate that there are significant individual differences in\nthe manner in which high and low risk-takers handle information, power and communica-\ntion in a competitive setting. Fourth, the role of differential power associated with hier-\narchical status in determining bargaining processes and results is crucial to our under-\nstanding of behaviour in organizations. Our results indicate that possessing a terminal\nposition in a bargaining exchange (e.g. who has the last offer in a superior-subordinate\nnegotiation regarding salary, duties, discipline, etc.) does generate significant differences\nin bargaining processes and results. .Fifthly, the literature of administration and, more\nrecently, organizational behaviour has been concerned with the behavioural and affective\nconsequences of the degree to which communication channels are ** open \", both vertically\nand laterally, in an organization. Our experimental variations of the availability of\ncommunication are relevant to the issue of whether communication necessarily increases\nthe profitability and/or the perceptions of satisfaction associated with bargaining.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe feel that laboratory simulation of organizational processes of the type described\nin this paper is a useful but certainly not exclusive strategy for investigating bargaining\nbehaviour in a triad relationship. It does, however, seem particularly appropriate at\nour present state of knowledge in specifying the determinants of bargaining behaviour\nand their interrelationships. Based upon the findings reported here, our research is\nmoving in two directions; (1) the investigation of the determinants of bargaining in an\nasymmetric bargaining triad and (2) the experimental control of bidding behaviour and\nthe contents of written communications in order to investigate the effects of competitive\nvs. cooperative bargaining strategies.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin L.

This cannot be so, since the demand for money is a function of\nwealth and is therefore related to the amount of assets owned.\n\nWhile the currently used approach contains fundamental theoretical deficiencies, the\nconclusions as to the conditions under which monetary policy will be effective under fixed\nand flexible exchange rate are essentially correct (although the analysis, by confusing\nstocks and flows, tends to focus attention on the level of the money stock rather than on\nits rate of change as the major policy instrument). In the case of fiscal policy, however,\nour analysis indicates the fallacy of Mundell's conclusion that fiscal policy is ineffective\nunder a flexible exchange rate; rather, fiscal policy will be effective in both the short and\nthe long run under both fixed and flexible exchange rate systems.

Since the choices\nmade by each firm under the rules specified in this paper are different from those which\nthe firm would make if it had full information about its demand function, and since under\nthe latter circumstances the profit of each firm would be less than what it could earn under\na cartel arrangement, it follows that the actual level of profit earned under conditions of\nlack of information may be higher than that earned under full information. Thus,\nignorance is not necessarily the root of all evil.\n\nCase Western Reserve J. HADAR\nUniversity, Cleveland C.

Similarly p(v) can be deter-\nmined. p(y) can be found by numerically integrating out p and v in (7). To get p(\u00f3) we\nmust integrate out y analytically from (6) and then numerically integrate out p and v.\nThus, given the prior distribution, the exact finite sample distributions of all the parameters\nof the CES function can be obtained.\n\nOther distributions that will be of interest are p(\u00f3 | p, data), p(p|v, data) and\np(v | p, data). The distribution p(\u00f3 | p) provides inference about the distribution parameter\n6, for an assumed value of p, while p(\u00f3 | data) provides inference when p is unknown.\nHence it may be interesting to get various conditional distributions of \u00f3. If these are\nquite different, then assuming that p is equal to some fixed value, say p \u2014 0, which corre-\nsponds to the Cobb-Douglas production function, could lead to distribution of \u00f3, far\ndifferent from that of the marginal distribution of 0. Similarly other conditional distribu-\ntions can be used.\n\nThe method suggested in this paper can be readily extended to the case of a CES\nfunction with many inputs.\n\nIII. AN EXAMPLE\n\nTo illustrate the method of estimation we fit the CES production function to the\ncross-section data relating to the Indian Textile Industry for the years 1960-61. The data\nare taken from the Annual Survey of Industries, 1960-1961. The variables used are defined\nas follows:\n\nV; \u2014 Net value added per establishment for the ith region.\n\nK; \u2014 [Fixed capital - (12-5) times the rent paid for fixed items taken on lease]/number\nof establishments for the ith region.\n\nL; \u2014 Man hours per establishment in the ith region.\n\nV; and K; are expressed in 1960 prices. \"The marginal and conditional posterior distribu-\ntions of some of the parameters are shown in Fig. 1. The mean of the posterior distribution\nof p is \u20140-243 with a standard deviation of 0-33. Thus there is no strong evidence against\nthe Cobb-Douglas function (p \u2014 0). The mean of the posterior distribution of v was found\nto be 1-233 with a standard deviation of 0-127. \"There is strong evidence in favour of\nincreasing returns to scale. It is also quite interesting to compare the estimates obtained\nby Sankar [12] for the same industry using Thornber's [13] method for the period 1953-58.\nThe mean of v was 1-262 with the standard deviation of 0-077. The estimate of c was\n1:601 (s.d. \u2014 0-616) as compared to our estimate 1-333 (s.d. \u2014 0-86). The conditional\ndistributions, p(p | v) and p(v| p) are quite interesting. As can be seen from Fig. 1,\nD(p | v) is quite sensitive to the specification of the returns to scale, while p(v | p) is quite\ninsensitive to our assumptions about p.\n\nColumbia University V. K.

It can easily be shown that this leads to a\nconstant term ( \u2014 d) ! on the right hand side of equation (3.2), so that its effect is equivalent\nto raising the rate of population growth. But from (3.3), raising the rate of population\ngrowth will raise the equilibrium share of profits and hence raise 0. If (a--n--d) were\n6 per cent instead of 4 per cent, the values of 0 in Table 3.1 would be raised by 16 per cent\nand (\u2014P\") \u2014 1-0 would imply 0 \u2014 25:3.\n\n\"These results were based on a linear expansion about the equilibrium; this approxi-\nmation is only valid, however, for small deviations. As a check on the accuracy of these\nestimates, we can apply to equations (3.1) and (3.2) the technique of numerical integration\nused in section 1. This gives values for the period very similar to those based on a linear\nexpansion about the equilibrium. As we move further away from the equilibrium, there\nis a tendency for \u00d3 to rise, but within the likely range of unemployment levels this makes\nvery little difference to the results.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this section I have used two alternative methods to estimate the period of the\ncycles likely to be generated by Goodwin's model of cyclical growth. Both methods show\nthat with reasonable values of the parameters, the period is considerably longer than the\n4 or 5 years of the typical recent trade cycle. A cycle with this period is only likely to be\ngenerated if all profits are saved, if the capital-output ratio is very low (less than 2), and\nreal wages respond very strongly to a fall in unemployment. In fact the model as it stands\nmay be better suited to explaining the 16-22 year '*' Kuznets \" cycle than the postwar\ntrade cycle.\n\n4. CONCLUDING COMMENTS\n\nIn this paper I have discussed three quite different models of economic growth and\ntried to show that in each case examination of the timescale provides useful information\nabout their behaviour. This is not altogether surprising, since some kind of time dimension\nis implicit or explicit in our thinking about any real economy; and we should expect the\ntimescale of these models to be important for understanding their relationship to the real\nworld.\n\nIn the course of the paper I have made considerable use of numerical methods of\nanalysis, and in particular of numerical methods to solve differential equations which\ncould not be solved analytically. This technique seems to have been relatively little used\nin recent economic literature, although similar methods were used in the 1950's to analyze\nthe behaviour of trade cycle models. While such numerical methods cannot yield results\nof the strength which economists have come to expect, I hope that the present paper has\ndemonstrated that this capital-intensive approach can have considerable value.\n\nSt John's College, Cambridge A.

Wage-\npush by unions must eventually spread to nonunion sectors of their industries through\nthreat responses in order to preserve the relative union-nonunion wage differential.\n\n(2) It has become a commonplace observation that unions appear to increase wages\nmore when they are first organized than later on [2], and the usual explanation is in terms\nof increasing substitution over the long-run. Section IV provides an alternative explana-\ntion for this phenomena. At any given level of organization, a union's ultimate ability\nto raise wages depends on threat responses on nonunion firms. G(W,) will rise if threats\nare high and that will result in higher union (and nonunion) wage rates. Nonunion\nmanagers! evaluation of the threat, p, is a highly subjective matter and will be far less\ncertain and more apt to change if there has been a short history of unionism in the industry\nrather than a long one. It follows that it will sometimes pay a newly organized union to\npress for higher immediate wage increases than it would otherwise try to sustain, in an\neffort to increase the apparent threat to nonunion firms. This is a kind of * demonstration\neffect. Needless to say, bluffing does not always pay off. Another factor is that the union\nis also likely to be highly uncertain about nonunion responses and this may be one way\nof learning what they are.\n\nUniversity of Rochester and S.

CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn this paper we have presented an operational method for generating production\nfunctions exhibiting returns to scale which vary with the scale of operations in a pre-\nassigned manner and having a preassigned elasticity of substitution which can be constant\nor variable. We refer to such production functions as generalized production functions.\nSome implications of several such functions for the behaviour of labour's share have been\nexplored. In addition, we have provided an illustrative example to show how the para-\nmeters of a generalized production function can be estimated by the maximum likelihood\nmethod. This approach can be utilized quite readily in the analysis of the particular\nfunctional form utilized herein and of other generalized production functions.\n\nUniversity of Chicago A.

The degree of monopoly, defined as the excess of price over\nmarginal cost, divided by price, was hence equal to the share of profits in the output of\neach firm, and the share of profits in the national income was a weighted average of the\ndegree of monopoly in all the firms of the economy. In a vintage model \u00e0 la Kaldor-\nMirrlees marginal cost (i.e. labour unit cost on the machine on the verge of obsolescence)\nis higher than average prime cost because of the coexistence of different vintages, and as\nwe have seen ju \u00ab x, but y has an effect on 7 through the solution of the system of equations.\nBy pulling the loose end thus revealed, namely the impact of ju on 7, one might well unravel\nthe carefully woven fabric of the Cambridge theory of distribution.\n\nKing's College, Cambridge D.

CONCLUSION\n\nIn his discussion of liquidity preference and portfolio choice as behaviour towards\nrisk, Tobin has been careful to emphasize that the mean-variance analysis must be regarded\nas an approximation (e.g., Tobin [17], pp. 12-14). This paper has shown that even his\nrather plausible simplifying assumption that the investor's subjective probability distribu-\ntion has only two parameters is insufficient for deriving the indifference curve convexity\nproperties that facilitate the analysis of investor behaviour. Moreover, if there is more\nthan one asset, an analysis in terms of only mean and variance is not strictly possible unless\nutility functions are assumed quadratic or probability distributions are severely restricted.\n\nBut the inability to obtain unambiguous a priori conclusions about liquidity preference\nor portfolio choice behaviour does not diminish Tobin's contribution in emphasisizing\nthe importance of analyzing this behaviour as optimization under uncertainty. Rather\nit emphasizes the need to develop empirical research in this direction.\n\nHarvard University M. S.

In several respects our windfall/wealth distinction differs from\nthe normal short-run/long-run distinction; first there is nothing temporal about it, second\nit does not depend on the existence of one fixed and one flexible good in addition to\nfinancial assets. Furthermore we are used to long-run functions being the envelope of\nshort-run functions: that is not so here, the ** short-run \" utility of windfall function that\nthe consumer is currently on ** penetrates \" the ** long-run \"' utility of wealth function.\n\nNuffield College, Oxford J.

So, although capital equipment may change with use or age, it must be specific to\nthe particular commodity it is designed to produce, once it is established. It is not neces-\nsary that new capital goods be specific to a particular purpose; only that they cannot be\nshifted from one use to another during their lifetime. It must be admitted that this\nkind of specificity is more commonly found in economic models than in real economies.\n\nThe dynamic nonsubstitution theorem is only an indication of the restrictions imposed\non possible relative prices in a dynamic economy when we assume constant returns, a\nsingle non-produced input, and no joint products. We could ask the more general question,\nunder what circumstances prices in one period are determined, independently of consumer\ndemand, given the history of prices and interest rates. The assumptions necessary for this\nresult seem, however, to be considerably more stringent than are required for the theorems\nstated in this paper. Consider, for example, the economy assumed in Theorem 2. 1f the\nmatrices 42; always had non-negative inverses, we could deduce the desired result; but\nthat is, in general, a more stringent requirement than those of the theorem.\n\nEven so, the assumptions that we have needed are rather stringent. Besides the\nfamiliar assumptions of constant returns to scale and a single non-produced input, we\nhave had to assume that the rate of interest is greater than the actual rate of growth, and\nsmaller than the maximum possible rate of growth; that no eligible production processes\nproduce consumer goods or new investment goods jointly; that fixed capital is specific\nto the particular commodity produced; and that in no industry does a capital good increase\nas rapidly as the labour force in the course of production. At any rate, it has turned out\nthat the nature of the ** No Joint Products \" assumption necessary is rather less restrictive\nthan has sometimes been thought. \"his is hinted at by Paul Samuelson in his second\npaper on the subject, but proofs are not given there.\n\nIt is perhaps fair to say that the heterogeneity of labour emerges as the main reason\nfor distrusting the proposition that the rate of interest determines relative prices in the\nlong run (though fixed mineral supplies may not be unimportant). The presence of joint\nproduction of the kind that has to be excluded hardly seems to be very important. No\ndoubt, that is what intuition suggests.\n\nNuffield College, Oxford J. A.

Economics and Information Theory (North-Holland Publishing Company,\nAmsterdam, 1967).\n\nThe Measurement of Utility '\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn this paper we show how the utility levels attained by a consumer may be measured\nexactly under idealized conditions. These conditions include knowledge of the trajectories\nof prices, income, and quantities, and of the numerical magnitudes of certain elasticities.\nThe approach taken provides a ranking for all consumption vectors on the trajectory.\n\nAn analytical expression is given, showing the effects on the marginal utility of income\nof changes in income and in relative prices. These effects depend on the income elasticities\nof commodities and on the income elasticity of the marginal utility of income. A link\nis thus provided between a number of concepts and parameters of consumer theory.\n\nThe result also lends itself to empirical application. Estimates of the demand\nelasticities are available from many econometric studies. The less well known elasticity\nof the marginal utility of income plays a role in intertemporal utility maximization. Follow-\ning Samuelson we show how it may be estimated from data on total consumption\nexpenditures over time.\n\nSECTION I\n\nConsider a consumer facing a given price vector P(r) \u2014 (P!(t), ..., P'(t)) and money\nincome M(t), where the P' and .M are continuous functions of time. At every instant\nof time, the consumer maximizes for given P, M the utility function U \u2014 F(X),\n\n1 The author received helpful comments from his colleague J. Hadar, from Professor M. K.

It will suffice to say two things about them in the present context.\n\nFirst, the amount of some labour employed by one firm and not by another may as\nwell be considered as a parameter of that firm's production function when dealing with\nthe Leontief conditions relative to the labours employed by both. This means that those\nconditions (essentially (3.8) and (3.9) with appropriate notational changes) must hold\nfor all values of such labour employment. Even if the firm's production function was\nhomogeneous of degree one in all employed factors it will not generally be so in the factors\nother than the special labour type in question, so it will not be possible to solve the Leontief\nconditions with respect to the labours employed in common as was done in the proof of\nTheorem 4.1. Indeed, those conditions can perfectly well fail to be satisfied for a given\nfirm no matter what the other firm's technology looks like.!\n\nA similar statement holds even more forcefully when dealing with the Leontief condi-\ntions relative to the labour type in question itself. Here the existence of a total capital\naggregate requires that the production function of the firm which employs that labour\nsatisfy a special condition ensuring that the direct effects of an increase in the amount\nof the labour in question on the marginal product of fixed capital be exactly offset by the\nindirect effects of the reallocation of the other movable factors.? Such conditions are very\nstrong.\n\nThus, it is clearly most unlikely that the nonemployment of a particular labour type\nby a particular firm and hence the nonequalization of that labour type's marginal products\nmakes total capital aggregation any easier. Closed-form results for this particular aspect\nof the problem are very hard to come by, however.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology F. M. FISHER\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Diamond, P.

This does allow one\nintegration, but the sort of problem indicated in the text arises anyway when dealing with the set of partial\ndifferential equations parallel to (4.6). It does not seem worth going into this in any more detail.\n\n2 See [2, p. 276]. If there are no other movable factors, i.e., if the sets of labours (and movable capitals)\nemployed by the two firms are disjoint, then capital aggregation requires each firm's production function\nto be additively separable into a function of capital and a function of labour.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:15:31 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

            "found": "CAPITAL AGGREGATION AND OPTIMALITY CONDITIONS 441\n\nGiven an optimal allocation there is an automatic link between the production functions\nand the allocation functions. If the former satisfy the aggregation conditions so must the\nlatter. But, without optimality, the form of the allocation functions is influenced by\nbehaviour and institutions. Technology may satisfy the aggregation conditions, but aggreg-\nation will only follow if the allocation functions also take the requisite form. The fact that\na combination of two largely-independent and individually-unlikely conditions is required\nfor aggregation suggests that its achievement may well have probability zero.\n\nTo justify the use of aggregates, we appear to have to go in other directions: either\napproximation or a more symmetrical treatment of capital and labour. For instance, if\nwe may regard Xy, \u2014 Y as a fund of capital which, like the available fund of labour, is\nsystematically allocated amongst firms, we can deduce allocation functions x, \u2014 A,(X, Y),\ny, \u2014 CK(X, Y). Hence:\n\nZ -\u00bb xf [A((X, Y), C(X, Y)] 5 F(X, Y), ...(59)\n\nand aggregation is automatic. A special case of this is when the allocation of the funds of\nboth labour and capital is optimal. The early paper by Pu [6] is instructive on this.\n\nAn alternative possibility would be to admit more general forms, 0(z) and y(x), for\nthe output and labour aggregates. Such a weakening of (26) would obviously relax the\nstringency of aggregation requirements, without making aggregation automatic. The\nretention of a labour allocation process makes Kleinian aggregation sufficient but not\nnecessary. It should be noted, however, that, unless the allocation process is of the shibbo-\nleth form (21), a generalized labour aggregate V/(x) will depend upon the capital vector y\nas well as on the total amount of labour available.\n\nBristol University and J.

Excluding OF/OX constant as inconsistent with diminishing returns, this gives a\nfunctional relation between p, X and $ or p and X.

Clearly, however, it cannot arise when the tariff is optimal in both\nsituations or only in the latter.\n\nTake, for example, the case where there is monopoly power in trade and the economy\nhas acquired an optimum tariff. In such a case if finite growth occurs, the specific tariff\nwhich was optimal in the initial situation will, in general, become sub-optimal in the new\nsituation.

The\nequilibrium points found above were not of this sort; they were only mutually optimal\nwhere they intersected. As a result, the decisions of the duopolists converge to decisions\nwhich would issue from Nash equilibrium strategies as the number of concluded periods\ngo to infinity.\n\n3.4. Final Comments\n\nThe treatment of reaction functions presented here gives a theoretical foundation to\nsupport those who believe it is possible for a pair of firms forming a duopoly to make\nprofits, without collusion or cooperation, similar to those which might be earned with\ncooperation. Such outcomes need not occur, and among all the possible outcomes is the\nsingle period non-cooperative.\n\nGeneralizations which would be desirable have been mentioned at various points.\nSeveral additional generalizations could be made. Reaction functions might be allowed to\ndepend on more past periods behaviour of the rival than one. A general n-firm version\nmight be developed. Or a more complex convergence problem might be posed in which\neach firm begins with an arbitrary reaction function, then each selects a new one which is\noptimal against the old one of the rival, and so on. Proof of the convergence of this process\nwould be a very strong result indeed.\n\nYale University J. W.

He will\ntend to increase his risk-taking while the opposite would tend to be true for risk lovers.\nIt is clearly brought out here that risk is increased when B-- K70, which means that if\na decision-maker is concerned about the possibility of making profits then the tax will\nincrease his willingness to take risks. This is due to the fact that the government is taking\npart of the risk by letting him offset losses against profits.\n\n4. CONCLUSION\n\nThe effect of a proportional tax on the investment decision has been studied previously\nby several authors. These authors have used utility functions of various forms. The results\nindicate that increased taxation would increase risk-taking in the society.\n\nSince many formulations of decision-making under risk exist in the literature, and\nsince no one can be judged correct under all circumstances, it is important to see whether\nthis conclusion is always true. Therefore some new models and one old but frequently\ndiscussed model are extended by including a proportional tax. Specifically, the chance-\nconstrained programming formulation is discussed both for the case of one riskless asset\nand several risky ones, and for the case when all assets are risky. For the former case the\nimportant separation theorem due to Tobin is proved to hold.\n\nThe principal conclusion of the paper is that increased taxation will in general increase\nrisk-taking in these models, but in some cases the opposite is true.\n\nThe analysis presented here could be carried out for the expected value of a quadratic\nfunction. Since we already have quadratic constraints, this would not complicate matters\nvery much. Finally, it would be interesting to study the effect of a graduated tax.\n\nStockholm University B.

Condition (4.10) is pertinent and suggests that for perfect symmetry\nin a C problem for which a; \u2014 0, it is also necessary that a, equal zero. Therefore, if\nthe differential equation (1.2) lacks the term q\" then it also cannot include the term q'.\nIn other words there is no perfectly symmetric first order linear differential equation.\n\nThis interpretation explains the paradoxical role of the interest rate in the continuous\nproblem by showing that in its original form the C problem was insufficiently symmetric.\nBy introducing condition (4.10) the dynamic demand relation becomes symmetric in the\nsame sense as the classical static demand schedule. The most important moral to be\ndrawn from this is why symmetry of a demand relation over time is unreasonable in the\nreal world. This is because such symmetry would destroy the distinction between the\npast and future. Symmetry in the static case arises essentially because the order in which\nthe goods are chosen does not matter. But in choices over time the order in which goods\nare chosen does matter for two reasons. First, it is impossible to change the decisions\nof the past. Second, the impossibility of changing past decisions would not matter only\nif there were perfect foresight because then there would never be need of changing past\ndecisions. Perfect foresight implies the absence of mistakes. In the real world there is\nuncertainty and perfect foresight is impossible. Hence current choices depend on the\nfact that one must adapt to new unforeseen circumstances as well as possible.

The theorem\nwill illuminate the desirability of decentralization from a certain welfare point of view.\n\nIt is also remarked that the dynamic path yielded by our consumption-investment\npattern may be dominated by another dynamic path. \"hat is, there may exist another\ndynamic path which starts from the same initial point, and yields at least the same amounts\nof per capita consumption for all moments of time, and a larger amount of it for at least\none moment of time.\n\nTokyo Metropolitan University K.

In fact, attempts have been made to do so. The point is that\nwe do require to know that the chosen form of the acceleration principle is corroborated\nby the evidence when other hypotheses are not if we are to regard it as a satisfactory\nexplanation of the investment process.\n\nUniversity College, London A. G. HiINES.\n\nThe Dynamics of the Number of Firms in an\nIndustry '\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nAn explanation of the rise and fall of firms' output levels is not sufficient to account\nfor the changes in the quantity produced by an entire industry, since these will often be\naccompanied by changes in the number of firms. It seems plausible that the factors govern-\ning the creation or annihilation of a firm are somewhat different from the factors which\ngovern the adjustment of an existing firm's output level to changes in demand or cost\nconditions. The latter type of adjustment depends on demand and cost functions and\nperhaps on some assumptions about the behaviour of competing firms as in the Cournot\nmodel; the former type of adjustment may also depend on the magnitude of the reward\nthat can be expected upon entry into the industry.\n\nThe treatment of the problem of entry and exit is seldom formalized. The typical\nargument in the case of perfect competition is as follows: if firms in the industry are making\nprofits in excess of normal profit, new entrepreneurs will be induced to enter the industry.\nTheir entry shifts the industry supply curve to the right and the market price falls. Each\nfirm in the industry then reduces its output and profits fall. The process continues until\nprofit in excess of normal profit becomes zero. Similarly, if losses are being incurred\nsome entrepreneurs leave the industry, the aggregate supply is reduced, market price rises\nand profits rise to zero. The equilibrium number of firms is determined by the condition\nthat profit equal zero ([3, pp. 96-8, 192-5].\n\nThe analysis of entry and exit will rest on several assumptions which are as follows:\n\n(1) In the absence of a complete specification of the cost functions of potential firms\nnot yet producing, it will be assumed that all firms, actual or potential, are identical with\nrespect to costs.\n\n(2) Marginal costs are assumed to be rising.\n\n(3) Although the number of firms is a quantity which is essentially discrete, it will\nbe assumed that the rate of change in the number of firms over time can be suitably\nanalyzed by means of difference or differential equations, even in those cases in which the\nsolution to these equations indicates that at some particular time the number of firms is\nfractional. In fact, this assumption is equivalent to saying, as appears perfectly reasonable,\nthat a fractional firm for the given time period, say a year, is equivalent to a whole firm\n\n1 'The authors are indebted to William J.

CONCLUSION\n\nOn the basis of fairly general assumptions about the form of demand and cost functions\nand about the way in which firms go about maximizing profit, it has been shown that the\nequilibrium number of firms in an industry is globally stable. This conclusion holds under\na Cournot-type decision rule as well as in pure competition. The introduction of expecta-\ntions which are not perverse and of external diseconomies does not upset the stability of\nequilibrium. External economies may, however, render the equilibrium unstable.\n\nIt is not difficult to extend the models described here to two or more industries. In\nthe two-industry case it is necessary to introduce a number of assumptions concerning the\nbehaviour of the system at the boundaries. Retaining the basic hypothesis that the change\nin the number of firms in an industry is proportional to the difference in profits that accrue\nin the two industries, it is possible to show that the system is globally stable.\n\nPrinceton University E.

The\nmodel assumes that expected price equals actual price in the previous period, that supply\nis a function of expected price, and that actual price adjusts to demand so as to clear\nthe market. The relative slopes of the supply and demand functions determine whether\nor not the sequence of prices will converge to the equilibrium price [3].\n\nThe unstable cases arise not only because of a relatively steep demand curve but also\nbecause the suppliers are assumed to believe that the unchanging structure of the market\nhas been changing every period.! Otherwise, suppliers will not ignore observations prior\nto the previous period. If they realize that the structure is unchanging, even if they do\nnot understand it, there is no reason to give greater weight to recent observations than\nto more remote observations. When all observations from some initial date are given\nequal weight and if, in equilibrium, expected price is to equal the equilibrium price, then\nexpected price must equal the mean observed price in all periods since the initial date.\nIn that case the price sequence must converge to equilibrium. \"We shall prove this for a\nclass of linear supply and demand functions.\n\nLet the model consist of the following four equations:\n\nD,\u2014-a-\u2014bP,, ...(1)\n\nS, c dP,, (2)\n\nD,- S, (3)\nn-i\n\nPo- \u00bb Pn, ...(4)\nt-\n\nwhere subscripts ? \u2014 0, 1, 2, ... and n \u2014 1, 2, 3, ... denote period numbers, and where\nD, \u2014 quantity demanded, S, \u2014 quantity supplied, P, \u2014 market price, and P, \u2014 expected\nprice. Assume that the parameters (a, b, c, d) provide positive equilibrium values for\nprice and quantity, and impose the boundary constraints P, z 0, S, z 0.\n\n1 Some experimental cobweb markets are reported in [2]. In subsequent experiments of this sort, it\nhas been possible to obtain non-convergent sequences for a number of periods only when the subjects\nwere misled and believed that the structure was changing when in fact it was stationary.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:23:26 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In situations where the future extends indefinitely, this is not always the case\n[9]. In particular it is important to distinguish between two views of competitive equili-\nbrium: there is the situation where producers are in equilibrium from moment to moment\u2014\nthis is the case of the present paper. However if we trace the economy forward far enough\nthis equilibrium may cease to be possible or efficient, although there may be no way of\ndiscovering this in finite time. On the other hand we could think of producers as being\nin equilibrium also in the sense that at each : the present value of their assets is maximized\n(if such a maximum exists). The economy then behaves as one which had infinitely many\nfuture markets. In such a world the actual path chosen by the economy will be Pareto-\nefficient, and it will be quite different from the economy investitated here.\n\nNow it is certainly possible for the paths generated by the present construction to be\nPareto-inefficient for a long enough horizon [8]. I conclude from this that if the world\nbehaves in this manner, the way for the economy to be made to behave efficiently is for\nsomeone to * aim \" it at a target. Thus there may be, given K(0), a unique choice of\nY(0), which if now made, will lead the economy along its expectation fulfilling path to the\nsteady state. [If indeed the motion were always ** catenary \" we could assert that there\nwill be one such choice of Y(0)\u2014as it is, there may be several.] In that case, if a planning\nboard announced the appropriate rate of change in relative capital goods prices, producers\nought to expect at ? \u2014 0, the economy thereafter will seek the steady state. In any case what\nour idealization shows is, that even if we assume all the frictions, which stop say, the\nequalization of own rates, at all ? away, the invisible hand will generally need a visible one\nto guide it. To say that this is due to the absence of an infinity of futures markets, is\ncorrect but not consoling.\n\nThe paradoxical fact is that if we do not make such very strong demands on the invisible\nhand at all moments of time it may perform in some sense * better \" in the long run.\nThus for instance if we suppose producers to expect current prices to persist forever even\nwhen the steady state has been perturbed, but retain all our other assumptions, then Mori-\nshima has shown [5] that the economy will seek the steady state. Thus while at all moments\nthe economy is making mistakes they are never the big ones it is capable of in the ** correct\nexpectation \" case. This suggests that it may well be that by idealizing as much as we have\ndone, we have not only created some artificial problems, but we are prevented from analyz-\ning the r\u00f3le of one of the most important features of a decentralized and unguided economy\nnamely that at most times economic agents find that their decisions with consequences for\nthe future, were not the appropriate ones. There is also the plain fact that not all agents\nhave the same expectations as to the future values of the same variable, and of course that\nthese expectations are uncertain. It may well be that it is precisely such ** frictional aspects \"\nof the world we live in which prevent it going disastrously ** off the rails \", but no one\nreally knows.\n\nLondon School of Economics.

Can the present generation so bind future generations? In the context of the present\nmodel the answer would appear to be no. Presumably a constitution establishing a saving ratio exceeding\nthe game-equilibrium saving ratio would have no defenders and would be amended; but perhaps sentimental\nattachment to the constitution would save it. In a different model with over-lapping generations, the antici-\npated survival of people for two or more generations ('* periods \") may lend stability to a constitution\nrequiring national saving in excess of the game-equilibrium amount implied by that model. Further, in a\nmodel with people of varying altruism, the more altruistic may be able to block constitutional amendment.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:28:52 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Strotz's result suggests that as the size of the\nsubintervals approaches zero, the conditions which determine the allocation of the C;'s\nwithin subintervals become all-important and the conditions which determine the allocation\nof K among subintervals drop out entirely. Intuition leads us to expect just the opposite,\nand our result contirms this.*\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania R. A. POLLAK.\n\n1 Jf the instantaneous utility function is logarithmic, (4.5) becomes (3.9) since b (0)/5(0) is a constant.\nWe showed in Section 3 that (3.9) is not a correct characterization of the continuous decision sophisticated\noptimum path in the logarithmic case.\n\n2 Think of the sequence of N decision point sophisticated optimum paths as a sequence of functions\napproximating (ox. Strotz's condition (4.5) is essentially a restriction on the slopes of these approxi-\nmating functions. But these slopes imply nothing about the slope of (x27.\n\nSuppose, for example, that we required the individual to allocate C; over the ith subinterval so that the\nrate of consumption was constant, instead of allowing him to allocate C; optimally over the subinterval.\nThis certainly does not imply that the corresponding continuous decision sophisticated optimum path would\nexhibit a constant rate of consumption (i.e. zero slope) on [0, 77.\n\n3 The logarithmic case is, of course, an exception.\n\n4 This also suggests a further difficulty. It would seem that Strotz's derivation applies as well to the\ncontinuous decision naive optimum path as to the continuous decision sophisticated optimum path. Thus,\nif one accepts Strotz's derivation of the sophisticated optimum path, one must argue that (a) the derivation\nis not valid for the continuous decision naive optimum path or (b) the continuous decision naive optimum\npath coincides with the continuous decision sophisticated optimum path regardless of the form of the\ninstantaneous utility function.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:29:21 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

His higher\nincome opens up new possibilities. Whether at the time of his lower income he was aware\nof the satisfaction he derives from added commodities cannot be inferred from his previous\nmarket behaviour. For there is no information contained in the demand relations (3.1)\nabout the commodities which are not consumed, except that they were not desirable\ngiven their cost.

L. WEGGE.\n\nDavis\nAPPENDIX 1\n\nIn this Appendix we make a few observations on the pivotal method (4) as described\nin the paper. Gomory and Baumol [3] called this method the condensed pivotal simplex\nmethod, and they attributed it to Tucker. The method is used widely in many fields, such\nas least squares regressions, and in other classical optimization problems involving linear\ncomputations. The mnemonic property of (4) as stated in (6) is basic to an understanding\nof multivariate statistics, regression analysis, and the analysis of properties of optimal\nsystems [6]. The method is called condensed, because, as compared to Dantzig's simplex\nmethod, no unit matrix (slack variables) is required in the tableaux. Otherwise, the trans-\nformation of the other elements is precisely the same, with a slightly different system of\nidentification of the entries in the tables. In the method followed here, the elements are\nidentified by a row index and a column index, each one preceded by a plus sign or a minus\nsign. A plus sign preceding an integer in the row index column means that the corre-\nsponding column is included in the stepwise inverse, and the positive integers in the column\nindex row on top of the table list all the rows included in the inverse. Negative integers\nlabel rows and columns not in the inverse, as stated in (6). The mnemonic property (6)\ncan be proved by induction through repeated application of Jacobi's theorem on deter-\nminants and the Laplacian and Cauchy expansions of a determinant. It can also be\nproved in the same way as the proof of the corresponding mnemonic property of the\nsimplex pivotal method. One advantage of the condensed pivotal method is that its\nmnemonic property (6) is useful for both constrained and unconstrained problems. Thus,\non basis of (6) it is readily seen that in the framework of the linear programming problem\nma (x'a; x \u00a3 0, b z Ax), A being an mxn matrix, we would generate from the initial\ntableau\n\n0 \u2014J5 0\n\u2014\u2014\u00c9 \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u00c0, 15 51, ..., m, 45 \u2014 1, ..., n, a sequence of tableaux\n\u2014l1,; |A b\n\n0 \u2014a' 0\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:29:51 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

            "found": "THE THEORY OF DERIVED DEMAND 235\n\nIt cannot be overemphasized that the choice here need not be the same as or depend on\nthe choice of concept of interest referred to above. The question of choosing the appro-\npriate form for estimation has to do with a correct description, or specification, of the\nstructure that generated the observations. For an exogenous output industry one would use\na demand curve with output as an independent variable, whereas for profit maximizing\nfirms one would use ratios of factors to product prices only. Similarly, if for some reason\nthe cost or profit of the firms are predetermined then one should estimate demand functions\nwith cost or profit respectively as independent variables.\n\nThe foregoing considerations apply also to the choice between short and long run\nmeasures. Since all observations can be considered, apart from random variations, as\nobservations of short run equilibrium, one should be estimating short run demand functions\nwhere the fixed factors and not their prices enter [10, 11]. This is simply a question of\ncorrrect specification and has nothing to do with the desired measure of substitution or\nwith the form of the production function.\n\nThere is another aspect to the choice of ES, that of generating production functions.\nAs has been pointed out above, there is no direct relationship between the concept one\nwants to use and the algebraic form for the production function. Nevertheless there are\nno clear guide lines for selecting functions and if one has to depend on empirical analysis\nthere is no harm in generating functions under the assumptions that some ES are constant\nand to let the data determine their relevance. Even under this principle, we still face some\ndifficulties which are mainly related to the two factor two price ES. As has been shown\nabove, in general these measures are not independent of the directions in which the relevant\nprices change. Fixing the ES for one directional change in prices has no economic\njustification. Furthermore, concentrating on one ES of a pair with respect to own prices\nstill leaves the others unspecified. These two remarks are not independent and not trivial\nin nature. They are related to the fact that the general theory of the economic unit, be it\nconsumer or a firm, cannot be reformulated in terms of two variable two price ES. So\nat best, one takes a partial view, but imposes a great deal, when requiring the production\nfunction to satisfy some conditions on one differential equation.\n\nIt is a different matter with the one price one factor measures. As we have seen,\nthese are not necessarily pure measures of substitution. However, they are directly related\nto the Hessian matrix, which is the canonical form of the underlying structure. The other\nmeasures impose constraints on various combinations of the elements of such a Hessian\nmatrix. But there are many more combinations of such elements than elements them-\nselves, hence it should be more efficient to try to deal with these elements directly rather\nthan through ES.\n\nHebrew University, Jerusalem Y.

Thus,\nthe results of the constant-price case extend in a natural way to time-dependent prices.\n\nI(t)\n\n,C 120\n\nE\n\nFicunE 2\n\nVI. SUMMARY\n\nIt appears from these results that the justification provided by the Strotz-Eisner and\nLucas papers for the geometrically declining distributed lag form of the investment function\ndepends critically on the assumption of fixed prices. In a dynamic world, however, it\nseems more realistic to assume time dependence in economic variables. \"When time\ndependent prices are introduced, the investment path is no longer a geometrically declining\ndistributed lag and there is little evidence to indicate that an auxiliary adjustment mechanism\nof any fixed form will work for all firms and at all times. Of course, it is possible to\nintroduce a changing K* into a distributed lag investment mechanism which is defined\nso as to make the resulting path optimal. However, it would be surprising to find that\npast or present levels of sales, profits, market value, or any of the other variables frequently\nused as estimators of desired capital in econometric work would work very well in this\nregard. The determination of the seriousness and extent of such mis-specification falls\nin the realm of empirical rather than theoretical analysis, however. It is entirely possible\nthat auxiliary adjustment mechanisms, while possibly embodying the above sources of\nerror, give a sufficiently good approximation to such a broad range of underlying cost of\nadjustment situations that their use is justified on the principle of Occam's Razor.\n\nAlthough no simple, unique form of the investment path can be derived from the\nmodel discussed in this paper, it is possible to establish some qualitative relationships\nbetween investment and other economic variables which are useful in theoretical work.\nAmong the most important of these relationships is the finding that investment will be\nincreased if the path of output prices is anywhere increased and decreased if the path of\ninterest rates is anywhere increased.\n\nUniversity of Chicago J. P. GourD\n\n1 As in the case of constant prices these results must be interpreted with some caution. lf wages\ndid increase over some interval, presumably all firms would reduce output thus resulting in an increase in\nthe price of output which would have an offsetting effect on investment.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:33:22 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

INTERPRETING THE RESULTS\n\n'The extent to which one finds the results reasonable must depend upon one's views of\nhow movements in the bond market are generated and also upon the method of con-\nstruction of the data. In this study, Grant's data have been accepted as being well con-\nstructed without any comment but, of course, it is possible that if data had been constructed\nin some different way, slightly different conclusions would have been reached.\n\nIn this section, the more important results will be discussed in turn and possible inter-\npretations of them given.\n\nThe fact that a random walk model with no seasonal component appeared to fit the\nshorter-run fluctuations of the series rather well, is to be expected from previous experience\nwith data from markets having an important speculative element. What is more surprising\nis the clear indications that over the period analyzed, cycles with periods of two and four\nyears were found fairly consistently in all the series. An explanation in terms of the\nstructure of the market is not easily found but a possible explanation is that, possibly\ncoincidentally, there has been a tendency for balance of payments crises to occur in the\nautumns of odd-numbered years, such as 1939, 1947, 1949, 1951, 1955, 1957 and 1961, the\nonly two recent exceptions being in 1956 and 1964, the latter lying outside the period\nanalyzed. As Government action at the times of these crises included the manipulation of\ninterest rates, the observed cycles could have arisen due to this periodic Government\nintervention.\n\nThe close relationships found between bonds of nearly the same term is not unexpected\nas it has always been considered that arbitrage by holders is usually closest between adjacent\nmaturities. However, the extent to which this relationship falls off with frequency has\nbeen less clearly noted in the past. The explanation could either be phrased in terms of\ninvestors! horizons or as being due to all the series being equally affected by Government\nactions which, as they occur only fairly infrequently, can be thought of as affecting long-run\nfrequencies to the greatest extent. This latter explanation appears in general to be plausible,\nand also fits in with the observed lead by the one-year rate over the other rates for the long-\nrun components as any Government action will generally affect short-term rates first and\nwill only slowly percolate through to the longer term rates.!\n\nThis observed lead does lend support to Meiselman's hypothesis that expectations for\nbonds with longer maturities should be based on the current value of the one-year rate as\nthis does appear to provide a useful predictor. However, the fact that no lead was found\nexcept for the long-run components means that his hypothesis needs to be rephrased in\nterms of such components.\n\n6. CONCLUSIONS\n\nA number of features of the movements over time of single series and pairs of series\nhave been found and, in general, plausible explanations have been proposed. The results\nwere found to be consistent with those from other speculative markets and also with\nMeiselman's form of the expectations hypothesis, when suitably amended.\n\nIt is felt that the advantage of the decomposition of the variables into several com-\nponents, which is inherent to the spectral approach, has been well brought out, as several\nof the results are unlikely to have been found using other statistical methods.\n\nUniversity of Nottingham C.

This concept implies that along a ray from the origin\ncrossing the isoquant map all the isoquants' slopes would be equal. Any homogeneous\nproduction function is homothetic but the reverse does not necessarily hold true.\n\nThe mathematical formulation of this function is simple and the function can be\nestimated empirically on the basis of either polynomial curve fitting or numerical integra-\ntion, a speedy task thanks to electronic computers. The parameters which can be estimated\nare technological change, returns to scale, the elasticity of factor substitution and the\nfactors! shares in the product distribution.\n\nIf the data should so indicate the empirical fit of the HIPF would estimate adequately\na straight line, Cobb-Douglas, constant elasticity of substitution production function or\nwhatever form is relevant.\n\nThe HIPF is applicable under market conditions of differentiated competition as\nwell as perfect competition.

(A change of one unit in the index of excess demand for labour corresponds\napproximately to a 1 per cent change in the unemployment rate.) The use of d,^, as opposed\nto any other single indicator of demand pressure, did not improve the overall fits of the\nregressions; we have, therefore, rejected our form of a non-linearity hypothesis about\nthe influence of demand. The regressions which contained d, d,..,, d, .; and d,.3, may\nprovide some information about the time distribution of the effect of demand pressure.\nAlthough the individual coefficients were not significant, there was a marked tendency for\nthe coefficient of d,.., to be positive, that of d, to be negative, and those of d, and d,..,\nto be close to zero. This would suggest that the pressure of demand has little effect on\nthe current price level, a larger effect on that of the following quarter, and then a lesser\neffect on those of succeeding quarters; this suggestion is, however, put forward very\ntentatively.\n\nOur main conclusion is that the level of demand cannot be dismissed as being an\ninsignificant factor in the explanation of the price changes of manufactured goods, even\nafter its effects on costs (wages and materials) have been accounted for. Indeed, our\nregressions may have underestimated the effect of demand forces for two main reasons.\nFirstly, the demand variable used in our regressions was the index of demand for labour\nand not an index of demand for the products of manufacturing industry. There are, of\ncourse, great difficulties (both conceptual and statistical) in the construction of such an\nindex for the products market, though perhaps one could experiment with data on new\norders or orders on hand. Secondly, our regressions imply that a given level of excess\ndemand causes an equal points rise in the price index throughout the whole time period\nunder consideration: this is likely to be a form of misspecification. If we assume that\nprices are fixed in relation to unit costs (fixed, wage and material) plus some percentage\nprofit mark-up, i.e. price \u2014 (unit fixed -- wage --material costs)x profit rate, then the\neffect of a unit change in wage costs is seen to depend on the profit rate at the time of the\nchange, whilst the effect of a unit change in mark-up depends on the level of cost factors\nat the time. If, as seems quite likely, percentage mark-ups remain fairly constant in the\nlong run but there is a marked trend in unit costs, then a given change in unit costs is\nlikely to produce a more or less equal change in price at all times, whereas the effect of a\ngiven change in profit rates will vary over time and will be related to the level of total unit\ncosts. As the total level of unit costs will in turn be related to the existing price level, it\nis seen that a given change in profit rate will produce not a given absolute, but a given\npercentage change in price. Now if we assume that the level of demand is related to the\nprofit rate (per cent mark-up) rather than the level of profits, it follows that a given level\nof excess demand is more likely to be associated with a certain percentage increase than\nwith a certain points increase in the price index.\n\nUniversity of Manchester F.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nThe correct specification of the labour input in the aggregate production function is\nimportant in the study of past economic growth, in measuring the marginal product of\ncapital, in predicting future growth and in assessing the opportunity cost of changes in\nworking hours. A production model embodying separate output elasticities with respect\nto men and hours has significant implications for the theory of labour supply, employment\nand distribution.\n\nTheoretical considerations suggest that the elasticity of output with respect to hours\nexceeds that with respect to men. The evidence, based on Cobb-Douglas production\nfunctions estimated for cross-sections of 24 British industries for three different years, is\ncompatible with this proposition. Attempts to correct for a variety of possible sources\nof bias does not alter this conclusion.\n\nAlthough the evidence supports the hypothesis, there is need for caution. The most\nserious reservation, but one that cannot be avoided with the current data, is that a pro-\nduction function estimated for a cross-industry sample may be misleading. A further\nstudy will therefore be carried out using the United States Census of Manufactures data,\npermitting intra-industry production functions to be estimated using individual states as\nthe units of observation. In addition, an aggregate time series study is in progress.\n\nAt this stage in the research it would seem best to assume that the elasticity of output\nwith respect to hours exceeds that with respect to men and is likely to exceed unity. The\ntraditional assumption that 5j is small or at most equal to y, may lead to substantially\nincorrect predictions and policies.\n\nNuffield College, Oxford and Harvard University M. S.

Mr Cliff Lloyd's paper [4] initiated this uncertainty by questioning\nthe validity of the Hicksian proof in a stock-flow economy and Baumol [1], Johnson [3]\nand Shackle [7] perpetuated it by recognizing the possibility that Lloyd might be right.\nThis note shows that the Hicksian proof can be extended to a stock-flow economy and that\nMr Lloyd's argument failed to utilize Walras' Law for a stock-flow economy.\n\nA stock-flow good is one which is produced, consumed, and held for future disposal\n[2, 4]. The excess market demand for such a good consists of the excess flow demand\n(consumption over production) plus the ''investment\" demand (excess stock demand\ntimes some adjustment coefficient). The market can be in market equilibrium or full stock\nequilibrium. In market equilibrium the excess market demand is zero and stocks are rising\nor falling; in full stock equilibrium the excess market demand is zero with stocks constant.\nFrom the latter condition, Lloyd argues liquidity preference and loanable funds need not be\nequivalent:\n\nIn a consistent n-good system, two of the goods being bonds and money, if any\nn\u2014 \u00cd excess demand equations are satisfied, the nth must also be satisfied, thus the nth\nmay be dropped . . . The loanable funds theory drops the money equation, the liquidity\npreference theory drops the bond equation, but the two are equivalent . . . This is\nquite a simple and clear-cut proof, provided each of the goods in the system is re-\npresented by only one excess demand equation, but . . . in an explicit stock-flow theory\nany stock-flow good will be represented by two excess demand equations [4].\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:39:38 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

An\nirreducible non-negative square matrix M has a unique (up to a scalar multiple) positive\ncharacteristic vector associated with its dominant characteristic value, and if another\ncharacteristic vector is associated with another real characteristic value of M then that\ncharacteristic value is less than the dominant one and that characteristic vector has a\nnegative component. If linearly independent non-negative characteristic vectors of an\napic matrix M share the dominant characteristic value 7 then no characteristic vector of\nM is positive; if M has positive characteristic vectors they all have the same direction and\nthey all have the same characteristic value, v. If the algebraic multiplicity ([14], p. 39) of\nthe dominant characteristic value t of a reducible non-negative x by x matrix M is e the\nrank of M \u2014\u00abI is at least x \u2014& and there may be as many as e linearly independent positive\ncharacteristic vectors associated with v. If a decomposable matrix M admits a standard\ndirect sum (1, 4) decomposition with A 1 there are linearly independent positive character-\nistic vectors associated with v. If it lacks a standard direct sum decomposition it still\npossesses linearly independent non-negative characteristic vectors. This bears on Sraffa's\ntreatment of decomposability ([17], pp. 7, 8, 25) and luxury commodities.\n\n3. REMARKS\n\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of both positive\nprices for a Sraffa system and positive multipliers for forming a standard system is that M\nbe irreducible. Some sufficient conditions for uniqueness, but not existence, of positive\nprice solutions are that M be basic or weak basic, of positive multiplier solutions that M\nbe apic or weak apic, of positive solutions of either sort that M have a simple ([2], p. 34)\ndominant characteristic value.\n\nA word of caution. Two non-negative square matrices can be as close together as\ndesired in each entry and yet each have just one positive characteristic vector direction,\nthose directions making an angle of over 89? with each other. Their characteristic vector\ndirections are not continuous functions ([22], p. 9) of their entries. However, the dominant\ncharacteristic value of a non-negative square matrix is a continuous function of its entries\n([9], p. 80). If the non-negative square matrices M and M* are close to each other their\ndominant characteristic values \u00ab and \u00ab* are close to each other. If other complex ([19],\npp. 1-7) characteristic values of the non-negative square matrix M are not close to its\ndominant characteristic value then a small change in M produces a small change in the\ndirection of the characteristic vector with dominant characteristic value. But if the dominant\ncharacteristic value is a multiple root of, or is near other roots of, the characteristic poly-\nnomial of M then small changes in M can produce swingeing changes in the non-negative\ncharacteristic vectors of M ([1], [7], [18], [19], [20]).\n\nState University of New York at Buffalo G.

In both of these calculations\nit would be important not to rely on erroneously measured residual growth in total output\nfor measurement of the social return to investment.\n\nIt is obvious that further disaggregation of our measurements would be valuable in\norder to provide a more stringent test of the basic hypothesis that growth in output may\nbe explained by growth in input. The most important disaggregation of this type is to\nestimate levels of output and input by individual industries. The statistical raw material\nfor disaggregation by industry is already available for stocks of labour and capital and\nlevels of output. However, data for relative utilization of labour and capital and for\ndisaggregation of different types of labour and capital within industry groups would have\nto be developed. Once these data are available, it will be possible to estimate rates of\nreturn to capital for individual industries and to study the effects of the distribution of\nproductive factors among industries along the lines suggested by Massell [43]. The\nfact that past observations do not reveal significant changes in productivity does not imply\nthat the existing allocation of productive resources is efficient relative to allocations that\ncould be brought about by policy changes. In such a study it might be useful to extend\nthe scope of productivity measurements to include the government sector. This would\nbe particularly desirable if educational investment, which is largely produced in that\nsector, is to be incorporated into total output.\n\nFinally, our results suggest a new point of departure for econometric studies of\nproduction function at every level of aggregation. While some existing studies [29, 30]\nemploy data on output, labour, and capital corrected for errors of measurement along the\nlines we have suggested, most estimates of production functions are based on substantial\nerrors of measurement. Econometric production functions are not an alternative to our\nmethods for measuring total factor productivity, but rather supplement these methods in a\nnumber of important respects. Such production functions provide one means of testing\nthe assumptions of constant returns to scale and equality between price ratios and marginal\nrates of transformation that underlie our measurement. A complete test of the hypothesis\nthat growth in total output may be explained by growth in total input requires the measure-\nment of input within a unified social accounting framework, the measurement of rates of\nreturn to both human and physical capital, further disaggregation, and new econometric\nstudies of production functions. A start has been made on this task, but much interesting\nand potentially fruitful research remains to be done.\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley D. W. JORGENSON\nUniversity of Chicago Z.

The weaknesses of simple adaptive\nexpectations models have been discussed at length elsewhere and need not be restated here.\nHowever, several problems associated with the stock adjustment model deserve a short\ndiscussion.\n\nIndividual economic units may plan portfolio adjustments at unchanged money prices,\nbut for the community as a whole equilibrium real balances and actual real balances must\nbe reconciled through changes in the level of money prices. If prices adjust instantaneously\n(in the unit period) when excess demands appear, equation (7) must describe lags arising\nfrom the delayed adjustment of individuals. Persons may be regarded as choosing a path\nthat maximizes wealth (or utility) over the adjustment period, subject to the cost of adjust-\nment. When the cost of adjustment increases with the speed of adjustment, the optimum\npath will be of the general form described by (7). The coefficient \u00f3, is then a function of\nthe rate of discount, which for this problem is the money rate of interest; ? variance of\nthe lag structures may simply reflect failure to specify this dependence in a period when\nthere has been large variance in the money rate of interest. At the other extreme, if the\ncosts of adjustments are independent of the speed, persons will attempt to adjust im-\nmediately. The lags implied by (7) therefore arise from lags of money prices in response\nto excess demands. Unfortunately, economic theory has little to say about the form\nthat such adjustments should take, and the variance of the imposed lag structure may\nresult because (7) is not the correct form of this adjustment. A more complete analysis\nwould separately specify these two sources of disequilibrium.\n\nIV. SUMMARY\n\nThe main findings of the study may be outlined topically: (1) the introduction of\nsecond-order Pascal distributions leads to the conclusion that geometrically decaying\nweight structures do not work as well as ones that peak in the second or third period;\n(2) the evidence is consistent with long and variable lags,? but the demand elasticities are\nnot very sensitive to alternative lag patterns; (3) the demand functions are interest inelastic,\nand the narrow definition of money is the luxury asset with an income elasticity of 2,\nwhile the broad definition has an income elasticity of 1; (4) events associated with World\nWar II induced an increase of 20-25 per cent in the desired level of real money holdings;\nand (5) the estimated equation for the broad definition of money has the smallest un-\nexplained variance and yields the best explanation of the rate of change of prices.\n\nUniversity of Washington. ALLAN HYNES.\n\n1 See Nerlove and Wage, loc. cit.\n2 The general structure of these problems is to find a path that maximizes the integral\n\nI 7 e-\"GLf(mG)) \u2014c(ri())]dv\n\nwhere f( ) describes the returns from holding real balances and c( ) describes the costs of altering port-\nfolios. When the integrand is concave with respect to m and ri (a case represented by strictly decreasing\nreturns and increasing costs), the solution is a path of the form given by (7); this follows from the catenary\nproperty of the solution to the Euler equation. For a more complete description of these problems, see\nP. A. Samuelson, * A Catenary Turnpike Theorem \"*, American Economic Review, 55 (June 1965), 486-495;\na special case is considered by R. Strotz and R. Eisner, * Determinants of Investment \", in Impacts of\nMonetary Policy, C.M.C. (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1963) ch. i.\n\n3 Finally, it should be noted that these results are not directly comparable to those of Harberger, /oc.\ncit. In his annual regressions, Professor Harberger regresses the rate of change of prices on the contem-\nporaneous rate of change in the nominal quantity of money, on the rate of change of the nominal quantity\nof money lagged one period, on the rate of change of real income and on the first difference of the rate of\nchange of prices; all rates are percentages. These regressions are best regarded as the reduced form of a\nlarger, though unspecified, structural system rather than as a transformation of a particular specification of\nthe liquidity preference function.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:43:17 UTC\nA]I use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In the inverse demand function (1), then, y; is replaced by a vector of prices\nof other commodites. This is the case of a monopolistically competitive firm, i.e. one of\nmany small firms belonging to the same industry and selling commodities differentiated\nfrom each other, while the case of Davis and Whinston is typically a monopoly (or a\nduopoly of private and public firms).\n\nSuppose, as in Negishi [2], some firms are monopolistically competitive. The perceived\ndemand curve for each differentiated product is assumed to be like (3) but y2; is replaced\nby a vector of other prices. It must be noted, in this case, that the second best condition\nfor the other firms, private or public, is simply the Paretian condition and nothing else.\nThe economic system is perfectly separable in terms of decision units and there is no place\nfor second best policies.\n\nUniversity of Tokyo TAKASHI NEGISHI.\n\nREFERENCES\n[I] Davis, Otto A. and Whinston, Andrew B.

By contrast, the typical situation in a *' free \" but\n* manipulated \" economy is that most or even all the behaviour functions are given and\nso must be added to the list of constraints. At the same time, the authorities have at their\ncommand a set of policy instruments which enter these functions as arguments. The\noptimum is then found by maximizing welfare subject to all the constraints over the\ndomain of these instruments. Indeed the whole problem has little practical interest without\nsome such explicit policy formulation.\n\nUniversity of Birmingham M.

It\nmay not suffice to choose i'(X) so as to make XH,\u00ab(1\u2014 HrE)(XF,-- ZF;.) at the point of\nequilibrium. This is necessary and sufficient for /ocal stability of equilibrium; but if\nelsewhere in R the opposite inequality continues to hold, global stability is not necessarily\nattained. The economy might settle down to a new limit cycle, separated from the equi-\nlibrium by another (unstable) limit cycle. To obviate this possibility i'(x) should be chosen\nso that xH,\u00ab(1 \u2014 Hg)(xF,4-zF,) throughout R. This is sufficient for global stability of\nthe equilibrium. The proof is as follows:\n\n(i) If xH, \u00ab(1 \u2014 Hg)(xF,-- zF,) for all (x, v) in R, there is no limit cycle. For let us\ndivide the right-hand side of S; by the positive function xv$(x), obtaining the system\n\nx- 1 [H(x, F(x, z)) \u2014 F(x, z)]\nv\n\n)-\u2014 n\u2014g(x) 53\n\"7 x\u00e9Q) e\nz \u2014 x[v.\n\nThe trajectories of X in the x, v plane are the same as those of S,. For both families of\ntrajectories satisfy the differential equation\n\ndx \u2014 x\u00e9GOLH (x, Fes, 2))\u2014 FGs, 2)]\ndv v(n\u2014g(3)) :\nThus it is sufficient to show that under the postulated condition X has no limit cycle. Now\n\nif X has a limit cycle the expression x Es x must change sign in R (see, e.g. [9], p. 176).\nx U\n\n(ii) We know that every positive half-trajectory, C*, of S; is contained in a compact\nset in R, so that its limit set, L(C^), is not empty. Given that L(C*) does not contain a\nperiodic orbit, it must consist either of the unique equilibrium point alone, or of that point\ntogether with a set of limiting trajectories each of which tends to the equilibrium point both\nas t -- oo and as t \u2014 oo ([2], Theorem 3.1). But the second possibility is ruled out by\nthe fact that the equilibrium is a node or a focus. Hence L(C ^) consists of the unique\nequilibrium point.\n\nTo explain the continuing presence of the employment cycle we do not need to believe\nthat no stabilizing interest-policy exists. Even if such policies can be found in theory, it\nmust be a matter of great practical difficulty to discover the minimum financial stringency\ncalled for, and also to exert the requisite control over the supply of money. And, of course,\nthere are the often competing objectives of interest-rate policy: the control of international\ncapital movements and the management of the National Debt.\n\nUniversity of Rochester.

            "found": "CAPITAL-THEORETIC MODEL OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE 187\n\nThe hypothesis receives its strongest confirmation from the coefficients on the cost-of-\ncapital variables, which may be regarded as crucial in a test of a capital-theoretic view of\ntechnology. In regressions 1 through 4, where the level and difference variables appear\nseparately, both variables have the predicted sign and (roughly) the predicted relative\nmagnitudes. In regressions 5 through 8 the composite cost of capital variable is significantly\nnegative, and in regression 7, which gives perhaps the ** sharpest \" estimate of b,, the cost\nof capital coefficient is well over six times its standard error. The variation of 5, in Table I,\nwhich is discouraging from the point of view of estimation, is not present in the more\nrestrictive regressions of Table II.\n\nWith the exception of b, in regressions 7 and 8, the capital variables have also performed\nroughly as predicted. When K(t\u20142) and AK(t \u2014 1) appear unrestricted, under hypothesis\n(13), the coefficient of K(t\u20142) varies depending on whether time is included or excluded.\nWhen these variables are combined into a single variable, under (14), the time variable\n* picks up \" more of the downward trend and becomes significantly negative. In these\nlatter regressions, the composite capital variable is consistently positive. In addition to the\n** trendlike \" movements in capital stock, which make it difficult to isolate its effects, we\nnote that, as mentioned in the discussion of the hypotheses of Solow and Arrow, changes in\ncapital stock may influence technology in ways other than those predicted by the theory of\nsections 2 and 3. This raises the broader question of whether one might reasonably expect\nthat the view of technological change taken in this paper should preclude or replace alterna-\ntive theories, or whether it should be regarded as complementary to them. Certainly the\nlatter view is the more promising one, which suggests that using the erratic behaviour of b,\nas a clue to revision and extension of the hypothesis may be more profitable than attempting\nto explain it away.\n\nStatistically, then, our results reject quite strongly the view that the rate of technological\nadvance in manufacturing is unaffected by market forces. When the coefficients in our\nbasic regression equation are constrained as suggested by the theory (Table III), the interest\nrate or cost-of-capital coefficient is highly significant and has the predicted sign. Thus, even\nif, as many economists believe, decisions of households as between present and future\nincome are relatively insensitive to interest rate changes, it may well be that the analogous\nchoice on the part of firms is significantly affected by interest rates.\n\nBefore the statistical significance of the interest rate coefficient has economic meaning,\nhowever, it is necessary to get some '' feel \" for its magnitude, or in other words, to ask\nwhether \u2014 0-124 (regression 7), represents a **large \" or a \"*' small\" interest rate effect.\nGiven the units in which v(r) and r(r) are measured, the coefficient 55, divided by mean\nquarterly output (71:25) and multiplied by 400, is a measure of the percentage point increase\nin the technological component of the annual rate of growth of manufacturing output\nwhich will be induced by a one percentage point fall in the cost of capital. Using\nb, \u2014 \u20140:124, this calculation gives a figure of 0-7. Thus, to take an example, if manu-\nfacturing output is growing at 3 per cent per year at a cost-of-capital of 10 per cent per year,\na reduction in the cost-of-capital to 9 per cent should induce an increase in the growth rate\nto 3-7 per cent. From the work of Denison [6] we know that a one percentage point\nincrease in the growth rate represents a large effect indeed of a growth acceleration policy.\nOur figures suggest that such an effect can be achieved in the manufacturing sector by a\nreduction in the cost of capital of less than two percentage points. It should be emphasized\nthat this is over and above any effect which a reduction in interest rates would have on\ninvestment in physical capital: it measures the interest rate effect on the *' residual \" or\n* technological \" component of the growth rate only. One must be careful not to overstate\nthe precision of this estimate, but it is surely large enough to give some interest to the further\ndevelopment and testing of hypotheses of the sort advanced in this paper.\n\nCarnegie Institute of Technology.

CONCLUSIONS GENERALES\n\nComme dans bien des probl\u00e9mes d'agr\u00e9gation les r\u00e9sultats obtenus sont d\u00e9cevants\nencore qu'instructifs. Pour qu'il y ait agr\u00e9gation il faut qu'il y ait quasi-identit\u00e9 entre\nles types de fonctions de production consid\u00e9r\u00e9es. A part des diff\u00e9rences irr\u00e9ductibles entre\nles surfaces de base, les variations \u00e0 partir de ces surfaces de base sont les m\u00e9mes dans\nleur ensemble pour toutes les techniques consid\u00e9r\u00e9es, le rep\u00e9rage de ces variations pouvant\ncependant \u00e9tre diff\u00e9rent et correspondre peut-\u00e9tre physiquement \u00e0 des gains (ou pertes)\nrelatifs dou\u00e9s d'un sens \u00e9conomique. Ces \u00e9tudes sugg\u00e9reraient donc de classer les diff\u00e9r-\nences entre fonctions de production en diff\u00e9rences irr\u00e9ductibles et au contraire en points\ncommuns, ces derniers \u00e9tant seuls susceptibles d'agr\u00e9gation.\n\nOn rejoint ainsi des id\u00e9es intuitives en m\u00e9me temps que l'on pr\u00e9cise les raisons\nd'examiner avec beaucoup d'esprit critique les ajustements tent\u00e9s de facon empirique.\n\nIl est aussi extr\u00e9mement important de noter que les hypoth\u00e9ses faites sont essentielle-\nment des hypoth\u00e9ses de convexit\u00e9 (ou ce qui revient au m\u00e9me de concavit\u00e9). Or il est\nbien certain que la recherche de progr\u00e9s dans les techniques conduit, heureusement\nd'ailleurs, \u00e0 des rendements croissants dans une certaine z\u00f3ne d'utilisation optimum,\navant que les rendements baissent au-del\u00e0 de cette z\u00f3ne. Dans ces conditions en admettant\nune r\u00e9partition physiquement optimum des ressources ce sont d'abord les techniques les\nplus productives qui sont employ\u00e9es au moins dans certaines z\u00f3nes avant que d'autres\ntechniques moins productives le soient. Ceci est particuli\u00e9rement net avec l'emploi de\nmod\u00e9les de programmation lin\u00e9aire.\n\nS'il est certain que les hypoth\u00e9ses de cette programmation ne peuvent \u00e9tre valables\ndans la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 pour des valeurs infinies des variables concern\u00e9es il n'en demeure pas moins\nque si les \u00e9tudes a priori d'agr\u00e9gation sont utiles pour reconnaitre le bien fond\u00e9 de pro-\nc\u00e9dures d'ajustement ou d'analyse des donn\u00e9es statistiques, il est aussi indispensable,\nsurtout apr\u00e9s de tels r\u00e9sultats, d'\u00e9tudier directement la composition (ce terme \u00e9tant pris\ndans un sens distinct d'agr\u00e9gation qui, dans la litt\u00e9rature \u00e9conomique a fini par prendre\nsurtout le sens de simplification par r\u00e9duction drastique des param\u00e9tres a priori consid\u00e9r\u00e9s)\nde fonctions de production (ou d'autre nature selon le cas). Le probl\u00e9me le plus important\nest sans doute la recherche de z\u00f3nes ou bien de paliers o\u00fc\u00e0 cette composition garde la\nm\u00e9me forme et des seuils o\u00e0 des changements se produisent. La programmation lin\u00e9aire\navec sa prise de conscience de fonctions lin\u00e9aires par morceaux, de faces variables, etc.\n\n. est encore un bon exemple des directions de recherche les plus utiles.\n\nEnfin l'aspect alg\u00e9brique des op\u00e9rations introduites, l'importance des r\u00e9sultats obtenus\n\u00e0 moindre peine et dans des conditions tr\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sans utilisation du calcul diff\u00e9rentiel,\nmais par traduction globale des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s physiques ou \u00e9conomiques, donnent du point\nde vue technique de recherche et nature du probl\u00e9me de l'agr\u00e9gation des indications encore\nvagues, mais de toutes facons pr\u00e9cieuses, sur l'int\u00e9r\u00e9t d'essayer d'unifier la structure de\nnombreux probl\u00e9mes d'agr\u00e9gation non seulement pour mieux les r\u00e9soudre mais aussi\npour mieux appr\u00e9cier leur consistance et juger s'ils ont un v\u00e9ritable int\u00e9r\u00e9t.\n\nFacult\u00e9 des Sciences de Caen A.

To\nanswer this question we neglect the gain of utility in later periods, if the utility function is\nbounded, for it is difficult to estimate. Clearly, as we have seen in our discussion of un-\nbounded utility functions, the gain in utility would be infinite for unbounded utility\nfunctions.

One\nsuch model, involving fixed coefficients, was just exhibited by way of illustration. On the\nother hand, macroeconomic distribution theories of the Kaldor type which provided the\nspringboard for Pasinetti's general analysis, must now be given brief notice here.\n\nSuch models fare best under the assumption of fixed coefficients, for if smooth marginal\nproductivities were well defined one would have no need for a genuinely alternative theory\nof distribution.! So recognizing the empirical oddity of the postulate, we posit last\n\n1 This sentence is worded cryptically and could be misunderstood. Marginal productivity, properly\nunderstood, provides some of the equations needed in a smooth neoclassical model for a complete theory\nof (factor and goods) pricing. Depending upon the time run, parameters of population growth (like z)\nand saving propensities (like s; or s,,) also contribute blades of the scissors needed to determine equilibrium.\nThe model defined by our equations (1)-(4), precisely because it possesses some simplifications of a neo-\nclassical model (effectively one-sector, effectively one capital good, etc.), is useful to contrast with what\nappear to be some Cambridge attributions of causation. To test the cogency of a line of logic and the\nuniversality of an hypothesized direction of causation, it is valuable to apply them to bor our neoclassical\nmodel azd the fixed coefficient model of this section\u2014and to certain intermediate cases involving a finite\nnumber of alternative activities or blueprints.\n\nSpecifically, assume s,/s. small, and consider f'/(k*) \u2014 r* \u2014 n/s.. Then, in our model, marginal\nproductivity does ** determine \"* the profit or interest rate at every instant of time, but that doesn't deny\nthat n/s. also does ** determine \"* the interest rate in the long run. Both blades of the long-run scissors\ncount. When we have two long-run unknowns\u2014kK* and r*\u2014the presence of two independent equations\nis not an inconsistency; it is a necessity. Because the long-run *' supply curve \"' is given by the horizontal\nlevel n/s,, while the long-run demand curve is the varying function f '(k*), there is a genuine sense of long-\nrun causation, which we share and also neoclassical writers share with Cambridge writers (like Kahn\nquoted below), that says: n[s.\u2014long-run r*.\n\nBut all of the above is quite consistent with short-run causation that runs in quite the opposite direction.\nIn each short run, let k(f) \u2014 K/L be given by past history. This provides us with a vertical short-run supply\nschedule, which intersects the f'/(K) schedule of demand. In the short run, for the model of (1)-(4), the\n** true * causation seen, in every instant of time, K(\u00a3)\u2014f '[k(t)] \u2014 r(fr). For this model, capital scarcity\nrelative to labour is the key to the level of the rate of interest.

(If\none wants to trace short-run effective demand sequences, the Central Bank ensures that the market interest\nrate, R, is put above and below the f''(k) \u2014 r level, just enough to induce full-employment investment\nwithout inflationary or deflationary gaps.) The full-employment growth path of the system as determined\nby its differential equations is causal, in the same sense that the trajectories of the planets around the sun,\nfollowing their Newtonian differential equations, are termed causal. This is a third meaning of causality\nin the present context, alongside the long term causal chain n/s,\u2014r* and the short-run chain kf '(k) \u2014 r.\n\nWarning: in a two-sector neoclassical model, where the sectors have different intensities and with\nproduction-possibility frontier K \u2014 T(K, L; C), k(t)f '[k(t)] \u2014 r(\u00a3), would be replaced by\n\n[Kst), KE); se, s] Le, Ko, ky, r \u2014 9TJ0K \u2014 eKJOK]\nand where we would have to take into account the possibility of multiplicity of short-run equilibria (as\ne.g. in the anti-Pasinetti case where s, \u2014 s, and capital goods production is sufficiently more relatively\ncapital-intensive than consumption goods production) and of long run equilibria (as in the case just\nmentioned, where the ratio of the value of capital to output might fa// while r falls).\n\nIn a general, neo-neoclassical model involving a great number of heterogeneous capital goods and\nprocesses, let [k1, Ko, ...] stand for a vector of per capita capital goods.

Since these assumptions are\nnot needed, it is not surprising that all these theories should appear so naive. They clearly\nought to be stripped of the unnecessary assumptions which have been superimposed on\nthem (for example that the capital-output ratio is a declining function of the rate of profit,\nthat the wage rate should be zero if just one worker is unemployed, etc.). Then, I should\nguess, they would appear far less naive than they have been made out to be.\n\nAs a general remark, Professors Samuelson and Modigliani correctly point out that\nrelation (1) is one of great generality, and is valid independently of any particular theory\nof income distribution. It may be useful to add that one should not infer from this that\nrelation (1) is irrelevant for such theories. It is, in fact, a necessary ingredient of all of\nthem (except of those that assume income distribution to be given). In particular, it is\nrelevant to Professor Kaldor's theory of income distribution more than to any other.\n\n7. Finally, I should like to add a few words on the warning that the reader is given\nat the end of the introductory section and\u2014more emphatically\u2014at the end of the paper.\nProfessors Samuelson and Modigliani emphasize that there is an assumption on which\nrelation (1) depends crucially, namely the assumption of *' permanent classes of income\nreceivers ?'.1\n\nThis insistence on pointing out the assumptions underlying new results is indeed\ncommendable, although it ought to be completed, it seems to me, with mentioning also\nthe assumptions on which the new results no longer depend, and on which the previous\ntheories which they replace did depend.\n\nIt may be worth pointing out, nevertheless, that there is at least one important case\nin which the assumption that Professors Samuelson and Modigliani stress so much is\nno longer an assumption and becomes a fact. This is the case of an economic system\nin which the means of production are owned by the State. I called such a situation, for\nthe sake of brevity, the case of a socialist system. Professors Samuelson and Modigliani\nhave dismissed it too quickly. They have simply concentrated on objecting that, in this\ncase, 5, is not necessarily unity\u2014which is a point of secondary importance, since efficient\npositions are always possible, never necessary, in a socialist system. What is more\nimportant, in such a case, is that the relevant propensity to save, namely s,, becomes the\nsaving propensity of the State. Therefore, whether it is equal to, or different from, unity,\nit becomes the saving propensity of a permanent saver.\n\nLuici L.

In order to show\nthat a Harrod equilibrium is possible for all values of s and n, the professors postulate a\n* well behaved \" pseudo-production function, with K/Y a smooth, continuous decreasing\nfunction of the rate of profit. They now admit (in footnote 1, pp. 290-1) that there is no\nlogical reason why the pseudo-production function should be of this form. They just assume\nthat it is so. After putting the rabbit into the hat in full view of the audience it does not\nseem necessary to make so much fuss about drawing it out again.\n\nBut it is not sufficient to postulate that K/Y can assume any required value. Is there\nsome mechanism to cause it to be equal to s/n? For the professors this is no problem.\nSaving consists in accumulating putty. When s/n is greater than K/Y, putty per man\nemployed is rising as time goes by, the rate of profit falling and K/Y rising. Contrawise\nwhen K/Y is greater than s/n. Thus K/Y is always being pushed towards equality with\ns[n. Most oftheir paper seems to be concerned with an analysis of the process of accumulat-\ning putty under conditions of Say's Law.\n\nIt is a pity that Pasinetti seemed to encourage the tiresome neoclassical habit of\nconfusing comparisons of equilibria with historical processes by talking about an ultimate\nequilibrium which the economy is approaching. It would be better to say that a golden\nage is a logical construction without history, in which there is no distinction between the\nfuture and the past. In a Pasinetti golden age the two classes always have been saving in\nthe postulated proportions and already own the corresponding shares in the stock of\ncapital.\n\nIn a Harrod golden age, putty or not, P, annual net profit, is equal to -- (1 \u20145)P \u20145W,\nbut to know the rate of profit, P/K, we have to look at the pseudo-production function\nto find K. We know that K/Y is equal to s/n, simply because if it were not this would not\nbe a Harrod golden age. \"Thus, given s, 7 and a *'* well behaved \" pseudo-production\nfunction there is one rate of profit at which a Harrod golden age is not impossible; if the\npseudo-production function is badly behaved there may be several or none; with Pasinetti\nassumptions there can be a golden age at any rate of profit with any pseudo-production\nfunction provided s, Y \u00abs,rK; when s, \u2014 0 a golden age is possible at any rate of profit;\nin the von Neumann or neo-neoclassical optimum golden age s, \u2014 0, s, \u2014 1 and the rate\nof profit is equal to the rate of growth.\n\nWhen the shape of the pseudo-production function and the behaviour of savings\nor the initial conditions are such that no golden age is possible, it does not mean that the\neconomy will not support life. It only means that steady growth would not be associated\nwith a constant rate of profit. For instance, when, at a particular moment, the share of\ncapital owned by workers is less than proportionate to their share in savings, the rate of\nprofit corresponding to a given rate of growth is less than that shown by Pasinetti's formula.\nAs the share of capital owned by workers grows relatively to total capital, as time goes\nby, so that the share of profit accruing to workers rises, expenditure out of profits increases\n(since 5, \u00ab5,) while the saving out of wages remains constant, so that the rate of profit\ncorresponding to any given rate of accumulation is rising through time.\n\nThis must be supposed to have repercussions upon the rate of accumulation and the\nchoice of technique, which we must then bring into the story.\n\nThe assumptions about savings that have been offered so far\u2014s, \u2014 0, 0 \u00abs, \u00abs,\nand s, \u2014 s,\u2014provide models that are extremely simple. Before appealing to reality,\nand claiming support from statistics about the U.S.A., we need to allow for some further\ncomplications, including the fact that no period of actual history is a golden age.\n\nCambridge JOAN ROBINSON.\nThis content downloaded from\n\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:58:52 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Unless they make a more imaginative effort to reconcile their\ntheoretical framework with the known facts of experience, their economic theory is\nbound to remain a barren exercise. One is reminded of what Clapham wrote 44 years\nago: *I have a fear lest a theory of value which should prove permanently unable to\nstate of what particular and individual values some of its more important conclusions\nwere true might in the long run be neglected by mankind.\" !\n\nKing's College, Cambridge NICHOLAS KALDOR.\n\nAPPENDIX\nA Neo-Pasinetti Theorem?\n\nDr Pasinetti has shown that on certain conditions the rate of profit, in a true long-run\nGolden Age equilibrium, will be independent of the rate of savings of ** workers \"', because\nthe additional consumption generated out of the workers' property income will offset\ntheir savings out of wage-income. The difficulty with this proposition (apart from the\nfact that it is * very long run \") is that it assumes that workers spend the same fraction of\ntheir income, irrespective of whether it accrues to them as property income or wages. In a\nworld where enterprises are organised as corporations, and property-income takes the\nform of dividends, this would imply (as Professors Samuelson and Modigliani point out)\noverspending their dividend income by the exact fraction required to make their con-\nsumption equal to (1\u20145,)P,, irrespective of the division of profits between corporate\nretentions and dividends.\n\nMoreover once we allow spending in excess of divided income, there is no reason\nto confine such spending to workers. '' Capitalists * also spend some part of their capital\ngains (or even their capital, in the absence of such gains), and as Professor Modigliani\nhas reminded us, the limited length of human life must add to such temptations.\n\nHence at any time there must be capitalists (or shareholders) who over-spend their\ncurrent (dividend) income, (and the same must be true of course of retired workers who\nconsume over the years of retirement their accumulated savings) just as there are active\nworkers who save a certain fraction of their income for retirement. Just as net saving\nout of income sets up a demand for securities, net dis-saving out of income (\u2014 net con-\nsumption out of capital or capital gains) sets up a supply of securities. There is also a\nnet supply of new securities issued by the corporate sector. Since, in the securities! market\nprices will tend to a level at which the total (non-speculative) supply and demand for\nsecurities are equal, there must be some mechanism to ensure that the spending out of\ncapital (or capital gains) just balances the savings out of income /ess any new securities\nissued by corporations.\n\nLet us divide the community into wage and salary earners (W) who save (through\nthe intermediaries of pension funds and insurance companies) some fraction of their\nincome during their working life and consume it in retirement; so long as the population\nis rising and income per head is rising, the savings of the working population must exceed\nthe dis-savings of the retired population by an amount which can be expressed as some\nfraction (s,) of current wage-and-salary income. (I am assuming also that s, is net of\npersonal investment in consumer durables, i.e. in housing.)\n\n1 Economic Journal, December 1922, p. 561.\n\n2 | should like to acknowledge the benefits from discussions with F.

It appeared\nthat this result held even when direct labour alone was considered. It also held when\nthe production funcions for direct labour were estimated directly using data on measured\nman hours. However such data are in principle subject to a measurement error due to the\ndifference between nominal and measured man hours. An attempt to take this measure-\nment error into account in estimating the production functions, resulted in sharp reductions\nin a number of the labour input elasticities, which made it doubtful whether the labour\ninput elasticities obtained from the employment functions could be identified with the\n** true \" short-term production function elasticities.\n\nThe estimated elasticities from the employment functions for total labour and the\nspeeds of adjustment were found to be correlated with the average rates of unemployment\nover the sample period. We were not able to establish the extent to which the former\ncorrelation was due to increasing returns at high rates of unemployment, or to shifts in\nthe equilibrium level of productive man hours. The latter correlation is plausibly explained\nin terms of greater flexibility of hiring and firing in relatively depressed industries.\n\nLondon Graduate School of R. J.

By and\nlarge, they show the same pattern as that of the ** total \" inaccuracy. Each cell of the\ntable contains four numbers. \"The first corresponds to the independence prediction (2.2),\nthe second to $7 as defined in (2.5). This second value is in almost all cases considerably\nless than the first. The third value of each cell corresponds to fj, the fourth to RAS.\n\"They are both better than $\u00e0 in a majority of all cases, but the majority is not overwhelming\n(less than 60 per cent). When comparing the various cells, we find that the largest figures\nare those of the Communist countries. This is the effect of a particular trade policy as\nwill be explained in some detail in the next section.\n\nVI. TRACING THE E.E.C. AND THE\nCOMMUNIST POLICY EFFECTS\n\nIn concluding we want to pay some attention to the possibility of using information\nanalysis to the problem of tracing certain special developments. For this purpose we\nreturn to the mutual information concept (2.3),\n\nlog \u2014U., (6.1)\n\nAs stated above, this logarithm is positive when the flow from ito j is above the independence\nlevel, negative when it is below that level, and it takes algebraically larger values when the\nflow from i to j increases relative to the total exports of i and the total imports of j. It\nseems clear that the development of this logarithmic ratio should enable us, at least in\nprinciple, to draw interesting conclusions about the changes in the trade pattern. In the\npresent case we have only four observations on each mutual information, but it is never-\ntheless instructive to consider a few cases.\n\nOne such case is that of the Communist countries (region 7). For the trade between\nthese countries we consider (6.1) with ij \u2014 j \u2014 7, which takes the following values:\n\n1938 0-619\n1948 2-663\n1951-52 2-973\n1959-60 2-408\n\nThese figures clearly indicate that the countries involved concentrated their trade among\neach other after the War. Of course, this feature is well known, but it is interesting to see\nthat it can be measured quantitatively. There are no other diagonal values (6.1) which\nare larger than 2. This explains the fact that the Communist figures of Table III are mostly\nso much larger than the figures of the other regions.\n\nAnother interesting case is that of Germany (region 3) and other E.E.C. countries\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 21:03:03 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The differences\nbetween the various forecasts are rather small, however, so that we may decide to expand\nthe inaccuracy according to powers of j$\u2014 5. The leading non-zero term is quadratic\nand is proportional to a chi-square:\n\nV V ($ \" umi $ ay 3 6\nM ...(3.6)\nizij-1 f\u00fc\n\nSo we minimize the quadratic form (3.6) subject to the linear constraints (3.5), which is a\nstraightforward procedure.! The information inaccuracy values are shown in. each cell\nof Table I (second number). The results indicate that there is a uniform improvement\nover the method (2.5). We conclude that it is important to take the marginal constraints\n\nseriously.\n\nIV. THE FOURTH METHOD: RAS\n\nThe method employed by M. Waelbroeck himself is the RAS method, which was\noriginally designed by Stone and Brown [3] for the adjustment of input coefficient matrices.\nIt amounts to the computation of n values r; and n values s; such that\n\njer; hjeol n (4.1)\n\nsatisfies the constraints\n\nn n\n\nY fj-rn Y oxus;y i-i..n\nj*1 j*1\nn n ...(4.2)\n\u00bb $5 \u2014-8j \u00bb\u00bb Xygri-yg joel s.n.\ni-1 i-1\nThe inaccuracy values are shown on the third line of each cell of Table I. They turn out\nto be of the same order of magnitude as those of the first line, which is not really surprising.\nIf we would identify r; with y; [x;, and s; with y.;/x,;, the forecast (4.1) would be the same\nas y; defined in (2.4).? This identification is not really correct, of course, since f;; does\nand yj; does not satisfy the marginal constraints. But if we adjust y;; such that these\nconstraints are satisfied, it stands to reason that the result 5 will not differ very much from\n$i. Therefore, the RAS method can be regarded as being approximately equivalent to\nthe information criterion when the y;; do not violate the marginal constraints too seriously.\n\nV. THE INFORMATION INACCURACY OF FORECASTS OF IMPORT AND\nEXPORT DISTRIBUTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL REGIONS\n\nUntil now we considered the problem of the prediction of all n? shares y;; in world\ntrade. We may also be interested in the prediction of the destination distribution of all\nexports from a given region i to all regions, y;j[y;., j \u2014 1, ..., n, or in the origin distribution\nof all imports to a given region J, y;j|y.j, i \u2014 l, ..., nr.

Note that it is immaterial for\n\nfi; whether we use f, in (3.6) or y;j. Hence the proportional adjustment of the preliminary forecasts is\n\nnot really necessary. . .\n2 Actually, the iterative procedure which leads to the RAS forecasts starts in the first round with\nprecisely these r, and s, values.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 21:03:03 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

For the simple independence method (2.2) there is, of course,\nonly one set of predictions for each year. The following are its inaccuracy values:\n\n1938 0-2061 bit\n1948 0-2540 bit\n1951-52 0-3479 bit\n1959-60 0-3532 bit\n\nThe values are increasing over time, which implies a trend away from independence.\n\nThe figures just given must be regarded as a kind of upper limit to the inaccuracy\nvalue obtained by the use of more sophisticated prediction procedures. Table I shows\nthe extent to which this is indeed the case. Each cell of the table consists of three figures,\n\nTABLE I\n\nInformation inaccuracy values of four alternative prediction methods\n\nYear to be predicted\n\nBase year\n1938 1948 1951-52 1959-60\n1938 1146 1616 1728\n995 1553 1701\n996 1552 1702\n1948 2908 964 1747\n2702 906 1479\n2617 900 1439\n1951-52 2478 994 456\n2402 948 338\n2367 948 340\n1959-60 1572 920 320\n1511 728 247\n1492 735 246\n\nNote\u2014All values are in 1074 bits.\n\nthe first of which refers to 92 as defined in (2.5); the second will be discussed at the end\nof this section, the third in the next section. On comparing the $7 figures with those of\nf ;; discussed above, we find that they are considerably lower except when 1938 is predicted\nby means of the early post-war data. Hence it is indeed true that we gain in prediction\naccuracy when we take account of the flow pattern of an earlier year.\n\nThe prediction method (2.5) has been derived from y;; as defined in (2.4) in such a\nway that it satisfies the constraint that the double sum over 5 be equalto 1. It is important\nto realize, however, that the single sum of these $2 over j is not equal to the y; which\nis taken as given, and that the sum of $2 over i is not equal to y. ;j This is pursued in\nTable IL, which contains y;, \u2014 Zy;; (sum over j) and y'; \u2014 Zyij; (sum over i) as well as\nthe observed y;, y,;. It turns out that the double sum y'. is close to 1 in all cases, so that\nthe correction (2.5) is of minor importance (at most 2 per cent and frequently much less).\nHowever, the discrepancies y; \u2014 y;; and y/;\u2014 y.; are larger. This difference between the\nbehaviour of sub-totals and grand total is not really surprising, which can be argued as\nfollows.\n\nLet us write\n\nyi, \u2014 (0\u00f3)x, y; \u2014 (0o ex. ...(3.1)\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 21:03:03 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Although there is undoubtedly some truth in this assumption, it is clearly of a very\napproximate nature. Some region i may export little to some other region j, in spite of\nsubstantial values of y; and y.;, simply because their distance is sizeable or because their\ngovernments have troubles with each other. Now some of these causes have a quasi-\npermanent character, such as distance and possibly political problems. It is therefore\nconceivable that we can improve on the prediction method (2.2) by taking account of the\nflow distribution in an earlier year. So we return to the year of our x;;.\n\nFor that year it will, generally, not be true that x;; \u2014 x; x; holds for all pairs (i, 7).\nThe left-hand side (x;;) will exceed the right-hand side for some pairs\u2014those whose trade\n'with each other is above the independence level\u2014and it will be below the right-hand side\nfor other pairs\u2014those whose mutual trade is at below-independence level. We shall now\nask the question to what extent it is reasonable to assume that the ratios\n\nOu 2 XulX.. Q3)\nXx, XQ Xj\nX.X.\n\nare constant over time, for which purpose we consider the following possibilities:\n\n(1) Suppose that there is an increase in world trade which is uniform in the sense\nthat all interregional flows increase proportionally. Obviously, the ratios (2.3) then\nremain constant.\n\n(2) Suppose that the exports of region i increase relative to world trade, so that\nx, \u2014 X;|X,. takes a larger value. Since X, is the sum over j of X;;, at least some of\nthe flows X;,, X;,, ... must increase too. If we assume that i's export expansion is uniform\nin the sense that X;, increases proportionally with X; for each j, the ratio (2.3) remains\nconstant as far as the concepts involving i subscripts are concerned. Of course, if X;,\nincreases this has its implications for X ;, the total imports of region 7, which also occurs\nin (2.3); and the relative increase of i's exports implies necessarily that some other region's\nexports show a relative decline, which has its impact on X; as well. If we assume that\nthe ratio (2.3) remains constant in the present situation, we cannot guarantee that the\nmarginal constraints EX;  \u2014 X; (sum over i) are satisfied. [We shall shortly see that\nthere is a good reason for not giving such a guarantee.] Nevertheless, predicting on the\nbasis of constant ratios (2.3) may lead to satisfactory results even though they are not\nperfect as in the previous case.\n\n(3) The third case is that of a region j whose imports X ; increase relative to world\ntrade, and it is supposed that the individual imports X,;, X,;, ... increase proportionally\nwith X ,. This case is completely symmetric with the second.\n\n(4) Suppose finally that i's total exports and j's total imports increase, both relative\nto world trade. Then i's exports to j, X;;, should increase even faster in order that the\nratio (2.3) remain unchanged, and X;, k 7 j and X,j, ^ x i not as fast as X;;. This is\nnot implausible either.\n\nIn summary, we shall attempt to predict the trade flows in the future year, given total\nexports and imports of each region, under the condition that the n? ratios (2.3) remain\nconstant. The logarithm of such a ratio is known in information theory (see e.g. [2],\npp. 30-31) as the mutual information between i and j, in this case: between the exporting\nregion i and the importing region j. The mutual information is evidently positive when\nthe trade from i to j is above the independence level, zero when it is at the independence\nlevel, and negative when it is below that level. So, under the assumption of unchanged\nmutual information we predict as follows:\n\n,\n\ni X, \"P\nXu -.. 4,J-7 1, (s H.\nYLY.;  **j\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 21:03:03 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

                    "The Information Approach to the\nPrediction of Interregional\nTrade Flows '\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nIn a recent article [5] published in the Cahiers \u00e9conomiques de Bruxelles Professor J.\nWaelbroeck analyzed world trade flows in a very interesting way. He took total exports\nto and total imports from each region as given and applied the RAS method\u2014-originally\nconstructed for input-output analysis\u2014to analyze the extent to which flows known\nfrom an earlier table can account for flows in a later year. The approach has some\nresemblance to certain aspects of bivariate information theory. The present paper takes\nthis theory as a starting point to provide an alternative method of analysis. The empirical\npart of the paper is based on the same data as those which are used by Waelbroeck. It\nturns out that the two methods yield virtually equivalent results, which is not really\nsurprising, but which sheds an interesting light on the nature of the RAS method.\n\nSection II considers international transaction shares from the standpoint of information\ntheory; section III considers some empirical results, and a third prediction method;\nsection IV the RAS method; section V, the information inaccuracy of forecasts of import\nand export distributions for individual regions; and section VI traces the E.E.C. and\nCommunist policy effects.\n\nIL. INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION SHARES FROM THE\nSTANDPOINT OF INFORMATION THEORY\n\nWe divide the world into \u00bb regions and indicate by X;; the flow of exports from\nregion i to region j, by X;, \u2014 \u00a3X; (sum over j) total exports from region i, by X, 2 XX;\n(sum over 7) total imports by region j, and by X, \u2014 X\u00a3ZX;; world trade. \"We divide all\nthese flows by world trade, so that we obtain\n\n-Xg Q 2X6 Q 2X3\n\nXy x. x \"cy ...(2.1)\n\nwhich are, respectively, the share of the flow from i to j in world trade, the share of i in\n\nworld exports, and the share of j in world imports. Since the x;; are non-negative and add\n\nup to 1, they can be regarded as probabilities of a bivariate distribution, and the x;, and\nx; as the corresponding marginal probabilities.\n\nWe assume that the flows X; refer to some previous year. Let it be our task to\npredict the flows for some later year, to be denoted by Y;; under the condition that the\nmarginal totals Y; , Y , are given. Hence it is sufficient to predict the shares y;; \u2014 Y,j/Y.,\ngiven all y; \u2014 Y;/[Y., and y; \u2014 Y j/Y., where Y, is the same function of Y;; as X.. is\nof X;;.\n\nOne prediction method is\n\np \u2014yiy; hLjol..n ...(2.2)\nwhich amounts to the assumption of import-export independence.

Output\ngrows more rapidly than investment. When there is some capital-augmentation, our\none-sector model begins to strain at the seams. The same gross output and the same\nconsumption at two different times mean two different things, because the ' same\"\nremaining gross investment generates more capacity at the later time. The classical\nproblem of the definition of * income\" arises. As Arrow has pointed out, for some\npossible definitions, the ratio of * saving \" to ** income \" is at least asymptotically constant.\n\nEven if m(t) is permitted to vary in time, a constant ratio of gross investment to gross\noutput is incompatible with exponentially-growing gross investment and exponentially\ngrowing employment.

Although we know that the investment and output\npaths are not exponential, we can be sure that the output path corresponding to & \u2014 0\nis no lower than the output path corresponding to u \u2014 0 and the same values for all the\nother parameters. Therefore, it follows from the theorem of III, 5 that for sufficiently large\nt Y(t) Zi c e**\"7-9! where c is a constant and e is any positive constant, however small.\nGross investment, then, eventually exceeds sce?-\"\u2014-9!, Each unit of new gross investment\n\nprovides employment equal to \" e\" \u20149*, \"(Thus current gross investment provides employ-\n|\n\n. 5, .\nment in excess of ri c e\" *v\u20149*, 1f e is chosen to be less than i, employment on currently-\n\n0\nproduced capital will eventually grow faster than an exponential itself growing faster than\nthe labor force.

Hence the rate of interest must be rising with calendar\ntime in order to keep the present value of quasi-rents from new investment always equal\nto 1l. On the other hand, if the saving ratio is constant, or falls slowly enough so that\nm(t) \u2014 0, the shortening of the length of life offsets the rising trend of quasi-rents.

Partially capital-augmenting technical progress\n\nAlthough the basic model is quite general\u2014within its fixed coefficient limitations\u2014\nwe have concentrated very heavily on the case of Harrod-neutral or purely-labor-augmenting\ntechnical progress. There are two reasons for this. First, only in this case can we get\nclear and simple analytical results. Second, it may be that the broad outlines of economic\nhistory\u2014in. particular, the apparent long-run trendlessness of the marginal efficiency of\ncapital\u2014suggest Harrod-neutrality more than they suggest any other simple hypothesis\nabout technical progress. Recent research, however, casts considerable doubt on this\nreading of the facts.\n\nUnder Harrod-neutrality, constant m and constant s go together. When there is any\ncapital-augmenting technical progress\u2014including the other standard case of Hlicks-\nneutrality\u2014we must choose between them. In general a constant gross saving ratio requires\nlim (ft) \u2014 0 and therefore, a rate of interest falling toward zero. On the other hand,\n\n1\u2014 00\nif m(t) is constant, then output will grow at the usual natural rate while the gross saving\nratio will fall exponentially and the rate of interest will rise. We illustrate these remarks\nby sketching the Hicks-neutral case.\n\nLet X(v) \u2014 Ae and u(v) \u2014 ue\"*, and let employment be N,e**.

(Of course the equality of private and social rates\nof return is broken.) It should be realized that in short-run equilibrium the real wage may\nbe at its competitive level for the current level of employment. Real-wage rigidity means\nonly that unemployment does not make the real wage fall.\n\nVII EXTENSIONS AND OPEN QUESTIONS\n\n1. Depreciation and loss of productivity\n\nIt is quite straightforward to make allowance for age-dependent physical depreciation\nwithin our simple technology. Let 3(x) be the proportion of an instant's gross investment\nthat survives to age x. Then the fundamental employment and output equations become\n\nSEP\nN(t),\u2014 uM 1) \u00e0(t \u2014 v)i(v)dv,\n\nY(t) \u2014 li p(v)\u00e0(t \u2014 v)i(v)dv.\nt\u2014m(t)\n\nThe easy special case is, of course, depreciation-by-evaporation: 9(x) \u2014 e-9*, The results\nare generally predictable. The case of *' one-hoss-shay \" depreciation is mixed. If 0 is\nthe physical lifetime of capital, 9(x) \u2014 | , o - x - 9 Whenever the economic facts\nrequire (f) X 0, the physical lifetime is irrelevant, and the analysis is exactly as in the\nbody ofthe paper. But when the economic facts would make m(t) \u2014 0, the physical lifetime\nhas primacy and shortage of capital supervenes. It is laborious to piece the two regimes\ntogether but it can be done.\n\nRelated to, but not identical with, the idea of physical depreciation is the notion that\ncapital goods lose productivity (or require increasing maintenance) over their lifetime.\nSuppose, for concreteness, that plant constructed at time v has a capacity at time t Z: v\nof u(t, v) units of output. It is now complicated to say what *' technological progress \"\nmeans, since it may well be desirable to have capital goods which are less productive when\nnew but lose productivity more slowly with age. It is unambiguously progress if v' \u2014 v\nimplies u(v' -- x, v) 7 p(v 4- x, v) for all x Z0 (and labor requirements are not higher\non vintage v' capital). But this is unnecessarily strong. The simple special case is u(7, v) \u2014\nw(t \u2014 v)u(v). Then one has\n\n2| MD,\nN() -\u2014 I.

(There is a symmetric\nhypothesis; output capacity remains but labor requirement increases with age.) It is not\nhard to see that\u2014ignoring depreciation again\u2014the real wage must be w(m)X(t \u2014 m)\nwhere, as usual, 7 is the economic lifetime of capital.

That is: the margin separating active from idle capital is fixed by the requirement\nthat the entire labor force find employment; and output is whatever they are capable of\nproducing. This would presumably be true in a planned economy, or in one where a\nflexible fiscal policy regulated aggregate demand accurately. XPre-Keynesian neo-classical\neconomics relied on a market mechanism: so long as there was unemployment the real\nwage would fall; older and older vintages of capital would be able to earn positive quasi-\nrents; as they entered production, employment would rise. Modern short-run income\nanalysis rests on the presumption that this cannot or does not happen, or does not happen\nquickly enough to matter. The causal structure in (7) and (8) is reversed. If we take\naggregate demand Y(ft) as given (in the simplest case, from exogenous investment via the\nmultiplier), (8) determines m(r) and (7) determines N(t). That is: the margin separating\nactive from idle capital is fixed by the requirement that output just match real effective\ndemand; and employment is whatever is necessary to man that capital. If the division of\noutput between consumption and investment is determined, a model like this is clearly\nable to generate its own future time-path.\n\n2. Aggregate Supply and Demand\n\nThere must, of course, be a market mechanism underlying a Keynesian economy,\nthough it cannot be the same as the neo-classical mechanism. For one thing, a Keynesian\neconomy must have at least one more asset, money, and therefore one more price, the\nmoney wage, than the neo-classical aggregative model we have been discussing. Otherwise\nthere is no explanation for over-saving. Without the attraction of some other store of\nvalue, investors would simply increase consumption whenever capital accumulation became\nunattractive. Nor is there, without money, any opening for the trouble that may arise\nfrom stickiness of money wages and prices. A mechanism close to that described in 77e\nGeneral Theory itself is the following. Suppose W(t), the money wage, is given in the short-\nrun; W(t)or its rate of change may depend on past unemployment, but for the current\ninstant it is given. Now equation (9) can be rewritten\n\nWn)\nXt \u2014 mt)\n\nwhere P(t) is the money price level. Together (8) and (9\") define an aggregate supply curve,\ngiving Y(t) as a function of P(r). Any P(t) determines, via (9), an m(t). That m(t), inserted\nin (8), yields the corresponding Y(ft). More descriptively, with a sticky money wage, any\narbitrary price level fixes the margin between those vintages of capital which can operate\nat a profit and those which cannot; the corresponding supply of output is the capacity\nof the profitable vintages. Obviously Y(f) is an increasing function of P(t).\n\nA detailed treatment of aggregate demand would be out of place in this essay. One\nlimiting possibility is that real aggregate demand is independent of the price level for a\ngiven money wage. More generally, real demand might depend on the price level through\nthe distribution of income, through the real volume of cash balances, or in other ways. In\nany case, the intersection of the aggregate demand and supply curves determines the price\nlevel and real output.\n\nThis is a perfectly-competitive Keynesian model, with (9^) doing the work of a marginal-\nproduct-of labor equation. Here\u2014as in the full employment model\u2014it is possible to\nallow for imperfectly-competitive pricing. Then (9^) can be altered to\n\nWe) .\nXt \u2014 m(t)) '\n\n(9) P(t) \u2014\n\n(9\") P(t) \u2014 (1 4- 0)\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 21:07:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

This is a double assumption (a) that at each moment of\ntime the stock of surviving capital is adequate to employ the whole labor force, and (b)\nthat effective demand is always adequate to buy the output producible at full employment\nfrom the existing stock of capital. Thus we have placed ourselves in the second of the three\nregimes mentioned in II, 3: output is limited by the supply of labor.\n\nRegime I, in which output is limited by a shortage of capital while labor is redundant,\nhas no application to an advanced industrial economy, though it may be relevant for the\nadvanced sector of a developing economy.

The social rate of return on saving\n\nUnder competitive conditions, the private rate of return on savings is independent of\nthe individual's decisions. Like any price, however, the social rate of return depends on\nthe aggregate of investment decisions. It can only be determined after the whole invest-\nment path (for the past as well as for the future) has been decided. Let us call this pre-\ndetermined path /*(7).

Without\na change in the investment path /*(7), no higher gross output than Y*(rt) is possible for any\nt. In other words, in order to achieve a higher volume of gross output in the future the\neconomy has to increase the current rate of accumulation, which means that it has to\nreduce current consumption.\n\nThe concept of a social rate of return on savings makes sense only in the case of\nefficient paths. For if Y(ft) were limited not by the capacity to produce but by effective\ndemand, then a rise in consumption today could be effected without changing the future\ncapacity to produce consumption goods. But for efficient paths Y*(f) the social rate of\nreturn on investment links small changes in /(7) to small changes in C(f) for given L(t),\njust as the marginal productivity of labor relates small changes in L(t) to the resulting\nsmall changes in C(t) for given /(t).\n\nThere are of course infinitely many ways in which marginal changes of the function\nI*(t) can be introduced. AJ(f) the difference between the old and the new investment\npath, may be almost any function of time, as long as t lies in the interval [0, 7], which we\nare considering.

Once again, the paths\nthus described are the same as those described earlier; they are merely characterized via\na different parameter. But now the equations do not ** decompose \" at all. There is no\none-at-a-time solution possible. Instead (33) and (38) must be solved simultaneously for\nr and m, after which the other unknowns follow as before. (Something similar is the case\nif the propensities to save wages and profits are positive but different.)\n\nThe only safe statement, therefore, is that the rate of interest is determined, in general,\nboth by thriftiness conditions and by ** marginal \" conditions. This result is not only safe,\nbut satisfying.\n\nV THE INTEREST RATE AND THE SOCIAL RATE OF\nRETURN ON INVESTMENT\n\nI. Definitions and preliminaries\n\nIn this part of the paper we revert to the more general assumptions of Part II. To\nbe precise, we assume u(v) and X(v) to be continuous positive functions of v, with 2(v)\nstrictly increasing. The object of this part is to relate the competitive equilibrium interest\nrate defined in (27) to what we shall call the social rate of return on saving or investment.\nThe point of the analogy is suggested by the fact that in a perfect capital market the ruling\nrate of interest functions as the private rate of return on savings.\n\nConsider a person who disposes of a certain amount of wealth, W(0), at time zero\nand who is obliged for some reason to pursue a saving program such that his wealth at\nsome given later time T'is equal to a given amount W(T). His wealth at time zero may con-\nsist of a current stock plus the sum of his discounted wage income in the time interval\n[0, T]. This person is free to choose any stream of consumption c(t), which has a present\nvalue equal to W(0) minus the present value of W(T?)) or, in a formula,\n\n(39) e c(t)dt - W(0) \u2014 e WT).\n\n0\n\nJi \u2014 f reis \u2014- [7 ra\n\nHence, as before, r(t) is the instantaneous interest rate ruling in the market at time 7. If\nwe compare any two such programs c,(1) and c;(f) and define Ac(r) \u2014 c,(t) \u2014 c(t) we get\nfrom (39)\nT \u2014 E r(u)du T IM r(u)du\n(40) | e Ac(t)dt \u2014 | e let) \u2014 ex0)]dt \u2014 0.\n0 0\n\nt\nBecause of (40) it is natural to refer to the expression e ML as the rate of transformation\n\nbetween consumption at time / and consumption at time zero. Giving up one unit of\n\nt\npresent consumption permits eo \"^\"^ additional units of consumption at time \u00a3. Thus\n\nthe instantaneous rate of return on savings is the geometric rate of change of the trans-\nformation rate as ? varies. Especially, as ? approaches zero we get\n\n(41) eorme Lau r(o)t.\n\nIf we choose the time unit small enough, we can say that r(o) expresses the net gain in total\nconsumption, if consumption is reduced by one unit at time zero and correspondingly in-\ncreased after one period. The same interpretation will be given to the social rate of\nreturn on savings.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 21:07:30 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

But for that very reason it may also\nbe inappropriate in an economy in which the capitalist motivations play a role. Alternative\ndescriptions have been proposed; the commonest are to make net saving proportional\nto net income, or to net profit, or to make gross or net saving a linear function of the wage\nbill and gross or net profits. Which of these alternative saving functions is the true one\nis an important descriptive question. \"They have different consequences in many ways.\nBut they do not introduce any new growth paths. It is clear from (33) and (36) that along\na steady-growth path a constant s is accompanied by constant c, constant c, and constant\nIL.

These two equations, plus the second equality in (18) and the newly-derived (37),\nare one equation short of determining all the unknowns along a steady-growth path. There\nseem to be two and only two consistent ways of completing the system. One is to adopt\n(33) as a market equilibrium condition: the rate of interest must equalize the present\nvalue of future quasi-rents from a new capital good to its cost of production. The other\nrequires that the uses of gross output exhaust gross output: Y \u2014 I -- wN -- (1 \u2014 o)lIZ.\nBut this requirement together with the other four equations just stipulated entails (33).\nSo there is only one way to complete the system and we might as well let (33) stand.\n\nThe path just defined, with a particular value of o, given, is of course the same as\n\n&\npl \u2014 e-?m)'\nequilibrium equations decompose differently and so lend themselves to another inter-\npretation.

Since F'(r) \u2014 0 (best seen directly from (32)) there is exactly one root.\n(That root may be negative; but not if the undiscounted sum of quasi-rents exceeds unity.)\nThus if technical progress is Harrod-neutral there is one and only one constant interest\nrate compatible with competitive equilibrium along a path of steady growth.\n\nIt is more complicated to prove that the interest rate must be constant.

We will show that the only positive\nsolution of (27\") valid for all t is R(f) \u2014 e'*, where r satisfies (33). Constancy of the interest\nrate follows.\n\nWe observe first that it is only necessary to settle the case ho g(x)dx \u2014 1 (i.e. the\ncase in which the constant interest rate is zero). If 5h g(x)dx 1, there is a unique constant\nh such that (/e-\"\"g(x)dx \u2014 1; and it is easily checked that R*(r) \u2014 R(r)e-^* satisfies\nR*(r) \u2014 (7 R*(t \u2014 x)g*Godx with g*(x) \u2014 e-\"*e(x). We will show that if fo gCodx \u2014 1,\nthe only positive solutions of (27^) are constant, whence A is the constant rate of interest,\nas it should be.\n\nWe begin by showing that any bounded solution of (27\") is constant. Let R(/) be\na bounded solution. Then for any fixed z, D(t; z) \u2014 R(t) \u2014 R(t\u2014z) is also a uniformly\nbounded solution of (27). Let M \u2014 sup, D(t; z). One can find a sequence 1, such that\nD(t,; z) converges to M. Now define the sequence of functions D,(t; z) \u2014 D(t--t; z);\nthe D, are an equicontinuous family of solutions to (27). There is a subsequence con-\nverging uniformly in any bounded interval to a limit solution D*(\u00a3; z) which is continuous\nand bounded above by M. Moreover,\n\nD*(0; z) 2lim D(tj; z) - M \u2014 r D*(\u2014x; z)g(x)dx.\n0\n\nSince g(x) 0, D*(t; z) \u2014 M for all t between 0 and \u20147.. Working backward one finds\nD*(t;z) \u2014 M forall:? \u20ac 0. Therefore there is a k such that D,(t; z) \u2014 D(t-1,; z)\u00bb M[2\nfor t in any long but finite interval to the left of the origin, so D(t; z)\u00bb Mj2 for t in any\nlong but finite interval to the left of ,. Therefore R(1) \u2014 R(t\u2014z) M([2 in the same interval.\nIf M \u20140, R(t) can be made to exceed any preassigned bound by taking the interval long\nenough. If M \u20ac O, let M' \u2014 inf,D(t; z \u20ac 0. A similar argument then shows that\nR(t) \u2014 R(t\u2014z) \u00ab M'[2 or R(t\u2014z)\u00bb.R(t) - M'[2 in a similarly long interval, and if M' \u00ab0\nR(t) can be made to exceed any preassigned bound by making the interval long enough and\ngoing far enough back. Hence M \u2014 M' \u2014 0 and R(ft) \u2014 R(t\u2014z) for any z, so (t) is\nconstant.\n\n1 This lemma has a checkered history. We began by depending on a more or less heuristic argument\nresting on the expansion of R(7) in an infinite sum of fundamental solutions of (27^). Not knowing how to\nmake that rigorous, we constructed a direct ** proof \". We are indebted to Kenneth Arrow for catching an\nerror that vitiated the argument. He also gave us a reference to S.

Proofs of these theorems would be essentially a\nrepetition of proofs given earlier.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe postulated a certain technology function which is conducive to golden ages. We\nthen showed that when golden-age consumption is maximal with respect to research effort,\nthe rate of return to '* investment in technology \" equals the rate of growth. We referred\nto this equalization as the Golden Rule of Research. It was also shown that when golden-\nage consumption is maximized with respect to tangible investment in the commodity sector,\nthe rate of return from tangible investment equals the rate of growth. This is the familiar\nGolden Rule of Accumulation. When golden-age consumption is maximal with respect\nto both kinds of investment, the two rates of return are therefore both equal to each other\nand to the rate of growth. This suggests the General Golden Rule of Investment: to\nmaximize golden-age consumption, assuming an interior maximum to exist, equate the rate\nof return from each kind of investment to the rate of growth.\n\nWe also characterized the Golden Rule state in terms of labor allocation. It was shown\nthat if the labor force is homogeneous and capital is unproductive in the research sector\nthen exactly one half the labor force is assigned to research on the Golden Rule path. But\nif capital is productive in research or if the skill at research of the marginal researcher falls\nwith increasing numbers of researchers, due to a nonhomogeneous skill mix, then, on\ncertain assumptions, less than one half of the labor force does research on the Golden\nRule path.\n\nYale University.

With a certain\namount of drudgery, however, these assumptions can be relaxed and the model made more\nrealistic. Of particular interest are the effects of introducing non-traded goods, and the\nquestion whether free trade would raise or lower the prices and outputs of such goods.\nFor simplicity, assume that there is one such non-traded good, that it is not used as an\ninput into the production of other goods, and that it is unimportant enough in con-\nsumption for the income effects of free trade on the demand for it to be ignored.

One thus finds washing machines\nin many homes, where they are only infrequently (if at all) rented out to neighbors, being\nutilized for only a very minor fraction of their potential. Such imperfections of the market\nalso may account for the coexistence of assets designed for the same type of service, but\nof different durabilities.\n\nWhen use and ownership of assets are interdependent, subjective time preferences!\nbecome relevant for determining the discount rate to be used in evaluating W. This is\nan additional factor of making different buyers prefer (and obtain) assets of differing\ndurabilities.\n\nThe market for second-hand goods does, to a certain extent, mitigate the effects of\nthe above-mentioned imperfections.\n\n3. The Concept of Durability\n\nIn our above discussion of the W function, some qualifications of the durability concept\nwere noted. We shall now examine some further questions relating to this concept.\n\n(i) One simplification of the durability concept lies in the certainty with which the\nlife span of the asset was assumed to be predictable in advance. It is more realistic to\nattribute to the asset, at its birth, some probability distribution of life spans.?. 3 In such\na stochastic model of durability, the value of the asset will equal the average of the values\ncorresponding to different life spans, weighted by their probability of occurrence. We may\ndefine the ** certainty equivalent \" of durability as the life span which, if certain, would\nresult in the same value for the asset. This certainty equivalent has the interesting property\nthat it is decreased when the interest rate rises\u2014as at the higher interest rate, the values of\nthe longer lives become relatively less important in the average. Thus the value of the\nasset is more strongly affected by the interest rate in the stochastic model than in the\ndeterministic one. It seems to us that this will result in amplifying the effect of changes in\nthe interest rate on optimum durability.\n\n(ii) Another conceptual difficulty with durability lies in the possibility of prolonging\nthe life span of an asset already in use. Such a possibility of rejuvenating the asset (by re-\nbuilding it, replacing parts, etc.) allows a partial postponement of the decision on durability.\nIn a deterministic system, of course, this question does not exist. Only when uncertainty is\npresent is it advantageous to postpone decisions until more information becomes available.\nIt seems to us that secondary (and tertiary, etc.) durability has to be introduced into\nthe model as an additional variable in the supply function. The solution should, therefore,\nbe similar, at least conceptually, to that presented here.\n\n(iii) One should perhaps also mention two more general problems which may be of\nparticular importance for the durability concept. As is customarily done with economic\nvariables, durability was treated as continuous. It might be, however, that only a limited\nnumber of alternative life-spans for the durable is technically possible.4 Secondly, we\nhave endeavored to formulate a pure theory of durability. Such an approach necessarily\ndisregards the possibility that in some cases extensions of durability may be technologically\ninseparable from other changes in quality.\n\n4. The Short Run, and Market Imperfections\n\nThe model presented in this paper was developed within the framework of long-run,\nperfectly competitive equilibrium. Two extensions naturally suggest themselves.\n\n1 Together with imperfections in the capital market.\n\n2 That is, when an asset is produced, it has a certain probability P; that it will turn out to belong to the\ncategory having a life span T;, with the whole time shape of the service stream associated with this life span.\n\n3 Solow, loc. cit., deals with the case of ** radioactive \"\" decline in the productive capacity of the capital\nstock, which may be interpreted as a case of mortality being exponentially distributed.\n\n* While such an approach would require a major reformulation, there is no reason to expect different\nresults. Nevertheless, it might be worthwhile to work out the problem in terms of activity analysis.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 18 Feb 2022 21:09:52 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

This cost is to be interpreted as the cost of exact physical repli-\ncation as it would have been had the blueprint been available at 5.!\n\nSince investment designs of different vintage were rarely in production at the same\ntime, and since designs invented after b could not have been produced then, historical\nevidence on relative costs will be sparse if not non-existent. Thus the application of the\nmethod is difficult and conjectural: chaining procedures seem to be required [14]: and,\nas usual, the choice of a particular b intrudes more arbitrariness.\n\nThere is an additional complication of principle even if such replication-cost deflators\ncan be constructed. Investors at \u00ab were interested in the actual relative costs of the available\ndesigns: not their hypothetical relative costs at b. If (due say to changing factor costs in\nthe investment-good industry) these differ, then systematic investment behaviour at the\ncosts of * may appear distorted when viewed at the costs of b. It may even appear, quite\nspuriously, that investors installed at \u00ab designs that were technically inferior to others\navailable at the same cost (see [15]).\n\nBefore amalgamating different vintages of investment into a factor-of-production\nmeasure of capital, it is necessary to weight them for physical deterioration and quality\nchange (or embodied progress)\u2014matters on which it is notoriously difficult to obtain\ndirect evidence. The earlier aggregation condition for technical frontiers serves as the\nconceptual idealisation, articulating in principle our empirical procedures. The basic\nrule it suggests is that weightings given to assets of different age and design should be\nbased on relative outputs (or labour inputs) only after standardisation to a common average\nproduct of labour and a standard lifetime.? There are two alternatives which give equiva-\nlent results only if the aggregation conditions hold exactly. Either consider the effects of\nhaving spent M(\u00ab) at \u00ab on assets with the same physical life as those actually chosen, but\nwith labour productivity at age \u00a3 \u2014 \u00ab equal to that on new vintage-/ assets. Or consider\nthe effects of spending M(f) at t on assets with the same physical life as those actually\nchosen, but with labour productivity equal to that on actual vintage-\u00ab assets of age 1 \u2014 ^.\n\nThese are counsels of perfection.  Failing them, as Solow has demonstrated [18],\nthere remains some hope that vintage-weighting functions may be chosen by the coherence\nwith which they graduate the data ([7] reports somewhat analogous experiments in a\ndifferent context).4\n\nIt is tempting to hope (as does [4]) that forward-looking market valuations of old\nassets can provide weights that convert obsolete and deteriorated assets into equivalent\nfractions of new ones of latest design. But the conditions under which this is true are very\nrestrictive [23]. Pragmatically, correlations between balance sheet and similar capital-value\nmeasures and conceptually-preferable ones may be high: but see [7].\n\nUniversity of Bristol. J. K.

In certain circum-\nstances, the s;(7) will be relevant in obtaining efficiency-unit weights.\n\n?

Thus e.g. we may observe that p,, . . . , ps vary in different proportions and conclude\n(having the Hicksian criterion in mind) that we are rot allowed to aggregate over x,, . . . , Xm.\nIt may however well be that the firm is a monopsonist in these inputs and the observed\nchanges in p,, . . . , py reflect purely endogenous changes along given supply functions. In\nthe latter case the criterion for perfect aggregation over x, .. ., xa is satisfied.

Case III is similar to case II except that the perfect-selfishness steady-\nstate position at the intersection 7 is at a value of i \u2014 / 4- /', so that the level of perfect-\nselfishness savings is now less than the golden-rule level. Inspection of cases II and III\nshows that there could be an intermediate case at which the curves a and 5 happened to\nbe tangential at the point i \u2014 / -- ' and a \u2014 b \u2014 1.

In this case there is a possible perfect-selfishness steady-state at the inter-\n\n: : . l', . .\nsection C.

In this case parents will help their children if i \u2014 s lies to the left of C\n\nand children will help their parents if i \u2014 - lies to the right of C.\n\nThe above perfect-selfishness steady-state points at the intersections 4, B, and C\nconform with commonsense. Suppose that one starts in a perfect-selfishness steady-state at\none of these points, and that mankind is then converted to perfect altruism. Then on the\n\n4\n\nlines of the argument in Section III above, according as \" is greater (or less) than the initial\n\nperfect-selfishness value of i, this conversion will make children wish to help their parents\n(or parents wish to help their children). In the former case there is less net saving as children\nmortgage their future to help their parents; but in the latter there will be more saving as\n\nparents accumulate to bequeath to their children. In the former case i rises towards \u00bb and\n\nL\n\nin the latter it falls towards T Thus the movement is in the correct direction to attain the\n\nnew perfect-altruism steady-state position. But this actual process of adjustment calls for\nmore precise analysis.\nCambridge. J. E. MEADE.\n\n!

In half the industries (20) changes in both\ndiversification and indirect relatedness were small (less than .05 in either direction). But\nin one-fifth of the industries (eight in number) increases in diversification were greater\nthan .10 and were accompanied by declines in indirect relatedness. Thus the changes\nobserved in Table 1 appear mainly to be associated with increased diversification in a\nrelatively small number of industries.\n\nAn increase in diversification in any one industry necessarily increases interrelatedness\nin other industries as well.

Our data, of course, use a fixed set of industrial\nclassifications, so that they would necessarily be incapable of showing this differentiation\nprocess. The disintegration process would have the effect of increasing the importance,\nover time, of the diagonal elements of the input-output matrix\u2014the sales by each industry\nto itself. The fact that there is little evidence of vertical chains of the type exemplified\nby the matrix 44, however, does show that vertical disintegration, if it occurs, leads to the\nformation of sub-industries which are sufficiently similar to be aggregated together, when\nthe economy is presented as an input-output model of moderate order (Leontief's data\nrefer to 41 industries other than final output and consumption). It is not clear, of course,\nwhat would be true if the number of industries considered separately was substantially\nincreased.!\n\n5. We may now consider the empirical connections between diversification and inter-\nrelatedness. This connection may be viewed either in terms of the economy as a whole\nor of particular industries. Table 1 gives a frequency distribution of the elements of the\n1919 and 1929 technological order matrices, and the values of the interrelatedness function\nfor these matrices. Interrelatedness increased from .444 to .536 in the decade. The increase\nin diversification was equal to .097. That is, it exceeded the increase in interrelatedness,\nbecause there was a small decrease (.005) in indirect relatedness in the economy.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTechnological Interrelatedness in the U.S. Economy, 1919 and 1929\n\nOrder of Number of Elements of Technological Order Matrix\nInterrelatedness 1919 1929\n\nIf individual industries are grouped according to their interrelatedness characteristics\n(Table 2), it may be observed that on balance, indirect relatedness appears to have been\ndistributed among industries in 1929 in much the same way as it had been in 1919, although\ndiversification had clearly increased. This circumstance is partly the result of the nature\nof indirect relatedness: an industry may have very little indirect relatedness either because\nit has no relatedness of any kind with other industries; or because it has direct relatedness\nwith almost all industries (is almost completely diversified). On the average, the index of\nindirect relatedness is small in industries where diversification is either very small (under .1)\nor very large (above .7).\n\n! Our findings are not independent of the amount and kind of aggregation used by Leontief. When\nindustries are combined (as they must always be in empirical work) to form an input-output matrix of\nmanageable size, a matrix 4 of order n is replaced by a matrix 4 of smaller order s. Each element of 4\ncorresponds to a block of 4, and it will be non-zero if any element of the block differs from zero. A power\n\nof \u00c1, say 4, has elements a(Q. These will be non-zero if it is possible to find any product aix ax; (a4\u2014 1) not equal\n\nto zero (k \u2014 1,...,5). Thecorresponding portion of the matrix 4t is a sum of products of blocks AG DA kj.\n\nEven if both blocks contain a non-zero element, however, it is possible for the product to be equal to zero.\nHence the qth power of 4 may have fewer zero elements than the qth power of A4 has zero blocks; in any\nevent it cannot have more. Consequently, the more aggregation is carried out upon 4 (the smaller s is,\nrelative to 7), the lower one should expect the calculated order of interrelatedness of the matrix to be;\nthat is, the more closely interrelated the economy will appear to be. For lack of information about the\nactual importance of this fact, we cannot discuss it further.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 08:24:10 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

It may easily be verified that\nevery finite power of a matrix of the form of 4; is a matrix of the same form (as regards\nzero and non-zero blocks) as 43. Moreover, 4; itself is clearly reducible. Technological\ninterrelatedness does not exist between certain pairs of industries, and hence certain in-\ndustries show zero interrelatedness. However, the industries in the third block exhibited\nnon-zero technological interrelatedness. ^ The corresponding part of the order matrix\ncontained no term of order exceeding three. Thus either a pair of industries turned out to\nbe technologically unrelated or they turned out to have interrelatedness of 1/3, 1/2 or 1.\nInterrelatedness of order three between industries ; and j corresponds to the following\nsituation: industry i has a customer, industry r, whose customer industry s sells directly\nto industry j, so that aira;5as; is positive. None of the industries i, r, s, j, of course is a\nfinal output or final demand industry.\n\nThese results rule out certain hypotheses about vertical integration in the economy.\nA. common form of these hypotheses is that industries may be grouped into '' stages \"\nrepresenting well-defined production and distribution processes. For instance, (1) extractive\nindustries sell to (2) basic processing industries, which sell to (3) fabricating industries,\nwhich sell to (4) distributors, which sell to (5) ultimate consumers.

But B,, the corresponding closed\norder matrix, contains terms of order 3, 4, and 5, whereas empirical order matrices contain\nonly terms of order 1 and 2. This circumstance is enough to permit rejection of the hypo-\nthesis.\n\nThis result permits a comment on the *' vertical disintegration hypothesis \".

Since A is of finite order, all elements of its order\nmatrix B must be finite, as was to be shown.\n\nIf A is irreducible, at least one non-diagonal element of each column of A4 must be\nnon-zero. By the preceding paragraph, therefore, the largest number in the order matrix\nof an irreducible matrix is (7). The interrelatedness functions n()\ndividual elements of an irreducible A, then, are the reciprocals of integers less than or\nequal to (7); and any row or column of B having o, as its maximum element must also\ncontain every integer less than rn.\n\nIn a closed input-output matrix of even moderate order\u2014say the 42 x 42 matrices\nused by Leontief in his pioneer work, The Structure of the American Economy, it would\nbe a major task to calculate the order matrix, if in fact it were necessary to compute 40\npowers of the original input-output matrix. However, it turned out that the 1919 and 1929\nmatrices in his book were essentially like the matrix 4, shown above. That is, every in-\ndustry used the services of households, and every industry sold to households. In addition,\nof course, these were inter-industrial sales, so that there were non-zero elements scattered\nthroughout A4. The study of interrelatedness in closed input-output matrices thus does not\nseem very interesting, but we shall find a more interesting application of the concepts of\ninterrelatedness.\n\n4. We shall now discuss technological interrelatedness, rather than interrelatedness\nin general. The discussion relates to ** open \" matrices rather than the ** closed \" matrices\nso far discussed. The open input-output matrix is a submatrix of the closed matrix. Certain\nof the '* industries \" (in particular the household and government sectors) are deleted on\nthe grounds that they are ** final demand \"; the relations remaining are described in the\nliterature as ** inter-industrial \". The matrix of the open system is described in this paper\nas the ** technological matrix \". In contrast to the matrix of the closed system, the tech-\nnological matrix need not be irreducible in theory; in fact the matrices under study are\nreducible.? For any given technological matrix, we may construct an order matrix. This\norder matrix is not a sub-matrix of the order matrix of the closed input-output matrix,\nbut must be separately computed.\n\nThe 1919 technological matrix developed by Leontief turned out (after some per-\nmutations of rows and columns) to be of the block form:\n\ncorresponding to in-\n\n0 0 0\nAs \u2014 0 Em 0\nAg Asa Ass\n\nThe industries in the top row of blocks:\ncanning and preserving,\nbread and bakery products,\ntobacco manufactures,\nother paper products,\nconstruction.\n\nSold only to final consumers.

Effectively, then, the matrix A is irreducible, provided\nthat it can be shown that P and Q and the vectors corresponding to the maximal charac-\nteristic value (1 in this case) of 4.

                    "Economic Interrelatedness\n\nThis paper associates with every input-output matrix an order matrix, and defines for\nevery submatrix of the order-matrix it defines an interrelatedness function. For certain\nclasses of submatrices, the interrelatedness function has an economic interpretation. On\nclosed input-output matrices, where irreducibility is of theoretical importance, irreduci-\nbility is associated with a condition on the interrelatedness function. On open input-\noutput matrices, the function is a way of interpreting certain propositions found in econo-\nmic history. Interrelatedness is also associated with diversification (and hence speciali-\nzation) in a simple way. It is empirically possible (using Leontief's data for the U.S.\neconomy in 1919 and 1929) to examine the way in which interrelatedness has changed over\ntime, and to make predictions about hypotheses such as technological convergence, which\nhave so far been difficult to subject to empirical analysis. Thus the interrelatedness function\nis a useful measure in a number of economic contexts.\n\nIt is assumed that readers are familiar with Leontief's closed system, which consists\nof two matrix equations (actually identities) :\n\n0 \u2014 (4 \u2014 E)Q,\n\n0 \u2014 (Ar \u2014 E)P. .\nHere 0 is a vector of zeros, E is the identity matrix, Q and P are (equilibrium) vectors of\nquantities, and prices, respectively. The matrix A has elements a;;, referring to the quantity\nof commodity ; that is used to produce one unit of commodity j. A7 is the transpose of\nA. These equations are said to be identities, in that all output is allocated to some industry\n(including producers! savings). Leontief's hypothesis is that the matrix A is independent\nof P and Q, and (for short periods of time) it is constant. The elements of A are, in the\nnature of things, non-negative.\n\n1l. . If A has non-negative elements, then A4?, 43, . . . also have non-negative elements.\nIn particular, if we consider an arbitrary power AX of A, then the elements a? of A*\nwill be sums of products of elements of 4. That is\n\nato \u2014-\u2014 \u00bb iri rir? \"P \u00dcrki\nwhere X represents (K)-fold summation.\n\nWe shall define an order matrix B for any matrix A having non-negative elements.\nB has the same number of rows and columns as 4. We examine the sequence aj, a,\naG, ..., and find the first non-zero term in the sequence. If this term is the Kth (K \u2014 1,\n2,.. ) then we set bij \u2014 K. If there is no finite K for which a? z 0, then we set b; \u2014 oo.\n\nA simple example of an order matrix is obtained from the matrix\n\n0 0 0 O0 ag\n0 0 0 O0 a\n4,\u2014]|0 0 O0 O0 ag\n0 0 0 O0 ag\nQsi  Qso sg g\u00e0 ss\n\n299\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 08:24:10 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In such mixed qualitative-quantitative models, a basic\nquestion that may be raised is that of the extent to which, within the framework of such\nmodels (including the quantitative restrictions), qualitative analysis can provide answers\nto questions concerning stability and comparative statics theorems for the models. By\nproviding tools for handling the purely qualitative case, Lancaster and Gorman have\ntaken the essential first step in the analysis of comparative statics theorems for such mixed\nmodels. Since sign patterns satisfying the Lancaster-Gorman theorems lead to complete\ncomparative statics information in the purely qualitative case, their conditions are sufficient\n(but not, of course, necessary) for complete comparative statics information when quanti-\ntative restrictions are imposed. Similarly, the conditions given in this paper, since they\nhold for arbitrary values of the elements of the matrices under consideration, provide\nsufficient conditions for stability for a wide range of restrictions on the values of the\nelements of the matrix. Thus, for example, any matrix of partial derivatives of excess\ndemand functions with sign pattern satisfying Theorem 3 is stable when Walras' Law and\nhomogeneity of excess demand functions are imposed, given a proper choice of signs for\nrows and columns associated with the numeraire commodity.!\n\nWhile there are some immediate applications of the Lancaster-Gorman theorems and\nthe theorems of this paper (particularly to macroeconomic models), the basic justification\nfor work in purely qualitative systems, we feel, is in providing a beginning in the analysis\nof qualitative methods in the more complex mixed qualitative-quantitative models. In the\nfurther work that needs to be done, stability analysis and comparative statics analysis\nmight well be even more closely related than the results of this paper indicate. For example,\nan interesting open question at the present time is that of necessary and sufficient con-\nditions on the sign patterns of a matrix for complete or partial comparative statics infor-\nmation when the only quantitative information is that provided by the assumption (not\nproof, as in this paper) that equilibrium is stable, i.e., what is the scope of Samuelson's\ncorrespondence principle in such a mixed qualitative-quantitative model?

The main\nconclusions may be summarized as follows:\n\n(1) The total effect of a reduction of interest on prices can be split up into two com-\nponents, one of which arises from the fall in interest rates in the course of time whereas\nthe other is related to the lower level of interest.\n\n(2) The first component, connected with the name of Cassel, can practically be relied\nupon to work in the classical direction, but\u2014except for possible lag phenomena\u2014it is\nlimited to the time when interest rates are actually going down. It is thus essentially of a\nshort-term nature and gives no support to Wicksell's propositions.\n\n(3) What Wicksell and other proponents of the classical doctrine seem to have had\nin mind is rather the effect of lower levels of interest. It is not certain, however, that this\neffect will work in the classical sense. As a consequence, it is quite conceivable that at\nlower levels of interest prices will finally be lower than if rates had been maintained at a\nhigher level. This can be attributed to the fact that in the long run lower interest rates\nmay stimulate the expansion of capacity more than they stimulate demand.\n\n(4) While from a theoretical point of view, these unclassical possibilities may be\nsomewhat disturbing and perhaps intriguing, their significance for monetary policy is\nlimited in several ways. First, aside from quite unlikely cases, they only apply to situations\nwhere prices are falling to begin with; for situations of rising prices the rule of the classical\ndoctrine is hardly weakened. Second, even if prices are falling, unclassical reactions only\nappear in the case of capital-poor economies with relatively high interest and low growth\nrates. Third, if interest rates are used as a short- or medium-term instrument, the direction\nof their change being reversed every few years, any unclassical reactions would tend to be\nwashed out in the long run and the picture would be dominated by the Cassel-effects which\nare sure to work in the classical direction.\n\nUniversity of Z\u00fcrich J\u00dcRG NIEHANS.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCES\n\n[1] Beckmann, Martin.

For evidently the ratio of expenditure on consumption\nto the desired value of capital is a constant and hence the arguments of (i) with minor\nmodifications apply. Existence of a steady state is proved as before.\n\nWe may now also note that the production assumptions can be made less restrictive\nfor this model. What is required is a convex production set, which is additive, contains\nthe origin and does not permit the output of anything in positive amount without input.\nWe may write the members of this set as the vectors x, the positive components of which\nmeasure outputs of the two goods the n:gative components of which measure inputs.\nWith any momentary equilibrium there will be associated some efficiency price vector v\nsuch that if x is a momentary equilibrium vector vx 7 vx' all feasible x'. Of course there\nmay be a whole cone of these v's satisfying this inequality, but the strict convexity of the\ncommunity indifference curves ensures that only one of these will be compatible with\nmomentary equilibrium. None of these postulates exclude the possibility of joint produc-\ntion. The Inada condition may now be stated in terms of the efficiency prices of the capital\ninput. Keeping labour constant one requires that this price should go to zero as k goes to\ninfinity and that it should go to infinity as k goes to zero.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nIt is evident that in all these constructions the condition that the equilibrium at a\nmoment of time be unique is crucial. The rest of the story is really concerned with ensuring\nthat there is a steady state with positive factor prices. But the assumptions required to\nestablish uniqueness of momentary equilibrium are all terrible assumptions. People differ\nin the assets they hold in their age and, alas, in their tastes. Simple proportional savings\nassumptions no doubt have their place in political arithmetic but. seem rather desperate\nat this level. Moreover assuming all these uniqueness problems away prevents us from\nfacing the interesting, although admittedly philosophical, question, of what is supposed to\nhappen when the assumptions do not hold. After all some decisions are taken at any\nmoment of time.\n\nIt seems likely that the way out of many of these problems is to examine paths which\nare not equilibrium paths. Of course this will be a good deal more difficult. It will also\nmean that we shall want to abandon the malleability assumption. There is a great deal to\nlearn.\n\nChurchill College, F. H.

The complements of these proportions measure the cases which\nare probably inconsistent with Lancaster's hypothesis of upwards bias. There may be\nsome small upwards bias for half of the cases, but it seems very difficult to claim that 5,\nis necessarily always biased upwards.\n\nMoreover, even in those years when 5, may be biased upwards the differences between\nthe estimates may be too small to be statistically significant. Durbin [2] suggests a measure\nof the sampling variation of (b, \u2014 5\"), which is used to compute the standard error\nS(b, \u2014 b') in Tables I, II and III. In the present context, however, 5, can exceed 5' so\nS(b, \u2014 b') is calculated for both positive and negative differences. Consequently, two-\ntailed / tests are used to test the significance of the observed differences at the five per\ncent level. In only five out of the forty-four cases are there significant differences between\nb, and 5' and in four of them ^, \u2014 b'. These results are inconsistent with Lancaster's hypo-\nthesis. In only one case (Table III, 1958) is b, biased upwards to any significant extent.\nThe overwhelming majority of cases is consistent with the implicit assumption in [6) that\nb, is not significantly biased.\n\n6. The stability of 5, over time observed in [6] is confirmed when the analysis is\nextended to two more samples and up to 1963. Presumably transitory components of\nX, Y and Z are caused by changes in costs, prices, demands, taxes, import controls and\na host of other economic and political ** shocks \". There have been very many *' shocks \"\nover the period 1949-63 and yet they do not appear to have changed the business savings\nincome-elasticity. If transitory influences on business savings policies are unimportant\nthere is no need to introduce a normal income hypothesis. This conclusion reached in [6]\nis subject to two more qualifications.\n\nIn [6] the view was taken that dividend-restraint ended in 1951 when wage-restraint\nended, though it is recognized that lip-service was paid to both policies after 1951. Prais\n[14] has claimed that dividend-restraint continued throughout the period 1949-53 which,\nif correct, could explain the stability of 5b, observed in [6]. Most economists would not\naccept the view that the observed stability of 5, 1949-63 was due to dividend-restraint, but\nit must be admitted that anyone who thinks that dividend-restraint continued up to 1963\ncan still use this argument to explain the stability of 5. A further check on the importance\nof transitory components is being made using pre-war data.\n\nThe second qualification is that the stability claim is based on a preliminary inspection\nof Tables I, II and III and this conclusion may not be able to withstand statistical tests\nof time-stability. Menges and Diehl [13] have described a series of such tests and they are\nbeing applied to the pre-war and post-war data.\n\n7. Subject to these and other qualifications mentioned in [6], the conclusion to draw\nfrom the evidence above is that the least squares estimates of the business savings income-\nelasticity are quite satisfactory. Normal income models of business saving [3], [15] are\nadmittedly attractive, but until further evidence is presented there seems no reason for not\nusing a least squares model. If this argument is correct, it will be permissible to develop\na more sophisticated least squares model of business saving than the one used here, but\nthere will still be no need to bother about errors in variables.\n\nUniversity of Bristol.

Under our current model of unlimited labor supply, if technological progress\nin both industries is either neutral or capital-saving in Hicks' sense, then the overall capital-\nlabor employment ratio would decline over time, provided that a \u2014 0.!\n\nProof Under the assumptions, the RHS of (33) is always negative. Q.E.D.\n\nCorollary f there is no technological progress in the consumption good industry and\nthe technological innovation in the capital good industry is either nil or Hicks' neutral,\nthen the overall capital-labor employment ratio remains constant.\n\nIt may be important to notice that, under this circumstance, capital is growing at an\naccelerated rate (K/K \u2014 0) due to (32), but labor employment is growing even faster than\ncapital. Thus the existence of an unlimited supply of labor appears to be an advantage\nin a sense for a developing country.? If technological progress is of Hicks' labor-saving\ntype, then the conclusion should be modified. As this process of declining capital-labor\nemployment ratio continues, the economy will sooner or later exhaust its surplus labor\nand reach a turning point to a full employment economy.\n\nThe above theorem 7 may correspond to Fei & Ranis' recent interesting study [16],\nin which they observed, for example, that the industrial capital-labor ratio was declining ?\nin the course of Japanese economic development, especially during the phase of unlimited\nsupply of labor in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century.*\n\nUniversity of Manchester. AKIRA TAKAYAMA.\n\n1]t may be an interesting exercise to see the movement of the ** Great Ratios \" such as the relative\nshare and overall propensity to save or to consider the turning point to full employment economy.\n\n? This is, of course, true provided that the assumptions are not too seriously violated. For example,\nthe quality of labor, which is recruited from an *' unlimited supply \" source, must be homogeneous. This\ncan be attained by the adoption of a proper education system, etc. (The proper education system also has\na shifting effect on the production functions.) The existence of active entrepreneurs is also important, for they\nsearch all investment opportunities by a shrewd economic calculation, which will make our saving \u2014\ninvestment equation (15) meaningful. It is generally observed that both of the above were true in the case\nof the Japanese economic development.\n\n3 See Fei and Ranis [16], especially table 3, p. 290.\n\n* Capital-saving (or *'labor-using \") nature of the innovation (see theorem 7) in the course of the\nJapanese economic development was also emphasized by Fei and Ranis. For example, they say, \"* continu-\nous capital shallowing in Japanese industry between 1888 and the end of World War I is evidence that\nJapan made maximum use of her abundant factor, surplus agricultural labor, by adopting labor-using (or,\nat least not very labor-saving) innovations \" [16], p. 295. They also point out that innovational activity\nin India was of the ** very labor-saving variety \", thus neglected '' the potentialities of a maximum utili-\nzation of her abundant, and rapidly growing surplus, agricultural labor force \". ibid., p. 197.

Small firms relied much\nless on this source for their growth.\n\nTo conclude, therefore, one of the reasons why Large firms have been growing at a\nfaster proportional rate than Small firms during the later part of the 1950's is due to the\ninfluence of amalgamations. This, however, is not the complete explanation as the net\nassets of Large and Medium size firms gain equally from acquisitions but the former still\ngrow at a faster overall rate.\n\nOne possibility is that Large firms tend to be less conservative than Small firms and\nrevalue their assets more frequently, and so give the impression, misleading as it may be,\nof faster growth. Another possible explanation is that large companies are finding it easier\nto obtain money on the Stock Exchange (the Board of Trade having shown they are heavy\nusers), and so obtain economies of scale in finance and advantages in growth.

It is illustrated\nin Figure 14 for the case in which none of the two countries is specialized at the balanced\n\nFiGURE 14\n\nstate. The time path of capital accumulation, starting with position 4, is described by a\ndotted curve. At the initial position 4, country \u00ab is less abundant in capital endowment\nthan country f, so that country \u00ab is specialized to investment goods and imports consump-\ntions goods from country B. As the process of capital accumulation starts, the aggregate\ncapital labor-ratio in country \u00ab is increased while it is decreased in country 8 until position\nBis reached. The price of the investment good is declining during this period and exports\nof investment goods from country \u00ab to country B continue to increase. At position B,\nthe capital-labor ratio in country 8 turns to increase. Country \u00ab is specialized to investment\ngoods until point C is reached where it starts to produce both goods. The path eventually\ngets to point D where the capital-labor ratio in country 8 again begins to decline. The\nexports of the investment good from country \u00ab to country f continue to decrease, and the\npath finally approaches the balanced state E.\n\nThe University of Chicago. H. Owr&K1 and H.

It seems\nunlikely that this matter will be cleared up in models in which A X; and U; are assumed to\nbe independent of each other and of AW.\n\n(iv) The residuals from the fitted equation were correlated with the level of unemploy-\nment as a rough test of whether demand impinges directly on prices as well as indirectly\nvia costs. There is no evidence of a direct relationship of this kind, the 7? between the\nresiduals and U is 0.0027.\n\nThe Unionisation Equation\n\n(i) A given change in the level of unionisation lagged one year reduces the current rate\nof change of unionisation by 11 7; of the change in the level of unionisation.\n\n(ii) The rate of change of prices has an immediate effect on AT which is approximately\n50 9, of the change in AP. The coefficient on AP,-, has the wrong sign.\n\n(ii) The level of profit lagged six-months is a significant explanatory variable. How-\never, its effect seems to be very small. A given change in the level of profits results in a\nchange in the index of pushfulness which is 107; of the change in profits.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIt has been shown that an index of trade union pushfulness namely the rate of change\nof unionisation is closely associated with the rate of change of money wage rates and that this\nindex cannot be explained by the level and/or the rate of change of the demand for labour.\nThis result is not upset in the jointly estimated model of Part 3. Our hypothesis that the\nrate of change of unionisation is the index of the causal variable in the observed relationship\nis therefore consistent with the data at this level of aggregation. Moreover, excess demand\nas measured by the level of unemployment does not appear to have made a significant\ncontribution to the explanation of the variance in wage rates over the period 1921-1961.\n\nWhat is now required is an analysis of the data at a lower level of aggregation. For\none thing, some of the implications of our hypothesis about the role of the union variable\ncan only be tested in disaggregated studies. For another, it is important to know how the\nrate of change of unionisation, the level of unemployment and the rate of change of money\nwage rates are related to each other in a particular sector and in all other sectors. For\nexample, the aggregate relationship between AW and AT' and the lack of correlation between\nU and AT are consistent with either of two conflicting hypotheses. Suppose wage rates\nwere to rise in some sector. Let it be each union's policy to prevent any widening of inter-\nindustry wage differentials. Then this wage change would make unions in other sectors\nmore militant and, if they successfully negotiate wage adjustments, a rise in aggregate\nAW and AT would be observed. Now, all this would be compatible with either an increase\nin demand for labour in the sector where the wage rise originated or with an increase in\nunion militancy which was independent of demand conditions.\n\nWe hope to report on investigations into these matters at a later date.\n\nLondon.

A major shortcoming, for example, is that the study is confined to\naggregate manufacturing. It seems unquestionable that a sectoral study would show that\nsome industries respond to market forces according to the above theory, whereas some are\nswayed almost entirely by institutional factors, and a number would range between these\ntwo extremes of the wage-determination process. A sectoral study is planned for the\nfuture.\n\nThe major finding of this study to date, in my judgment, is that a model that purports\nto discuss the wage-determination process must have some mechanism for differentiating\nbetween the influence that experienced and qualified workers have on the wage decisions\nof employers and that which inexperienced or lesser-skilled labor has on these decisions.\nThis study indicates that the quit rate, a worker behavioral variable that is also a proxy\nfor labor demand, does make the distinction between those workers that can affect wage\nchanges and those who cannot.\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley.

            "found": "THEORY OF WAGE-PRICE PROCESS IN MODERN INDUSTRY 283\n\n(5) The theory also throws some light on the traditional distinction between cost-push\nand demand-pull inflation. Several observers have shown the difficulty of distinguishing\nbetween these two types of inflation [21], [28], [33]. The key distinction between the two\nmechanisms is not whether prices will respond to demand changes. Clearly, they respond\nunder either process. But under the demand mechanism, prices should be stable as long as\ndemand and supply remain in balance and basic costs do not change. Under the oligopoly\nmechanism, prices can rise without excess demand, and the major driving force of the\ninflationary process is the interaction of target-return pricing and profit-based wage\ndemands. While the oligopoly mechanism is likely to lead to inflationary troubles at a lower\nlevel of demand, it may also have a stabilizing effect in periods of excess demand, when the\ninsensitivity of prices to excess demand will lead to a less than full exploitation of the market\nposition. Empirical investigation of the relative significance of the two mechanisms should\nlook for the response of price changes to objective measures of excess demand to sub-\nstantiate the demand mechanism, and to changes in standard unit costs to substantiate the\noligopoly mechanism.\n\n(6) The oligopoly mechanism advanced here also refutes the widely held view [33],\n[28], that on the cost-push side, only wage-push can lead to a sustained inflationary process,\nsince only a repeated increase in business profit targets could lead to continued inflation.\nIt has been shown here that even a constant target rate of profit can produce a rate of\nwage increase in excess of the productivity trend, and with target-return pricing, this wage\nincrease is passed on in higher prices, maintaining the profit rate, and also maintaining the\nrate of wage increases. The oligopoly mechanism is neither a wage-push nor a profit-push\ntheory. It is the interaction of prices, profits and wages which maintains the inflationary\nprocess, and it is the existence of monopoly elements in both factor and product markets\nwhich leads to this result.\n\nHarvard University.

Not only does he have what freedom the\npresent multivariate form of the relation offers, but also the possibility of shifting the whole\nrelation in a desirable direction.\n\nThe Kennedy-Johnson Administration has in effect tried to cause such a shift through\nits wage-price guidelines, first advocated in 1962. These comprise a set of suggestions for\nwage behavior which on balance would keep wage increases in line with aggregate product-\nivity gains, coupled with corresponding suggestions for price behavior in individual in-\ndustries based on industry productivity gains. The guidelines are enforced only to the\nextent that pressure from the Administration, when applied, has any impact on individual\nbargaining negotiations and price decisions. At various times, both business and labor have\ndenounced the guidelines\u2014at first because they were not understood, but more generally\non the grounds that only the wage or price portion was being stressed. And many economists\nhave considered them a useless attempt to tamper with inexorable market forces. It is\ndoubtless premature to point to the overpredictions starting in 1962 as evidence that the\nguidelines policy has had an impact. Again, the test will come when substantially higher\noperating rates are reached.\n\nFinally, the present way of looking at the determinants of wage changes suggests the\nstandard classifications of wage push and demand pull inflations can be refined and\nexpanded. Armed with a regression, such as equation (9), one can look to residuals for\nevidence of the source of inflationary pressures. Significant underestimates of wage changes\noffer an accurate definition of wage push conditions. Rapid wage changes that are in line\nwith the predicting equation but associated with extraordinary profit rates suggest a fairly\nprecise meaning for a profit push inflation. While demand pull could properly describe a\nsituation in which wage changes are in line with the predicting equation and other ex-\nplanatory variables are in some normal relation to the unemployment rate.\n\nUniversity of Minesota.

However, it is obvious\nthat there is substantial overlap between occupational levels and other aspects of social\nstatus. Thus unskilled workers include disproportionately large numbers of negroes,\nimmigrants, rural-urban migrants, youths and persons with little schooling. Therefore,\nvariations in the skill margin reflect corresponding variations in the relative earning\nposition of these groups vis-a-vis those more favored, and the paradigm of the ladder has\nimplications for social mobility.\n\nIdentifying skill levels with social classes pre-supposes a broad consensus among\nemployers, paralleling the status hierarchy, as to the order of preference in selecting job\napplicants. It also implies substantial correlation between educational attainment and this\norder of preference. These two conditions are and long have been met in the United States\nand in most other places as well. It is only in rare cases, such as Jews and Huguenots, that\none finds an inverse relation between educational attainment and position in the consensual\norder of hiring preference.\n\nThe relation of age to the hiring preference hierarchy calls for a brief comment. So\nfar as manual workers are concerned, the young are likely to be only partially trained\nand/or not yet fully committed to full-time year-round wage earning and hence more\nlikely to find unskilled than skilled jobs. The managerial and/or the professional ladders\nare largely non-competing with the manual; but in all of them, the young largely overlap\nwith new entrants and as such play the role of inferior applicants relative to those previously\nhired.! Hence, if there is vestibuling for these ladders, the young will tend either to slop\nover into other job markets (clerical and sales) and/or temporarily retreat to school for\n** more training \".\n\nStanford University.

Trade can only be diverted to union members. The net tax\nflow would be maximised for the union as a whole (unless union governments had to agree\nto pay over tax proceeds to external governments). And the resulting system, that a\nproduct was taxed at the same rate in the union whether it originated anywhere inside or\noutside the union, would accord with one philosophy of the role of taxation in a tax\nunion.!\n\nIn such a case, what becomes of the relation between a tax union and a customs union?\nThe customs union essentially discriminates on a product from different sources whilst the\naimed-for tax union as above does not. Clearly, the effects of setting up a tax union can\nbe analysed in similar terms to the formation of a customs union, but have we not arrived\nat something essentially different?\n\nWe have, but it is not some *' free-trade-equivalent\" system. Even in the case under\nimmediate discussion, there is still discrimination between products, even if any one\nalways carries the same rate, so we still have ** excess burdens \" (we are at points like e',\nnot e). Furthermore, the equalised nominal tax rates on a product are not necessarily\nequalised effective rates due to such factors ? as different shifting characteristics and the\ndetailed structure and administration of the tax.?\n\nFinally, the tax union which has been compared with a customs union in this paper,\nsince it is the most formally similar kind of union, is a very circumscribed version. It is\nbased on the Equalisation view which is unlikely to prevail even for all indirect taxes, and\nwe must also remember that tax unions are planned not only for indirect taxation, but for\ndirect business taxes and personal income taxation as well.\n\nUniversity of York.

Nevertheless, the regression\nand correlation coefficients that are obtained are usually significant at high levels of sig-\nnificance. ?\n\nA common procedure of the cross section studies is to fit gross fixed capital expenditure\nas a proportion of gross fixed assets against percentage change in sales with a distributed\nlag. Those that do not use this form still work in terms of some ratio form. The use of\nthe percentage change or other ratio form does have the advantage in cross section analysis\nof removing heteroscedasticity as automatic adjustment is made for firm size.\n\nThe cross section studies find long distributed lags suggesting slow adjustment. lt is\ninteresting that accelerator effects seem to be concentrated in just those firms we should\nexpect\u2014those with rising sales and more rapid growth.3\n\nIII\n\nThe conclusion that can be reached from an examination of statistical work on the\nacceleration principle is that crude formulations and inappropriate methods of analysis\nhave often yielded bad results but more sophisticated models and methods have almost\ninvariably produced results favourable to the acceleration principle.\n\nThe view is widely held that the statistical evidence is unfavourable to the acceleration\nprinciple.

On the contrary, if g(V,, t) \u2014 0 for all V, and\nt, the balanced growth path is unstable.\n\nIt is not hard to show that Uzawa's capital-intensity condition for stability implies\ng(V, t) 2 0 for all V; and t. For if the consumption-goods sector is more capital-intensive\nthan the investment-goods sector, the term (4,6, -- 450; -- (B \u2014 F)C] is positive.

The possibility of unstable growth may arise if both the\nelasticities of substitution are each less than one and/or if the consumption-goods sector\nis more labour-intensive than the investment-goods sector.!\n\nIn passing, Professor Solow attacked Uzawa's assumption that wages are spent\nentirely on consumption and profit on investment, saying ' This is an extraordinarily\npowerful assumption, more powerful than many of its users realize \".?

The only\nassumption I have made about workers' saving behaviour is that they save a constant\nproportion of their income (whether from wages or from profits), and not of total savings.\nOf course, in the long run, the ratio of S; to S; will tend to become a constant. But this\nis no assumption: it is a long-run equilibrium result. The same will happen to all ratios\nof any variable to any other, in the system I have considered, for that is what long-run\nequilibrium is. May be, Professor Chang has not realised this characteristic of long-run\nequilibrium models.\n\nA. proof, for example, that 2 \u2014 e is a long-run equilibrium relation and not an\nassumption is given by the fact that, off the equilibrium path, this relation does not hold,\nas Professor Chang has discovered himself in his numerical example of footnote 2.

In assessing the interpretative value of the analysis suggested above the following\nassumptions of the analysis should be borne in mind.\n\n(i) The whole approach rests on the assumption that inter-dependence is important.\nStatistical investigations have sometimes suggested a contrary view.[7] However, the\ncontradiction is easily explained. According to our analysis, the bias against the develop-\nment of industries with mutual external economies implicit in laissez-faire is itself a powerful\ncause of underdevelopment. Hence estimates of the strength of structural inter-dependence\nin an underdeveloped economy on the basis of data relating to existing industries tends\nto be misleading. Contrafactual conditionals cannot be reflected in observational data!\n\n(ii) A more genuine analytic limitation is that our analysis requires the strict assump-\ntion of mutual interdependence. Thus, it would not help in explaining the absence of key\nindustries in underdeveloped countries.\n\n(ii) Lastly, the analysis abstracts from difficulties in the use of the game-theoretic\napproach itself and in particular from those concerning the interpretation of the numbers\nforming the pay-off matrix.\n\nV. \"This paper has been concerned with decision-criteria only in so far as these bear on\nthe balanced growth controversy. However, the approach discussed above has certain\nmethodological implications for decision theory. It will suffice to point out here that the\n** reasonableness \" of ' reasonable \" axioms which determine the choice of a decision\ncriterion may often be illusory. Thus, for the general case of a two-person game-like\nsituation with opponent's pay-off unknown (corresponding to our Model IT) Luce and\nRaiffa rely on what they call Rubin's modified axiom 8 to rule out the Wald criterion. [4] p.\n307. This axiom requires that if a decision criterion D is optimal for a game P, it should be\noptimal also for a game Q which is a probability mixture (p, 1 \u2014 p) of the games P and P',\nP' being defined as a game with the same strategy sets as P but such that pay-offs to player\n] are constant within any column and those to player 2 constant within any row.? In the\npresent context P' will then represent a situation where inter-dependence of A and B is\nruled out.

Reder's statements\nare consistent with L*-ordering, given different conditions facing the firm. More recently,\nin a discussion of ** the many features of corporate aims \"', Professor Shubik has suggested\nthat ** we can select one feature and assume that the firm wishes to maximize it, subject to\nboundary conditions which require that the other corporate aims meet certain specifications \"\n[10, p. 368]. Shubik's procedure is validated by a utility function for the firm which can\nonly be of the L*-ordering form.\n\nSome interesting lines of research, both theoretical and empirical, are easily suggested\nby such a utility function. In the theory of oligopoly, for instance, one could represent\nthe effects of rival actions by the parameter ^ of our example. The firm's choice is fully\ndeterminate in every case, and along the stretch where the profit objective is ** inferior \",\na reduction in the number of firms\u2014which shifts the transformation surface or attainable\nset outwards\u2014leads to the (unusual) result that profits are decreased. Quite a number of\nsolutions to the oligopoly problem are indicated, depending on the conditions of each\nsituation, since one no longer assumes a single common objective which firms are supposed\nto have. Looking at the internal organization of the firm, it would be interesting if we could\nidentify particular individuals with specific objectives and see the relative influence of each\nin decision making at different times. It may happen that the financial officer has a domin-\nating influence when some conventional ratio is below its acceptable level. He might,\nfor instance, exert a restraining influence on the sales manager when the current ratio is\nbelow par. Such a situation would be explained by L*-ordering.\n\nEmpirical research on the firm's behaviour, oriented along the lines of this hypothesis,\ncould determine its usefulness and validity. From the standpoint of theory, the maximi-\nsation of some final objective in a long run model of the firm could rationalize the particular\nconstraint or satisfactory levels of prior objectives. This idea is immediately suggested by\nBaumofl's growth-maximising model which requires some specific profit rate and pay-out\nfor optimality. Maximising the nth objective then determines the optimum levels of the\nfirst n \u2014 1 objectives, which automatically makes them mutually consistent even when\nsome are instrumental in the promotion of others.\n\nJos\u00c9 ENCARNACI\u00d3N, JR.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Baumol, W.

To the extent that money wages resist downward pressure\nfrom excess labour supply, involuntary unemployment will be more severe and marginal\ncosts to the firm will initially remain constant. The commodity market adjustment process\nwill be even more long and drawn-out as this added impetus to lower prices is withheld.\n\nIn the commodity market, approach toward the new equilibrium will reduce the dis-\nparity between actual commodity supply and that which would prevail, at any given price,\nin a perfectly competitive equilibrium. The new equilibrium level of price is that at which\ncommodity supply will equal demand under conditions of perfect competition to all firms.\nThe transitory monopoly powers of the firms will have passed when prices have converged\nto this new level. At the same time, elimination of downward sloping product demand\ncurves will have also eliminated the difference between the value of labour's marginal\nproduct to the firm and its marginal revenue product, hence the demand curve for labour\nwill have returned to its original position\u2014to Patinkin's labour demand curve. Finally,\nwith an unchanged labour supply curve, the real wage rate must, unless money wages are\nentirely rigid, return to the original equilibrium level (w/p)o, with lower commodity prices\nand a lower money wage rate, but with the same quantity of commodities and labour\ndemanded as in the previous equilibrium. Regardless of the initial rigidities in the money\nwage rate, the force of reduced nominal marginal costs must be added sooner or later to\nthat of product market imperfections as a mechanism which forces commodity prices\ndown to the new equilibrium level.\n\nAt the end of the adjustment, then, the comparative statics result of Patinkin's analysis\nhas been achieved. But the use of temporary competitive imperfection as the adjustment\nmechanism following a reduction in commodity demand has allowed the development of\nan internally consistent system, eliminating the need both for Patinkin's distinction between\nactual and desired supply and for Cross and Williamson's accumulation of unintended\ninventories in perfect competition. We cannot agree with Patinkin who summarized his\nunemployment model saying, ** we can see that involuntary unemployment can exist even\nin a system of perfect competition and wage and price flexibility \" [5, p. 220]. Neither\ncan wage rigidities be avoided as the basic cause of involuntary unemployment nor can\ncommodity market disequilibria and perfect competition coexist in a fully consistent\nPatinkin model.\n\nD.

If the utility of money is assumed to be separable\nfrom that of commodities, the joint utility of money and commodities can be written as\nF(U(Xa, ... , Xin), VZi)), where Z; is the real value of M;, i.e, Zi \u2014 Mi[ZW;P;, W;\nbeing positive constants. PF is assumed to be homogeneous with respect to Y;; and Mi.\nFrom the maximization of F subject to 2;P; Xi; -- Mi \u2014 I;, Xi; and Mi; are obtained as\nfunction of P and /;. Again in this case X;; can be written as X;; \u2014 B;l;, Bj \u2014 0 being\nfunction of P, as in the case of real economy. Equilibrium prices P** which satisfy X; \u2014 X;\nfor all j when ZI; \u2014 ZjP; X; 4- X4Mi, are absolute money prices determined in the model\nof monetary economy. Again, this is independent of distribution of /;.\n\nWe shall show that ratio of P**, relative prices in the monetary economy, are\nasme as those in the real barter economy, ratio of P*. In the real economy, we have\n(9U[JoX3)/(QU[JOXiy) \u2014 P7|Pz. Since the left-hand side of this is homogeneous of degree\nzero, it is unchanged by the proportional change of X7 from A7'I* to AF X;P* X;, which\nis equal to X; (j \u2014 1,..., m). On the other hand, also we have in the monetary economy,\n(9UJ0 X;)/(QU[0 Xiy) \u2014 PT*[P**, the left-hand side of which remains unchanged by the pro-\nportionated change of X77 from Bf*IT* to B** (XjP7* Y; -- X4Mi;), which is equal to\nX; (j \u2014 L,...,m). Therefore, PF[P\u00a3 \u2014 PT*|P** for all j, k is established.\n\nThus, to obtain P**, we can first solve P* and then substitute AP* for P in the excess\ndemand equation for money, Z:M; \u2014 X4 Mi, to solve 2, the absolute price level. The excess\n\ndemand for money is independent of distribution of total income, though it depends on\ntotal income itself as well as on P.\n\nTokyo, Japan.

This calls for some comment. In both\nyears 1951 and 1952 real disposable income fell by 3.4 9, and 1.7 9;, so this had caused a\ndecrease in the share of saving. Next income distribution could not have had any effect\nfor the rise in the share of saving, because the proportion of capital income,of all consumers'\nincomes increased 1952 by only 0.5 7; and was even 0.8 7 lower than 1950. So our explan-\nation for the sharp rise in the share of saving 1952 is that the big inflation during 1951\nwhich continued in 1952 had lowered the real value of consumers! bonds so much that\nthey had to compensate part of the loss by saving more. If monthly or quarterly statistics\nwere available years 1950-1953 would shed very interesting light on our problem.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn an analysis based on the maximisation of utility we have found that the amount\nof bonds compared to savings is a decisive factor in the response of saving to price level\nchanges. This is because the rise in prices decreases the real value of bonds and consumers\ntry to compensate for the loss by saving more. If the amount of bonds is many times the\namount of saving, as in the case of the United Kingdom, the increase in saving needed to\ncompensate for the loss in the real value of bonds is very great.\n\nThere is also an effect due to the decrease in the real value of income, but the mag-\nnitude of this effect\u2014the income elasticity of saving\u2014probably does not vary so much\nfrom time to time and from country to country as the ratio between bonds and savings.\nIn the United Kingdom the size of the income elasticity to save is small compared to the\nratio between bond and saving. Consequently the estimation of the theoretical result\nshowed that in the United Kingdom the effect of inflation on real consumer saving is\npositive.\n\nStatistical investigation showed that our theoretical result is not contradicted by the\nfacts. The regression coefficient between the change in the share of saving from disposable\nincome and the change in the price level was of the magnitude which was expected from\nthe theory and there is a probability of 0.813 that the sign of the regression coefficient is as\nexpected from the theory.\n\nILARI TYRNI.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 09:19:55 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

But for the same reason, Arrow's majority\ndecision may not be discoverable from voting data. If in a referendum, there are m votes\nfor A, n for B, and p abstentions, what do we decide? At least, m people of course satisfy\nAR;B. But the p abstentions may be consistent with AR;B, or may not; they may for\nexample represent BP;A, i.e., not AR;B, subject to case (IIT). Similarly, the n votes for B\nmay represent not AR;B, or it may not; they may, for example, represent AR;B, and\nBRiA, subject to cases (TI) or (II). Thus, even if we arbitrarily assume the existence of only\ncase (T), or only case (II), or only case (IIT), an element of undecidability will still be there.\n\nFinally, it may also be pointed out that once the relevance of the utility or disutility\nof voting is recognized, it is no longer strictly decidable whether the underlying preference\npattern is single-peaked or not. The difficulty arises as before from the lack of a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between preferences and votes, given that the voters maximize utility, as\ndescribed above, rather than follow rules of thumb. Thus single-peakedness of preferences\nis not generally decidable with voting data.! In addition there is the problem that with\nBlack's method of majority decision transitivity is not guaranteed by single-peakedness,\nwhereas with Arrow's method of majority decision what is decided is not generally obser-\nvable from voting statistics.\n\nAMARTYA KUMAR SEN.\n\n!

The reason\nwhy such a strong result holds for their cases may be explained by the fact that the con-\ndition of uniform convergence of the value preserving paths is satisfied in trivial ways,\nrespectively.\n\n5. In this section we are concerned with McKenzie's theorem. The set of the input\nconfigurations of the normalized value-preserving technologies is an 7 \u20141-dimensional\nsimplex R involved in S. McKenzie assumes that each industry has a strictly convex\ntechnology set. From this, the normalized maximal balanced growth technology is a\nunique combination of n normalized technologies selected, one for each industry, and each\nindustry has only one normalized value-preserving technology.\n\nIf there is a value-preserving path of any order, the path is expressed by the solution\nx! of the difference equation:\n\nyt AB! \u2014 yt[I \u2014 A 4- By,\nxt \u2014 yt] \u2014 A 4- Bl and y! z 0.\n\nHere, each column of matrix B is the normalized input configuration of the value-preserving\ntechnology selected one from each industry, and each column of matrix [/ \u2014 A -- B] is\nits normalized output configuration.

The other x's therefore\nmove in step with it, as before, while the z's are unaffected.\n\nThis extension, though slight, is not trivial economically.

However the '' typical \" case may reasonably said to be that of a series of\nsmall, fairly isolated, markets, being pulled closer and closer together at higher levels\u2014\na type of model which is also close to the heart of some economists.

            "found": "168 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nTo see the relations between the pace of technical progress and the length of life of\nplant, we must keep a clear view of what question is being put to the model. Some com-\nplications (which the ingenious reader can supply) are avoided, in the comparison between\neconomies, by postulating that the capital/labour ratio is the same, in each economy, in\nproducing consumer goods as in producing capital goods, and that the degree of mech-\nanisation is everywhere the same.\n\nTo exhibit the neo-neoclassical theorem, I compared two economies with the same rate\nof growth and different propensities to save out of profits. In the economy where the\ncapitalists are more thrifty, the share of profits is less and the life of plant shorter. If we\nintroduce into this picture Arrow's principle of learning by doing (which means, as I inter-\npret it, that a higher ratio of gross investment to stock of capital induces a faster pace of\ntechnical progress) then the more thrifty economy also has a higher rate of growth.\n\nFor Arrow, the ratio of gross investment to income is an independent datum. A higher\nratio (due to greater thriftiness of the economy as a whole) tends to shorten the life of\nplant (by increasing the proportion replaced every year) and consequently to increase the\nrate of growth.\n\nThus, in both models, given the propensity to learn by doing, faster growth is associated\nwith shorter life, but the causation runs the other way.\n\nNow compare economies with the same thriftiness conditions, of which one has a\nhigher propensity than the other to learn by doing. A faster rate of growth entails a higher\nratio of investment to capital (both valued in terms of consumer goods). A given ratio of\ninvestment to income cannot sustain a higher rate of growth unless the capital/income\nratio is lower. Thus, for Arrow, the life of plant must be longer in the faster growing\neconomy.! This entails that the share of gross profits on the latest plant is higher to an\nextent that more than offsets the faster pace of the rise of wages. The rate of profit on\ncapital is thus determined.\n\nIn the Keynesian model, given the thriftiness conditions, the rate of profit is determined\ndirectly by the rate of growth. In the extreme case where savings are equal to profits,\nthe rate of profit on capital is equal to the rate of growth. Now, if the capital/output\nratio is the same in the two economies, the share of net profits in proceeds is proportional\nto the rate of profit on capital, which is identical with the rate of growth. On our assump-\ntions, the share of gross profit is proportional to the share of net profit. Thus the two\nopposing influences balance; the length of life of plant is independent of the rate of growth.\n\nIn the general case, with some consumption out of profits, the rate of profit exceeds\nthe rate of growth (the more so, the smaller the proportion of saving in profits). A higher\nrate of growth is associated with a more than proportionately higher share of profits and\ntherefore a longer life of plant.\n\nThus in no case (on our assumptions) does a faster pace of technical progress lead\nto a shorter life of plant.\n\nFurther complications can be introduced into the analysis if we allow for a choice\nof technique at each stage of the learning process. A faster rate of growth tends to lead\nto a lower degree of mechanisation, as well as longer life; but the degree of mechanisstion\nitself reacts upon length of life, through its effect upon the share of profits in proceeds.\nThis was thc point that Mr Pai Panandikar was struggling to express, but at that time no\none understood the argument sufficiently to see what he was driving at.\n\nCambridge. JOAN ROBINSON.\n\n! Arrow takes the ratio of gross saving to gross income to be given by the propensity to save, instead\nof the proportion of net income saved, as in the formula g \u2014 s/v. This reduces the force of the relation\nbetween saving and the capital/output ratio. His assumption, however, seems rather unnatural.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 10:10:16 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Throughout, discussion has been\nconfined to systems that produce stable means. Thus, monotonically divergent time\nseries will not occur. In neither case is there a possibility of variances which converge\nto zero; consequently, both models produce irregular oscillations around fixed levels.\n\nStandard non-stochastic dynamic models generate various classes of time series: if\nthe roots of a second order system are complex with modulus greater than 1, for example,\nthe time path will diverge and oscillate. The variance of the time series composed of regu-\nlar observations on this time path, will increase without bound through time. A logical\nconcomitant of this implication is that an unbounded variance (such as would be observed\nwith y \u2014 1 in equation (10) ) is a sufficient condition for an explosive oscillatory time path.\nSimilarly, a stable variance is sufficient for regular oscillation with constant amplitude\n(the unit modulus time path). There is, however, a much richer array of time path possi-\nbilities in the stochastic models: there is no limitation to cycles with regular period and\nconstant (or steadily expanding) amplitude, and no dependence upon fortuitous properties\nof characteristic roots to obtain realistic fluctuations. In a paper which also rejects the\nstandard deterministic difference equation approach in favor of a random shock mechanism\n[11], Muth has shown that ** cobweb \"' behaviour can be obtained without the assumption\nof irrational price expectations on the part of farmers, a necessary ingredient in cobwebs\nspun in the absence of random shocks.\n\nVII CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe principal results of this study are (a) ** multiplier-accelerator '\" mechanisms can be\nmodified to accommodate random shocks; the modified mechanism generates series which\nafford a better representation of observable series than do the more familiar non-stochastic\ndifference equation models. (b) The rules for inventory investment prescribed for retailers\nin the new normative literature of managerial economics contain characteristics which\nmay lead to substantial amplification in the inherent variability of the system; so long as\nthe smoothing motive remains attractive to the manufacturer, however, this amplification\nmay in part be offset before it is transmitted to the employment and output decision level.\n(c) Under all conditions that can be foreseen in models which relate consumption to\ncurrent income, systems are stable, i.e., the variance of the income variable converges to\nsome finite level.\n\nChicago.

Put p' equal to\nthe proportion of instalments that are gross induced savings; these arise because people,\nhad they not bought on hire-purchase, would not have saved all the money they actually\ndid save by repaying their debt.

A glance at Figures 2 and 3 shows that Figure 2 is the more favourable,\nsince here there is an actual increase in repayments during a period equal to the new con-\ntract length. Figure 2 is more probable, as has been shown, if deposit controls are not\nstrengthened but the whole weight is borne by maximum contract lengths, so from this\npoint of view the government would be well advised to act more strongly against them.\nThe same is true of a proposed relaxation in controls for reflationary reasons; a lengthening\nof contracts will be associated with larger immediate net dissaving if there is a drop in\nrepayments, which again suggest that a greater lengthening with a smaller reduction in\ndeposits would be desirable.\n\nThere is no need here to prolong the discussion by analysing all the possible circum-\nstances in which the government might want to change its hire-purchase controls. The\nconsequences of such changes are more complicated than might appear at first sight, so\nthe most suitable technique of control under the circumstances of the moment should be\nselected with some care, and the somewhat lengthy transitions should not be overlooked\nin doing this.!\n\nExeter.

On the other hand, if \u00bb is negative, and the dis-\nequilibrium roots are dominated, then the coefficient of initial stocks is negative if zm is larger than the\nFrobenius output root.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 10:21:40 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The high value of 1934 may perhaps be ascribed to this factor.\nA. second consideration is that the Cottom Spinners' Association apparently controlled\nproduction through strong cartel action; Ueno believes that high profits were partly a\nresult of this cartelisation. This suggests that the division of the expected expansion of\noutput between the spinning firms may have been the result of a cartel decision. The\ninterpretation of cross section investment relations in a cartelised industry is not at all\nclear. Whatever the limitations of Ueno's cross section estimates, they do still constitute\na contradiction of one of our hypotheses.\n\nVI\n\nWe can now review the evidence presented in this paper. First we have showed that\nthere is a downward bias in accelerator coefficients due to the correlation between technical\nprogress and changes in output. For all the data surveyed the correlation coefficient\nwas positive and always exceeded 0.6; the typical value was about 0.9. \"These data sug-\ngested that there was, therefore, a downward bias of between 307; and 607/.  'These results\nwere not discredited when we reviewed the empirical evidence derived from distributed\nlag accelerator models. The addition of the bias gave results which were not markedly\ninconsistent with our theoretical expectations. Secondly, we put forward a much more\ntentative hypothesis\u2014that, due to the different degrees of bias, the cross section accelerator\ncoefficients would be lower than those from time series data. This hypothesis\u2014derived\nfrom an analysis of aggregate data\u2014was tested against various studies which use the firm\nas the unit of observation. The data of Klein and Kuh, when reinterpreted, conformed to\nthe prediction; only one set of Ueno's data discredited the hypothesis. To sum up we\ncan claim that the first hypothesis\u2014the general downward bias\u2014has been firmly established ;\nthe second hypothesis on cross section /time series estimates is still very tentative and more\ntests are required.\n\nBirmingham.

While the natural rate of growth is not affected by capital\naccumulation, an initial increase in the actual growth rate, due to policy measures, will\ntaper off only slowly, so it will continue for a long period. If the government policy\nwishes to maintain an increased growth rate, this lengthy period means that effecting\nchanges in the savings ratio is a satisfactory policy. On the other hand if the object of\nfiscal policy is to raise the level of income per head of the labor force as rapidly as possible,\nchanges in the savings ratio increases the level so s/owly that the new equilibrium level of\nincome which the higher savings ratio proposes to achieve may not be reached for a very\nlong time; in fact such a long time that a change in the savings ratio is unlikely to be useful\nas a fiscal policy.\n\nIf the government wishes to raise the level of income as quickly as possible, while\nmaintaining a higher growth rate of income, investigation of ways for improving technology\nin addition to increasing the rate of capital accumulation would be more likely to achieve\nboth of these goals.\n\nHonolulu, Hawaii.

Thus, if we were to select a starting program at random, the probability of\nfinding the optimal program would be 29. This suggests that it is quite likely that the\noptimal program would be observed in several trials with randomly selected starting\nprograms. Thus, the probability of reaching the program (23) at least once in two trials\nis 23 \u2014 .85, at least once in three trials is $25 \u2014 .94, and so on. These probabilities\nassume independent random trials with replacement.\n\nThe procedure for finding optimal programs consists of a sequence of repetitions, with\nrandom starting programs, of the algorithm for finding locally maximal partitions, together\nwith a stopping rule, which tells in what circumstances to end the repetitions. Stopping\nrules are discussed in (2). In essence, these stopping rules involve comparison of the value\nof an increase in the total pay-off (together with the probability of such an increase) with\nthe cost of another iteration of the algorithm which finds locally maximal programs.\n\nExperimental computations on problems whose structure is similar to, but more\ncomplicated than that one, using the stochastic algorithm outlined here, and other similar\nones as well, indicate strongly that it is quite likely that an optimal program will be found\nin very few iterations. Not only is an optimal program usually more probable than any\nother, but the probability of observing an optimal program is likely to be large as compared\nwith the probability of all other programs taken together. Some of these experimental\ncomputations are reported in [1]. Their import for the stochastic procedure outlined\nhere is, in summary:\n\n(1) It converges to an optimal program in a finite number of steps with probability\nequal to 1.\n\n(2) The probability that an optimal program will be found in a relatively small number\nof steps is large.\n\n(3) The probability of finding a '' nearly optimal\" partition in a small number (two\nor three) of steps is substantial.\n\nThis stochastic algorithm provides a computationally practical way of finding optimal\nor good programs.

It is therefore incompetent to contribute to the analysis of a\nhost of important problems: the one extreme is too narrow to be of great interest;\nthe other, too broad to permit meaningful generalizations.\"'\n\nIf this passage does not say that the theory has no rigorous implications for *' groups,\"\nand hence no *' testable \" implications, I am at a loss to know what it does say. And if\nArchibald can read this passage as implying that the concept of the group is to be rejected\nbecause its assumptions are unrealistic, then there is real doubt that any communication\nbetween Archibald and me is possible.\n\nStigler is unduly generous in his evaluation of Archibald's attack on Chamberlin.\nThis attack is seriously marred by Archibald's failure to distinguish between the meaning\nof the condition ** marginal cost equals marginal revenue \"' and the condition '* average\ncost equals average revenue.\" The first is a maxim of rational conduct by the firm; it\nis something the firm seeks to achieve. The second is not. In a world of specialized\nresources, and certainly in one of monopolies whatever their source, it is either a convention\nof accounting (total costs equal total receipts) or, if defined to be an equilibrium condition,\nis imposed on the firm by the capital market via the revaluation of specialized resources.\nThis is what renders the tangency condition irrelevant to productive adjustments and\nmakes the alleged implications about ''excess capacity and unexploited economies of\nscale \"-\u2014with or without advertising\u2014highly misleading if not downright wrong.\n\nA useful concept of ** capacity \"' should be a technical, production concept, dependent\nof course on factor prices but not on the state of demand. The definition of capacity as\nthe minimum point of the kind of average cost curve for which tangency is relevant is not\nsuch a concept. Let demand rise, but the physical production function and factor prices\nremain unchanged except that the rents earned by the firm's specialized resources increase,\nand the minimum point will shift to the right. Does this shift in the minimum point\nimply a meaningful increase in capacity? \"Of course not. A useful concept of the capacity\nof a particular plant is the output at which short-run marginal costs equal long-run marginal\ncosts: if this is the expected output, the plant will be of the right size in the sense that the\nfirm has no incentive to seek either to enlarge it or make it smaller; it is operating at\n* capacity.\" On this concept of capacity, there is no more reason to expect short-run\nexcess capacity under monopoly than under competition. And this conclusion is of course\nsensible. Why should a firm's position on product markets have any connection with its\nincentive to produce whatever output it does produce as cheaply as possible? Similar\ncaveats are in order for alleged unexploited economies of scale.\n\nBecause average cost concepts offer such pitfalls to the unsophisticated, I have long\nfelt that it might promote a fuller understanding of economic theory to expunge '* average\ncost \" from the textbooks. Stigler took a large step in that direction in his 1952 revision\nof his Theory of Price, and by doing so, added noticeably to the quality of an already\noutstanding work. It is too bad that Archibald apparently learned his economic theory\nfrom the earlier edition.\n\nChicago. MiLTON FRIEDMAN.\n\n!

In\nparticular it depends on the crucial hypothesis (post-Keynesian rather than Keynesian)\nthat investment can be treated as an independent variable governed by technical progress\nand population growth.\n\nBut this is not the approach that I should like to take here. Whether we are or whether\nwe are not prepared to accept the model in this behavioural sense, there are important\npractical implications which are valid in any case. I should look, therefore, at the previous\nanalysis simply and more generally as a logical framework to answer interesting questions\nabout what ought to happen if full employment is to be kept over time, more than as a\nbehavioural theory expressing what actually happens.\n\nThe case of a socialist systera, which came last in our analysis, is the most straight-\nforward on this respect. The amount of investments that must be undertaken in order to\nmaintain full employment\u2014once this has been reached\u2014is indeed that which is required\nby technical progress and population growth. And if these investments are carried out,\nthe rate of profit (when uniformly applied) must be equal to the natural rate of growth,\nif total demand is to be such as to allow the full utilization of the productive capacity and\nof the labour force. These results do not depend on any behavioural assumption what-\nsoever. They are true whatever individual behaviour may be; as a simple matter of\nlogical necessity.\n\nIn the case of a capitalist system, the additional problem arises of whether the capital-\nists will or will not spontaneously undertake the amount of investments necessary to cope\nwith the natural possibilities of growth. We may of course discuss at length in this case\nthe circumstances under which equilibrium will or will not be automatically reached.\nBut again we should not let these discussions obscure the conclusions, which are valid in\nany case, about the relations that must be satisfied if full employment is to be kept. 1f\nfull employment is to be maintained, /hat amount of investment must be undertaken.\nAnd if it is undertaken; there is\u2014for any given proportion of capitalists' income which\ntends to be saved!\u2014only one rate of profit, i.e. one distribution of income between profits\nand wages, that keeps the system on the dynamic path of full employment.\n\nThis, it seems to me, is the relevant way to look at the model which has been elaborated\nabove. The whole analysis has been carried out with constant reference to a situation of\nfull employment because full employment is the situation that matters, and that indeed,\nnow-a-days, forms one of the agreed goals of any economic system. The conclusions,\ntherefore, acquire an important practical relevance whether the system is automatically\nable to reach full employment or whether it is not. In the latter case, I should say that\nthey become even more important, because it is then that practical measures have to be\ntaken and it becomes essential to have clear ideas about the direction in which to move.\n\nCambridge. LuiGi L. PASINETTI\n\n! Let me point out that, in this context, the objection so commonly advanced against the theory formu-\nlated in section 1 \u2014namely, that to classify the members of a modern society in only two groups is an arbi-\ntrary and crude simplification\u2014entirely loses its ground. The central outcome of the previous analysis\nhas just been to show that, as far as the determination of the rate of profit is concerned, the distinction\nbetween individuals who save exclusively out of profits and individuals who save out of wages is the only\none that matters.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 10:50:39 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In the absence of this type of instability the degree to which the labor supply\ncurve could be backward bending is rather limited.\n\nThe more interesting case (given that we do not observe instability in the labor market)\nis when 1 \u2014 fr. g\u00bb. When capital stock increases (decreases), the quantity of labor hired\nwill diminish (increase). Hence, the total change in output resulting from a change in\ncapital stock will always be absolutely smaller than the marginal productivity of capital.\nThus, whereas it is usually supposed that the observed inverse incremental capital-output\nratio is higher than the marginal product of capital, if the supply of labor were backward\nbending within the relevant range, the incremental output-capital ratio would be lower\nthan the marginal product of capital!\n\nMoreover, as gy fi, \u2014\u2014 1, the reduction in output attributable to a reduced labor\nforce as capital stock increases will eventually become larger than the marginal product of\ncapital, and total output will move inversely with the supply of capital stock available\n(on the assumption that the services of capital stock are monotonically related to the supply\nof capital) !

If it is believed that the supply\nof labor is backward bending, some investment in consumer goods of a kind to increase\nthe preference for income may have a very high yield if a government wishes to raise\nnational income (abstracting from the welfare question involved in consumers' preference\nfor leisure). Secondly, if the supply of labor is significantly negatively sloped, this in\nitself could account for the observed stagnation at low levels of output in some circum-\nstances. \"Thirdly, in all circumstances where the supply of labor is backward bending,\ncomputations of an inverse incremental capital-output ratio will always yield a number\nsmaller than the marginal product of capital.\n\nMinneapolis.

RoBERT L. BisHoP.\n\n1 Professor Fisher has asked me to add the following footnote, which corrects a minor error in his\npaper. He states (p. 127, n.1) that Theocharis gives the solutin to his original system of difference\nequations incorrectly, since the multiple root (1/2) must involve a polynomial in terms such as /i-!(1/2)t\n(i \u2014 1,..., n\u2014l). (McManus and Quandt, '* Comments on the Stability of the Cournot Oligopoly\nModel,\" this Review, Vol. XXVIII (2), 1960-61, 136, make a similar statement.) This is incorrect, and\nTheocharis's solution is right, as the latent vectors of the relevant matrix span the n-dimensional vector\nspace in which they lie, thus affording the requisite 1 independent solutions to the system, despite the multiple\nroot.\n\nA similar remark applies to Fisher's discussion (p. 130, n. 1) of the case where b -- d \u2014 0. Here,\nagain, the multiplicity of the root\u2014in this case, zero\u2014does not involve a polynomial time trend. However,\nthe fact that zero is \u00e0 root does mean that the particular solution involved is explosive, save in the special\ncase where all the c; are the same. In the latter case, the particular solution is still a constant vector, and\nstability of the second kind can still be obtained. The case of b 4- d \u2014 O corresponds to the cases (discussed\nabove) in which all reaction functions have the same slope. In these cases, if all reaction functions do not\ncoincide, stability (and, indeed, equilibrium itself with the stipulated number of producers all active) is\nnot present; if they all do coincide, the system can be stable (if the other conditions in Fisher's paper are\nsatisfied), but any point on the common reaction function can be approached as an equilibrium, depending\non the initial conditions.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 10:59:25 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

When there is con-\nsumption out of profits, so that the real wage is lower than that which corresponds to the\noptimum length of life of plant, replacements are not being made that the benevolent\nauthority would undertake.\n\nThe behaviour of the firms and of the benevolent authority coincide only when the\nrate of profit on capital is equal to the rate of growth of the economy.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt is not legitimate to draw practical conclusions, without further consideration, from\nan argument, such as the above, which is concerned only with the logical implications of a\npostulated state of equilibrium. n particular, it must be remarked that under private\nenterprise a rise in thriftiness is more likely to produce a slump than an improvement in the\nselection of technique and that it is more onerous to provide for an increase in the degree\nof mechanisation or a speeding up of obsolescence than to maintain a higher level that has\nalready been attained. Nevertheless, if there is any rough correspondence between\nreality and the type of analysis here set out, the fact that the rate of profit on capital may be\nof the order of 15 or 20 per cent in an economy that is growing at the rate of two or three\nper cent per annum, does suggest some interesting lines of thought.\n\nCambridge. JOAN ROBINSON.\n\nAPPENDIX I\n\nThere has been a recent revival of interest in Wicksell's problem of a process of deepen-\ning investment (with a constant labour force and a set of blueprints of known techniques\ngiven once and for all) carried out in neoclassical equilibrium so that the profit-maximising\nmarginal productivity conditions are continuously fulfilled.! There are two major\ndifficulties in this analysis. The first concerns the question of foresight. As the process\ngoes on the rate of profit falls. Are the entrepreneurs aware that this will happen, and if\nso, how are they to make the correct selection of types of long-lived plant to ensure that\nprofit maximising techniques are always in use?\n\nOne way to evade the difficulty is to postulate that the process goes on very slowly\nand plant is relatively short-lived, so that even though firms act on the assumption that the\npresent rate of profit will continue to obtain in the future, the errors in investment planning\nare not serious. (This is rather in the nature of the housemaid's excuse.) Another is to\npostulate that all capital goods are made from a homogeneous, indestructible material\ncalled s7ee/ or meccano, which might better be named ectoplasm. t can be shifted from\none use to another and moulded into different forms without cost, so that there can never\nbe any mistaken investments. In this case no foresight is needed.?\n\n! See Joan Robinson '* Accumulation and the Production Function,\" Economic Journal, September\n1959; and Collected Economic Papers, Vol. II, for a number of recent discussions of this problem. Since\nthen an elaborate treatment has been offered by Professor Meade in A Neo-Classical Theory of Economic\nGrowth. Meade allows for steady growth with an increasing labour force and technical progress, as well as\npure deepening.\n\n? |n the case where ectoplasm per man employed is always larger in the ectoplasm-producing sector of\nthe economy than in the consumption-good sector, ectoplasm will become redundant and its price sink to\nzero at some point in the process of decelerating accumulation. If ectoplasm is not indestructible, a process\nof decumulation (not accumulation) can take place under equilibrium conditions. The story starts with an\nindefinitely large stock of ectoplasm and runs down to the stationary state from above. This was pointed\nout to me by Dr. H. Uzawa.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 11:03:44 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

That is, a fluctuation in the rate of growth of aggregate money income,\napart from the causal (autonomous) change in spending, will be twenty per cent less than\nit would be if personal tax yields remained fixed.\n\nIf corporate investment is influenced by the current level of disposable retained profits,\nthe combined stabilizing impact of both personal and corporate tax yield sensitivity is\ngreatly increased. If, for example, corporate bodies invest two-tenths of any change in\nthe level of disposable profits the total stabilizing impact is increased to fifty per cent.\n\nThese estimates depend upon a number of simplifying assumptions in connection\nwith the tax system and the pattern of income fluctuations. Moreover, the consumption\ncoefficient adopted is probably too simple and a more precise analysis would have to take\naccount of the way spending propensities are likely to vary depending upon the magnitude\nof an income fluctuation.\n\nThe calculated compensatory effect of the income tax system is overstated to some\nextent by the omission of indirect tax yield changes from the analysis. Nevertheless,\nchanges in indirect tax yield will increase the total automatic regulatory effect of the fiscal\nsystem, as will the sensitivity of national insurance contributions and unemployment\nbenefits. \"The evidence suggests that discretionary fiscal measures are still very much\nrequired for the control of fluctuations in income, but the impact of automatic adjustments\nis probably greater than has been realized.\n\nEdinburgh.

The inclusion of capital\ngains in taxable income would prevent a most volatile part of total income from escaping tax and hence\nwould increase the responsiveness of tax yields to income changes. Any increase in the proportional\nrate on corporate income would increase the marginal rate and hence built-in flexibility of corporate tax\nyields\u2014or if corporate rates were made progressive the stabilizing effect would be strengthened even more.\nA reduction in exemption limits on personal incomes would broaden the tax coverage and a steepening\nof the rate schedules (without necessarily increasing the average liability) would also increase the flexibility\nof the tax yield. A similar result would be achieved by relating compulsory contributions and welfare\nbenefits more closely to the level of income. In short, any measure that would either broaden the tax base\nor make the rate schedules more progressive would increase built-in flexibility and hence also the automatic\nstabilizing effect.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 11:13:02 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The outstanding implication of the last two sections is that we require more facts,\nnot for their own sake, but in order to put into the theory sufficient content for it to yield\nsignificant predictions. Perhaps the most serious criticism of Chamberlin's critics is that\nthey have concentrated upon a priori discussion of his assumptions, instead of on discovering\nwhat facts were needed to give the theory content, and endeavouring to obtain them so that\nthey might test it. Discussion of the empirical material required is beyond the scope of\nthis paper, but the results of Section III are a little discouraging: we need facts about the\ndemand functions of individual firms (with respect to quality and advertising as well as\nprice) which are likely to be very difficult to get. Hence it may be that, with the obser-\nvational techniques at our disposal, the theory is not likely, at present, to be very fruitful.\nAs for the theory of the group, it appears that, to proceed further, we require some know-\nledge of demand relationships within groups. This suggests both theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nLondon. G. C. ARCHIBALD.\n\nMATHEMATICAL APPENDIX TO SECTION IIl:\n\nThis appendix is a somewhat overdue application of the methods of the early chapters\nof the Foundations to some cases that Samuelson did not have occasion to consider there.\nWe have a maximising model in several variables; our problem is to discover if our infor-\nmation is sufficient to determine the direction of change in the variables when a parameter\nis changed. It is in general obvious that we cannot expect much: the solutions will neces-\nsarily involve the second order partial derivatives, both direct and cross, and, if we have\nlittle information about the former, we have less about the latter. \"We shall, however,\nat least discover what is the minimum information necessary to determine the direction of\nchange. The main results are:\n\n(1) In the case of a specific tax, the direction of change of quantity is unambiguously\ndetermined without the need for any additional information.\n\n(2) This is not true in any other instance. To determine the direction of change of\nquality and advertising when tax changes, it is necessary to assume that second-order\ncross partial derivatives can be neglected; and this assumption is necessary in the case of\nan ad valorem tax to determine the sign of the quantity change.\n\n(3) In no case is the direction of change of price determined, even when cross-effects\nare ignored. This is because it is determined as a linear combination of the changes in\nquantity, advertising, and quality, which, in general, have opposite effects upon price.\n\nIn what follows, advertising and quality variation are first treated together and then\nseparately. It will be noticed that the only difference between the two follows from the\nform of the cost functions assumed: in the case of advertising, the costs of production\nand of advertising are assumed to be independent. It would be possible to treat quality\nvariation in this way, in which case there would be no analytical difference between it and\n\n1 [ am greatly indebted to Kelvin Lancaster, George Morton, and John Wise for generous help with\nthis appendix.

Further\npointers for the improved specification of econometric models may be expected\nfrom an intensive examination of the forecasting properties of the Oxford model\nover several recent years.?\n\n(iii) Conventional econometric models seem to underexploit the basic autoregressive-\nness of the economic system. The specification of linear structural equations\nwith some lags does imply that each endogenous variable has an autoregressive\nequation of the same order and with the same coefficients as all other endogenous\nvariables, but only three equations in the Oxford model have prior values of the\ndependent variable among the explanatory variables. It would be interesting\nto study the empirical properties of a system in which lagged values of the depend-\nent variable were incorporated with other explanatory variables in each relation-\nShip. This would imply a greater degree of agnosticism about economic relation-\nships than is customary, but it might be rationalised by saying that each variable\nis influenced by its previous values and by other variables which may push it off\nits autoregressive path. It would be interesting also to see the results of empirical\nresearch with reduced form systems, in which one estimated a separate equation\nfor each endogenous variable as a function of the whole set, or a sub-set, of the\npredetermined variables. For forecasting and policy purposes such a system\nwould be more directly useable than a set of nearly forty structural relations. To\nthe best of my knowledge, no model builder has yet presented the '' solved \"'\nversion of his system for the convenience of the reader.\n\n(iv) Perhaps we are expecting too much of econometric models at the present stage\nof their development. In particular, straight forecasting may be more efficiently\nachieved by the development of survey and anticipations data or by extensive\nautoregressive analysis of economic time series. Econometric forecasts take the\nform of numerical estimates, but if half or more of the implied directions of change\nturn out to be wrong we only have a spurious and misleading precision. As the\neconomic system moves through time, the odds on various further developments\nare continually changing; the likelihood of a balance of payments deficit increases,\nsay ; a renewed burst of inflationary pressure seems more probable. lt would\nbe interesting and important if an empirical model could be constructed in\nwhich the output was the estimated probability of change rather than the estimated\nabsolute changes.

Itis obvious from this mode of argument that the model works the way it does\nonly because wages are spent entirely on consumption and profits on machines. This is\nan extraordinarily powerful assumption, more powerful than many of its users realize.\nHere is a cute example of just how powerful it is: Constant returns to scale, competition,\nmachines produced by labor alone, consumables produced by machines alone, wages\nconsumed, profits saved. Exercise: prove that the relative share of wages in national\nincome is exactly 1/2!\n\n8. In my 1956 paper (and in Swan's) this assumption is not made. \"We took saving\nas a fraction of aggregate income (at one point I permitted the savings ratio to depend on\nthe rate of return on capital).

Because an increase in w/r will increase\nk, and k, and also increase P;/P; if Sector 1 is more labor-intensive, hence decrease Yj/Y,,\nhence increase relatively the output of the machine-intensive sector.\n\nIt would not be easy to give a complete analysis of equilibrium paths for this model.\nBut it seems highly likely from the first two terms on the right-hand side that it can give\nrise to behavior like that of the one-sector model; there may be equilibrium paths in\nwhich K/L increases without limit, for instance.

We have seen that quite strong assumptions are needed to justify his intuition,\nbut that these are certainly no less realistic than those of the current approach to long-run\nequilibrium.\n\nBut although we would be quite content to have achieved only this piece of retro-\nspective justification, we believe that something more has been accomplished. By freeing\nlong-run analysis from its dependence on equilibrium for all firms and consumers, the\nmodel has thrown open the way to a closer analysis of the competitive process, and of the\nways in which the structure of an industry changes through time. On the other hand,\nthere are a large number of mopping-up operations to be done, as well as further advances\nto be made; and perhaps some of our more exposed thrusts should be withdrawn a little.\nTime alone will tell whether this particular way of approaching the problem is useful,\nbut we are in no doubt that economic analysis will in some way eventually have to deal\nwith this class of problems.\n\nIn the meantime, let us mention some important areas (other than those already\ndiscussed) where consolidation is needed, and where further progress could be made.\nFirst, we have been rather vague about the actual numbers in the transition matrices, and\nabout the ways in which they are derived from the basic production (and, for demand,\npreference) data; the general approach is fairly clear, but the details need a good deal\nof work. In particular, the role of internal economies and diseconomies needs to be\nelucidated. Secondly, the rather ** unnatural \" monotonicity assumption, indicates that\nit might be more appropriate to investigate the stability of the size distributions themselves,\nrather than of total output and price. This, however, would leave price determination out\nin the cold, and the model would have to be extended by the inclusion of relations dealing\nwith it, possibly of Walrasian '* market-clearing \" type. Thirdly, we have dealt here only\nwith partial equilibrium. In an earlier unpublished paper, we dealt also with the general\nequilibrium analysis of this system, but only at the cost of a very restrictive assumption\non the demand functions, i.e., that they could be inverted to give prices as well-defined\nfunctions of quantities demanded. Clearly there is a rich field for future work.\n\nFourthly, in many respects the model has a definite recursive structure (especially\nin the ** birth-and-death \"* special case), and this makes it suitable for econometric investi-\ngation. Finally, and probably most important, exclusion of imperfect competition is\nregrettable, particularly since the analysis should help to throw light on the ways in which,\nas the size distribution of the industry changes under the impact of economic forces,\nperfect competition gives way to monopolistic conditions (and\u2014possibly\u2014on the reverse\nprocess). Indeed since, as Harvey Brazer has pointed out to us, the size distribution of\nfirms in perfect competition is not particularly interesting, the problem of extending the\nmodel to imperfect competition will be a crucial test of its usefulness, as well as of its\nrobustness.\n\nIn spite of all these problems, however (and there are others), we believe that some such\nstochastic approach as this is required if the unfortunate and ever-widening gap between\nthe approaches of micro-economics and macro-economics is\u2014someday\u2014to be closed.!\n\nAnn Arbor PETER NEWMAN.\nBerkeley J.

SuMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThis paper has been concerned with the ratios of price to marginal cost for produced\ncommodities, and with the ratio of labour income after tax to labour income before tax.\nIts principal substantive conclusions are as follows:\n\n(a) 1f some of these ratios are given and others are free to vary, the first-order con-\nditions for an optimum prescribe that, if commodities are substitutes in the Hicksian sense,\nthe variable ratios should lie within the range bounded by the largest and smallest of the\ngiven ratios. If complementarity is present, no such bounds can in general be set for the\noptimal ratios.\n\n(b) Consider a set of such ratios, some given and some variable, the latter set at values\nprescribed by the first-order conditions. Let us now change one of thevari able ratios\n(say that of x;). If the initial ratios are uncorrelated (or negatively correlated) with the\nchanges that now occur in the values of the Slutzky substitution terms relating to x, the\nfirst-order conditions define an optimum with respect to the xq-ratio. The optimum is\nlocal if (but not only if) this requirement is met in the vicinity of the value of the x;-ratio\nprescribed by the first-order conditions; it is global if (but not only if) it is met for all\nchanges in the x;-ratio.\n\nThree final points will be made. First, as Samuelson points out ([l11], p. 20),\nit may be that the optimal allocation of given totals of commodities according to the social\nwelfare function is a position of unstable market equilibrium. He suggests that it is\npossible for a government to circumvent this difficulty; it is a debatable point whether\nthis requires more or less skill than to decide whether a particular set of ratios of price to\nmarginal cost defines a local optimum, a global optimum, or a pessimum! Secondly,\nit may be that a programming approach to the problem discussed in this paper would\nbe more fruitful; it has been pointed out to me? that this would be particularly the case\nif we were to introduce more than one primary resource. Thirdly, it would be interesting\nto examine the implications of the techniques and results of this paper for problems of\ninternational trade.\n\nToronto. H. A.

In addition, it should be remembered that idle capacity may take the form of\nidle machines or idle men or both. The implications of planning for some idle capacity\nof manpower in inter-firm or sectoral models, including the input-output type, have not\nbeen drawn in this paper but they might prove the basis of some interesting discussion\nconcerning the welfare efficiency of an economy. The criticisms of competitive economies\nthat there is too much idle capacity, and of planned economies that there is too little,\nseem especially interesting in light of these observations. One of the problems involved\nin planning an economy under centralized control would seem to be the provision of\nenough idle capacity, rather than the '* least possible \" which planners often aim for.\n\nPerhaps one of the most useful tasks which queueing theory could be put to work\non is the determination of the optimum number of competing servicing units (petrol\nstations is a good example) and the most efficient average level of idle capacity in an industry\nor market. Economists have always had vague notions about the need for some extra\ncapacity to take care of fluctuations, but this approach clears up many of the conceptual\ndifficulties and ties the problem up into a manageable bundle.\n\nREFERENCES AND FURTHER READING\n\nR.

If this assumption did not\nhold, the commodities in the system could be divided into (say) k mutually disjoint groups,\nsuch that the commodities of the first group produced only those of the second, those\nof the second only those of the third (and so on), until the commodities of the kth group\nproduce only those of the first group; so that after k periods the inputs of commodities\nof any group would be converted, independently of other groups, into outputs of com-\nmodities of the same group. Accordingly, though the system is indecomposable, so that\nin any single period it does not fall apart into sub-systems, we could make it decomposable,\nif we were prepared to construct new periods that consisted of k of our previous periods,\nand look only at the initial inputs and final outputs of these compound periods. Thus\nwe may say that while Assumption I rules out simple independence, Assumption III rules\nout compound independence also. Compound independence is not inconsistent with the\nexistence of a von Neumann path; it does however mean that the optimum path (from\nan arbitrarily given starting path) may not approximate to the von Neumann path, but\nmay oscillate about it (within the ** compound \" period).\n\nThe further stages of Morishima's work then proceed as follows. The general\n** Turnpike \" problem\u2014of the optimum path with (arbitrarily) given initial supplies and\n(arbitrarily) given terminal product-mix\u2014is set up as a Linear Programming problem,\nprimal and dual; the primal determining the course of outputs and the dual the course of\n(imputed) prices. Lemma II establishes that if there are no zero outputs in the final\nperiod, there can be no zero outputs in any period; equality of costs and prices must\ntherefore hold throughout. (This, it should be noticed, does not exclude the possibility\nof excess supplies, with zero prices.) Lemma III then shows that, in infinite time, there\nis a convergence of prices; looking at the sequence of relative prices only, and starting\nfrom arbitrary initial prices, there is convergence to the von Neumann price-ray, in infinite\ntime. Lemma IV sharpens this convergence. Given a *' neighbourhood \" of the von\nNeumann price-ray (taken to be so small that the same activities as are chosen at the von\nNeumann prices are chosen at all prices that remain within the neighbourhood), any\nprice-sequence that starts close to arbitrary initial prices will remain within this neighbour-\nhood after a finite time. \"This uniform convergence, together with the fact that the initial\nimputed prices stay in a bounded region however long the programming period is taken\n(Lemma V), enables us to determine a finite time, that is independent of the length of the\nprogramming period, such that after that time the sequence of relative prices will be\nwithin the prescribed neighbourhood of the von Neumann price-ray. It follows that\nthe same activities as on the von Neumann ray will always be chosen except during a finite\ntime (which, as we have seen, may be zero) at the beginning.!\n\nAll the argument so far, since Lemma II, has run in terms of the price-sequence;\nthe principal properties of that sequence, which have emerged in simple terms in the course\nof my own argument, have been established by Morishima with great generality. (Lemma\nIV effectively establishes the convergence to constant costs.) All that remains for\nMorishima to do is to climb back from the price-sequence to the quantity-sequence;\nthis is what he does in the last stages of his proof.\n\n! Morishima's assumption that choice is made from a finite number of activities should here be noted.\n\nOxford. J. R.

Changes in prices\nand outputs are affected by the level of profits and excess stocks; but changes in excess\nstocks and profits are not determined by price and output levels but comprise a self-\ngenerating cumulative process of the type familiar from the classical theory of the business\ncycle. The casual interpretation of the complete system reduces the problem of stability\nto that of the relative stability of equilibrium and disequilibrium parts.\n\nThere are many directions in which this theory could be generalized. First, stocks\ndesired for precautionary motives were omitted from the analysis. In order to combine\nspeculation with trading in futures contracts, it would be necessary to analyze precautionary\nholdings as well as transactions and speculative holdings of stocks. Secondly, alternative\nassumptions about the formation of expectations of future prices could be adopted rather\nthan the hypothesis examined here, that expected price is equal to the long-run normal\nprice, which is equal to the cost of production. Finally, it would be of interest to deal\nexplicitly with the problem of the irreversibility of accumulation of fixed capital equip-\nment.\n\nThe main conclusions of this study are as follows. First, the investment is determined\nby capital requirements, steady growth output proportions and equilibrium relative prices\nare stable within the complete system, provided that the money rate of interest is at least\nequal to the equilibrium rate of growth. \"This conclusion may be verified when capital\nrequirements are determined by transactions motives alone and remains true when capital\nrequirements are determined by both transactions and speculative motives. The chief\nconsequence of speculative activity is to generate damped oscillations in speculative stocks\nand profits or to slow the approach to equilibrium which would take place if no specu-\nlative investment were undertaken.\n\nBerkeley, California.

As is seen most easily in (19),\nincreasing the number of firms only makes the damping rather quicker.

I had worked out what still appear\nto me (subject to the amendments of the ** Supplementary Note \"' in the June 1960 issue\nof this journal) the simplest conditions under which the revealed preference relation may\nbe extended to generate a complete ordering for the consumer. But I was careless in\nadapting Georgescu-Roegen's axiom to the revealed preference relation, in seeking con-\nditions under which this derived ordering may be represented by a continuous function\n(paragraph 33 on pp. 74-5 of my paper).\n\nGeorgescu-Roegen (Q. J. E., 1954, p. 508) defines a ** preferential set \"' as '* a continuous\nsequence of alternatives arranged in their order of preference \", and his Axiom II.7 may\nbe paraphrased as follows: Given a particular commodity bundle x and any preferential\nset Y not containing x, but containing y, and y, such that y,Px and x0Py,, then Y also\ncontains a bundle y, such that x is indifferent to y, (by definition of the preferential set, ys\nis unique). He claims that no ordinal measure of utility can be obtained without such an\nassumption and\u2014by inference\u2014that this condition allows a complete ordering to be\nrepresentable by the usual continuous utility function, unique up to a monotonic or\norder-preserving transformation.*\n\nMy error arose from failing to observe that Georgescu-Roegen's axiom, although its\nwording is ambiguous on this point, must apply to every preferential set satisfying the\nconditions of the axiom. The Engel curves in the revealed preference problem are certainly\npreferential sets (in the sense of rp) that satisfy the axiom, but there may well be other\npreferential sets around that do not, as the reader may verify by studying Dr. Uzawa's\ncounter-example. It is also fairly easy to see intuitively that if there are no kinks in the\nbehaviour curves (his suggested condition), then the axiom will be satisfied for al/ prefer-\nential sets.\n\nMona, Jamaica. PETER NEWMAN.\n\n* The relations between orderings and representational functions, and the necessary proofs, have not\nyet been completely worked out in the literature, and will form the subject of a later paper by R. C. Read\nand myself. That there does exist some confusion may be seen in Maurice McManus's otherwise excellent\npaper in this journal (Volume 25, no. 2), where he states (p. 98, footnote 3) that '* Continuity and density,\nhowever, are true properties of ordinal quantities \". Clearly any continuous representation function\ncan be submitted to a discontinuous order-preserving transformation so that this statement is false; the\nonly invariant property of an ordering is the order itself.\n\n142\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 20 Feb 2022 11:30:41 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

In the\nlong run the supply of exportables is certainly responsive to changes in the domestic prices\nof exports; and in the short-run, even though the supply of exportables may be fixed, their\nprices in foreign currency may well fall. It is this latter short-run case which will be\nconsidered briefly here.\n\nIn discussions of the United Kingdom devaluation of 1949 it is often said or implied\nthat export prices tended to be inflexible in domestic currency\u2014to be fixed on a cost rather\nthan a market demand basis. With the supply of exports fixed, a devaluation will then\nmean a reduction in the foreign currency value but no change in the domestic value of\nexports. The foreign currency value of exports will fall in proportion to the devaluation.\nWhether a devaluation improves or worsens the balance of payments then depends only\non the elasticity of demand for imports. 1f this is unity the value of imports in domestic\ncurrency does not change (and in foreign currency falls in proportion to the devaluation),\nand the balance of payments will not alter. Only if the elasticity of demand for imports\nis greater than unity will the balance of payments improve. This type of case is not generally\nprovided for in formal international trade theory, which commonly assumes market-\nbased pricing. It might be useful here (as also when there is excess demand for imports\nor for home-produced goods) to introduce a ** price flexibility factor \"*.\n\nCost-based export pricing can be represented in Figure III. The initial position is at\nL and the increased price of imports shifts consumers! equilibrium to A. This time the\ndomestic value of exports does not rise, so there is no increase in expenditure in terms of\nheme-produced goods. Instead of the equilibrium shifting up to B or C (as in our earlier\nanalysis), it stays at A.\n\nThe value of exports in terms of foreign currency falls in proportion to the devaluation.\nIf A is due west of L, this means that the degree of external deficit originally represented\nby L is now represented by 4. And in this case there has been no change in the balance of\npayments situation. But of course A may be north-west or south-west of L, depending\non the elasticity of demand for imports, and then the foreign value of imports will have\nfallen more (north-west) or less (south-west) than exports.\n\nMelbourne.

As for the first and third quotations\u2014in\nthose relatively rare cases where they discussed disequilibrium, the classics seem quite\nclearly to have recognized that a change in the money supply can affect supplies and\ndemands for goods (thereby rejecting the homogeneity postulate),? just as they were well\naware of the possibility that an increase in the money supply may tend to reduce the\ninterest rate. They only insisted that wien equilibrium is finally attained it will all have\nworked out well\u2014price level adjustments will have returned goods supplies and demands\nto their original position and have pushed the rate of interest back to its old investment-\nsaving equilibrating level.\n\nIf this is so, the constructions discussed by Archibald-Lipsey and Mishan do not pertain\ndirectly to the work of the classical economists. There is no dichotomy between real and\nmoney price level determination in the classical system except where it involves only equi-\nlibrium price levels.

The Patinkin discussion of the real-\nbalance effect is of importance because it describes an important feature of the dynamic\nequilibrating mechanism and because it points out a contradiction in the work of several\nmore recent writers who (sometimes inadvertently) would have Walras' law, the homogeneity\npostulate, and the Cambridge equation all hold at once, even in disequilibrium, and who\nwould foist this monstrosity upon us as '' the classical system \"'.\n\nPrinceton.

For in this case it can be shown that the ratio between the aggregate stock of\nbonds and the aggregate stock of money, i.e., SB/Sy, appears as an explicit parameter in\nthe reduced form equations corresponding to ($3). Even in this instance, however, all\n\" real\" quantities are invariant with respect to equiproportionate changes in the aggre-\ngate stock of money and bonds. This emphasizes what is perhaps the most interesting\nfeature of the system (S2), namely, that the stock of bonds is '* geared \"\" to the stock of\nmoney via a market adjustment mechanism in such a fashion that changes in the aggre-\ngate stock of bonds are, ceteris paribus, directly proportional to changes in the stock of\nmoney.\n\nResults precisely analogous to the above can be obtained for an economy containing\nfixed supplies of physical assets (which yield an income in ** kind \").

As Patinkin\npoints out,! equilibrating additions to, or subtractions from, the stock of real balances on\nthe part of either households or firms may intervene between the two.\n\nIH\n\nIn conclusion, two implications of the foregoing discussion may be stated explicitly.\n\nFirst, the stock of real balances is, or can be made, an integral part of value theory\nas well as of monetary theory. Starting with certain specified assumptions, we can derive\ndemand functions in which the initial stock of real balances plays a definite role. It\nshould be emphasized that the importance of this real balance effect is an empirical, not\nan a priori, matter. Patinkin, for example, suggests that **. . . there is fairly persuasive\nevidence from the postwar experience of inflationary pressures generated by accumulated\nliquid assets that this behaviour (that of consumers in commodity markets) has been so\n(i.e. by the real value of their money balances) affected.\"? The usefulness of demand\ntheory is to suggest the specification of, and place restrictions on, the demand relationships\nrequired in practice. For example, the econometrician is interested in the problem as\nto whether or not he should include the stock of real balances in (say) his consumption\nfunction. Orthodox demand theory tells him to do this; the only question remaining is\ntherefore how important it is, and this is an empirical matter.\n\nSecondly, on a theoretical level, the stock of real balances is a matter of some impor-\ntance in any economy where positive saving exists. In certain special cases (i.e., where\ndepreciating assets are not involved), the stock of real balances becomes irrelevant in full\n(i.e., stationary) equilibrium. But this is not surprising. 1t will be recalled that the\ninfluence of the real value of the monetary stock was first called into account? as a device\nfor explaining how saving and investment could be automatically equated, in a schedule\nsense, at a positive rate of interest and a full-employment level of income. Thus positive\nsaving was presumed to be desired at high levels of income, and so it is quite reasonable\nthat the stock of real balances should figure on a theoretical level, in one set of circum-\nstances (an economy with positive savings at high levels of income) but not in another\n(namely, in a special type of stationary state).*\n\nPennsylvania R.

Here all that we can do is to observe that the authors demonstrate that the\nequations of the neo-classical model of the kind they consider are consistent in a formal sense. This is\nirrelevant to the central issues of whether such a model is particularly meaningful from an economic point\nof view, or whether it provides an adequate background for a discussion of the response of price changes\nto autonomous shifts in the money supply. In their discussion the authors fail to come to grips with\nPatinkin's argument, for the most part because their use of the word '' consistent \" cannot beiden tified\nwith Patinkin's use of the term.\n\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 05:24:45 UTC\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

Now Clower and Burstein\nargue that, in the stationary exchange model of our Part I, the quantity-theory relationship\nremains even when money and bonds are substitutes. This is an interesting result, and\nwe should like to understand just how it is obtained, particularly since, at first sight, it\ndepends on a rather special assumption. Suppose that the quantity of money is arbitrarily\ndoubled. Now if individuals redistribute bonds, they permanently redistribute real income.\nThen the aggregate equilibrium demand for real balances is altered, and the price level\ntherefore not doubled, wnless all individuals have identical linear transactions demands for\nreal balances.\n\nClower and Burstein show that '** provided we adhere to the standard assumption of\nthe uniqueness of equilibiium states . . .\" we continue to get the quantity theory result.\nThey assume **. . . that the demand for each commodity and the real demand for bonds\n(equivalently, bond income) and for cash balances is in every case a function of real\nincome, relative commodity prices, the rate of interest, real bond income and real money\nbalances \". The argument may now be stated as follows: assume a position of equili-\nbrium and double the stock of money; (1) doubling all prices leaves real balances and\nrelative prices unchanged; (2) doubling the nominal quantity of bonds! leaves real bond\nincome unchanged; since all real values are now unchanged, this is a possible equilibrium\nsolution; now, by the assumption that equilibrium is unique, this is the only equilibrium\nand all real equilibrium values are independent of the price level, which varies proportionate-\nly with the stock of money.? \"Thus the invariance properties of the model are undisturbed\nby the introduction of bonds provided that, following Patinkin, all demands are *' real \"'.\nIn the Keynesian model, of course, part of the demand for money is nominal, so that this\ninvariance proof will not hold.

In the light of this brief\ndiscussion, it can be seen that these arguments are not always well founded. By the\nsame token, many of the arguments employed by opponents of the device cannot be said\nto have any general validity. The effects of index-linking depend in general upon the\nbehaviour patterns of the individuals in the community in which it is introduced; on com-\nplex considerations concerning expectations, and on the interpersonal and intersectoral\ndistribution in the economy of obligations fixed in money terms. These must be evaluated\nfor any economy in which its introduction is contemplated.\n\nThere is also to be considered an important argument of principle, namely, that\nindex-linking enables those members of the community who so choose, to eliminate some\nof the risk arising from monetary instability. Other things equal this must be accounted\na positive gain. \"This consideration suggests that an index clause may be of value even\nwhen, on balance, the community expects no significant movement in the price level in either\ndirection.\n\nThe main arguments against the introduction of index-linking derive from expedience.\nThe device may well make it difficult for the authorities to attain their policy objectives\nin other directions. It is for instance, perfectly possible for index-linking to add to the\nlevel of effective demand even if expectations turn out to be correct. In addition, if\nexpectations turn out to be wrong, the device may add to the pressure on prices arising\nfrom costs. To some extent also, the use of particular weapons of economic policy such\nas increases in indirect taxation, may be rendered less effective. An increase in effective\ndemand is not of course a decisive ground for opposing a particular policy even in time of\ninflation, but it is evidently a factor to which much weight is likely to be given in practice.\n\nIn addition to these considerations there are numerous practical matters to weigh\nin the scale against the device. Difficult problems of accounting would arise for businesses.\nThe problem of defining an appropriate index would become of major importance. Almost\ncertainly, the authorities would be tempted to tailor their tax and subsidy measures so that\nthe index is stabilised.! Nonetheless, post-war experience suggests that these practical\ndifficulties need not be regarded as decisive.\n\nTo decide where, among these conflicting considerations, the balance of advantage\nlies for any particular economy is clearly not an easy matter. The difficulty of this task,\ncombined with the fact that the advance of inflation has currently been checked may suggest\nthat the issue would be best shelved. The argument from the current stability of prices,\nhowever, does not dispose of the issue. For one thing, it has yet to be shown that, over the\nlonger run, monetary stability is compatible with a satisfactory rate of economic growth.\nFor another, much of the real case for index-linking rests on its ability to ameliorate the\nproblems associated with unexpected price changes, whether inflationary or otherwise. If\nit were felt that the merits of index-linking were sufficiently persuasive to warrant its intro-\nduction even within a limited field, there would be much to be said for taking steps to do\nso at a time when this could only be construed as a demonstration of strength on the\npart of the authorities rather than the reverse.\n\nCambridge.

This reduces an important secondary inflationary pressure\nfrom scarcity of goods caused by hoarding, so that linkage makes not only a given degree\nof inflation less harmful, but tends to reduce the degree of inflation itself.\"\n\nThe opposite view has been expressed by the Bank of Israel, which fears that the effec-\ntively higher interest rates, induced by this method, would augment the spiral of the cost\ninflation.\n\nThis writer's view is that the main significance of the value-linking instrument in Israel\nis a political one; accidentally or deliberately it has strengthened even further the public\nsectors at the expense of the private sectors. Reference has already been made to the\nnegative aspects of rigidity which this technique helps to stress.

                    "208 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\n\nstock-flow theory any stock-flow good will be represented by two excess demand equations,\nan excess flow demand equation and a market excess demand equation. Provided that\nboth money and bonds are either pure stock or pure flow goods and therefore represented\nby only one excess demand equation, the two theories must be equivalent by the Hicksian\nproof. In a pure flow economy, i.e., one in which goods are produced and consumed\nbut never held, or in a pure stock economy, i.e., one in which goods are held but never\nproduced or consumed,! the Hicksian proof is quite valid. Even in a stock-flow economy,\nwhere production, consumption, and holding go on simultaneously, Hicks! proof holds\nif neither bonds nor money are stock-flow goods, though one may be a stock good and the\nother a flow good.\n\nThe problem arises in the seemingly more realistic case when bonds or money or\nboth are stock-flow goods and therefore represented by two equations. In this case\ncertain limiting conditions must be met before Hicks' proof is valid. By Walras' Law\nwe are able to eliminate one of our excess demand equations, but only one. In order to\neliminate a stock-flow good from our equation system we must eliminate not one but two\nequations. One way we might do this is to make certain assumptions concerning the\ninstitutional make-up of the model we are working with, thus causing some of the equation\nin our system to be redundant by connecting them to other equations. In particular, it\nis possible to link the excess flow demand function for money to the excess flow demand\nfunction for bonds in such a way as to make them equivalent.\n\nLet us suppose that in our particular economy the only way to create bonds is to go\nto a bank, state one's intentions to the banker, and, should he see fit, promise to pay him\na certain sum per year in perpetuity. The banker, in return for this, creates demand de-\nposit in the name of the individual and the deal is completed. In order to buy back the\nbond one must return to the banker and by the same process eliminate the agreement,\nin which case the banker destroys the previously created demand deposits of the individual.\nLet us further suppose that in this economy of ours the only way in which the banker can\ncreate money is by buying individuals\" bonds, and the on]y way in which he can destroy\nmoney is by selling them back to the individual from whom he originally bought them.\nNo one but the banker is permitted to hold bonds and no one but the banker is permitted\ntocreate money. In this economy, therefore, it will be impossible to destroy bonds without\ndestroying money, and it will be impossible to create bonds without creating money.\nIt will be equally impossible to create or destroy money without creating or destroying\nbonds. The excess flow demand function for money gives us the rate of destruction or\ncreation of money at each set of values assumed by the model. In our model economy\nit must also tell us the rate of destruction or creation of bonds, because the two are identical.\n\nThis is not to say that bonds and money are in any sense identical; the stock of money\nmay be much greater or smaller than the stock of bonds for historical reasons, but the\nrate of change of the two stocks will be identical.\n\nUnder these conditions the excess flow demand for bonds is always identical to the\nexcess flow demand for money; if one is equal to zero, the other is equal to zero. Now by\nWalras' Law we may eliminate either the market excess demand for money or the market\nexcess demand for bonds. Since, when the excess flow demand for bonds is in equilibrium\nthe excess flow demand for money must also be, which of them we choose to deal with is\nof no importance. Like Hicks we may call a theory which chooses to eliminate the market\n\n1 This of course, is precisely the situation envisaged in the pure exchange economy of the earlier stock\nand flow analysis.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 05:35:39 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

One not only must concern oneself with the allocation\nof existing stocks but also with the net change in these stocks which arises when the rate of\nproduction is not equal to the rate of consumption. At any given price there will be a\ncertain demand to hold any stock-flow good, there will also be a certain net rate of\nproduction of that good (possibly negative or zero). If there is a non-zero net rate of\nproduction the size of the stock of the good in existence will change. If this change is\nnot compensated for by a change in demand, excess market demand (excess demand to\nhold plus excess demand to consume) will be non-zero, and price must change. If stocks\nare changing the system must be out of equilibrium. However, if the rate of current\nproduction (flow supply) is not equal to the rate of current consumption (flow demand)\nStocks must be changing. In equilibrium, flow supply (the rate of production of goods)\nmust be equal to flow demand (the rate of consumption of goods). \u2014 That is to say that\nexcess flow demand (flow demand less flow supply) must be zero.\n\nUnfortunately the fact that the current rate of production is equal to the current\nrate of consumption does not mean that the market is in equilibrium. There still exists\nthe possibility that the current existent stock of the good is not equal to the current demand\nto hold the good. \u2014 This being the case, price will change because total demand (consump-\ntion plus the demand to hold) will not be equal to total supply (production plus existent\nstocks). In equilibrium, not only must the rate of production equal the rate of consump-\ntion, but total supply must be equal to total demand. Thus according to the ** new\"\nstock-flow economics a stock-flow good, that is one which is produced, consumed and held\nmust be represented in a general equilibrium system not with one but with two excess\ndemand equations. One is the excess flow demand equation which tells for each possible\nset of values of the system what the rate of additions to or subtractions from stocks will be.!\nThe other is the market excess demand equation which shows the total market demand,\nboth stock and flow, for the good at these values. In equilibrium both these equations\nmust be equal to zero. If excess flow demand is not zero, then flow supply, the rate of\ncreation of new stocks, must not be equal to flow demand, the rate of destruction of old\nStocks, and over time there will be net additions to or subtractions from stock, which will\ncause the market excess demand curve to shift and thus change equilibrium price. If\nmarket excess demand is not zero then there will be forces at work causing prices to change.\nThus for each stock-flow good in an economy there will be two equations which must be\nsatisfied. Fora pure stock good or a pure flow good, on the other hand, the usual analysis\ncan be conducted with one excess demand equation for each good.\n\nThe Hicksian proof of the equivalence of the two theories is based upon what Patinkin\ncalls ** Walras Law \"', according to which, in a consistent n good system, two of the goods\nbeing bonds and money, if any n\u20141 excess demand equations are satisfied; the nth must\nalso be satisfied, thus the nth may be dropped. Of course, it makes no difference what the\nnth equation is, no matter which of the equations is dropped the solution of the system\nremains unaltered. In particular one could drop either the equation for bonds or the\nequation for money, it would make no difference. The loanable funds theory drops the\nmoney equation, the liquidity preference theory drops the bond equation, but the two are\nequivalent.\n\nThis is quite a simple and clear-cut proof, provided that each of the goods in the system\nis represented by only one excess demand equation, but as we have just seen, in an explicit\n\n1! Such changes in the size of existent stocks constitute the flow side of the picture. A flow is defined\nas the rate of change of the size of stocks. Parenthetically this definition has one peculiar ramification.\nIf stocks are zero and remaining zero as in the case of service industries, flows must also be zero. Thus\nin the case of a pure flow good, where stocks are by definition zero, ner flows must be zero.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 05:35:39 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

The mathematical formulation of the present paper helps to clarify the issue.\nIt shows that the entire Ricardian model stands on the assumption of a uniform composition\nof capital all over the economy. The problem of introduction of machinery exactly\nhypothesizes a violation of this assumption. \"Therefore, the general conclusions cannot\nbe extended to this case. Looked at in these terms, the chapter ** on machinery \"* appears,\nrather than a contradiction, an honest acknowledgement by Ricardo of the limitations\nof his theory.\n\n10. CONCLUDING REMARKS\nA few remarks may be drawn as a way of conclusion.\n\nRicardo's model is built on very crude assumptions. The most crucial of them is\nthat all sectors of the economy use\u2014we might say in more modern terms\u2014the same period\nof production. This was just the point against which his contemporary critics (especially\nMalthus) threw their most violent attacks. In their function as critics, they were right.\nThe limits entailed by the assumption are relevant not only for the Ricardian theory of\nvalue\u2014as has always been thought\u2014but also for the determinateness itself of the whole\nsystem, as soon as the simple case of two-commodity production is depaited from.\n\nOn the other hand, once the assumptions underlying the whole analysis have been\nexplicitly defined, the system appears to be logically consistent and determinate in all its\nmacro-economic features and even in its sectoral details, except for some particular\nsectoral variables in which Ricardo was not interested. A mathematical formulation of\nthe model is possible, claiifies many issues\u2014among others, those connected with the\ncontroversial chapter ** on machinery \"\u2014and permits a representation of the Ricardian\ndynamic processes\u2014in particular the process of economic growth\u2014in a few rigorous and\nconcise notations. The solutions of the natural system Ricardo was dealing with are shown\nto exist and to be unique but not stable. They reach a perfect stability only in the equili-\nbrium of the stationary state.\n\nThe whole model, in its crudeness and simplicity, appears remarkably complete and\nsynthetic. Ricardo is always looking for fundamentals. Detailed relations are dealt\nwith only in the light of basic tendencies\u2014when they become too complicated and lead to\ndifficulties, those relations which are thought to be less important are frozen by crude\nassumptions. Whether this is a fruitful methodological line to pursue is open to contro-\nversy. Later, neo-classical economists preferred a radically different line of approach.\nThey abandoned too ambitious dynamic outlooks and instead started to analyse, in a\ncomplete way and in all its functional interrelationships, at least a more simplified (static)\nversion of economic reality. The step which was supposed to follow, however,\u2014that of\npassing to a dynamic analysis\u2014has not come out as easy and spontaneous as was expected,\nand, in recent years, it has not been infrequent for economists, faced with urgent problems\nof economic development, to have second thoughts on the subject. In this light, the\nRicardian analysis, with all the naivet\u00e9 and the limits of its particular theories, appears\nless primitive now-a-days than it appeared some decades ago.\n\nHarvard University and Cambridge University.

But he is not\nfree simply to ridicule the whole macro-proceeding by saying, in effect, why bunch every-\nthing into two categories, instead of 50 or 500? | Macro-economic models, for all their\nshortcomings, attempt to do something rather more subtle than just aggregating production\ninto two arbitrary categories, 4 and B, and incomes into two equally arbitrary categories\nX and Y\u2014the division in each case is justified by fundamental behavioural properties of\nthe capitalist system. Investment is picked out, because expenditures debited to a capital\naccount are independent of the current income flow in a way in which expenditures on\nincome account are not ; Profits are picked out, because any change in aggregate demand\nrelatively to aggregate supply affects residual incomes in a contrary direction to contractual\nincomes and also because in any reasonably stable system the proportion of profit saved is\nvery much greater than savings out of contractual incomes of a// kinds. Of course it\nwould be nonsense to suggest that it is the decision to produce Goose Livers on a certain\nscale which determines the incomes of Gourmets, instead of the other way round. But\nit is just as nonsensical to imply that the assumption that the division of output between\nInvestment and Consumption is independent of Profits and Wages is equally far-fetched.!\n\n8. Professor Tobin's second point is that the theory only works so long as there is\nno collusion between members of each of the two groups, in raising or lowering their\npropensities to consume so as to influence their share of the product ; and if there is\ncollusion on both sides, there will be all the horrors of bilateral monopoly. \"With all\nthis I heartily agree.

What we would like to know is how far he would\npursue the Induced-Investment criterion if it is not for the time being economically feasible\nand conflicts with existing comparative costs.\n\n(c) The third conflict arises from the fact that while Hirschman treats the growth\nof imports of new commodities as the prime mover of the industrialisation process of the\nunderdeveloped countries creating a ready-made demand for their new domestic industiies,\nhe skates very lightly over the snag that at present these imports will have to be financed\nmainly by the expansion of primary exports. Here again we would like to have a clearer\nstatement of how far Hirschman is willing either to expand or contract the production of\nthese primary exports to promote industrialisation, failing luck in having surplus capacity\nto produce an export commodity which happens to have a very elastic demand at the time\n(p. 172).\n\nIn fact Hirschman's whole treatment of the balance-of-payments problem of the\nunderdeveloped countries is unsatisfactory and eccentric. Other economists may worry\nabout the fluctuation in the prices of primary products, but to Hirschman the balance-\nof-payments problem of the underdeveloped countries is yet merely another of the excess\ndemand pressures which would stimulate their economic development provided they do\nnot aggravate their inflation by investing too much in social overhead capital. For instance,\nwhat is one to make out of his argument that the balance-of-payment difficulties of these\ncountries are not due to an excess of total demand over available resources but merely\ndue to a certain growth sequence which leads to expansion of those sectors whose output\nhas low *' exportability ''? (p. 169). On the subject of outside aid to ease the balance-of-\npayments difficulties of the underdeveloped countries, Hirschman again tries to sustain\nhis view that what they really need is not a ** supplement of real resources \" or general\ninvestible funds but merely specific additional imports and speaks favourably of the barter\nagreement negotiated by Russia with a number of underdeveloped countries (p. 172).\nThus he ends up by advocating tied aid or investment in its narrowest form ! He obviously\nhas no experience of the practical difficulties which the '' specificness\"\" of the imports\ncreates for the underdeveloped countries which have entered into such barter agreements.\n\nTo sum up : (i) Hirschman has successfully established the case for unbalanced growth :\nbut his argument has been vitiated because he has unnecessarily and excessively tied it\nup with a pure Demand Approach to economic development. (ii) He has also done real\nservice by stressing the psychological factors of economic backwardness in opposition to\nthe usual concern only with the physical supply of resources. But by his somewhat\noptimistic belief in the pressure of excess demand to overcome all physical shortages of\nresources, by his over-tender attitude towards inflation and balance-of-payments deficits\nand by his outright rationalisation of the underdeveloped countries\" fondness for prestige-\ncreating large scale industries and modern technology, Hirschman reminds us of the psy-\nchiatrist who claims to cure his patients by humouring them in their wilder fancies instead\nof telling them a few hard facts of life. In the end we are left with the doubt whether even\nsuch a persuasive exponent of this technique as Professor Hirschman can really talk himself\nout of the frequently dismal and negative task of the economist in the underdeveloped\ncountries of pointing out the need to husband scarce resources and to make painful choices.\n\nOxford and Rangoon.
