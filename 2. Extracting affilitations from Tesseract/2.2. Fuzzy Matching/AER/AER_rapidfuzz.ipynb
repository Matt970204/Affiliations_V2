First, Tarshis is to be thanked for his\\nreminder that \"normal cost\" pricing is quite\\ncompatible with profit maximization and\\nstandard micro theory. It is timely for\\nTarshis to remind Post-Keynesians of the\\nimportance of the M/4A ratio to the func-\\ntional distribution of income at the micro\\nlevel—that is, at the level of costs, markups,\\nand prices. (Recall that Sidney Weintraub\\nmade exactly the same point over twenty\\nyears ago when discussing Kaldor\\'s //Y\\ntheory of profit share.)\\n\\nSecondly, Post-Keynesians would take\\nissue with Tarshi! comments concerning\\nthe investment funds theory of the markup.\\nIn Keynesian and Post-Keynesian models,\\none must be very careful about assumptions\\nas to the state of long-term and short-term\\nexpectations and their interaction. As J. A.\\nKregel argues, Post-Keynesians, in the tradi-\\ntion of Keynes, use a \"stationary equi-\\nlibrium\" methodology, where long-period\\nexpectations are held constant at a given\\nlevel, but where short-period expectations\\nmay be disappointed and, most importantly,\\nwhere there is no feedback from the disap-\\npointment of short-period expectations on\\nthe state of long-period expectations.\\n\\nThe investment funds markup model can\\nbe seen as an application of this methodol-\\nogy. The state of long-term expectations\\ngoverns the perception of agents about the\\nevolution of *normal\" output, \"normal\"\\ncosts, and the desired stock of capital goods.\\nIt is under these conditions that the firm\\nmakes its decisions about the desired level\\nof retained profits and about the size of the\\nmarkup. None of this is inconsistent with\\nmaximizing expected long-period profits or\\nwith a fairly constant markup or, for that\\nmatter, with a variable gearing ratio\\n(although Tarshis comments concerning\\nsources and uses of funds is well-taken).\\n\\nIn addition, there is no implication that\\nthe decision about the desired level of cor-\\nporate saving has anything to do with cor-\\nporate investment decisions.

A careful application of\\nthe \"stationary equilibrium\" methodology\\nwould deny any implication that an act of\\nsaving would lead to an increase in invest-\\nment outlays. It is true, however, that Post-\\nKeynesians have been rather careless about\\nthis, and Tarshis\\' concern is well founded.\\n\\nMy third comment concerns two issues\\nraised by Tarshis towards the end of the\\npaper. The first is that Post-Keynesians\\nhave paid little attention to the macro-eco-\\nnomic implications of micro-adjustment\\nprocesses. This sin of omission is not re-\\nstricted to Post-Keynesians; however, Post-\\nKeynesians have been very concerned about\\nthe need to analyze processes of adjustment\\nthrough historical time, and it is incumbent\\nupon them to attempt this analysis. How-\\never, this raises severe problems with the\\nKregel/Keynes methodology discussed\\nabove. It is precisely the need to model the\\nfeedback from the disappointment of short-\\nperiod expectations on the state of long-\\nperiod expectations that is pushed aside by\\nthe adoption of the Kregel/Keynes\\nmethodology.\\n\\nThe problem is that Post-Keynesians have\\nno model of expectations formation. They\\nconstantly appeal to the inoperative concept\\nof \"animal spirits.\" This appeal to capri-\\ncious fate has led Coddington to dub\\nPost-Keynesian analysis \"Chapter 12\\nKeynesianism.\" The argument comes from\\nKeynes\\' early work on probability theory,\\nand says that situations involving decisions\\nabout the future are uncertain and cannot\\nbe reduced by applying the tools of proba-\\nbility to situations involving risk. Decisions\\nmust be made today about a logically un-\\nknowable future; however, these decisions\\nwil have long-lasting intertemporal con-\\nsequences.\\n\\nThis is a paradox of Post-Keynesian the-\\nory. It wishes to model economic processes\\nthat depend upon the formation of, and\\nadjustment to, the state of long-term ex-\\npectations, but there is no theory of expecta-\\ntions formation. In fact, it is virtually denied\\nthat there ever could be such a theory: refer-\\nence is continually made to chapter 12 of\\n', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'DISCUSSION\\n']\n",

As\\nSiegfreid and Sweeney note, a novel tech-\\nnology exists for dealing with this case, at\\nleast under normality assumptions.

She might ex-\\nplore how these developments altered the\\nterms of trade within the family. Fourth, the\\npaper suggests that women at present are\\nlocked into sex-typed jobs with work agree-\\nments that are obsolete with respect to their\\nown identity and changed family relation-\\nships. As an overall conclusion, I must take\\na more pessimistic outlook in expecting the\\nworkplace to conform to the needs of the\\ntwo-career family. The difficulties as-\\nsociated with such a family, given socie-\\ntys low premium on children, will neces-\\nsarily be internalized, hopefully with both\\npartners bearing the cost.\\n\\nThe major hypothesis of Daniel Quinlan's\\nand Jean Shackelford's paper is that female\\nemployment is a doubly derived demand.

I applaud his\\neffort because I believe that much more can\\nbe learned from studies of annual data, de-\\nspite the imprecision in earlier years, than\\nfrom additional studies of quarterly data for\\nthe recent past.\\n\\nDuring the period Gordon considers, the\\nUnited States shifted from gold to a paper\\nstandard, and from fixed to floating ex-\\nchange rates. The role of government in the\\neconomy expanded greatly. From studies of\\nthis experience, we can learn about the con-\\nsequences of these and other changes for\\ninflation, price, and output variability, and\\nthe formation of anticipations. Eventually,\\nwe will learn about the institutions that in-\\ncrease or reduce variability.\\n\\nGordon's principal findings are: 1) there\\nis a nearly constant response of the per-\\ncentage rate of price change to the per-\\ncentage rate of change of nominal GNP; 2)\\nthe size of the response is approximately\\none-third; 3) there is a slower response by\\nthe prices observed during postwar reces-\\nsions (mainly the result of changes in beliefs\\nabout persistent inflation and not, as com-\\nmonly alleged, the result of increased\\npowers of unions and monopolies or other\\nchanges in the relation between prices and\\noutput); 4) the standard Phillips curve is far\\nless reliable than a relation that links output\\nor spending to the price level so that the rate\\nof price change varies with the rate of\\ngrowth of output or spending, and not with\\nthe level of spending or output; and 5) the\\nlagged inflation rate is now a far more im-\\nportant predictor of current inflation than\\nbefore World War II.\\n\\nConclusions 3) and 4) are consistent with\\nand supportive of my own earlier work,\\nespecially the rejection of the standard Phil-\\nlips curve on the grounds that it is misspeci-\\nfied.

The\\ngreater importance of past average rates of\\nchange of money and prices does not mean\\nthat people now look farther back when\\nforming anticipations about the future rate\\nof inflation. The opposite is more likely to\\nbe true.\\n\\nTo see why, think of the current rate of\\nprice change p as consisting of two compo-\\nnents, p — 7t p. The anticipated rate of in-\\nflation 7 is the central value around which\\nprices are expected to change; p is the one-\\ntime rate of change of prices. (See Gordon\\'s\\nequation (3). Under the gold standard, v\\nchanged slowly, but p changed frequently.\\nConsequently, people looked back farther to\\nestimate z, but gave less weight to 7 when\\nforming anticipations about p. In the 1950\\'s\\nand 1960\\'s, v dominated p, so past average\\nmoney growth (or past rates of price\\nchange) received greater weight in the ex-\\npected rate of inflation. The oil shocks of\\nthe 1970\\'s shifted some of the weight from z\\nback to p.\\n\\nGordon\\'s conclusions 1) and 2) differ\\nfrom Phillip Cagan\\'s and my own earlier\\nresult. The difference in conclusion is re-\\nlated to the way in which Gordon models\\nthe pricing process. His model, like many\\nstandard Phillips curves, is based on an im-\\nplausible idea. Deviations of prices from\\nexpected price levels depend on the gap\\nbetween current output and some measure\\nof capacity. The problem does not depend\\non either the use of price levels instead of\\nrates of price change or on the use of output\\ninstead of employment. Expected price\\nlevels are not related to expected levels of\\noutput except in the special case in which\\nthe economy is near capacity. The use of\\ncapacity involves sizeable error in the de-\\npressions of the 1890\\'s and the 1930\\'s.\\n\\nGordon overcomes the problem by in-\\ntroducing lagged \"net\" price change as a\\nmeasure of anticipated inflation.

Their estimates of in-\\ndustry capital stocks and returns will be\\nuseful to researchers in several areas.\\n\\nWe were curious to see how the nominal\\nreturn estimates presented by Fraumeni-\\nJorgenson (hereafter F-J) would compare\\nwith the implicit estimates of investors who\\nparticipated in the stock market during the\\nsame period (1948-76). Our source was\\nStandard and Poor's (S- P) Market Analysts?\\nHandbook. We found there industries or sets\\nof industries coinciding with twenty-one of\\nthe SIC groupings used by F-J. (See our\\nTabulation, which is a comparison of S-P\\nand F-J estimates of nominal industry rates\\nof return for 1948-76. The * denotes\\n1957—76 data) For each S-P industry we\\ncalculated the average dividend yield and\\nthe average growth of the stock price index\\nover the period. The sum of these two num-\\nbers was taken as an approximation to the\\nactual nominal return experienced in the\\nmarket. (Note that a really careful analysis\\nwould take into account variations in di-\\nvidend yield over time, interindustry dif-\\nferences in debt-equity ratios, and the return\\nto intangible stocks corresponding to flows\\nlike advertising or research and develop-\\nment.) Where several S-P industries corre-\\nsponded to one SIC group, we aggregated\\nusing relative market values as weights.\\n\\nBasically, we found a good match be-\\ntween the S-P and F-J results. The rank\\ncorrelation is .57, rising to .79 when the\\nthree regulated utilities are left out. Without\\nthe utilities, this is higher than the correla-\\ntion of the S-P ranking and an ordering\\nbased on standard accounting rates of re-\\nturn (that correlation was .59). That is, F-J\\npredict the ordering of stock market returns\\nover industries better than does information\\non earnings and book values.

Mank, U.S. Bureau of Labor\\nStatistics: The problems Albert Rees men-\\ntions are certainly present in the productiv-\\nity measures, and the government agencies,\\nparticularly the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\\nhave been aware of them. While I would\\nagree that there probably is some downward\\nbias to the BLS measures of productivity, I\\ndo not believe it is very large, as may seem\\nto be indicated by Rees' observations.\\n\\nThe problem of inclusion of input\\nmeasures for output in the National Income\\nand Product Accounts has a very small im-\\npact on the BLS measure, which excludes\\ngeneral government, households, and in-\\nstitutions precisely for this reason. As Rees\\nmentions, only 5 percent of the measure of\\ntotal real output is probably affected by this\\nproblem.\\n\\nOn the price deflators, I would agree that\\nthe lag in the introduction of new and\\nchanging products like computers does lead\\nto an upward bias in the price measures and\\nhence a downward bias in the output\\nmeasure. However, on the general question\\nof quality change I am not sure that we\\nknow the overall direction of the quality\\nerror. Jack Triplett, in his survey of studies\\nmeasuring quality change in the price in-\\ndexes (in Analysis of Inflation, edited by\\nPaul H. Earl) observed that some studies\\nhave produced quality-adjusted price index-\\nes which rise more slowly than counterpart\\ncomponents in the CPI or WPI deflators,\\nwhile for others the indexes have risen more\\nthan the comparable BLS or BEA indexes.\\nAlso, the Rees panel report pointed out that\\nthe price indexes can contain an upward or\\ndownward bias because of the measurement\\nof quality change. As Triplett concludes, we\\nare a long way from being able to estimate\\nthe quality error in the indexes or even to\\nestimate the sign of the error in the overall\\nindexes.\\n\\nThe use of hours paid rather than worked\\nmost likely results in a downward bias, but\\nat present we only have a very crude esti-\\nmate of its magnitude and that is not very\\nlarge.

However. it is\\ninteresting to consider how these games\\nmight change if richer, and more realistic.\\nstrategies were available to the players.\\n\\nConsider government bureaucracy as a\\nplayer. The paper by Morris Fiorina and\\nRoger Noll treats bureaucracy as a largely\\npassive actor, evolving as a consequence of\\nthe election game played by congressional\\ncandidates. The only active role of the bu-\\nreaucracy in this paper is to apply distribu-\\ntional penalties to opposition congressmen.\\n\\nThe serious and popular literature on bu-\\nreaucracy suggests that it will be a more ac-\\ntive participant, and that its strategies will\\nbe determined by the interplay of bu-\\nreaucrats responding to the internal struc-\\nture and incentives of the organization.\\nMax Weber views the evolution of bureau-\\ncratic behavior as the result of individuals\\nwithin the organization seeking power and\\navoiding personal liability, by replacing dis-\\ncretionary judgements with impersonal\\nrules. Parkinson's laws suggests the\\nmechanisms by which individual incentives\\nare translated into the evolution of the bu-\\nreaucracy. Kafka paints a bleak picture of\\nthe outcome of this process, and incidently\\npoints out the usefulness of a good facilita-\\ntor.\\n\\nApplying this view of bureaucracy to the\\nworld of Fiorina and Noll, one sees that\\nwhile the form of bureaucracy is molded by\\nlegislation, the bureaucracy may itself be-\\ncome an active lobbyist for legislation af-\\nfecting its future.

Bu-\\nreaucracies have a strong incentive to nof\\nyield distributional power to Congress, but\\nrather to retain this power in order to\\ndevelop their own constituencies and sup-\\nporting lobbys, and to avoid exposure of in-\\ndividual bureaucrats to pressure which\\ncould create personal liability. In this view,\\nexcessive bureaucratization is in large\\nmeasure a consequence of the internal in-\\ncentives to individuals in the organization.\\nThe evolution of complex rules requiring\\nfacilitators occurs for Weberian and Parkin-\\nsonian reasons. As a player. the bu-\\nreaucracy may actively attempt to maintain\\nits own constituency, and to minimize the\\nrole of facilitators, and may be an active\\nand effective lobbyist for its own growth.\\n\\nIf bureaucracy is an active player, then\\nthe games considered by Joel Guttman and\\nby William Brock and Stephen Magee also\\nchange. In the Guttman world, the bu-\\nreaucracy may actively seek an enforce-\\nment role for collective action, providing\\nboth a mechanism and a lobby for coercive\\nsolutions to problems of providing public\\ngoods. The preferences of government for\\nquotas over tariffs, for environmental regu-\\nlations over pollution prices, may be due\\nmore to the self-interest of bureaucrats than\\nto the difficulty of understanding the\\ntheoretical advantages of decentralization.\\nThe Brock-Magee model also changes\\nwhen bureaucracy becomes an active par-\\nticipant. In addition to buying a favorable\\npolicy position, campaign contributions\\nnow play a second role—the purchase of\\nfacilitation services, including favorable\\nlanguage in legislation establishing bu-\\nreaucracies to enforce collective action. In\\nthis world, the lobbying strategies\\nconsidered by Brock and Magee will be su-\\nperimposed on \"facilitation insurance\"\\npurchased from all viable candidates.\\n\\nI have discussed government bu-\\nreaucracy as one of the players in the\\ncollective action game whose role is more\\nactive, and more important, than the\\nmodels treated in these papers suggest.

How could these\\ncontrols have been so ineffective as to\\nallow  refiners to capture rents that\\namounted to $6 or more per barrel?

Niehans is concerned\\nwith three related issues—first, the collapse\\nof the Bretton Woods (BW) System;\\nsecond, the short-run management of the cur-\\nrent payments system; and third, the long-run\\nreform of the international payments system.\\nLet me take each of these in turn.\\n\\nNiehans maintains that the BW System\\ncollapsed because of the lasting expansionary\\ncourse of American monetary policy which\\nbegan in 1961. I find this argument either\\none-sided in its historical perspective or restric-\\ntive in its interpretation of BW. In the first\\nplace, the United States was, for a long time,\\nblamed for the so-called dollar shortage. Then\\nin the 1960\\'s, it was accused of creating a\\ndollar glut. So initially the complaint was one\\nof too strong an American balance of payments\\nposition and later it turned to one of too large\\na deficit. It is clear that if the Europeans\\nwere not accumulating enough dollars, they\\ncould have devalued with respect to gold and\\nif they were getting too many dollars, they\\ncould have revalued. I would, however, agree\\nthat the same result could have been achieved\\nif the United States had changed the parity\\nof the dollar to gold; but it chose not to, I\\nthink, for good reasons. But, in any case, the\\nrest of the world had a very powerful and\\ndirect mechanism for correcting any complaint.\\nNiehans could, however, argue that continuous\\nchanges in parity was against the \"spirit\" of\\nBW. 1 would find such a position as subjective.\\n\\nIn regard to the desired management of\\nthe current system, I have two related con-\\ncerns. First, I think that there should be\\navailable a constant purchasing power (in\\nterms of internationally traded goods) and\\ninterest bearing Special Drawing Rights\\n(SDR). My reason for this is that the oil\\nexporting nations are currently wasting a great\\ndeal of resources in haphazard development\\nplans largely because they feel that they have\\nto spend their oil receipts immediately. Tf, on\\nthe other hand, such an SDR was available\\n', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'to them, they would be more willing to acquire\\nsuch an asset in lieu of wasteful development\\nand be possibly motivated to expand output\\nand reduce oil prices. Second, the major\\nbalance of payments deficit now resides with\\nnonoil exporting developing nations. But no\\nexchange system can alleviate their deficit\\nposition. However, the International Monetary\\nFund (7MF) could, by acquiring OPEC bal-\\nances through the creation of this new SDR,\\nmake large loans to finance development of\\nsuch nations. Thus a larger Organization of\\nPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) sur-\\nplus could be indirectly used to finance\\ndevelopment of the largest segment of the\\nworld population.\\n\\nIn the long run, I agree with Niehans that\\nwe should be able to do much better. Any\\nviable long-run system must incorporate some\\nflexibility in allowing for relative autonomy\\nin domestic policy and further not be dis-\\nruptive in causing unnecessary short-run shifts\\nin resources which are not dictated by long-\\nrun scarcities.\\n\\nAny system of fixed exchange rates will be\\nlimiting, as Niehans has pointed out, in flexi-\\nbility of differing domestic goals. No nation is,\\nI believe, willing to again abdicate control of\\nits domestic monetary tools as required under\\na system where exchange rates do not change,\\nor at least, do not change frequently.\\n\\nA system of floating rates, though desirable\\non many grounds, has two major drawbacks.\\nFirst, large fluctuations in rates can cause\\ntransfers of real resources which may not be\\ndesirable from the long-run perspective.\\nSecond, and probably much more controver-\\nsial, floating rates may enhance world wide\\ninflation. I have come to this tentative con-\\nclusion from some casual empirical and\\ntheoretical considerations.\\n\\nEconomists have, since the writings of\\nKeynes, agreed with the proposition that\\nprices, although flexible upwards, tend to be\\nsticky downward.

The paper by Dennis\\nMueller and the one by James Buchanan and\\nWinston Bush can be viewed as bearing in\\nimportant, though different, ways on the\\narguments Rawls puts forth in making his\\ncomparison.\\n\\nRawls\\'s first argument is based upon the\\n\"very considerable normal risk aversion\"\\nindividuals will display in the original posi-\\ntion.

First, the same group may\\nnot be least favored under each possible ar-\\nrangement so that under maximin one has\\nthe considerable task of determining the least\\nfavored group under all alternative arrange-\\nments.

Third, the method\\nof estimating the overall balance of gains\\nand losses in the average utility setting is\\nreadily at hand since it has been agreed that\\nthe goal is maximization of the average of\\nthe utilities.

Marshall was concerned with the con-\\nnections between what we might now call\\nthe quality of life, family size, and wage\\nlevels. But during the twentieth century\\neconomists gave little attention to popula-\\ntion change, except for the discussion during\\nthe Great Depression of the effects of slow or\\nnegative population growth upon the main-\\ntenance of full employment.\\n\\nEven though the recent efforts have im-\\nportant antecedents, the careful develop-\\nment of analytical frameworks and the care-\\nful confrontation of the frameworks with the\\navailable data represent an important break-\\nthrough. The work described in the paper is\\nnot only important as evidence of the sturdi-\\nness of economic analysis, but also because\\nour understanding of important problems is\\nbeing improved.

On\\nbalance, however, the papers result in a net\\nimprovement in our deficit in the balance of\\nquestions and answers, not only because of\\nthe new insights but also because asking bet-\\nter questions will finally help to get better\\nanswers.\\n\\nThe paper by Dwight H. Perkins provides\\na brief history of the phases of Chinese plan-\\nning and plan implementation.\\n\\nIt is enlightening to learn from Perkins\\npaper about the problems which the People\\'s\\nRepublic of China has had in formulating\\nand implementing consistent plans for de-\\nvelopment. There is in some quarters a ten-\\ndency to believe that such problems are spe-\\nciüic to the market-oriented economies of\\nmost of the less developed areas of the world.\\nIt is, therefore, useful to learn about the suc-\\ncessive extensive reorientations in planning\\nand plan implementation which have oc-\\ncurred in China.\\n\\nPerkins also raises but does not resolve\\nsome of the central issues of planning and\\nplan implementation in China.

With imports equal\\nto about 2 percent of GN P, China had to\\nfollow a balanced growth strategy and a fail-\\nure to do so quickly manifested itself.\"\\n\\nPerkins is telling his story under space con-\\nstraints which limit the amount of qualifica-\\ntion which he can make. So perhaps these\\ncomments may make a contribution by\\npointing out some of the qualifications to his\\nexplanation which are necessary. First of all,\\nthe absence of \"large numbers of important\\nbottlenecks or numerous white elephants\"\\nis, at most, a test of the consistency of the\\nplan.

Economic\\nplans should do as well as possible in terms\\nof some fundamental criteria, such as per\\ncapita income or overall growth. There are\\ninfinite number of feasible and consistent\\nplans for an economy, but presumably these\\nare not all equally desirable. The information\\nwhich Perkins gives us, which is, presumably,\\nall that is available, does not permit us to\\njudge the degree to which the People\\'s\\nRepublic of China has been successful in\\nachieving its own fundamental economic\\ngoals.\\n\\nFinally the virtual self-sufficiency of the\\nChinese economy to which Perkins ascribes\\npart of the reason for its success in planning\\nwould normally, and more correctly, I be-\\nlieve, be considered a handicap rather than\\nan asset.

How important is this\\ncorrelation as compared with the relation-\\nship between earnings and other economic\\nvariables? In a previous paper Bowles has\\nshown that 13 percent of the variance in\\nearnings can be explained by father's occu-\\npational status, parents' income, and num-\\nbers of siblings. This implies a correlation of\\n.36 between income and a composite of\\nfamily background variables. By contrast,\\nhuman capital models can explain about 52\\npercent of the variance in log of incomes,\\nwhich implies a correlation of .72 between\\nlog of income and a composite of human\\ncapital variables such as education, experi-\\nence, and weeks worked. Thus, although\\nsocial economic background does have an\\nimpact on earnings it is not as important\\nquantitatively as that of other subsets of\\neconomic variables. Yet the question re-\\nmains—why do background variables affect\\nearnings? It is this question Bowles addresses\\nhimself to.\\n\\nFirst, Bowles outlines three contrasting\\nviews of the causes of this correlation (called\\nby him the inequality of income-earning op-\\nportunity): first, that inequality in income-\\nearning opportunity results from inequality\\nin schooling; second, that it results from\\ndifferences in ability; and third, that it re-\\nsults from conditioning in the family.\\n\\nThe correlation between background vari-\\nables and income is then allocated among\\nthese factors. Using data adjusted to correct\\nfor a suspected downward bias in the coeffi-\\ncients of background variables, Bowles finds\\nonly 20 percent of the correlation between\\nfamily background and income is due to\\nschooling, 9 percent is due to childhood 7Q\\nand 11 percent due to genotypic 7Q. The find-\\ning that the contribution of ability is small is\\nconsistent with a number of studies which\\nfind that ability measures contribute little to\\nexplaining earnings, once schooling is in-\\ncluded in the earnings function.\\n\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The finding that schooling accounts for\\nonly 20 percent of the correlation between\\nearnings and background can be cited not as\\nevidence of immobility, as Bowles claims,\\nbut as evidence that opportunity to receive\\nschooling which affects earnings is not rigidly\\ntied to parents! characteristics. Since school-\\ning accounts for only a small part of the cor-\\nrelation between income and background,\\nthis suggests that the major part of school-\\ning\\'s impact on income is independent of\\nbackground variables.\\n\\nThe indirect effects of ability and educa-\\ntion account for 40 percent of the correlation\\nbetween income and background variables;\\nthe remaining 60 percent is attributable to\\nthe direct effect of family background vari-\\nables. Thus of the 13 percent of the variance\\nin earnings attributable to the background\\nvariables alone, 8 percent is attributable to\\nthe direct effect of background.

In addition,\\nLekachman asserts that economists simply\\ndo not tackle problems of power or social\\nissues very frequently.\\n\\nI believe Lekachman is mainly right—\\nalthough economists of my generation have\\nfar less faith in markets than he ascribes\\nto the profession as a whole. But the lack of\\ninterest in unions among economists has\\nsome additional roots. These can be divided\\ninto two groups—those involving noneco-\\nnomic or intellectual issues and those in-\\nvolving economics.\\n\\nLet us take the noneconomic issues first.\\nMost economists, like most Americans, have\\nvery little understanding of trade union\\ngoals, operations or history. In large part,\\nthis is the fault of American high schools\\nwhich present little or no information on\\ntrade unions. The study of unions is slowly\\nmaking its way into the curriculum, but,\\nunfortunately, the present generation of\\neconomists is unaffected. Of course, econo-\\nmists could learn about unions in their col-\\nlege and graduate school years, but thev\\ngenerally become interested in other matters.\\nThere is a feeling among young economists\\nthat unions are not * where it\\'s at.\" Econo-\\nmists, or at least some of them, do prefer to\\ndeal with social issues—but not union\\nissues.

These are the social issues\\nwhich have turned on\" economists—\\nalthough, as Brimmer, Harper, and Lekach-\\nman all point out, the majority of economic\\nresearch is not on these tvpes of problems.\\n\\nMost liberal economists do not believe\\nthat unions share their interest in alleviating\\nracial discrimination and poverty. The fact\\nthat certain trade unions discriminate or\\nhave discriminated against blacks has been\\nblown way out of proportion. Many Ameri-\\ncans, economists included, are unaware that\\nthe percentage of blacks in trade unions is\\ngreater than the percentage of blacks in the\\npopulation—15 percent vs. 11 percent—or\\nthat one out of every three new union mem-\\nbers is black, or that, according to the\\ndirector of the Washington bureau .VAACP,\\n\"None of the legislative fights we have\\nmade in the field of civil rights could have\\nbeen won without the trade union move-\\nment\" (Bayard Rustin, pp. 76 and 80).\\nNor do many seem aware of the long-stand-\\ning American labor movement tradition of\\nautonomy for national unions.\\n\\nThere is also a good deal of misunder-\\nstanding, as Lekachman points out, on the\\nmatters of so-called blue-collar conservatism\\nand wealth.

Somewhat para-\\ndoxically, the gist of my critique is that they\\nclaim both too little and too much for their\\nanalysis.\\n\\nThere are advantages in reframing their\\nproof in simple opportunity-set terms. In\\nswitching from the matching to the lump-sum\\nform, each voter in effect exchanges the trian-\\ngular set of opportunities FJC in their Figure\\n5 for the set FAH. But the pivotal median\\nvoter and all inframedian voters are known to\\nhave rejected, under the matching grant, all\\nother opportunities in favor of some point in\\nFAH, namely one on line segment AF.\\n\\nThus, we can deduce that under the block\\ngrant, when the only loss is the \"irrelevant\"\\nset FJC, all voters in a controlling coalition\\nmust again choose some point in FAZ. In the\\nhighly improbable limiting case, the results of\\nthe matching and block grants would be iden-\\ntical; in all other cases, the matching grant\\nwould be more stimulative because the median\\nvoter finds some point in FAH preferable to\\nthe matching grant equilibrium F.

Consider first the determi-\\nnants of rapid export growth. Government\\npolicies in all the superexporters were clearly\\nset within the context of a commitment to\\ngrowth through exporting. Several policy in-\\nstruments were geared to those targets: the\\nreal exchange rate received by exporters, the\\nimport regime as it affected reexports, and\\nthe infrastructure (ports, domestic transport,\\ncommunications with the outside world by\\nphone and mail) necessary for exporting all\\nwere determined by the needs of the export\\ndrive. (See Kwang Suk Kim, 1987, and\\nRichard Snape, 1988, for documentation.)\\n\\nIn every country with a successful devel-\\nopment-through-exporting strategy, export-\\ners were exempted from whatever restric-\\ntions prevailed in the import regime. This\\nwas not only necessary for success in ex-\\nporting, but it restricted the extent to\\nwhich officials could monitor and regulate\\nimports. Further, the government's commit-\\nment to exporting was an implied assurance\\nof the profitability for successful exporting\\nfirms. While some of the NICS initially pro-\\nvided export subsidies, subsidized credit, and\\nother special privileges for exporters, all of\\nthese became costly as the export drive suc-\\nceeded, and there was therefore perpetual\\npressure on government officials to increased\\nreliance on the exchange rates and uniform-\\nity of incentives. In Korea, for example, Kim\\n(Table 2.10) estimates that the effective ex-\\nchange rate for exports was within 6 percent\\nof that for imports for every year after 1965;\\nthe variation of incentives between import-\\ncompeting and exportable commodities was\\nfar smaller than in the typical import-sub-\\nstitution regime.\\n\\nIt is certainly not correct to state that the\\ngovernments in the export-strategy countries\\n\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The Asian experience with trade and\\ngrowth has been highly varied.

Hong\\nKong, Singapore, and Taiwan were also\\nrapidly growing economies whose growth of\\nexports outpaced that of income.

In\\n1967, America was just completing two de-\\ncades of unparalleled economic expansion;\\nthe ratio of imports to GNP suggested that\\nthe United States was equally as insulated\\nfrom the rest of the world\\'s economies as it\\nhad been in 1929; and corporate profits were\\nnear their post- World War II peak. In this\\nshort-lived niche in time, American corpora-\\ntions appeared to be in charge of their own\\ndestinies—to be in control of their markets\\nrather than to be controlled by them.\\n\\nIn the following decade, of course, Amer-\\nica\\'s preeminence in the world was severely\\nchallenged. Imports as a proportion of GNP\\nnearly doubled and profits began a long-term\\nslide that would not end until the beginning\\nof the 1980\\'s. In rhis environment, the cor-\\nporation did lose much of the control it once\\nexercised. The important point, however, is\\nthat the chief function of the * technostruc-\\nture\" that runs the firm has by no means\\nbecome obsolete. Along the lines of the\\ncentral theme in TNIS, corporate managers\\nset out to develop new strategies that could\\neffectively supersede, circumvent, or control\\nthe market. From the vantage point of 1967,\\nGalbraith would have had to possess ex-\\ntraordinary powers of premonition to pre-\\ndict exactly how managers would eventually\\ncope with the changed environment. But\\nwhat Galbraith did establish back then—and\\ncontinues to teach us today— is that in the\\nface of inevitable change, the technostruc-\\nture will not sit idly by, subject to rigid\\nLagrangian constraints, but instead will use\\nall of its power to develop fresh strategies to\\ncope with new exigencies.\\n\\nTNIS was an early inquiry into what\\nmakes corporate managers tick.

To make this\\nenormous set of issues manageable, critics\\noften reduce the debate over TNIS to the\\nmore limited question: do corporations profit\\nmaximize? Yet, even here, where the tradi-\\ntional economist presumably has the home\\ncourt advantage, Galbraith\\'s insight survives.\\n\\nIn the environment of record profits dur-\\ning the 1960\\'s, it is altogether reasonable\\nthat corporate management could and did\\nallow other goals beside maximum profit to\\ncreep into their calculus— maximizing share\\nof market, paying bonuses to itself or to its\\nworkforce, or even engaging in hedonisti-\\ncally motivated philanthropic activity (i.e.,\\ndonating other people\\'s money!) But as rates\\nof return on capital slipped from nearly 10\\npercent in 1965 to an average of less than 6\\npercent during the entire decade of the\\n1970\\'s, managers were forced to switch\\nstrategy. From long-term profit *satisficing\"\\nduring a period of extraordinary rates of\\nreturn, firms had to shift gears to con-\\ncentrate almost singlemindedly on short-term\\nprofit maximization.\\n\\nWhile Galbraith admittedly failed to fore-\\nsee the enormous impact of \"the invasive\\nthrust...of Japan and the other Pacific coun-\\ntries\" on profits or the degree to which cor-\\nporate raiding would force the existing tech-\\nnostructures to concentrate on the bottom\\nline, the overall point still stands: when cor-\\nporations are flush they can afford to pursue\\nother goals beside pure profit maximization\\nand they do; when profits are threatened,\\nthey subjugate all other desires and motives\\nto simple short-term greed. In fact, by the\\nend of the 1970\\'s, the shift in strategy from\\nprofit satisficing to profit maximizing was\\nsufficiently widespread to account for some\\nof the stagflation that arose.

They claim that all\\nworkers would benefit from a comparable\\nworth policy, except those employed in oc-\\ncupations that are exclusively male. Conse-\\nquently, Johnson-Solon overestimate the\\neffect of comparable worth on male earnings,\\nand underestimate its effect on the earnings\\ngap between women and men.\\n\\nSecond, Johnson-Solon and comparable\\nworth studies use different dependent vari-\\nables. The dependent variable in comparable\\nworth studies is the occupational salary, de-\\nfined as one of the salary levels that an\\nindividual could receive if employed in this\\noccupation. On the other hand, Johnson-\\nSolon use individual salaries of men and\\nwomen as their dependent variable. But, in-\\ndividual female earnings and the occupa-\\ntional earnings of women are different.\\n\\nFemale earnings are affected by two in-\\nequalities, unequal pay within an occupation\\nand unequal pay for comparable worth. Un-\\nequal pay within an occupation is negatively\\ncorrelated with the proportion of women in\\nan occupation. In other words, women in\\nmale-dominated occupations face greater\\nearnings disparities within their occupation\\nthan women in female-dominated occupa-\\ntions.

BAnRO, University of Chicago:\\nThomas Sargent's paper covers two issues\\nthat are interesting, but I think largely inde-\\npendent. The first is the Lucas critique of\\npolicy evaluation, which involves the idea\\nthat shifts in the form of the government's\\nbehavior imply shifts in the form of the\\nprivate sector's behavior. The second issue\\nconcerns positive vs. normative theories of\\ngovernmental actions—an issue that has im-\\nplications for the role of the economist as an\\nadviser for policy.\\n\\nThe Lucas critique applies, for example, to\\nchanges in governmental behavior that re-\\nflect exogenous events, such as war, natural\\ndisasters, and perhaps elections. These devel-\\nopments likely imply shifts in the (condi-\\ntional) probability distribution for future\\ngovernment policies, which imply shifts in\\nthe rational expectations of these policies,\\nwhich lead to effects on the behavior of the\\nprivate sector. The same conclusion obtains\\nfor shifts in governmental behavior that stem\\nfrom unobservable causes— or even, unlikely\\nas it seems, from a response of the govern-\\nment's actions to policy advice from econ-\\nomists. (One can think of policy advice as a\\nvariable that perhaps influences the actions\\ntaken by the public sector.) In each case the\\ncrucial matter is the change in the probabil-\\nity distribution for future governmental be-\\nhavior, combined with the idea that people\\nunderstand this change. In particular, the\\nLucas critique applies whether or not there is\\na role for policy advice. However, if neither\\nadvice nor anything else ever shifts the prob-\\nability distribution for governmental behav-\\nior, then the Lucas critique is not so interest-\\ning. Also, it seems inconsistent to argue—as\\nChristopher Sims apparently has— that first,\\nthe probability distribution for future gov-\\nernment behavior does not shift much over\\nshort periods, but second, it is conceivable\\nthat policy advice could be offered that would\\nlead to a sudden and substantial shift in\\nactual governmental behavior.\\n\\nSargent also discusses positive vs. norma-\\ntive theories of government, which is an in-\\nteresting old issue.

I\\nwould have expected references to the sub-\\nstantial work on public choice, including\\nwritings by James Buchanan and Gordon\\nTullock, George Stigler, and Earl Thompson,\\namong others.\\n\\nIt is useful to carry out positive analyses\\nof governmental behavior, possibly viewing\\nthe people in the government as attempting\\nto maximize something.

There were lots of deep thoughts, but a lack of\\nquantitative results. Even in simple cases where it can be\\nsaid that some economic magnitude is influenced by only\\none causal factor, the question of how strong is the influence\\nstill remains. It is usually not of very great practical or even\\nscientific interest to know whether the influence is positive or\\nnegative, if one does not know anything about the strength.\\nBut much worse is the situation when an economic magni-\\ntude to be studied is determined by many different factors at\\nthe same time, some factors working in one direction, others\\nin the opposite directions. One could write long papers\\nabout so-called tendencies explaining how this factor might\\nwork, how that factor might work and so on. But what is the\\nanswer to the question of the total net effect of all the\\nfactors? This question cannot be answered without mea-\\nsures of the strength with which the various factors work in\\ntheir directions.

DIFFICULTIES\\n\\nThere were many scholars, first of all Ragnar Frisch, who\\nbegan to see dangerous pitfalls in the attempts to draw\\ninformation about economic interrelationships from ob-\\nserved data. The most formidable among these difficulties\\nwere connected with the old-time enemy of statisticians; the\\nphenomenon of so-called spurious correlation. This expres-\\nsion refers to the danger of drawing hasty conclusions about\\ncause and effect from observed connections between two\\nor more economic variables. Ragnar Frish used to imprint\\nhis warnings on this point upon his students by giving the\\nfollowing horrifying illustration. It can be observed that there\\nis a high positive intercorrelation between the number of flies\\non the western coast of Norway and the number of tourists\\nvisiting that region. From this observation it is probably not\\na very good idea to try to promote tourism by breeding more\\nflles. But the phenomenon of spurious correlation has a\\nmore intricate form which is often much harder to discover.\\nIf we have what we think is a good and reasonably well-\\nfounded theory of some interrelation within a group of\\neconomic variables, and the observed facts do not seem to\\ncontradict such a theory, we may still be misled, because\\nthe same apparent interrelation may often be produced by\\nmany different models of economic structures.\\n\\nOn this basis Ragnar Frisch was also to some extent\\ncritical of Jan Tinbergens extensive numerical work.

In the first half of the twentieth century, a few mathematicians began to formu-\\nlate models for analyzing rational competitive decisions in more general frameworks, laying the\\nfoundations for game theory (Emile Borel 1921, John von Neumann 1928, von Neumann and\\nOskar Morgenstern 1944, John F. Nash, Jr., 1951; see also Myerson 1999).\\n\\nWithin economics itself, a substantive need for analytical models that go beyond the limits of\\nprice theory gradually became evident. In particular, the inconclusiveness of economic theorists'\\ndebates about socialism versus capitalism showed the limitations of price theory for evaluating\\nnon-price institutions like the socialist command economy (Enrico Barone 1935, Oskar Lange\\n1938, Ludwig von Mises 1935, Friedrich A. Hayek 1935). Price theory could show (under some\\nconditions) that free markets will achieve allocative efficiency, but such results about free mar-\\nkets did not prove that socialist command economies could not achieve similarly good outcomes.\\nTo allow analytical comparison of fundamentally different forms of economic organization, a\\nnew and more general theoretical framework was needed. In an widely influential paper, Hayek\\n(1945) argued that a key to this new economic theory should be the recognition that economic\\ninstitutions of all kinds must serve an essential function of communicating widely dispersed\\ninformation about the desires and the resources of different individuals in society.

Of Course, Calabresi Alsopresumed Zero Transactions Costs. In Addition, Calabresi Reiterated The Coase Conclusion That Liability Rules Do Not Influence Theefficient Allocation Of Resources In Either Theshort Or Long Run.!A Major Logical Problem With The Coaseproposition Is In Introducing A Perturbationinto An Otherwise Perfect System And Thenasserting That Regardless Of Legal Rules, Thesystem Will Regain Its Perfection.

      "Procedures For The Design And Operation Ofpublic Undertakings Have Traditionally Separated The Evaluation Of Project Benefits Andthe Pricing Of Project Outputs. Benefitcostcalculations Have Been Based Upon Standardeffhciency Criteria Without Regard To Thepricing Policy Utilized During The Operatingphase. An Undertaking, Whose Scale Has Beenappropriately Determined By Equating Incremental Benefits And Costs, Is Deemed Worthyof Investment If Its Total Benefits Exceedcosts. However, If The Pricing Policy Thatgoverns The Sale Of Output Is Not Explicitlytaken Into Account In The Benefitcost Analysis, Serious Errors In The Estimation Of Benefitsand, Hence, The Scaling Of Facilities Will Beencountered.In Practice, No Widespread Recognition Ofthe Effects Of Ultimate Public Project Pricingpolicies On Prior Benefit Calculations Is Evident (See Hanke). For Example, The Waterresources Council Has Recently Provided Newrules For Benefitcost Analysis That Are Farmore Comprehensive Than Any Previous Federal Effort, But The New Standards Do Notmention Pricing Policies Or How They Mightalter The Performance Of Public Undertakings.In The Academic Literature, Very Few Havenoted The Dilemma Created By Not Explicitlytaking Into Consideration Pricing Policieswhen Conducting Benefitcost Analvses. Johnkrutilla Is One Of The Few Economists To Explicitly Recognize The General Implications Ofseparating Evaluation And Pricing Procedures.* Assistant Professor, Virginia Polytechnic Instituteand State University, And Associate Professor, Thejohns Hopkins University And University Of California,Berkeley, \n",

Simon Rottenberg, Roger Noll,Mohamed El Hodiri And James Quirk 1971,1974, Henry Demmert, And Gerald Scully).A Central Policy Issue Which Has Receivedconsiderable Attention In The Theoreticalliterature Is The Allocational Effects That Result From Monopsony Practices Such As Baseballs \"Reserve Clause.\" This Effectivelytransfers Ownership Rights From The Playerto The Team Owner. Professional Baseballexecutives, As Well As Fans And The Press, Haveargued That The Elimination Of Such Monopsony Restrictions And The Antitrust Exemptiongranted Professional Baseball Would Lead Todomination In Player Strengths By The Largecity Teams And Ruination Of The Sport. However, The Analytical Position In The Economicsliterature Is Clear On This Subject: As Long Asproperty Rights Are Well Defined And Recontracting Through Sales Of Players! Contractsis Permissible And Costless, A Labor Marketwith Monopsonistic Restrictions Leads To Thesame Allocation Of Players And Relative Teamstrengths As Does A Competitive Labor Market; Only The Distribution Of Wealth Betweenplayers And Owners Is Affected.Nevertheless, The Allocational Aspects Ofthe Analytical Proposition Have Been Metwith A Great Deal Of Skepticism In Both Theacademic And The Popular Press.!

Only With Such Amodel Can One Answer The Relevant Counterfactual Question: What Would Have Beenthe State Of The Economy In The Absence Offiscal Or Monetary Policy.While The Method We Propose Is Quitegeneral, Our Application Of It Is Specific.We Use The Mitpennssrc (Mps)Model Of The U.S. Economy To Generatequarterly Timeseries Of The Influence Offiscal And Monetary Policy On Real Gnpfrom 1958 To 1973. Our Objectives Are Twofold. First, The Series Developed Here Maybe Useful To Other Students Of Americanstabilization Policy. Second, We Hope Thatother Economists Will Be Induced To Use Thesame Techniques To Generate Analogousmeasures Based On Alternative Models.Section I Enumerates Several Uses Formeasures Of The Impacts Of Fiscal Andmonetary Policies, And Briefly Indicateswhy Existing Indicators Are Inadequate Forthese Purposes.

      "During The 1960'S It Was Generally Believedthat Policies Of Providing Additional Education Would Go A Long Way Toward Equalizingthe Large Income Differentials Between Blacksand Whites. But In Light Of Recent Studies Onthe Subject, Serious Doubt Has Been Cast Onthe Sanguine View Toward Education'S Abilityto Accomplish Income Equality (See Giorahanoch, Randall Weiss, And Lester Thurow).While Most Research Has Centered On Returnsto Years Of Education, Christopher Jencks Hasgone Even Further To Argue That The Qualityof Education Has A Negligible Part To Play Inthe Process. Recently, However, The Studiesby Leonard Weiss And Jeffrey Williamson,Link And Ratledge, And Finis Welch Haveylelded More Optimistic Findings Regardingthe Role Of Educational Quality On Blackwhite Earnings Differences.!The Present Note Deals Specifically With Therecent Article By Welch. He Presents Evidence Suggesting That Blacks For The Pastseveral Years Have Finally Begun To Receivemonetary Benefits From Education Commensurate With Those Of Whites. Most Importantly, He Argues That This Change Is Dueto An Increase In The Quality Of Black Education. Welch Observes In His Earnings Equations A Decline In The Coefficient Of The Yearsof Schooling Variable (D) For Older Cohorts Ofblacks And Whites In His Samples.

Although It Is Not Possible Toestimate The Value Of This Rate (Which Willhereafter Be Referred To As U,) With Anyprecision, Its Consensus Estimate In 1978Terms Is About 6 Percent, Plus Or Minusonehalf Of 1 Percent.

Implicit In This Bill (The Socalled Humphreyhawkins Proposal) Is Thenecessity Of Expanding Labor Market Programs In Order To Achieve Its Principal Objective. The Major Component Of Such Programsin The United States Has Been The Directprovision Of Job Opportunities To Specificgroups In The Labor Force.'

      "Many Would Agree With Samuel Johnsonthat *A Decent Provision For The Poor Is Atrue Test Of Civilization.\" Yet Still There Ismuch Debate About What Form Poverty Reliefshould Take. Particularly Controversial Is Theclaim That Recipients Of Relief Should Berequired To Work In Exchange For Benefits.The Use Of Work Requirements In Povertyalleviation Programs Is Of Widespread Significance. Perhaps The Most Notorioushistorical Example Is The English System,Instituted By The Poor Law Of 1834, In Whichpoor Relief Was Granted Through Residencein A Workhouse. Workfare Was Also Commonin Ancien Régime France, Where Relief Wasgranted In \"Charity Workshops.\" But Workfare Schemes Are By No Means Just Relicsfrom The Past. They Remain Popular In Bothdeveloped And Less Developed Countries Today. In The United States, For Example, Anumber Of States Now Demand That Welfareclaimants Enroll In Either A Training Or Workprogram In Order To Receive Benefits.! Similarly, Current Practice In India Relies Heavilyon Publicworks Projects As A Tool For Providing Poor Relief.?* Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University,Princeton, Nj 08544, And Department Of Economics,University Of Pennsylvania, 3718 Locust Walk,Philadelphia, Pa 19104, \n",

      "To Participate In 401(K) Plans, And More Than 36Million Workers Made Contributions To Theseemployerprovided Saving Plans. In 1995, The Lastyear For Which The U.S. Department Of Laborhas Released Definitive Data, 401(K) Contributions Amounted To $87.4 Billion, Or 55 Percent Ofall Contributions To Employersponsored Pensionplans. The Level Of Contributions, And Their Shareof All Pension Contributions, Is Probably Significantly Higher Today.The Spread Of 401(K) Plans Is The Mostimportant Indicator Of The Move To Personalretirement Saving. In 1980, Almost 92 Percentof Pensionplan Contributions Were To Traditional Employerprovided Plans, And About64 Percent Of These Contributions Were Toconventional Definedbenefit Plans. Today,Almost 60 Percent Of Contributions Are Topersonal Retirement Accounts, Including 401(K),Ira, And Keogh Plans. Including Employerprovided, Non401(K) Definedcontributionplans, Over 76 Percent Of Contributions Are Toplans That Are Controlled In Large Measure Byindividuals. These Individuals Make Participation, Contribution, Assetallocation, Andwithdrawal Decisions.In This Paper, We Describe The Likely Importance Of 401(K) Assets For Future Older Americans And The Effect Of Investment Decisions Onasset Accumulation. We Also Examine The Extentto Which Retirement Assets May Be Affected Byseveral Decisions: Preretirement Withdrawals,Management Fees And Expenses, Contributionrates, And Early Retirement.
