                    "The papers in this issue of the /PE were presented at a Festschrift con-\nference in honor of James J. Heckman's 65th birthday. The conference\nattendees included many of his former graduate students, coauthors,\nand colleagues. Thirteen excellent papers were submitted to this special\nissue. They went through the regular refereeing process, and six were\nultimately accepted. Below, we describe how the papers included in this\nissue were inspired and influenced by Heckman's research.\n\nHeckman has produced a large body of research examining the ori-\ngins of inequality in socioeconomic outcomes. An important insight\nfrom this research is that the family has a large influence on an individ-\nual's human capital formation. This finding led Heckman to state that\n*the accident of birth is a major source of inequality\" (2008, 289).! After\nHeckman won the Nobel Prize in 2000, a large part of his research focused\non understanding what types of policy interventions can improve early\nlearning environments for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and\naugment their skill levels. The research develops and implements new ap-\nproaches to modeling and estimating human capital formation processes\nand broadens our understanding about the economic relevance of critical\nand sensitive periods of human capital development. This work has stimu-\nlated an extensive and growing economics literature on child development\nand related policies. An example is *A Flying Start? Maternity Leave Bene-\nfits and Long-Run Outcomes of Children\" by Carneiro, Loken, and Salvanes\nin this issue, which analyzes the effects of a 1977 policy reform in Norway\nthat increased paid maternity leave from 0 to 4 months and unpaid leave\nfrom 3 to 12 months. The authors find that the mandated maternity leave\npolicy had long-term effects on the dropout rate and on education and\nwages at age 30, adding to accumulated evidence that early lifetime in-\nvestments have substantial long-term benefits.\n\nHeckman's research conceptualizes human capital formation as a\nlifelong cumulative process that starts even before birth and continues\n\n?

The use of low-down payment loans is initially lim-\nited by paymentto-income requirements but becomes unrestricted dur-\ning the boom. The model approximates key housing and mortgage mar-\nket facts before and after the crisis. A counterfactual experiment suggests\nthat the increased number of high-leverage loans originated prior to the\ncrisis can explain over 60 percent of the rise in foreclosure rates.\n\nL Introduction\n\nThe share of high-leverage loans in mortgage originations started rising\nsharply in the late 19905.

In this\nappendix, we further leverage our data to deepen our understanding of the particular mechanisms through which learning\ntakes place.\n\nA. Distribution of Defects across Stations\n\nAs discussed in the main text, we see outcomes for each of the several hundred processes that go into assembling a car. We\nuse these data to answer questions about the composition of process-specific productivity gains that underlie the more\naggregated productivity improvements analyzed above.\n\nWe first explore the process-level distribution of defect rates. Figure A6 shows the evolution over the sample of\nvarious quantiles of the process-specific defect rates. 8 defect rate is computed as the number of de\nrecorded at that process (station on the line) in a given workweek divided by the total number of cars produced that\nweek. The figure sorts these processes into quantiles on the basis of that week's performance; that is, a station will move\nfrom one quantile to another over time if its relative defect rate fluctuates.\n\nPanel A of figure A6 shows the 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles of the absolute levels of station-level defect rates\n(the skewness of the distribution relative to the scale of the figure makes it very difficult to visually distinguish quantiles\nbelow the median). Defect rates are highly skewed across stations, with a thick right tail. In the first full week of\nproduction, for example, the defect rate at the 95th percentile station is 20 times the rate at the median station that week\nand five times the 75th percentile rate. The tightening of the distribution early in the production year indicates that the\nlarge early-period productivity gains seen in the aggregate series come largely from defect reductions in the right tail of.\nstations. Interestingly, though, the basic shape of the distribution stays the same throughout the production year. This can\nbe seen in panel B of figure A6, which shows the ratio of a quantile's defect rate in a particular week to that same\nquantile's defect rate during the first week of production. We add the 25th percentile series to this panel, as it can now be\ndistinguished from the others. That is, the panel shows the percentage decline of the quantile's defect rate relative to itself.\nAII quantiles follow essentially the same pattern, with considerable reductions in relative defect rates early in the\nproduction period that decelerate over time. Aggregate learning by doing at the plant therefore reflects a proportional\ntightening of the entire station-level defect rate distribution, with all quantiles experiencing similar percentage declines in\ndefect rates.^* It does not appear, therefore, that productivity gains reflect all-out efforts to address the most problematic\nassembly procedures while ignoring all the others. The relative defect rates of all processes fall essentially in tandem.\n\nB. Persistence of Station-Level Defects\n\nFigure A6 sheds no light on the question of whether defect rates for particular processes are persistent. Specific\nprocesses could be relatively defect-prone (or defect-free) throughout the year, or they could jump from quantile to\nquantile, being major sources of defects at one point during the year while being nearly defect-free at other times. To\ninvestigate persistence, we first split the model year production into three equal-length periods: beginning, middle, and end.\nWe then calculate the station-level defect rate distribution within the first period and assign a station to its quintile in the\ndistribution during that period. We then count defects in each of the three periods by the first-period quintile of their\nprocess. The fewer changes we observe in the relative contribution of a particular quintile over time, the more persistence\nthere is in process-level defect rates.\n\nWe present the results of this exercise in figure A7, which can be interpreted as follows. Panel A shows the results for the\ntotal number of production defects during the period. The bar labeled *1\" breaks the total number of defects that\n\n? The quantiles of the distribution are computed while including stations that report no defects, which number between 7 percent and 14 percent\n\nof stations in any given week. Qualitatively similar data patterns remain in both absolute and relative defect levels among the corresponding quantiles of\nthe distribution conditional on stations reporting at least one production defect during the week.\n\n",
