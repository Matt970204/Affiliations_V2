      "['Preface\\n', 'The papers in this issue of the /PE were presented at a Festschrift con-\\nference in honor of James J. Heckman\\'s 65th birthday. The conference\\nattendees included many of his former graduate students, coauthors,\\nand colleagues. Thirteen excellent papers were submitted to this special\\nissue. They went through the regular refereeing process, and six were\\nultimately accepted. Below, we describe how the papers included in this\\nissue were inspired and influenced by Heckman\\'s research.\\n\\nHeckman has produced a large body of research examining the ori-\\ngins of inequality in socioeconomic outcomes. An important insight\\nfrom this research is that the family has a large influence on an individ-\\nual\\'s human capital formation. This finding led Heckman to state that\\n*the accident of birth is a major source of inequality\" (2008, 289).! After\\nHeckman won the Nobel Prize in 2000, a large part of his research focused\\non understanding what types of policy interventions can improve early\\nlearning environments for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and\\naugment their skill levels. The research develops and implements new ap-\\nproaches to modeling and estimating human capital formation processes\\nand broadens our understanding about the economic relevance of critical\\nand sensitive periods of human capital development. This work has stimu-\\nlated an extensive and growing economics literature on child development\\nand related policies. An example is *A Flying Start? Maternity Leave Bene-\\nfits and Long-Run Outcomes of Children\" by Carneiro, Loken, and Salvanes\\nin this issue, which analyzes the effects of a 1977 policy reform in Norway\\nthat increased paid maternity leave from 0 to 4 months and unpaid leave\\nfrom 3 to 12 months. The authors find that the mandated maternity leave\\npolicy had long-term effects on the dropout rate and on education and\\nwages at age 30, adding to accumulated evidence that early lifetime in-\\nvestments have substantial long-term benefits.\\n\\nHeckman\\'s research conceptualizes human capital formation as a\\nlifelong cumulative process that starts even before birth and continues\\n\\n?

DOI: 10.1086/671137\\n', '', '', 'Appendix from Levitt et al., *Toward an Understanding of Learning\\nby Doing: Evidence from an Automobile Assembly Plant\"\\n(JPE, vol. 121, no. 4, p. 643)\\n\\nDigging Deeper into the Learning by Doing Mechanism\\n\\nWe explored in the main text the nature of knowledge acquisition, transmission, and embodiment in the plant. In this\\nappendix, we further leverage our data to deepen our understanding of the particular mechanisms through which learning\\ntakes place.\\n\\nA. Distribution of Defects across Stations\\n\\nAs discussed in the main text, we see outcomes for each of the several hundred processes that go into assembling a car. We\\nuse these data to answer questions about the composition of process-specific productivity gains that underlie the more\\naggregated productivity improvements analyzed above.\\n\\nWe first explore the process-level distribution of defect rates. Figure A6 shows the evolution over the sample of\\nvarious quantiles of the process-specific defect rates. 8 defect rate is computed as the number of de\\nrecorded at that process (station on the line) in a given workweek divided by the total number of cars produced that\\nweek. The figure sorts these processes into quantiles on the basis of that week\\'s performance; that is, a station will move\\nfrom one quantile to another over time if its relative defect rate fluctuates.\\n\\nPanel A of figure A6 shows the 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles of the absolute levels of station-level defect rates\\n(the skewness of the distribution relative to the scale of the figure makes it very difficult to visually distinguish quantiles\\nbelow the median). Defect rates are highly skewed across stations, with a thick right tail. In the first full week of\\nproduction, for example, the defect rate at the 95th percentile station is 20 times the rate at the median station that week\\nand five times the 75th percentile rate. The tightening of the distribution early in the production year indicates that the\\nlarge early-period productivity gains seen in the aggregate series come largely from defect reductions in the right tail of.\\nstations. Interestingly, though, the basic shape of the distribution stays the same throughout the production year. This can\\nbe seen in panel B of figure A6, which shows the ratio of a quantile\\'s defect rate in a particular week to that same\\nquantile\\'s defect rate during the first week of production. We add the 25th percentile series to this panel, as it can now be\\ndistinguished from the others. That is, the panel shows the percentage decline of the quantile\\'s defect rate relative to itself.\\nAII quantiles follow essentially the same pattern, with considerable reductions in relative defect rates early in the\\nproduction period that decelerate over time. Aggregate learning by doing at the plant therefore reflects a proportional\\ntightening of the entire station-level defect rate distribution, with all quantiles experiencing similar percentage declines in\\ndefect rates.^* It does not appear, therefore, that productivity gains reflect all-out efforts to address the most problematic\\nassembly procedures while ignoring all the others. The relative defect rates of all processes fall essentially in tandem.\\n\\nB. Persistence of Station-Level Defects\\n\\nFigure A6 sheds no light on the question of whether defect rates for particular processes are persistent. Specific\\nprocesses could be relatively defect-prone (or defect-free) throughout the year, or they could jump from quantile to\\nquantile, being major sources of defects at one point during the year while being nearly defect-free at other times. To\\ninvestigate persistence, we first split the model year production into three equal-length periods: beginning, middle, and end.\\nWe then calculate the station-level defect rate distribution within the first period and assign a station to its quintile in the\\ndistribution during that period. We then count defects in each of the three periods by the first-period quintile of their\\nprocess. The fewer changes we observe in the relative contribution of a particular quintile over time, the more persistence\\nthere is in process-level defect rates.\\n\\nWe present the results of this exercise in figure A7, which can be interpreted as follows. Panel A shows the results for the\\ntotal number of production defects during the period. The bar labeled *1\" breaks the total number of defects that\\n\\n? The quantiles of the distribution are computed while including stations that report no defects, which number between 7 percent and 14 percent\\n\\nof stations in any given week. Qualitatively similar data patterns remain in both absolute and relative defect levels among the corresponding quantiles of\\nthe distribution conditional on stations reporting at least one production defect during the week.\\n\\n', 'This content downloaded from.\\n137.158.158.62 on Tue, 22 Feb 2022 20:51:22 UTC\\nAI use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\\n']\n",

In this note I wish to show\\nthat this can be done, by examining one of the basic problems in\\nmetaphysical theology: the nature of the afterlife, or, to give i\\nsomewhat more technical formulation, the ontology of Heaven.\\n\\nI start with one postulate: that in Heaven there is no scarcity. As\\nDavid Hume recognized, all conflict springs from scarcity, so it is not\\nnecessary to describe Heaven as characterized by justice, peaceful-\\nness, mutual love, etc., since these are derivatives from the no-scarcity\\npostulate. One might wonder how economic analysis could be applied\\nt0 a regime of no scarcity, but this is exactly the point: we can use the\\nanalysis, not to describe how to allocate resources efficiently, but to\\n\\ndiscover the characteristics Heaven must have if no such allocation is\\nnecessary.\\n\\nMost theologians consider that scarcity would be absent if the in-\\nhabitants of. Heaven were to enjoy everlasting life. What I wish to\\nshow is that this is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for no\\nscarcity.\\n\\nI take \"everlasting life\" to mean that every inhabitant of Heaven is\\nlocated on a time line which is, with certainty, expected to be infinite\\nin duration. There is, then, an infinite amount of time available for\\ncach inhabitant. Does this mean that there is no scarcity of tim ot\\nif Heaven time is like World time since, while it would be possible to\\ndo everything one wished to do sooner or later, one could not do\\neverything at the same time; one could not, for example, play the\\nharp and go swimming simultaneously. Choices would have to be\\nmade as to which to do first; that is, time would have to be allocated\\ndespite its cert infinite duration. So, everlasting life is not a\\nsufficient condition for no scarcity.\\n\\nFor Heaven to be characterized by no scarci\\nHeaven time be different\\n\\ny, it is nec that\\nrom World time. Tentatively, let us assume\\nthat Heaven time, in addition to being infinite in length, is also infinite\\nin width.

According to Friedman\\'s original exposition, the\\nzero MPC of transitory income \"introduces important substantive content\\ninto the hypothesis\" (1957, p. 27). Also, the zero MPC of transitory\\nincome contradicts the absolute-income hypothesis, which postulates a\\nstrong cffect on consumption of windfall income as well as regular\\nincome. Morcover, it raises an important policy question of whether a\\ntemporary income tax cut may have a stimulating effect on consumption.\\n\\nOriginally Bodkin (1959) tested this feature of the PIH by utilizing\\nthe 1950 BLS Urban Consumption Survey. which information on the\\nNational Service Life Insurance (NSLI) dividend payment to veterans\\nwas collected. Defining the dividend as a windfall by following Friedman\\'s\\noriginal suggestion,! Bodkin found that the estimate of the MPC of wind-\\nfall income was quite large and, indeed, as large as the estimate of\\nthe MPC of regular income. \"Thus, his finding challenged the validity\\nofthe PIH. Friedman (1960), however, replied that, since Bodkin estimated\\nthe effect of windfall income without holding permanent income constant,\\nhis estimate of the windfall effect might be biased upward, reflecting the\\neffect of permanent income in disguise. In support of this view, Reid\\n\\nI wish to thank Professors Ronald G. Bodkin and Milton Friedman for their con-\\nstructive comments. I am also grateful to Professors Guy H.

This note indicates that a basic con-\\nstraint has been omitted from McKenzie\\'s model and that its inclusion\\ninvalidates his results. The analysis will also be extended to incorporate\\nthe influence of income, which was omitted from McKenzie\\'s model, on\\nthe allocation of faculty time between teaching and research activities.\\n\\nMcKenzie\\'s model may be summarized as follows. Minimize disutility\\nU(T, R) subject to a constraint T — H — rR, where T and R are time\\nspent on teaching and research, 7 is the maximum teaching load, and\\nr is the number of units of T which can be traded for a unit of R. The\\nfirst-order conditions for this problem are:\\n\\nUp-à 20,\\n\\nUg — Ag 0\\nwhere 2, is the marginal disutility of teaching. The optimal combination\\nof T and R must satisfy the condition that U7/Ug — 1/r; this is depicted\\nby the tangency point between an indifference curve and the technical\\ntrade-off locus in McKenzie\\'s diagrams.\\n\\nChanges in the maximum teaching load, ceteris paribus, are equivalent\\nto a change in the level of H combined with a simultaneous change in r\\nwhich preserves the condition H/r — constant R. Like the income and\\nsubstitution effects of traditional price theory, an increase in H tends to\\nraise both T and A, while the associated rise in r tends to reduce T and\\nincrease R. The net effects of these two influences on the levels of T and\\nR undertaken depend on the form of individual\\'s utility function. In\\nMcKenzie\\'s model the \"income effect\" of successive increases in the\\nmaximum teaching load at first dominates the substitution effect, leading\\nto increases in both 7\\' and A; eventually, however, the substitution effect\\nexceeds the income effect, and T falls.\\n\\n219\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 154.59.124.54 on Fri, 01 Apr 2022 12:23:43 UTC\\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\\n']\n",

There I discovered that, while for the general population\\nmonogamy and dowries prevailed, there were certain subcastes, such as\\nthe laundrymen of Calcutta, in which the master married his labor force.\\nUnder these circumstances, not only polygamy but bride prices were\\nfound.\\n\\nLet me suggest that the probability of a positive bride price (or nega-\\ntive dowry) will be greater when inter alia:\\n\\nl. The number of wives per husband exceeds unity.\\n\\n2. The work expected of a wife, both within the household proper and\\nin aid of the husband\\'s business, is productive, skilled, and/or arduous.\\n\\n3. There are few or no legitimate extracurricular substitutes for wives\\nas sexual partners.\\n\\n4. The sex ratio of man to woman in the population of nubile age is\\nhigh.\\n\\n5. The prospective husband\\'s subsistence in old age depends, in de-\\nfault of both \"law and order\" and large undivided families, upon the\\nprotection furnished against neighbors, officials, and marauders by numer-\\nous healthy sons.\\n\\nTn most developed countries, a tradition of romantic love has prevailed\\npublicly, and probably privately, for approximately two centuries. Osten-\\nsible dowries and bride prices are therefore both zero. Supply and demand\\nanalysis suggests that this is a \"disequilibrium system\" as J. K. Gal-\\nbraith; it suggests further that the disequilibrium should reduce the\\nfrequency of marriage and create dissatisfied fringes of young men and/or\\nwomen. My own conjecture (supported by casual empiricism and a\\n\"dirty mind\") is, however, to the contrary.\\n\\nWhat is more likely is a collection of fringe burdens and benefits,\\nseminegotiated and semiassumed, accompanying the marriage proper. These\\nmay relate, for example, to the privileges or obligations of aged relatives,\\nto jobs or employment promises for either or both of the prospective\\npartners, to responsibilities assumed by or for unborn children, siblings,\\nand other younger relatives, and to present or future interests in real\\nor personal property. A írequent problem: marriages being \"made in\\nHeaven\" and above mundane economic considerations, contracts are not\\ndrawn up, legal consideration is not given, privileges and duties are not\\namenable to specific performance, third-party beneficiaries are left in\\nignorance. Indeed, the fringe burdens and benefits may often, and honestly,\\nbe understood quite differently by the marital couple themselves.\\n\\nThe disequilibrium result, if I am approximately correct, is to be found\\n\\nIn answer to 7968—0Q4 in \"Puzzles and Problems\" (J.P.E. 76 [May/June 1968]:\\n498).\\n\\n1424\\n', 'This content downloaded from.\\n197.90.38.233 on Tue, 29 Mar 2022 18:22:20 UTC\\nAII use subject to hitps://about jstor.org/terms\\n']\n",

In fact, when the demand for money function and other relevant\\nrelationships are specified, the system must possess the property implied\\nby general equilibrium theory that, in a truly ceteris paribus situation, a\\n1 percent increase in the quantity of money produce a 1 percent rise in\\nthe general price level after all lagged adjustments have worked them-\\nselves out, that is, that the elasticity of the price level with respect to the\\nmoney stock be equal to 1. In his study of seven hyperinflations, Cagan\\n(1956) derived the necessary and sufficient conditions for his assumed\\ndemand for money function to yield a money supply elasticity of the price\\nlevel equal to 1 under the assumption that adjustments are instantaneous;\\nthat is, that the path of prices is the solution to a first order differential\\nequation.\\n\\nIn contrast to Cagan's instantaneous adjustment model, Diz (1970)\\nin his study of the demand for money and inflation in Argentina has as-\\nsumed a discrete adjustment model, but failed to derive the necessary and\\nsufficient conditions for such a model to yield a money supply elasticity of\\nprices equal to 1.

Given the constrained maximization, economic theory derives\\ndifferent implications for income distribution and resource allocation from\\ndifferent systems of property rights. If we ignore problems of transaction\\nCost, the constraint of private property rights leads to a set of equilibrium\\nconditions which define economic efficiency.

And I put forward here another one\\nwhich I consider to be more in accordance with reality.\\n\\nThe late Professor Charles Rist, who was considered an authority on\\nmonetary questions and prices, has given the following theoretical justifi-\\ncation of this explanation of the rise in prices, which is basically that pro-\\npounded by all his adherents: *When gold is taken as a standard,\" he\\nwrote, **the rate of exchange against goods is established in the simplest\\nway. An increase in the production of gold tends to raise the price level of\\ngoods. Conversely, when the production of goods increases more rapidly\\nthan the production of gold, we witness a fall in the price level. But since\\nthe production of gold has remained the same, there is no reason why its\\npurchasing power should have changed since 1940. However, the price\\nof goods has risen in spite of the increase in the volume of goods. This rise\\ncan, therefore, only be attributed to the even greater increase in fiduciary\\nmonetary resources which have taken the place of gold\" (1953, pp.\\n100-102).\\n\\nAgainst this argument it can be objected first that prices represent the\\nrelation between the social utility value of goods and the value of the mone-\\ntary, unit and not the relation between quantities of goods and of mone-\\ntary instruments. Furthermore, Rist failed to appreciate the real evolution\\nof supply and demand of goods since the war as well as the laws relative to\\nvariations in the value of goods. Bearing these considerations in mind, we\\ncan find the real causes of the rise in prices since the war. Let us examine the\\nfacts.\\n\\nFrom 1939 to 1957, the annual production of gold of non-Communist\\ncountries was slightly reduced. As regards the evolution of monetary\\ncirculation, credit, and prices, we must limit our study to the United States,\\nwhere since the devaluation of 1934 the monetary unit has maintained its\\n\\n651\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 154.59.124.54 on Tue, 29 Mar 2022 19:40:54 UTC\\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\\n']\n",

This view is based upon the as-\\nsumption that many depositors, in order to\\nsave premiums, would forego such insurance,\\nor at least insure considerably less than 100\\nper cent of their holdings.\\n\\nAs a result, bank failures in certain com-\\nmunities—presumably Meltzer would be\\nprepared to accept such failures—might well\\nlead to the type of \"freezing up\" of the cir-\\nculating media which federal deposit insur-\\n\\nance was originally set up to counter.

But Meltzer goes\\nfurther and endorses privately offered insur-\\nance, presumably at the option of the de-\\npositor (or the bank?), an approach which\\ninvolves additional shortcomings. It seems\\nhighly doubtful that an insurance system\\noperated partly under private auspices\\nwould enjoy the full confidence of depositors\\n—an attribute which is essential if the fun-\\ndamental purposes of deposit insurance are\\nto be realized. This shortcoming might be\\novercome by providing for governmental\\ninspection and certification of the private\\ninsurers; but if this is to be the case, why\\nnot go further in the first place and provide\\nfor a government-operated system?\\n\\nThis leads to a fundamental point.

But inflation has been grad-\\nually eroding the real value (purchasing\\npower) of gold, while rising educational lev-\\nels and technical progress have been grad-\\nually increasing the value of human beings.\\nIn consequence, a significant number of\\npeople in our society have become worth far\\nmore than their weight in gold. For these\\npeople, to say that they are worth their\\nweight in gold is not to praise them but to\\nbelittle them, since it implies that they are\\ngrossly overpaid.\\n\\nGold is currently priced at $35.00 an\\nounce. This, however, is a Troy ounce,\\nnot the avoirdupois ounce used in weighing\\npeople. It takes 14.58333 Troy ounces to\\nmake a pound avoirdupois. Hence a pound\\nof gold, in terms of the system of measure-\\nment of human weight, is worth $510.41;\\nan ounce of gold, in terms of the same\\nmeasurement system, is worth $31.90; and a\\nhundredweight of gold is worth $51,041.663.\\nHence a person who weighed 125 pounds\\nwould have to be worth $63,802.08, a person\\nwho weighed 150 pounds would have to be\\nworth $76,562.50, a person who weighed 175\\npounds would have to be worth $89,322.92,\\nand a 200 pounder would have to be worth\\n$102,083.33, to be worth his weight in gold.\\n\\nPeople\\'s weights vary with their age,\\nheight, and sex, and it is these variations\\nthat are of interest to insurance companies,\\npublic health authorities, and others inter-\\nested in compiling statistics of average\\nweights. Hence it is difficult to find average\\nfigures for the typical American male or fe-\\nmale adult. Margaret Reid has, however,\\nprovided me with the following figures: the\\naverage American adult male weighs 168.5\\npounds, the average American adult female\\n\\nweighs 139.1 pounds, and the average Amer-\\nican adult weighs 153.5 pounds. To be worth\\ntheir weight in gold, therefore, the average\\nAmerican male adult would have to be\\nworth $86,000, the average American female\\nadult $71,000, and the average American\\nadult $78,300 (all figures rounded to the\\nnearest $100).\\n\\nHow much is a person worth? Colloqui-\\nally, this question refers to the value of a\\nperson\\'s holdings of property, that is, to his\\nwealth. The notion of a person\\'s being\\n\"worth his weight in gold,\" however, is usu-\\nally taken to refer to his value on the job,\\nrather than to his wealth. For the purpose of\\nassessing the value of a person in this sense,\\neconomists have invented the concept of\\n\"human capital\"; that is, they look at the\\nworker or salaried employee as a kind of\\ncapital equipment, which contributes a\\nstream of productive services to the eco-\\nnomic system and receives in exchange an\\nincome that represents the return on the\\nhuman capital Like other capital equip-\\nment, human capital can be valued in two\\ndifferent ways, useful for different purposes.\\nOne way is by the cost of producing it; this\\nis most useful for assessing the value of\\npeople who have just completed some stage\\nof their formal education.

Meltzer devel-\\noped and tested a \"wealth model\" of the\\ndemand for money in the United States,\\nusing non-human wealth and a long-term\\ninterest rate as explanatory variables. The\\nwealth model was shown (in the above and\\nsubsequent articles) to compare favorably\\nwith other demand-for-money hypotheses.\\nMoreover, Meltzer has defended his em-\\npirical results against various criticisms of\\nthe statistical methods he used to derive\\nthem.\\n\\n\"This note is concerned with some impor-\\ntant assumptions underlying Meltzer\\'s hy-\\npothesis and with his conclusion regarding\\nhuman wealth. More specifically, I shall\\nargue that one of Meltzer\\'s assertions does\\nnot hold, namely, the assertion that his em-\\npirical findings support his conclusion that\\nlittle bias results from excluding human\\nwealth from the measure of wealth he uses\\nto test his hypothesis. I shall show that\\nMeltzer\\'s argument is based upon the very\\nassumptions he attempts to confirm by his\\nempirical evidence. Finally, my argument\\nleads logically to the conclusion that if\\nMeltzer\\'s assumptions about human wealth\\nand income (which he says his evidence\\nsupports) were true, we could not distinguish\\nbetween a demand function using a wealth\\nconstraint from one employing an income\\nconstraint.\\n\\nIt will be recalled that the general form\\nof Meltzer\\'s demand function for money is\\n\\nM - f(r*, e, d*, W,),\\n\\n* The arguments presented herein are solely\\nthose of the author and they are not to be construed\\nas an official opinion of the Federal Reserve Bank\\nof New York.\\n\\nY The criticism was contained in Courchene and\\nShapiro (1964). Meltzer replied in Meltzer (1964).\\n\\nSYRING, JR.*\\nBank of New Vork.\\n\\nwhere M is the nominal quantity of money\\ndemanded; r*, the yield on financial assets;\\n£, the yield on physical assets; d*, the yield\\non human wealth; and W,, the nominal\\nvalue of the stock of non-human wealth. If\\nthe demand function is homogeneous of\\nfirst degree in W,,\\n\\nM — f*(r*, g, d*, 1)W,.\\n\\nMeltzer then lets d* — Y;/W,, the ratio of\\nhuman income to human wealth. Further,\\nthis is made the product of two components:\\nY,/Y * Y1/W». The first term is the ratio\\nof actual to expected human income, and\\nin the long run it can be assumed to be\\nconstant and equal to 1. Since Meltzer\\'s\\nstudy was concerned with the long-run de-\\nmand function for money, he made this\\nassumption. The second term, Y7/W., is the\\nratio of expected human income to human\\nwealth, and it is also assumed to be con-\\nstant.\\n\\n\"Thus, money is interpreted to be a liquid\\nasset that is held for the services it provides,\\nand the particular quantity that economic\\nunits desire to hold at any point in time\\ndepends upon the yields on alternative as-\\nsets and on the total stock of wealth to be\\nheld. The proper specification of the latter,\\nhowever, presents a vexatious problem.\\n\\nSince total wealth—human and non-hu-\\nman-—theoretically includes all sources of\\nincome, including human income, the ques-\\ntion arises as to the consequences of exclud-\\ning human wealth (which has not been, and\\nperhaps cannot be, measured) from the em-\\npirical wealth measure used as the con-\\nstraint on the demand for money balances.\\nAn important point at issue is our ability\\nto distinguish between demand functions\\nusing an income constraint and those em-\\nploying a wealth constraint.

In the interest of main-\\ntaining intellectual continuity, Nutter\\'s\\nbasic methodology has been retained. Do-\\nmestic industries have been grouped into\\nthree catagories: workably competitive, ef-\\nfectively monopolistic, and government or\\ngovernmentregulated. Each industry has\\nbeen weighted by its share of national in-\\ncome originated.\\n\\nNutter calculated that, in 1939, 20.16 per\\ncent of national income originated in gov-\\nernment or government-regulated indus-\\ntries, 59.09 per cent in the workably com-\\n\\n* This paper summarizes one portion of my Ph.D.\\ndissertation, \"Enterprise Monopoly and the Concen-\\ntration of Domestic Industrial Output: 1939-1958,\"\\nwhich will be included in a forthcoming Columbia\\nUniversity Press book.

Thus,\\nmanufacturing-concentration ratios for 1935 were\\napplied to 1939 census data, as were the findings of\\nthe Temporary National Economic Committee. A\\nrich variety of market studies similar to those pre-\\nparcd for that committee were not available for later\\nyears. As with the 1950\\'s, the manufacturing division\\nwas analyzed in more detail than other sectors be-\\ncause of the availability of far more data and infor-\\nmation.\\n\\npetitive sector, and 20.43 per cent in the\\neffectively monopolistic sector. Briefly,\\nNutter\\'s government-regulated industries\\nincluded the transportation industries (ex-\\ncluding pipelines), the public-utilities divi\\nsion, and the radio industry. He also in-\\ncluded pipeline transportation, the contract-\\nconstruction division, motion pictures, milk\\nproduction, fluid-milk distribution, automo-\\ntive retailing, banking, insurance carriers,\\nand telephone and telegraph industries in\\nthe effectively monopolistic sector, along\\nwith a number of manufacturing and mining\\nindustries.\\n\\nSeveral other economists have evaluated\\nthe trend of competition and industrial\\nstructure in the United States. George J.\\nStigler (1949) concluded that competition\\ndeclined moderately from 1870 through 1920\\nand rose moderately afterward; his brief\\nexamination of concentration in twenty\\nmanufacturing industries suggested a de-\\ncline in manufacturing monopoly from 1900\\nto 1940. For 1939 Stigler applied both struc-\\ntural and behavioral characteristics and\\nidentified the shares of national income\\noriginating in three industrial classes: (a)\\ncompetitive industries provided 55.2 per\\ncent of national income, (b) compulsory\\ncartels required by government provided\\n2.3 per cent of national income, and (c)\\nprivate monopoly (in the oligopolistic\\nsense) provided 24.4 per cent of national\\nincome.

Though several were not exciting\\nenough to have made a very permanent im-\\npression, I confess to having read each of\\nthe more than sixty separate studies. On\\nthe whole they were carefully executed and\\ndeserve a careful reading by economists.\\n\"They clearly embody sufficient evidence and\\nanalysis to have supported the long since\\npublished Report of the Commission on\\nMoney and Credit [II]. The Report left the\\nimpression of being a political document,\\nthe outcome of an effort to elicit a monetary\\npolicy mean from reconciliation of the spe-\\nCial interests of members of the Commis-\\nsion. In general, the research studies are\\nindeed scientific inquiries into the nature of\\nfinancial institutions and financial behavior\\nand the implications of such knowledge for\\nmonetary policy.\\n\\n(The authors of the research studies ap-\\npear to have been in general agreement that\\nchanges in the quantity of money affect eco-\\nnomic activity, but there were differences\\nconcerning the mechanism, magnitude, and\\ntiming of the effects. A consensus that\\nmoney matters somehow or other is prob-\\nably neither surprising nor significant, since\\nmost of the authors have established repu-\\ntations (and biases?) in money and related\\nfields. The great bulk of the studies were\\ndirected at uncovering empirical evidence\\nabout financial behavior patterns. In addi-\\ntion to the empirical studies, there were\\nseveral very good theoretical works and\\nseveral articles designed to survey research\\nin particular areas. One cannot know what\\n\\n? Numbers in brackets refer to references listed\\nin the bibliographic Appendix which appears at the\\nend of this article.\\n\\nfraction of the research studies would have\\nbeen completed and published in profes-\\nsional journals if there never had been a\\nCommission on Money and Credit to pay\\nthe bills. But I suspect most studies were\\nalready in process and that the principal\\neffect of the Commission was to speed their\\ncompletion (though hardly their publica-\\ntion). In general one might characterize the\\nresearch studies as a collection of good\\njournal articles, though the quality of the\\nediting would compare unfavorably. Partly\\nthis may be the result of a crash-program\\napproach in pushing authors and editors to\\ndeadlines. Because of the lack of opportu-\\nnity or willingness to wield an incisive blue\\npencil, there were altogether too many typo-\\ngraphical errors, long and repetitive studies,\\nand uninterpreted statistical tables.\\nInsofar as the over-all directing of the\\nresearch effort is concerned, I was disap-\\npointed that the Commission\\'s Report was\\nlargely independent of the research. Was\\nthe Commission so intransigent in terms of\\nits special interests and lack of competence\\nin economics that the research results were\\nignored? Or were the questions that were\\nasked by the researchers not answered re-\\nliably enough to warrant their application\\nin the Report? An affirmative answer to\\neither question is not very flattering to the\\nCommission.

      "['A NOTE ON THE SUBSTITUTION OF INANIMATE FOR ANIMAL POWER\\n\\nRICHARD\\n\\nB. DU BOFF\\n\\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\\n\\nN THE June, 1963, issue of this Journal,\\nEdward F. Renshaw (\"The Substitution\\nof Inanimate Energy for Animal Power\")\\nattempted to determine some concrete\\ncauses of the widely observed \"increases in\\nproductivity\" in the American economy.\"\\nHe concluded that factor-productivity ad-\\nvances can be explained largely by substitu-\\ntion of inanimate for animal power, and\\nthat this substitution process has been sub-\\nject to \"diminishing returns.\" This is\\nsupported by his finding that output per\\nunit of inanimate power input has been\\nfalling since the end of the nineteenth cen-\\ntury.\\n\\nYet there is clear evidence which under-\\nmines much of that argument. Since around\\nWorld War I, output per unit of inanimate\\npower input has been either stable or slowly\\nrising in both the domestic economy and its\\nmanufacturing sector.\\n\\nBefore elaborating upon this point, it is\\nnecessary to note two flaws which bear di-\\nrectly upon Renshaw\\'s theme of diminishing\\nreturns. First, the Wardwell article, cited\\nby Renshaw (n. 2, p. 285) to help prove that\\npower use has risen faster than output, says\\nprecisely the opposite: \"energy consumption\\nin the U.S. economy, though growing faster\\nsince 1930 than total employment, has not\\ngrown so fast as real national product.\"* Sec-\\nond, Renshaw\\'s Table 3 (p. 286), an attempt\\nto illustrate diminishing returns to power in-\\nputs in manufacturing, lacks significance.\\nIt compares output per man-hour with\\npower per production worker to arrive at\\n\"output per installed horsepower.\" But\\ndividing the first by the second (Renshaw\\'s\\nTable 3, source note) gives no algebraic\\nanswer; the denominators do not cancel out.\\n\"The corrected series (see my Table 2) shows\\n\\n1.284.\\n\\n?

Renshaw\\'s Table 1,\\ncol. (3), shows that since 1920-30 there is no\\ntrend. In fact, the Dewhurst data (Ren-\\nshaw\\'s Table 1, col. [1]) show that since\\naround 1920 GNP per horsepower hour has\\nbeen rising—the opposite of diminishing\\nreturns. The Dewhurst series is surely\\ncloser to what Renshaw secks to analyze\\n(work output); for the Putnam data (Ren-\\nshaw\\'s Table 1, col. [2]) are not final work\\noutput, but primary energy inputs.*\\n\\nGNP per horsepower of capacity (Ren-\\nshaw\\'s Table 2) has been falling since 1869.\\nHowever, this table includes automotive\\npower which it is often preferable to exclude.\\n\"This is what the Bureau of the Census does\\nwhen it compiles power statistics for manu-\\nfacturing, mining, railroads, and farms.

A freedman often con-\\ntinued in the same employment or else was\\nset up in business with funds supplied by the\\nmaster, or, on the land, was given part of the\\nestate to work as a tenant. Hence the slave\\nin fact bought his own freedom, either by\\nbeing given the opportunity to accumulate\\nsavings of his own, the \"peculium,\" or after-\\nward as a freedman, having received his\\nfreedom, so to speak, on credit. This system\\nwas to the advantage of the owner because it\\ngave the slave an incentive to work well and\\nin general to make himselt agreeable to his\\nmaster.

The\\nfact that the relatively minor significance of slavery.\\nin other societies usually had nothing to do with ethi-\\ncal considerations does in itself strongly support my\\ncontention that slavery is not an efficient economic\\nsystem. The size of the slave labor force has always\\nbeen in balance between extensive manumission or\\nexcessive mortality on one side and fresh outside\\nsupplies on the other. In Greece, for instance, the\\nadvantages of manumission were no less realized\\nthan in Rome, and the practice was as widespread.\\nAccording to Westermann, manumission prices were\\nin excess of the usual market prices for slaves.

U.S. Foreign Trade is\\nquite aware of recent trends in the United\\nStates balance of trade and payments.\\nMoreover, he has great respect for, and con-\\nfidence in, the forces operating to restore in-\\nternational equilibrium. In fact, he is quite\\ncritical of dollar-shortage theories that seek.\\ntoshow that these forces either do not work,\\nor work in the wrong direction. Thus, in the\\ncourse of a single chapter, he exposes the\\nflaws in the major dollar-shortage models,\\n\\n1 This note is mainly a review of Erik Hoffmeyer\\'s\\nDollar Shortage and the Structure of U.S. Poreign\\nTrade (Copenhagen: Ejnar Munksgaard; Amster-\\ndam: North-Holland Publishing Co., 1958).

His initial problem, which he never\\nsatisfactorily solves and which continues to\\nplague him throughout the length of the\\nbook, is with the concept itself. Hoffmeyer\\nagrees with Kindleberger and others that\\ndollar shortage is a persistent tendency to-\\nward disequilibrium in the balance of pay-\\nments of the United States, but he finds no\\nsatisfactory definition of disequilibrium and\\nno way to measure it. In Hoffmeyer\\'s words:\\n\\nIt is not possible to define generally what equi-\\nlibrium means. Strictly speaking it is necessary\\nto undertake a special analysis in each period in\\norder to establish the conditions for equilibrium.\\nOn the other hand, signs of disequilibrium have\\nbeen so numerous that it seems worthwhile to\\ninvestigate whether there is a common explana-\\ntion.

In\\ncontrast, the vigorous development of\\nempirical research in the field of personal\\nincome distribution is of recent origin.\\nMoreover, the emphasis of contempo-\\nrary research has been almost completely\\nshifted from the study of the causes of\\ninequality to the study of the facts and\\nof their consequences for various aspects\\nof economic activity, particularly con-\\nsumer behavior.\\n\\nHowever, the facts of income inequal-\\nity do not speak for themselves in sta-\\ntistical frequency distributions. The facts\\nmust be recognized in the statistical con-\\nstructs and interpreted from them. Per-\\nhaps the most important conclusion to\\nbe drawn from research into the influ-\\nence of income distribution on consump-\\ntion is that the effects of inequality de-\\npend upon its causes.! Thus factors as-\\nsociated with observed inequality must\\nbe taken into account before the data\\ncan be put to any use.\\n\\n281\\n\\nSince income inequality is observable\\nin terms of the shapes or parameters of\\nstatistical frequency distributions, theo-\\nries of the determinants of personal in-\\ncome distribution, if they are to be\\noperational, must predict features of the\\nobservable statistical constructs.\\n\\nProbably the oldest theory of this\\ntype is the one that relates the distribu-\\ntion of income to the distribution of\\nindividual abilities. A special form of\\nthis theory can be attributed to Galton,\\nwho claimed that \"natural abilities\" fol-\\nlow the Gaussian normal law of error.\\n\"This, it appeared to Galton, was a simple\\nconsequence of Quetelet\\'s findings that\\nvarious proportions of the human body\\nare normally distributed.

CAR!\\n\\nY BROWN\\n\\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\\n\\n\\'OFESSOR GURLEY has made a valuable\\nP ibution to the systematic formula-\\ntion of the fiscal problems of economic de-\\nvelopment in his article Fiscal Policy in a\\nGrowing Economy.\" Of particular interest\\nis his strong conclusion that the warranted\\nrate of growth is independent of the size\\nrelative to income of a balanced government\\nbudget. This result seems remarkable be-\\ncause we have learned that under static con-\\nditions the size of the balanced budget does\\ninfluence the size of equilibrium income. We\\nmight expect, therefore, to find that it could\\nalso affect the warranted growth rate. This\\nnote points out some of the restrictions in\\nGurley\\'s formulation which prevent this\\nresult.\\nBut first a word regarding Gurley\\'s undue\\nstrictures on static analysis. He writes:\\n\\nA characteristic of static fiscal analysis . . .\\nis that fiscal policy by itself could not alter the\\nfull-employment level of national income. . .. It.\\nis this characteristic of static analysis that has\\nlimited fiscal policy to its one principal role—\\nthat of achieving a given full.employment\\nincome level.\\n\\n\"When growth is allowed for, however, fiscal\\npolicy ...not only may... work to insure\\nthat the growing output resulting from the full\\nuse of capacity will be purchased at stable\\nprices but it may also strive to alter the rate\\nof growth of capacity output itself. The first\\nrole...is analogous to its principal static\\nrole, but the second has no counterpart in\\nstatic analysis [p. 524].\\n\\n\"This view seems to identify static analysis\\nwith that of a stationary state. The early\\ndiscussions of income analysis, it is true,\\nplaced major, if not sole, emphasis on de-\\nmand analysis, assuming either implicitly or\\nexplicitly that supply was perfectly elastic\\n\\n1 John G. Gurley, Journal of Political Economy,\\nVol. LXI (December, 1953).\\n\\nup to \"full employment\" and then perfectly\\ninelastic at that level of output. It was a\\nkind of reverse Say\\'s law: demand created\\nits own supply. In more recent discussions,\\nhowever, explicit attention has been given\\nto the determination of fullemployment\\nsupply in static aggregative models. Such\\nanalysis makes it perfectly clear that fiscal\\npolicies can affect full-employment supply\\nthrough their effect, for example, on incen-\\ntives. Surely, then, we must allow that\\nstatic analysis is concerned with demand and\\nsupply relationships and that the essence\\nof the difference between static and dynamic\\nfiscal analysis is not to be found here.\\nGurley\\'s results are based on a model of\\naggregate demand of the following kind?\\n\\nYi cYi(1— z) (D\\nTe(.— Yi) 0-2) c gYi,\\n\\nwhere Y\\', is net national income in period f£;\\n6, the fraction of disposable income spent on\\nconsumption; z, the fraction of income taken\\nin taxes; e, the acceleration coefficient; and\\n1g, the fraction of output purchased by the\\ngovernment.

      "['A REPLY\\n\\nGEORGE F. BRj\\n\\nK\\n\\nUniversity of California.\\n\\npaoressos. BROWN\\'S brief note, it seems to\\n\\nme, leaves the major differences between\\nus in a somewhat ambiguous state. I hope\\nthat the following comments will help to\\ndraw the lines somewhat more clearly than\\nmy original article was able to do.\\n\\nBrown has, I think, clarified his prefer-\\nence for what I called an *actual-purchasing-\\npower\" concept of real income. I willingly\\ngrant that probably few readers would have\\nplaced him in the potential-purchasing-\\npower group. On theother hand, statements\\nsuch as \"\\'the real value of an asset depends\\non the purposes for which it is held\" (Brown,\\nop. cil., p. 134) and \"the position of firms\\nwhen prices change is related directly to the\\nkinds of capital goods they own\" (ibid., p.\\n136) did leave unclear his choice between\\nactual-purchasing-power real income (full\\nreplacement allowed regardless of what the\\nincome receiver does with the proceeds of\\nasset sales) and replacement-value-main-\\ntenance real income (full replacement al-\\nlowed only when the income receiver re-\\nplaces exactly in kind). It is good to have\\nthis issue resolved.\\n\\nV The statement which suggested to me that he\\nmight be there was this one: \"No gain would be\\nshown unless the asset yielded more than its book\\nvalue adjusted to current prices; no loss would be\\nshown unless it yielded less than the adjusted book\\nvalue\" (Brown, Effecs of Taxation: Defreciation\\nAdjustments for. Price Changes [Boston, 1952], p.\\n115). He gave no reasons for these real gains and\\nlosses. One possible explanation is that a more or\\nless general price index is to be used to compute real\\nincome. In such a case real gains and losses will occur\\nto the extent that individual asset prices move dif-\\nierently from that general price index. Another\\npossible explanation is that specific-asset price rela-\\ntivesare to be used to derive real income but that the\\npattern of depreciation taken does not exactly match\\nthe pattern of price decline of the depreciable assets\\nin question. No doubt my hypersensitivity to the\\npossible ambiguities in the concept of real income led\\nme to neglect unduly the second possibility\\n\\n75\\n\\nEvidently some disagreement still re-\\nmains between us concerning the simple and\\ncomplex methods of allowing for replace-\\nment-cost depreciation. The simple depre-\\nciation method (ibid., pp. 96-102) involves\\nadjustment each year of histori t de-\\npreciation allowances to the asset prices cur-\\nrently prevailing and will frequently yield\\nan aggregate of such currently priced de-\\npreciation deductions different from the ac-\\ntual replacement cost. My evaluation of the\\nmethod is that it is correct as far as it goes.\\nthat is, for the single depreciable asset in\\nquestion—on the argument that the sum of\\nthe depreciation allowances, when each is\\nconverted to dollars of a constant purchas-\\ning power, must equal the replacement cost\\n(stated in the same homogeneous dollars)\\nand that this is the relevant comparison.\\nBrown, I gather, regards the simple depre-\\nciation method as unsatisfactory even for a\\nsingle depreciable asset, since to him the\\nrelevant comparison is between the aggre-\\ngate of currently priced depreciation allow-\\nances and the replacement cost. (ibid., pp.\\n100 and 148).\\n\\nSince I regard the simple depreciation\\nmethod as satisfactory for a single asset, I\\nalso view with favor its extension to all as-\\nset accounts in what Brown calls the *con-\\ntinuous adjustment of all balance-sheet ac-\\ncounts depreciation method\" (ibid., pp. 110.\\n15). Brown also judges this method to be\\n\"ogically impeccable\" (ibid., p. 110), but it\\nis not clear from his discussion whether or\\nnot he intends to conline this evaluation to\\nthe specific situation used to illustrate the\\nmethod.

INTRODUCTION\\n\\nHE definition of \"income\" based\\n| upon a straight money conception\\nof capital maintenance has been\\nunder heavy fire in recent years. Criti-\\ncism has come not only during the recent\\nprice inflations from advocates of various\\nreal- or replacement-cost concepts of\\ncapital maintenance but also over a more\\nextended period from economic and tax\\ntheorists seeking either a satisfactory\\nanalytical tool or a good tax base. But in\\nthe process some of the characteristics\\nwhich any good definition should possess\\nhave been lost from sight. It is the pur-\\npose of this paper to evaluate each of the\\ndifferent concepts of capital maintenance\\nwith reference to two of the most impor-\\ntant of these characteristics. Such analy-\\nsis, I shall argue, leads to the conclusion\\nthat one definition of capital mainte-\\nnance is superior to all others—namely,\\nthat which uses as its standard the origi-\\nnal money value of all capital assets in-\\nvolved in the computation of income.\\nThe two qualities considered here as\\nfundamental to a good definition are,\\nfirst, clarity and precision and, second,\\nlack of arbitrary boundaries. Definitions\\nwhich do not possess these qualities have\\na basic inferiority which must be more\\nthan overbalanced by other desirable\\ncharacteristics, if their use is to be justi-\\nfied.

This classification,\\nin turn, serves a number of secondary\\npurposes. For one thing, the essential\\nambiguity of the term \"real income\" is\\nshown in the diversity of meanings ap-\\nplied to it by different writers.

The need for a special \"welfare\\neconomics,\" whose function it is to relate the\\nfindings of positive economics to problems\\nof public policy, is of relatively recent date.\\nOnly within the last fifty or seventy-five\\nyears have economists made serious and\\nConsistent efforts to create a positive science\\ndivorced (at least conceptually) from the\\nconsideration of public policy. For a time it\\nseemed fashionable to label the study of wel-\\nfare problems as unscientific and, by impli-\\ncation, unworthy of serious attention. How-\\never, in the last decade and a half there has\\nbeen a revival of interest in these problems,\\nand much of the best work of leading con-\\ntemporary theorists has been directed to-\\nward systematizing and extending \"welfare\\neconomics.\" The volume under review is, in\\npart, a recapitulation of this work and also\\na comparison of it with the welfare aspects\\nof \"classical economics.\"\\n\\nDr. Myint distinguishes three levels of\\nwelfare analysis: a. \"physical level,\" where\\n\"quantities of economic welfare are propor-\\ntional to quantities of physical products\"; a.\\n\"subjective level,\" where \"quantities of eco-\\nnomic welfare are proportional to quantities\\nof satisfaction of given and constant indi-\\nviduals\\' wants\"; and an \"ethical level,\"\\nwhich is \"not concerned with the quantita-\\ntive measurement of success in achieving\\n\\n!

Their\\nanalysis is said to be on a \"physical level\"\\nbecause (according to the author) they neg-\\nlect the question of whether the composi-\\ntion of output is properly adjusted to the\\npattern of consumer demands and, instead,\\nevaluate the performance of an economic\\nsystem in terms of its success in maximizing\\naggregate output (pp. xii and 6-9).

At stake is the role of the entire impu-\\ntation theory of neoclassical economics. At\\nstake is the social justification of free markets\\non the basis of social utility. To my mind these\\nare issues of paramount importance, and to\\nthem my thesis is directed in a most explicit\\nmanner (chaps. viii and ix).\\n\\nMr. Earley calls my demand theory \"a pecul-\\niar variant\" of the formal type. It may be pecul-\\niar, but it certainly is not formal. I do hold that\\nour science has evolved the concept of *margin-\\nal utility\" and construed it to suit its own pur-\\nposes, just as in the physical and chemical sci-\\nences we use the concepts of \"specific gravity\"\\nand \"valence.\" However, such concepts are not\\nnecessarily purely formal. They may be derived\\nfrom realistic data, and there may also exist an\\nindirect contact with reality.

      "['', '', '182\\n\\nBOOK REVIEWS\\n\\nA REJOINDER\\n\\nI wish to apologize to Dr. Schróder for my\\nunsympathetic review of his monograph. Much\\nof my criticism, I now see, was based on mis-\\nunderstanding of his position.\\n\\nDr. Schróder is right in surmising that my\\nhypercritical attitude toward his work was\\nbased at bottom on my feeling that it was insuf-\\nficiently directed toward important issues. His\\nreply makes dear that he was trying to get at\\nsome of them. I still feel, however, that he was\\nled around the important issues by the charac-\\nter of the literature he was surveying. My com-\\nplaints should perhaps have been directed pri-\\nmarily at his materials.\\n\\nDr. Schróder wonders what I deem impor-\\ntant in demand theory. Let me say this: De-\\nmand analysis is important because it opens up\\nlines of inquiry into three important sets of\\nquestions. First, how do consumers! objective\\nchoices influence price formation, resource use,\\nand levels of economic activity? Second, what\\nmakes consumers behave the way they do?\\n\"Third, to what extent does effective demand for\\ngoods and services reliably measure the welfare\\nwhich their production and consumption create?\\nSubjective demand analysis bears especially on\\nthe latter two of these three sets of questions.\\n\\nUnfortunately, a great deal of the literature\\nof subjective demand, especially in America, has\\nbeen diverted from these topics to questions\\nsuch as whether \"utility\" is absolute or relative,\\nwhether marginal utility or cost of production\\ndetermines value, and, recently, to whether\\npreference theory has dethroned utility theory.\\nDr. Schróder, following the American literature,\\ngave most of his attention to these issues.\\n\\nSuch problems seem to me rather unimpor-\\ntant. No special interpretation of consumers\\nchoice is required to analyze the ways in which\\neffective demand influences prices and resource\\nuse. As to the second salient question, \"What\\nmakes consumers choose what they do?\" price\\nand income are obvious factors whose influence\\ndoes not depend on any special interpretation\\nof subjective valuation. Beyond these factors,\\nthe utility theory posits marginal utility sched-\\nules as determinants of demand schedules; but\\nin most analyses this \"utility\" is as purely formal\\n\\nas the indifference systems posited by the pref-\\nerence theorists.\\n\\nThe real question here is:\\nand predict the demand functions, whether these\\nbe interpreted as reflecting preference or utility\\nsystems? What is needed for these purposes is\\nknowledge of what influences— biological, psy-\\nchological, sociological, business-induced, etc.—\\nactually incline people to certain choices. Yet\\nvirtually all demand theory merely takes these\\nindiinations as \"data,\" without inquiry.\\n\\nSuch knowledge is part, though only part, of\\nthat needed to say anything, in any but a formal\\nsense, about the third important issue—the ex-\\ntent to which effective demand for consumer\\ngoods is a sound criterion of economic welfare.\\n(Inquiries into the relations between income\\nlevels, income distribution, and economic wel-\\nfare are also requisite.) Unless we can judge the\\nextent to which consumer demands are based on\\nadequate knowledge and \"intelligent\" behavior\\n(and unless an income distribution bears some\\ndeterminable relation to an \"optimum\" pat-\\ntern), there is little basis for deciding whether\\nthe resource-use determined by a market system.\\nis or is not \"economical\" in any significant\\nsense.\\n\\n1f we can acquire some substantial knowl-\\nedge of all these things, we can move through\\nsubjective demand analysis to important scien-\\ntific and normative conclusions. If we have no\\nmeans of finding out about them, let us not de-\\nlude ourselves that we are discussing weighty\\nmatters when we debate the role of \"utility\" in\\neconomics. Whether subjective valuation im-\\nplies a comparison between two utilities is an\\nempty question so long as we posit nothing\\nabout the meaning and significance of these\\nutilities. In that case the \"logical consistency\"\\nof the value concept based on utility theory is\\nalso a second-rate issue; perfect logical consist-\\nency will not save the *imputation theory of\\nneoclssical economics\" nor help decide \"the\\nsocial justification of free markets on the basis\\nof social utility.\"\\n\\nJawEs S.

Stigler has raised some queries\\nabout the famous Giffen paradox as elabo-\\nrated in Marshall\\'s Principles? His points\\nmay be listed under two main headings:\\n(I) Where did Giffen make his statement?\\n(II) Does statistical evidence support the\\ndictum or not? It will be convenient to put\\nour comments under these two headings.\\n\\nI\\n\\nProfessor Stigler declares that he is un-\\nable to find the source of the statement. I\\nsuggest that it may be the following pas-\\nsage:\\n\\nTt may be suggested that as the fall in [the\\nprice of] cereals cannot be ascribed to an exces-\\nsive growth of the production of the cereals\\nthemselves, it must be ascribed, seeing that\\nthere has been a great increase of the resources\\nof the consuming peoples themselves, to a\\ndiminution of demand arising from various\\ncauses. What can be these causes? Why do\\npeople as they grow richer consume less wheat\\netc. instead of more? The answer to the last\\nquestion is to be found, I think, in an examina-\\ntion of the figures as to livestock... . People\\nconsume less cereals per head because, with\\ntheir increase of resources, they consume more\\nmeat, which pro tanto displaces the cereals.\\n\\n\"These sentences are extracted írom a\\nmemorandum written by Giffen, The Real\\nAgricultural Development of the Last 20\\n\\n* Vol. LV (April, 1947), 152 ff.\\n\\n? \"There are however some exceptions. For in-\\nstance, as Mr. Giffen has pointed out, a rise in the\\nprice of bread makes so large a drain on the resources\\nof the poorer labouring families and raises so much\\nthe marginal utility of money to them, that they\\nare forced to curtail their consumption of meat and\\nthe more expensive farinaceous foods: and, bread\\nbeing still the cheapest food which they can get and\\nwill take, they consume more, and not less of it.\\nBut such cases are rare; when they are met with\\nthey must be treated separately\" ([sd ed., 1895],\\np. 208).\\n\\nPREST\\n\\nYears,\" printed as Appendix V to the Final\\nReport of the Royal Commission on Agricul-\\nlural Depression In this memorandum\\nGiffen contrasts the growth of populations\\nin a number of countries from 1873 to 1893\\nwith the relative growth in the areas under\\nwheat and other cereal crops and the num-\\nbers of livestock. He freely admits, however,\\nthat the comparison is by no means exact,\\nand the inference he draws is essentially a.\\nbroad generalization rather than a piece of\\ndeductive reasoning.\\n\\nIt may well be that Giffen has written\\nelsewhere on similar lines—it will be noted\\nthat Marshall is not quoting this passage\\nexactly, for he speaks of the effect of a rise\\nin price, while Giffen only refers to a fall—\\nbut the fact that the memorandum is dated\\n\"8.1.95\" and that the third edition of the\\nPrinciples (in which the reference appears\\nfor the first time) also appeared in that year\\naffords an a priori reason for believing that\\nthis was the origin of Marshall\\'s paragraph.\\n\\nII\\n\\nProfessor Stigler divides his examination\\nof the empirical evidence into two parts:\\n(a) time-series data and (b) family-budget\\ndata.\\n\\na) Time-series. data.—In his Table 1r\\nStigler lists the per capita wheat consump-\\ntion (in pounds) and the price of British\\nwheat (per quarter) for the crop years 1889\\n1904.

The object of the present paper is to\\nindicate various theoretical and practical\\nconsiderations concerning the role of foreign\\ninvestment in the national drive for full em-\\nployment. The paper is divided into two sec-\\ntions: (1) a consideration of foreign invest-\\nment as a palliative to cyclical unemploy-\\nment, and (2) a similar consideration with\\nrespect to \"secular stagnation.\"\\n\\nI. FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND CYCLI-\\nCAL UNEMPLOYMENT\\n\\nForeign investment is one way to offset a\\ncyclical deficiency of aggregate domestic de-\\nmand. In other words, it is a method of in-\\ncreasing foreign expenditure for exports? In\\nso far as cyclical unemployment is con-\\ncerned, the foreign demand for capital goods\\n\\n* I have benefited from discussions with my col-\\nleagues, Professors J. Viner, F. D. Graham, F. A.\\nLutz, and W. Lockwood. I am particularly indebted\\nto Dr. H. R. Bowen, economist, Irving Trust Com-\\npany, who read the entire manuscript and offered\\nvaluable criticisms.\\n\\n? An increase in the national income resulting\\nfrom interest and amortization payments is left out.\\nof account for two reasons. One is that in the future\\nforeign lending is likely to be expanded at \"generous\\nterms.\" The other is the likelihood that part of the\\nmultiplier effect of the increased national income on\\ndomestic employment will \"leak out\" to the benefit\\nof employment elsewhere, since the increased na-\\ntional income gives rise to a higher marginal propen-\\nsity to import and thus decreases the United States\"\\nfavorable foreign balance. On this point, see J. M.\\nKeynes, General Theory (New Vork: Harcourt,\\nBrace & Co.), p. 120.\\n\\nKURIHARA*\\n\\nis crucial. Accordingly, foreign investment\\nisan attempt to increase foreign expenditure\\nlargely for capital goods. It is generally as-\\nsumed that reconstruction and development\\nin the rest of the world will, if properly\\nfinanced, give rise to increased foreign de-\\nmand for capital goods and therefore stimu-\\nlate domestic employment in the United\\nStates when aggregate home demand begins\\nto level off. The practical problem is to di-\\nrect foreign demand toward capital goods at\\na time when the domestic capital-goods in-\\ndustries are at a low ebb. Obviously, un-\\nregulated private foreign investment cannot\\nbe expected to have that effect. Two other\\ntypes of foreign investment are plausible in\\nthis respect: \"tied loans\" such as those\\nmade by the Export-Import Bank, and\\nlong-term loans such as those made by the\\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and\\nDevelopment.\\n\\nAlthough the Export-Import Bank re-\\nquires that the proceeds of its loans be spent\\nin the United States; it has little direct con-\\ntrol over the time, volume, or manner of\\nforeign spending. It is possible that the for-\\neign borrowers may spend the proceeds for\\nconsumers\\' goods rather than for capital\\ngoods and at a time when the stimulus of\\nextra exports is not needed. Even though the\\nbank had sufficient funds to lend, its tied\\nloans might not find enough foreign applica-\\ntions.

Most\\nschoolboys have read his autobiography\\nand have had Poor Richard\\'s aphorisms\\ndrilled into them for edification. Later,\\nthey may have been introduced to the\\n\"complete\"  Franklin—the American\\nrepresentative of the Enlightenment, the\\nscientific deist, the friend of Du Pont de\\nNemours and the physiocrats, le bon\\nhomme of the French court, and the au-\\nthor of some essays in the vein of\\nRabelais. Here the concern is with\\nFranklin as a political economist. And\\nwhen full weight has been given to his\\nvaried intellectualism, we must return to\\nhim as Poor Richard, or, at most, Poor\\nRichard Improved. By making a few\\nemendations, Franklin can be reconciled\\neasily with the schoolboy\\'s conception of\\nhim.\\n\\nIn his economic doctrine, Franklin\\nwas eminently \"practical\": his ideas\\nwere designed to meet specific problems,\\nand the test of their validity was not\\nwhether they formed a cohesive, logical\\nwhole but rather whether they were indi-\\nvidually useful. This is the only conclu-\\nsion one can draw after considering them\\nin loto. Viewing Franklin\\'s political\\neconomy otherwise has led students of\\nintellectual history into unresolved para-\\n\\ndox or to sheer astonishment at their\\nsubject\\'s versatility. There are passages\\nenough in the profuse writings of Frank-\\nlin to make an approximate case for his\\nbeing a physiocrat (or a forerunner of\\nBritish classicism or a mercantilist); a.\\nfriend of the common man (or an\\nenemy); an advocate of paper currency\\n(or an opponent); a proponent of free (or\\nrestricted) trade, of high (or low) wages.\\nA more comprehensive view would show\\nthat Franklin was shrewd, cautious but\\nnot of a closed mind, methodical but not\\ngiven to rote, a great compromiser and\\nbeliever in the virtue of expediency. He\\nwas not exactly the penny-pinching\\nprinter of the Autobiography; he was\\nopen-minded, intellectually curious, and\\nwilling to try new ideas; but he was not\\ndevoted to intellectualism as an end in it-\\nself, to the pursuit of truth per se—as\\nwere, for example, John Adams and Jeí-\\nÍerson. An awareness of these traits is\\nnecessary if the diverse and conflicting\\nelements in Franklin\\'s economic doctrine\\nare to become comprehensible.\\n\\nI\\n\\nFranklin\\'s remarks on laissez faire are\\nillustrative of his pragmatic outlook. In\\none of his more celebrated economic\\nscreeds, On the Price of Corn and Manage-\\nment of the Poor (1767), he pleads for the\\nÍree export of grain and for permitting\\ngrain prices to fluctuate according to\\nmarket conditions.

      "['NOTES ON THE HISTORY\\n\\nGEORGE\\n\\nF5 more than half a century economists\\nhave recognized the possibility of a posi-\\ntively sloping demand curve. They have de-\\nsired a real example, probably to reassure\\nthemselves of the need for discussing the\\npossibility, and almost invariably they have\\nused Marshall\\'s Giffen paradox as this ex-\\nample. The present note arose out of curios-\\nity as to the nature of the evidence for the\\npáradox—a curiosity that was and is far\\nÍrom satisfied.\\n\\nMarshall introduced the paradox in the\\nthird edition of his Principles (1895), with\\na paragraph that was not changed in essen-\\ntials in later editions:\\n\\nThere are however some exceptions. For\\ninstance, as Mr Giffen has pointed out, a rise\\nin the price of bread makes so large a drain on\\nthe resources of the poorer labouring families\\nand raises so much the marginal utility of\\nmoney to them, that they are forced to curtail\\ntheir consumption of meat and the more ex-\\npensive farinaceous foods: and, bread being\\nstill the cheapest food which they can get and\\nwill take, they consume more, and not less of\\nit. But such cases are rare; when they are met\\nwith they must be treated separately (p. 208).\\n\\nOne suspects that the paradox was a last-\\nminute addition to the Princijles, for it\\nstands in bold conflict with the law of\\ndemand:\\n\\n\"There is then one Law of Demand, which is\\ncommon to all demands, viz. that the greater\\nthe amount to be sold, the smaller will be the\\nprice at which it will find purchasers . . . .\\n(p. 173).\\n\\nThus the one universal rule to which the\\ndemand curve conforms is that it is inclined\\nnegatively throughout the whole of its length\\n(p. 175 n).\\n\\n? This and all subsequent works of Marshall to\\nwhich reference is made are published by Macmillan\\n& Co., Ltd., London.\\n\\nOF THE GIFFEN PARADOX\\nJ. STIGLER\\n\\nAlready in the fourth edition of the Prin-\\nciples (1898), the law of demand was stated\\nmore cautiously:\\n\\nThere is then one general law of demand,\\nviz. that the greater the amount to be sold, the\\nsmaller the price at which it will find pur-\\nchasers . .. . (p. 174);\\n\\nbut the footnote stating the universal rule\\nof negative slope persisted in all later\\neditions.\\n\\nThe paradox is stated again in the\\nMemorandum on Fiscal Policy of Inler-\\nnational Trade (1903) with somewhat more\\ndetail for the parliamentary audience to\\nwhich it was addressed:\\n\\nTt is, indeed, an almost universal rule that a\\ntax on the importation of a commodity lessens\\nits consumption more or less; and the conse-\\nquent diminution of demand tends to induce\\nforeign producers to offer it on terms which are\\nlower, although not always perceptibly lower.\\nWheat has conformed to this rule throughout\\nall history, so far as is known, until about forty\\nyears ago. But now nearly the whole of the\\nEnglish people can afford to buy as much bread.\\nas they want, and yet have money enough left\\nto buy some more expensive foods: and, as Sir.\\nR. Giffen seems to have been the first to observe,\\na rise in the price of wheat still leaves bread the\\ncheapest food, which they will consent to eat in\\nany quantity; so that, having to curtail their\\npurchases of more expensive foods, they buy,\\nnot less bread than they would have done, but\\nmore.\\n\\nIn 1909 Edgeworth commented upon the\\nparadox in the course of a review of Russell\\nRea\\'s Free Trade in Being.?

The\\ntask of guiding the government's falter-\\ning steps toward complete mobilization\\nwas assumed by the leaders of labor. In\\nthe following paragraphs a record is pro-\\nvided of the labor movement's rise in\\nprestige and authority before and during\\nthe course of World War II, culminating\\nin the recent overwhelming victory for\\nthe Labor party—largely because of its\\ndrastic program of domestic reform.\\n\\nIn the General Election of 189s, for\\nthe first time in English history, a group\\nof labor candidates, independent of\\nother parties and standing for the separ-\\nate representation of the working classes\\nin Parliament, offered themselves to the\\nvoting public. These representatives\\nnumbered twenty-eight, and all were de-\\nfeated, polling a total of only 44,000\\nvotes. Fifty years later the Labor party\\nsponsored 6or candidates and elected of\\nthis number 392 with a total popular\\nvote of nearly twelve million—almost\\nhalf of the total votes cast. The indi-\\nviduals who were elected to Parliament\\nconstituted a more representative dele-\\ngation than any Labor party had pre-\\nviously offered, including many agricul-\\ntural workers, now effectively organized\\nfor the first time, servicemen and women,\\nand large sections of the middle classes.\\nNot since the Liberal government of\\n1906 has there been such an influx into\\nthe House of Commons of new men and\\nwomen inspired by new thoughts and\\nprograms. In fact, nearly two hundred\\n\\n.

In that period retail food prices in-\\ncreased 3,342 per cent in the southern\\nand central regions of Italy.

BISHOP\\'S ARTICLE\\n\\nFRANK H.\\n\\nINCE both my own article and Bish-\\nS op\\'s criticism have been long and\\nrather heavy reading, I shall com-\\nment as briefly as possible and chiefly on\\nhis early sections, which deal with fun-\\ndamentals in the logic of utility theory.\\nTo begin with, my critic finds me incon-\\nsistent in stating that progressive satia-\\ntion, implying \"diminishing marginal\\nutility,\" is an indisputable fact and then\\nsaying that other assumptions are to\\nsome extent logically admissible. I see\\nno inconsistency at all in this, or in stat-\\ning a general principle and admitting\\nreal exceptions. Of course, a description\\nof any situation as typical raises a ques-\\ntion of fact. Two persons often look at the\\nsame thing and see, or report, different\\nthings; and still more commonly they\\n\"look inward\" and report different things\\nand make different judgments about gen-\\neral human attitudes. These can be\\nknown only from the expression or be-\\nhavior of a limited human sample, which\\nmust be interpreted in the light of one\\'s\\nown mentality. So, if anyone denies that\\nprogressive satiation and its implications\\nare typical of consumer experience\\n(which Bishop does not expressly do),\\nthere is no argument; the only appeal is\\nto the judgment of the individual reader,\\nor what he thinks to be the consensus of\\ncompetent and unbiased persons.\\n\\nA similar logical issue is involved in\\nBishop\\'s second section (pp. 143-51),\\nwhere we come closer to the main ques-\\ntion. My general contention is that the\\ntheory of \"diminishing marginal utility\"\\n(I think \"diminishing incremental satis-\\nfaction\" a much more accurate expres-\\nsion) is sound and useful for exposition of\\n\\ni70\\n\\nKNIGHT\\n\\nthe theory of consumer behavior. I sup-\\nported this view by asserting that the\\nquantification, as well as the ranking, of.\\nsatisfactions is \"necessary\" to explain\\nthe constant addition of new \"goods and\\nservices\" to a consumption budget as in-\\ncome increases (prices constant) and,\\nin view of this facl, is necessary to explain\\nrealistically the definite allocation of in-\\ncomes among a large number of lines of\\nexpenditure, in place of spending the\\nwhole on the item (or the few items) most\\nhighly valued at the start. The data\\nwere treated as familiar facts, and my\\ncritic has not questioned them. (The rea-\\nsons and conditions might raise interest-\\ning problems.) I recognized that it is\\n\"possible\" by ranking ofsatisfactions,\\nwithout comparison of differences, to ex-\\nplain income apportioning, as long as\\nnew items are not added; but I pointed\\nout that the procedure is unrealistic and\\nstrained and confusing and a needless\\ndeparture from common-sense psychol-\\nogy. As to the \"necessity\" in question,\\nI did not imply that it is mathematically\\ndemonstrable or that no satisfaction\\nfunction could be set up which would ac-\\ncount for adding new items, if it oc-\\ncurred, without assuming decreasing in-\\ncrements of satisfaction. I have felt only\\n2 limited abstract curiosity on that point\\nand, lacking adequate command of the\\ntools of analysis anyway, have never\\ngone into it very seriously.\\n\\nAs far as I can judge, Bishop\\'s mathe-\\nmatics are correct, and I shall take his\\nargument as accomplishing all that he ex-\\nplicitly claims for it.

In its immediate incidence this\\nproblem does not necessarily involve the\\nmatter of Negro membership—the tradi-\\ntional hurdle facing colored workers in\\nshops under the control of certain unions.\\nIt becomes clear, however, that, when\\nclearance or auxiliary-union affiliation is\\narranged, the questions of membership\\nstatus and full participation in unions are\\nsure to become issues. These questions\\nmay be raised by the minority affected in\\nits opposition to second-class member-\\nship and work permits (sometimes at\\nfirst-lass membership fees)? or they\\n\\n* TThis paper does not include the railroad indus-\\ntry, since it has been subject to the review of the\\nPresident's Committee on Fair Employment Prac-\\ntice.

In a. period of full employment and national\\nprograms to encourage men and women to enter\\ndefense industries, it is inevitable that there should\\nbe deep resentment against the payment of work-\\npermit fees to organizations which will not extend\\nfull membership to the group affected. In the case of\\nthe Negro worker, his opposition to special unions\\nor to second-class union status is but a part of his\\nefiort to achieve full American citizenship rights.\\n\\nRO UNION RELATIONSHIPS'\\n\\nC.

The color\\nline in certain American labor unions is\\ndeeply intrenched. As early as 1834 the\\nNew Orleans Typographical Society for-\\nbade its members to work with free\\njourneymen of color? and some inter-\\nnational unions (principally in the metal\\ntrades and railroads) have denied ad-\\nmission to Negroes practically from their\\ninception.*\\n\\nThe National Labor Union was the\\nfirst national federation of labor unions\\nto deal with the race problem. At its\\ninitial session in 1866 it stated that the\\ninterests of labor demanded the inclusion\\nof all workers without regard to race or\\nnationality and that organization should\\nbe encouraged among colored people.\\nAction, however, was postponed until\\nthe next session.

Now, in its\\ncustomary definitions, it fits neither the\\nrequirements of modern theory nor the\\nhistorical pattern marked by concentra-\\ntions of power in government, labor\\ngroups, and officers of the firm.

      "['', '', 'THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PUMP-PRIMING THEORY\\n\\nCLAY J.\\n\\nN ANTICIPATION of the problems that\\nI the end of a major war brings, much\\n\\nconsideration is being given to post-\\nwar planning. A public works program,\\nwhether planned or unplanned, will\\nsurely be a part of any policy aimed at\\npostwar economic stabilization. While\\nwe are still in the planning stage, a careful\\nexamination of the development of the\\npublic works *pump-priming\" theory\\nshould be of more than usual interest.\\nThe primary purpose, therefore, of this\\nartide is to give a rather exhaus-\\ntive history of the development of\\nthis particular theory of public works\\npolicy.\\n\\nThe pump-priming theory has, in\\ngeneral, passed through three stages.\\nThe first stage was characterized by a\\nrecognition that public expenditures\\ntend to stimulate private industry and\\nthat this stimulus, once started, spreads\\nfrom industry to industry. There was no\\ncareful analysis, however, of just how\\nand to what extent public works ex-\\npenditure could be expected to stimulate\\nprivate industry. The second stage, be-\\nginning about 1930, was characterized\\nby careful attempts to describe the proc-\\ness of secondary expansion initiated in\\nprivate industry and, under certain\\nstated assumptions, to measure the mag-\\nnitude of this expansion. During the last\\nfew years there has been a growing\\nrecognition that the principle of second-\\nary effects explains only how public\\nworks expenditure may be employed to\\n*tpump\" private industry up to a certain\\nlevel. To maintain the higher level with-\\nout continuing the primary expenditure,\\nfavorable tertiary effects—i.e., induced\\n\\nANDERSON\\n\\nexpansion in private industry in addition\\nto the secondary effects—are necessary.\\n\\nI\\n\\nThe principle of resorting to govern-\\nment policy to \"prime\" private industry\\nis not new. In 1723 the colony of Pennsyl-\\nvania passed an act providing for a\\n£15,000 sterling issue of paper money to\\nremedy the \"extreme\" scarcity of money,\\nbecause of which the trade of \"this\\nprovince is greatly lessened and ob-\\nstructed.\" A large part of this new\\nmoney was to be loaned and was to be\\nsecured by mortgages on land and houses.\\nThe first issue was followed shortly by\\nanother issue of £30,0co; and, according\\nto reports of the assembly of the province\\nand of the governor, there was a notice-\\nable revival in business activity.^ Thus\\nPennsylvania attempted with somc ai-\\nleged success to revive a depressed\\neconomy by issuing paper money and\\nloaning it out for productive purposes.\\n\\nT. R. Malthus anticipated certain\\naspects of the pump-priming theory over\\na century ago. As a remedy for depressed\\nconditions such as followed the War of\\n1812 he suggested that\\nthe employment of the poor in roads and\\npublic works, and a tendency among landlords\\nand persons of property to build, to improve\\nand beautify their grounds, and to employ\\nworkmen and menial servants are the means\\nmost within our power and most directly cal-\\nculated to remedy the evils arising from that\\n\\ndisturbance in the balance of produce and con-\\nsumption.3\\n\\n* See Richard A.

Lengthy and fre-\\nquently bitter discussions have ranged\\naround policies, methods of valuation, and\\nthe desirability of various types of regula-\\ntion and ownership. The difficulty of re-\\nSolving these issues has been increased by\\nthe welter of conflicting agencies concerned.\\nThe doctrine of the yardstick was formulat-\\ned in an attempt to deal with both issues—\\nto achieve some sort of socially acceptable\\npolicy and to improve the administrative\\npicture—and it is in the light of the situation\\nthat it was designed to meet that the yard-\\nStick must be examined.\\n\\nA survey of the literature dealing with the\\nyardstick reveals two major objectives\\nwhich its proponents seem to have in mind:\\nFirst, and most obvious, the use of the yard-\\nstick as a measuring device to evaluate the\\nefficiency of public utility operations and the\\nreasonableness of prices. Second, the use of\\nthe yardstick as an administrative or en-\\nforcement device to implement the regula-\\ntory commission\\'s policies.\\n\\nVarious advocates have visualized the\\nyardstick as a measuring device from differ-\\nent points of view: for example, there is the\\nyardstick of retail rates advocated by Mr.\\nJ. A. Krug, chief power economist of the\\nT.V.A. Briefly, Mr. Krug, in arguing the\\nÍeasibility of the T.V.A. as a \"yardstick\\nplant,\" believes that it is only necessary\\nto show that the T.V.A., which is a whole-\\nsaler and distributor of power, not a re-\\ntailer, covers all costs in its pricing pol-\\nicies.

Con-\\ngressman Rankin adopts a different ap-\\nproach^ To him the question of whether or\\nnot the T.V.A. covers its costs is irrelevant\\nin determining whether T.V.A. operations\\nconstitute a fair yardstick. Illustrating his\\ncontentions by citing numerous cases of\\nprivate power companies that wholesale\\npower at prices equal to or below the rates\\nset by T.V.A., he then goes on to show that\\nthe prices set by the municipalities and co-\\noperatives which retail T.V.A. power are\\nconsiderably below the general level of rates\\nset by private power companies. With lower\\nprices and increased gross revenues the\\nmunicipalities and co-operatives are able to\\ncover all costs and to show a reasonable re-\\nturn without effective subsidies, Congress-\\nman Rankin contends. Mr. Leland Olds,\\nwitness for the T.V.A., covers the whole\\ngamut: generation, transmission, and dis-\\ntribution of electric power. Against any or\\nall of these phases of utility operations it is\\nfair to lay down the public plant\\'s opera-\\ntions as a reasonable measure of cost and\\nefficiency which the private companies ei-\\nther must meet or else show cause why they\\nare unable to do so. The multiple-purpose\\nnature of T.V.A. operations constitutes a\\ndifficulty, to be sure, but Mr. Olds visual-\\nizes the public plant as a leader in the field\\nand refuses to be bound by specific cost-\\nallocation formulas.\\n\\nIn addition to comparisons with publicly\\nowned and operated plants, there are a host.\\nof other yardsticks confined to intercom-\\npany comparisons of the operating picture of\\nprivate concerns.

The issue will be forced in the\\npost-war adjustment period, and the out-\\ncome will in no small way help to deter-\\nmine what kind of a nation ours is to be.\\n\\nFor about a hundred and fifty years\\nAmerican agricultural policy held to one\\npersistent ideal: the establishment of a\\nrural economy in which independent\\nfarmers had full and free ownership of\\ntheirland. Instead of achieving this end,\\nthe ownership of farm property slipped\\nfurther and further from the hands of op-\\nerating farmers despite a host of meas-\\nures which were used to check the trend.\\nAbout 1920 we stopped talking about the\\nownership goal for American agriculture.\\nDuring the last two decades the objec-\\ntives of farm policy have been set in\\nterms of attaining certain prices for farm\\nproducts or a certain level of farm in-\\ncomes. These goals have been achieved\\nonly to a debatable degree and for de-\\nbatable reasons. But, all the while, our\\nagriculture has continued to slide even\\nfurther away from reaching the full own-\\nership ideal.\\n\\nContrary to common assumptions, the\\nproperty ownership and the price-income\\nobjectives are by no means identical, and\\nit is therefore important to ask whether\\nthe former ideal has actually been\\nscrapped. The answer to this question\\nwill in large measure determine the fu-\\nture problems of farm policy and the\\nnature of our whole national economy.\\n\\nSALTER, JR.\\n\\nI\\n\\nOver a span of nearly a century and a\\nhalf, legislation was sought by the farm-\\ners, or sold to them, directly on the basis\\nof its contribution to the promotion of\\nthe ownership of land by the actual\\ntillers of the soil. This long campaign be-\\ngan in 1777, when, upon the recommen-\\ndation of the Continental Congress, the\\nColonial legislatures confiscated the Tory\\nestates and parceled them out to inde-\\npendent yeomen. It virtually ended in\\n1916, when the Federal Farm Loan Act\\nwas passed for the purpose of making it\\neasier for farmers to pay for their land.\\n\\nDuring this long period the whole na-\\ntion indicated its willingness to help agri-\\nculture toward the free ownership ideal.\\nAfter the Revolution the new state con-\\nstitutions specifically prohibited long-\\nterm farm leases, quit-rents, and other\\ntraces of feudal land tenure. The North-\\nwest Ordinance of 1787 banned entail\\nand primogeniture, and the nation\\nfought a civil war to abolish the last out-\\nward forms of the manorial system in the\\nSouth.\\n\\nThe entire history of the disposal of\\nthe public domain, however checkered,\\nreflects the persistent American hope of\\nassuring an independent landowning ru-\\nral citizenry.

      "['ABILITY OF THE BANKING SYSTEM TO ABSORB\\nGOVERNMENT BONDS\\n\\nJAMES\\n\\nLTHOUGH the nation has become\\nA accustomed to governmental def-\\nicit-ünancing as a result of\\ntwelve consecutive years of unbalanced\\nbudgets, the size of the prospective war-\\ntime deficits is somewhat staggering.\\nFor the nine peacetime years of the New\\nDeal, federal deficits aggregated the huge\\ntotal of $29.227 billion.! For the fiscal\\nyear ending June 3o, 1942, a deficit of\\nalmost $20 billion was realized, and for\\nthe current fiscal year a deficit of at least.\\n$50 billion is now anticipated. If this\\nlatter expectation is realized, the pro-\\nspective federal government debt on\\nJune 3o, 1943, will be somewhere in the\\nneighborhood of $125 billion.\\n\\nTo meet the $77 billion of expendi-\\ntures budgeted for the fiscal year 1943,\\nthe Treasury apparently will be required\\nto borrow some $53 billion. In general,\\nloan funds can be obtained from four\\nsources: from individuals, from non-\\nbanking corporations and institutions,\\nÍrom commercial banks, and from the\\nFederal Reserve banks. (This ignores a\\nfifth source of financing—the issuance of\\nfiat currency, which it is to be hoped the\\ngovernment will never use.) Of the $53\\nbillion to be borrowed, it is estimated\\nthat individuals will take $12 billion in\\n\\n* Covering the period July r, 1933—]une 3o,\\n1941.\\n\\n? Estimates submitted by the Budget Bureau in\\nApril, :942, indicated a prospective deficit of\\n$49.223 billion for the fiscal year ending June 3o,\\n1943.\\n\\n5 In mid-October, President Roosevelt estimated\\ntotal Treasury expenditures for the current fiscal\\nyear at slightly over $8o billion.\\n\\nc.\\n\\n23\\n\\nDOLLEY\\n\\nthe form of war savings bonds.! Endow-\\nment funds, insurance companies, sav-\\nings banks, and other nonbanking or-\\nganizations will buy another $6 billion of\\ngovernment obligations. The remaining\\n$35 billion must necessarily be absorbed\\nby the commercial banks and/or the\\nFederal Reserve banks. In all probabil-\\nity the former institutions will take\\nnearly all of this huge total.\\n\\nThis prospect naturally raises the\\nquestion as to whether it is possible for\\nthe banking system to absorb an addi-\\ntional $35 billion of government obliga-\\ntions during the current fiscal year. As of\\nJune 3o, 1942, member-banks held\\n$24.086 billion of governments.5 (Of ne-\\ncessity, the discussion from here on will\\nrelate to member-banks and the Federal\\nReserve banks only, adequate data as to\\nthe operations of nonmember banks not\\nbeing available. If anything, this means\\nthat the credit-expansion potentialities\\ndiscussed later are underestimated.) If\\nthese banks should purchase a further\\n$35 billion during the fiscal year 1943,\\ntheir total holdings would aggregate $59\\nbillion on June 3o, 1943. Under present\\nreserve provisions, is such an expansion\\n\\n^ It is reasonably apparent now that the $12 bil-\\nlion quota in war savings bonds will not be met.\\nFor the period July through November, such sales\\naggregated $4.023 billion, an average monthly rate\\nof $o.8os billion. A total sale of $9-$ro billion for\\nthe year now seems probable. On the other hand, the\\n$6 billion estimate of sales to nonbanking institu-\\ntions may well be exceeded. \"That result seems to be\\nindicated by the success of the Treasury \"tap\" bond.\\noffering in August, for which $1.26 billion in sub-\\nscriptions was received.\\n\\n5 Federal.

Some of\\nthese amendments may be wise, some fool-\\nish; but even those which are well consid-\\nered may be inconsistent with such of the\\nstatements in the original exposition as do\\nnot happen to meet the approval of the cur-\\nrent commentator.

This generalization has a high de-\\ngree of accuracy so far as pedal mathematics is concerned. The\\nexceptions are abnormal and accidental. Yet there are certain\\nessential connotations. One has a more or less particularistic vis-\\nualization of human legs paired—distinguishable from all other\\ntwo-legged beings.
