This type of economic organization has been called forth\\nby the doctrine of total war. Besides the traditional use of the military proper, total war\\nembraces two new weapons: psychological and economic warfare. In the economics of the\\nmilitary state there is no distinct line of demarcation which separates war from peace.\\nWar is no longer regarded as a passing stage of abnormality to be replaced in short by\\nnormal conditions of peace; and war economics is no longer a special branch of public\\nfinance but penetrates the whole of economic science.\\n\\nIn the economics of the military state, there is no unused capacity, industrial or other-\\nwise, since all resources are placed in the service of war preparation and war. The profit\\nmotive is retained, but is subject to important modifications. Private initiative, inasmuch\\nas it is recognized and allowed to emerge, is vested with the function of serving the\\neconomics of the military state. Depletion of the stock of accumulated wealth, as a source\\nof current consumption, is coórdinated with current production, the other source. The\\ntraditional concept of normalcy with its excess of national income produced over national\\nincome consumed is abandoned.\\n\\nEvolution of War Economics in Recent German Literature\\n\\nThe intensive occupation with the economic aspects of war preparation\\nand warfare which started in Germany with the advent of the Hitler\\nregime has resulted in a stupendous volume of literary output in the course\\nof the years. Research institutes and university chairs for the investigation\\nand propagation of war economics were established by the authorities, who\\nalso assumed financial responsibility for the printing and publishing of\\nnumerous treatises and monographs on war economics. All this is re-\\nmarkably different from the situation in 1914 when Werner Sombart spoke\\nof the economists as follows: \"W\\'e had nothing to give that could have\\nbeen of direct service to the great cause. Nothing has become more clear\\nin our minds than this: our coóperation was not needed in any respect.\"\\nCorrespondingly it is said now that \"economic science cannot be acquitted\\nof the grave guilt of insufficient preparation for the [first] World War.\"?\\n\\n\"Though attempts have been made to appraise nazi economic policies\\nas the result and outcome of German economic development within the\\nimmediate and more remote past, it does not seem possible to regard\\n\\n!NV.

The first, approved June 25,\\nwas a series of amendments hastily thrown together in what was then thought to be the\\nclosing days of the congressional session. This Act (1) reduced the amounts of personal\\nexemptions, (2) increased by about 10 per cent individual and corporation income taxes,\\n(3) increased surtax rates in the middle brackets and (4) increased most excises.\\n\\nThe Second Revenue act of 1940, applicable to corporations only, has three important\\nfeatures: (1) it levies a special tax on the excess profits of corporations; (2) it suspends\\nduring the life of the excess profits tax the Vinson-Trammell act designed to limit profits\\nfrom naval, airplane and other defense contracts; and (3) it permits accelerated (five-year)\\namortization of the cost of certain facilities necessary for national defense. The Act also\\nprovides for those in military and naval services a new system of life insurance and credit\\non annuities under the Railroad Retirement acts. An amendment is made to the Social\\nSecurity act for employers who had not received credit for contributions to state funds\\nbecause they were late.\\n\\n\"The first Act is expected to augment revenues by $729,000,000 for the fiscal year 1941,\\nand by about $1,000,000,000 in a full year of operation. The second is expected to increase\\nrevenues still further by about $500,000,000 in the calendar year 1941, and by $900,000,000\\nto $1,000,000,000 when the defense program becomes fully operative.\\n\\nThe Fiscal Situation\\n\\nNo year since the World War has seen such changes in the federal fiscal\\npicture as 1940. In January the President estimated that the deficit for the\\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1941, would be $2,876,000,000. His estimate\\nfor national defense expenditure for 1941 was about $1,940,000,000. This\\nsum was only a fraction of the amount soon deemed necessary as he saw\\nthe German army overrun country after country in Western Europe. A\\nrevised estimate in June was for $3,250,000,000 defense expenditures; in\\nAugust for $5,000,000,000. Total expenditures for 1941 were estimated in\\nAugust at $12,000,000,000 in contrast to $8,000,000,000 in January. These\\namounts do not tell the full story. Congress was asked to appropriate in-\\ncreasingly huge sums for defense, not all of which could be expended in\\nthe current fiscal year. Exclusive of the cost of enforcing the acts for com-\\npulsory military training and putting the National Guard into active mili-\\ntary service, Congress had appropriated over $14,000,000,000 for defense\\npurposes by August 5, 1940.\\n\\nEven in May before the situation in Europe became so bad, and while\\ndefense appropriations were comparatively small, Secretary Morgenthau\\nbecame concerned over the $45 billion debt limit. At that time the work-\\ning balance was $1,3500,000,000, a sum the Secretary thought unwise to re-\\nduce. Although the President had suggested additional tax revenues ot\\n$460,000,000 in his January message, Congress ignored the request, and\\n\\n\\'Preceding federal revenue acts passed since the adoption of the Sixteenth (Income\\nTax) amendment to the Constitution have been discussed in earlier volumes of the\\nAmerican.

This situation arises where excess capacity coincides with inability of\\nproducers to control production and prices. The experience of the cotton textile industry\\nsupports the view that cutthroat competition tends in time to correct itself. (The excess ca-\\npacity which developed in this industry around 1923 was substantially eliminated by 1937.\\nUnder certain conditions, however, it is quite possible for cutthroat competition to continue\\nindefinitely. This possibility arises chiefly from the imperfection of the labor market.\\n', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'I\\n\\nEconomists have long maintained that free competition tends to promote\\neconomic efficiency. Business-men, however, have remained singularly un-\\nconvinced. In trade journals and at manufacturers conventions competition\\nis termed \"ruinous,\" \"unethical,\" \"cutthroat,\" \"destructive.\" The control\\nof competition through patents, tariffs, mergers, trade associations and in-\\nformal agreements has been a major objective of business policy.\\n\\nThe competitive practices condemned by business-men are of two quite\\nseparate types, which should be clearly distinguished. Cutthroat competition\\nsometimes refers to false advertising, adulteration of goods, commercial\\nbribery, defamation of competitors, and similar fraudulent practices. It\\nwould be generally agreed that such practices are undesirable, and they\\ntherefore raise no major question of public policy.\\n\\nSecond, and perhaps more commonly, cutthroat competition refers to\\nacts which tend directly or indirectly to lower the existing price structure.\\nIt can scarcely be argued, however, that price reductions are always un-\\njustified. A price cut which reflects a reduction in raw material costs or an\\nimprovement in manufacturing technique is clearly reasonable. Under what\\nconditions, then, does price cutting become cutthroat?\\n\\nMost of those who denounce price cutting are rather vague on this point.\\nEmphasis on the zofivation of producers is reflected in such terms as\\n\"chiseler,\" \"unfair,\" \"unethical.\" In other cases certain /ecbziques of price\\nreduction, such as secret rebates or fictitious advertising allowances, are\\ncondemned. Neither of these criteria, however, provides a satisfactory\\nbasis for distinguishing cutthroat competition from competition in general.\\nIt does not matter very much what a price concession is called— \"rebate,\"\\n\"allowance,\" \"discount,\" or plain \"cut.\" The important thing is that prices\\nhave been reduced.

Most goods are sold at a wide variety of prices, which are not necessarily changed\\nsimultaneously or proportionately.

(1) In the late 1920's many deposits were withdrawn for\\nthe purchase of stocks and other investments. During the 1930's, as a rule, deposits were\\nnot used for current spending on consumption to the extent commonly supposed. In one\\ndepressed area, however, spending and unemployment were the main reasons for with-\\ndrawal. (2) The activity of savings deposits is marked by sharp seasonal fluctuations, but\\nthe annual rate of turnover is more stable than that for demand deposits. Medium-sized\\nbalances ($400-800) are the most active. (3) The data indicate that over 40 per cent of\\naccounts are closed before becoming a year old. Older and larger accounts, however, make\\nup a large part of total deposits. (4) These data emphasize the need for a time period in the\\ndefinition of savings, since many deposits are used for non-current spending. The use of\\nsavings deposits as investments, however, seems to be increasing.\\n\\nIn this paper certain characteristics of the deposits in the mutual savings\\nbanks of New York State are considered. The purpose of the investigation\\nis to acquire a clearer notion of the nature of savings deposits. The prin-\\ncipal characteristics considered are the uses of saved funds, and the activity\\nand age of accounts. For the most part, data concerning these questions\\nare not obtainable for all banks, but it happens that internal studies made\\nby a few of the banks in the state are pertinent to this inquiry, and are be-\\nlieved to be representative of other banks.

Uses of Savings Deposits\\n\\nIt is virtually impossible to determine accurately the reasons for savings-\\nbank withdrawals. This is so because deposits usually are withdrawn in\\ncash, which cannot be traced. Sometimes, however, withdrawals take the\\nform of checks drawn by the savings banks on depository commercial banks,\\nespecially when the amounts are large, and the endorsements on these\\nchecks provide clues to the uses of the money. Several individual banks\\nmade studies of these endorsements covering short periods of the late\\n1920's in order to discover to what extent deposits were being used for\\nstock purchases. These studies showed quite conclusively that savings de-\\nposits were attracted in large amounts to the stock market or to invest-\\nment in mortgage certificates and other securities.\\n\\nOne bank, for example, discovered that in January, 1929, 24 per cent of\\nthe withdrawals by check were used to purchase stocks and bonds, while\\n40 per cent went into real estate or mortgages.

      "['', '', '', 'A REÉXAMINATION OF THE CLASSICAL THEORY\\nOF INFLATION\\n\\nAn adequate analysis of the classical theory of inflation cannot afford to neglect the\\nfollowing points: (a) The structure of economic society, more particularly of industrial\\nproduction, was not fully integrated by the turn of the eighteenth century. (b) The general\\neconomic theory formulated at that time concentrated on the problem of production in ac-\\ncordance with the concrete major problem of its time. (c) The \"received doctrine\" con-\\ncerning money had been formulated under mercantile conditions based on a manufactural\\nand not an industrial mode of production. (d) The general circumstances occasioned by\\nthe jerkingly proceeding industrial expansion, enhanced by the specific conditions of the\\nAnglo-French wars, resulted in an apparently general rise of prices.\\n\\nAs to the functional value of a theory developed on this basis and proposed to be ap-\\nplied to the solution of modern monetary problems, we have to recognize that: (a) The\\nanalysis of this rise of prices was carried on with the help of a scientific method which did\\nnot and could not include a concept of qualitative change. Quite the contrary, \"received\\ndoctrine\" as well as the outward appearance of the economic process seemed to suggest a\\nmerely quantitative expansion without any fundamental qualitative change in the structure\\nof production. (b) The result of such an attitude toward the phenomenon of rising prices\\nwas to conceive of them as deviations from an otherwise static condition. (c) Such theoretical\\nposition did not prove fatal for 1bat time for the reason that the actual though temporary\\neconomic conditions tended to obscure the imminent structural change indicated in the rise of\\nprices.\\n\\n\"The classical theory of inflation expressed thus the phenomenal coincidence of a specific\\nhistorical period. It has to be understood as a \"special case\" in doctrine formation created\\nby and applicable to a special historical situation only.\\n\\nBy the end of the eighteenth century the industrial type of producing\\ncommodities had become prevalent, bringing in its wake a development of\\nregular interrelationships between the various producers and consumers.\\nAdam Smith, in his discussion of the division of labor, has given an\\nadequate picture of that society.\\n\\n\"There is little doubt that the theory of money would have retained its\\nposition of secondary importance in the general economic theory of that\\nperiod if it had not been for the occurrence of particularly striking events\\nwhich forced the political and economic strategists to concern themselves\\nparticularly with disentangling the apparently highly important flux of\\nmoney. One extraordinary event was the French Revolution, which to the\\nEnglish merchants produced an economic-political threat of first im-\\nportance. There was a definite connection between the Revolution in France\\nand the conditions in England. In the treatises on money, concerned with\\nthe doctrines elaborated in this period, it has always been emphasized that\\nthe military expenditures during this time were of an ex/raordinary nature.\\nThere is a curious neglect of the difficulties which arose out of the structural\\ntransformation which took place in England quite irrespective of the foreign\\nwars.

Nowhere are these\\nchanges so clearly reflected as in the treaties of commerce which have been negotiated\\nduring the past eight years. Since these treaties are the legal embodiment of one aspect of\\neconomic foreign policy, they represent a complex structure of contractual obligations\\nwherein various national interests in the sphere of economic life find expression. For an\\naccurate analysis of recent commercial policy, an examination of the tendencies, established\\npractices, and methods exhibited in the binding agreements entered into by nations is\\nessential. Here the use of the most-favored-nation clause, quotas, exchange controls, barter\\nagreements, tariffs, bilateralism, and other devices of trade policy, the frequency of their\\nappearance, and their content and scope, can be studied with a view to determining more\\nprecisely the nature of the above-mentioned changes.\\n\\nI\\n\\nThe subsequent data are based upon a study of over 510 bilateral con-\\nventions, treaties, and exchanges of notes between states for the period\\n1931-1939. This group is broken down by means of the accompanying\\ntable into various cross-classifications, by topics and kinds of provisions,\\nand certain conclusions will be drawn from the number of treaties in each\\ncategory. Provisions which are characteristic of the new trend in commercial\\npolicy will be examined in detail, and further general conclusions as to\\nthe effect of the new regime upon international trade relations will be indi-\\ncated.\\n\\nEven though this group is not exhaustive, it represents approximately\\ntwice as many negotiations of a similar nature as are recorded for the\\nwhole era from 1919 to 1930. One effect of the unsettled economic rela-\\ntions of the last decade has been to necessitate many and frequent agree-\\nments on trade and commerce. Of the 510 agreements, 137 were modifica-\\ntions of existing treaties. These modifications were not only changes within\\nthe broad pattern of agreements already in force; they also entailed altera-\\ntions of a more fundamental nature.\\n\\nAs can be seen from Table I, when the total is broken down into com-\\nponent figures representing the several types of provisions found in this\\ngroup of treaties, as well as the geographic distribution of agreements con-\\ntaining these provisions, some noteworthy facts emerge. But a caveat should\\nbe entered at once against interpreting the table too literally. Aside from\\nthe qualifications set forth in the explanation which accompanies the table,\\nand which must be considered in any interpretations drawn therefrom, the\\ndata summarized should be interpreted as providing evidence on the char-\\nacter and content of recent commercial-treaty policies.

The trend of the employers compliance\\nwith the Act is inferred from the yearly total number of disputes over \"unfair labor prac-\\ntices.\" The number of organization strikes in disputes under the Board\\'s jurisdiction in\\ncomparison to those not under the Board\\'s jurisdiction is used as additional indicator\\nof the effectiveness of the Act.\\n\\nThese several indices are calculated as nearly as the published records allow, and\\ngraphically represented.\\n\\nThe picture of the development so obtained is regarded as promising. Labor is coming\\nto settle disputes over \"unfair labor practices\" increasingly through the NLRB rather\\nthan through strikes; the ratio of strike-complaint to pure complaint cases is beginning to\\ndiminish, and organization strikes in disputes under the Board\\'s jurisdiction are diminish-\\ning faster than those not under the Board\\'s jurisdiction.

Indeed, the Labor Relations act expresses the conviction that\\nsuch will be the results of established collective bargaining:\\n\\nExperience has proved that protection by law of the right to organize and to\\nbargain collectively safeguards commerce from injury, impairment or interrup-\\ntion, and promotes the flow of commerce by removing certain recognized sources\\n\\n\\' Totalitarian states, on the other hand, have found governmentally controlled common\\norganizations of workers and employers better suited to their political and economic sys-\\ntems. The fact that trade unionism in the United States has come to be made govern-\\nmentally enforceable might perhaps raise the question in one\\'s mind as to the continued\\n\"liberalistic\" character of this institution.\\n', 'This content downloaded from\\n137.158.158.62 on Wed, 19 Jan 2022 04:06:45 UTC\\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n']\n",

By analyzing the former we may explain the\\nweaknesses of the latter.\\n\\nThe law makes certain rather obvious \"economic\" assumptions which are inapplicable to\\nthe modern economy. But the most important—and most fallacious—assumption is its in-\\ndividualistic conception of the process of invention. In fact, invention is a group process, the\\nindividual contributions being relatively minor. In modern industrial research this is par-\\nticularly so.\\n\\nA grant of separate proprietary rights over each inventive contribution thus imposes bar-\\nriers to further innovation and reduction to practice of the whole. The economic system has\\nhad to remove these barriers. But this has involved the creation of large patent pools, with\\nconsequent dangers of injustice, and monopoly.\\n\\nIn addition, the confusion entailed by the application of the single patent to modern tech-\\nnology has offered to the powerful legal methods of unfair competition. The result is often\\ninjustice, perpetual legal monopoly over whole industries, and the danger, at least, of tech-\\nnological retardation.\\n\\nThe patent law is not the same thing as the patent system. Our legal\\nmethod of fostering technological advance is an ancient structure, almost\\nthe same, basically and in detail, as it was three hundred years ago. But\\nthe economic institutions which have grown up around this venerable\\nlegal framework have so radically changed that it is difficult to believe\\nthat the same law could possibly apply in the manner originally intended to\\nthe new situation. In fact it does not. Economic change, motivated by the\\ndynamic quest for profit, can use law, modify it, or ignore it. The resultant\\nsystem may be more or less socially beneficent, more or less effective in ac-\\ncomplishing its original purpose; in any event it will be different from that\\noriginally contemplated by the unchanged legal prescriptions.\\n\\nThis paper does not attempt thoroughly to describe or evaluate the op-\\neration of the patent 5j5/em. Its major interest is rather in the theory of the\\npatent /aw. Law is society\\'s means of conscious control. Because it is basic\\nin the sense that economic institutions must develop within or about it, we\\nmust understand the law before we can understand and evaluate the eco-\\nnomic adaptations and the resultant synthesis. Insight into the problems\\nof our present patent system may therefore be gained through analysis and\\nevaluation of the preconceptions and rationale of the patent law, particu-\\nlarly in the light of the major economic changes which have occurred since\\nits conception.\\n', 'This content downloaded from\\n137.158.158.62 on Wed, 19 Jan 2022 03:38:38 UTC\\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n']\n",

This may be true for net investment but it is not obvious for reinvestment. Unless\\nit is true for both net investment and reinvestment, there does not exist an unequivocal\\nguide for policy. À change in the rate of interest operates on reinvestment by bringing\\nnearer or postponing the abandonment and premature abandonment of existing capital.\\nAn increase in the interest rate tends to increase in general the abandonment of existing\\ncapital and also the premature abandonment of those capital goods which are to be re-\\nplaced by goods of intermediate durability. But though the decision to abandon is hastened\\nby the increase in the interest rate, this does not automatically swell the flow of reinvest-\\nment. It may or may not. This, however, introduces a range of indeterminacy in the effect\\nof a change in the interest rate on the flow of total investment which calls for further\\nstudy.\\n\\n1l. It is the purpose of this paper to examine briefly the problem of the\\nrelationship between the flow of reinvestment and the rate of interest.\\nApparently it is tacitly assumed that reinvestment responds to a change in\\nthe rate of interest in the same way as net investment, or at least does not\\nbehave in such a way as to offset the effect of such a change on net invest-\\nment.! Now, the classical position on the relationship between the rate of\\ninvestment and the rate of interest may be expressed in the words\\nof Keynes: \". . . if there is an increased investment in any given type of\\ncapital during any period of time, the marginal efficiency of that type of capi-\\ntal will diminish as the investment in it is increased . . . the rate of invest-\\nment will be pushed to the point on the investment demand-schedule\\nwhere the marginal efficiency of capital in general is equal to the market\\nrate of interest.\"? This implies that a rise (or fall) in the rate of interest,\\ncel. par., will decrease (or increase) the rate of investment; and in an\\neconomy which is consuming its capital, this change in the interest rate will\\nincrease (or decrease) the rate of capital consumption. But the rate of\\ninvestment may be taken either gros; or nel, 7.e., with or without the rate\\nof reinvestment.? The rate of reinvestment can be further subdivided into\\ntwo rates, viz., the rate of reinvestment which arises from replacing exist-\\ning machines with new ones of the same kind, and that which arises from\\ntransferring over to new machines of a different kind.

Mexico\\'s share in our imports, since\\nthe expropriations of March, 1938, has fallen drastically as a result of the boycott of\\nMexican oil by American companies. The selection in this manner of a base period during\\nwhich special conditions were unfavorable to imports from Mexico is contrary to the\\nprinciple insisted upon by the United States in the negotiation of trade agreements with\\nforeign countries. This action weakens the bargaining position of the United States and\\njeopardizes the principle of equal treatment embodied in the trade agreements program.\\n\\nBilateralism in international trade has put a severe strain on the \"most-\\nfavored-nation\" policy, once accepted in principle by all great trading na-\\ntions. Today the United States is almost alone in its practice of a commercial\\npolicy aimed at extending the application of the principle to all phases of\\ntrade regulation. Other countries hold that the most-favored-nation prin-\\nciple is limited to tariff treatment, and does not apply to the newer direct\\ncontrols. But we insist that equality of treatment must be extended to quotas\\nand exchange controls also, otherwise the new devices will nullify equal\\ntreatment in tariff rates. Consequently we have insisted that our exporters\\nreceive a share in all foreign import quotas proportional to tbeir sbare in\\ntbe imports for a previous \"representative period.\" \\'This formula as incor-\\nporated in the Hull trade agreements refers to customs quotas, which limit\\nimports at special tariff rates, as well as to quotas which establish an abso-\\nlute limit to imports.\\n\\nUsually it is the United States which insists upon the principle in order\\nto get a \"fair\" share in someone else\\'s quota, but there are several instances\\nin which we ourselves have established customs quotas in connection with\\ntariff reductions niade in trade agreements.

The influence of these agencies on\\ninterest rates is discussed, followed by an analysis of the justification of the existing rate\\nlevel.

It is\\ncommonly assumed that, with the correction of the existing abnormalities,\\ninterest rates will inevitably be adjusted.

(See Supplement, March, 1940, p. 227.)\\n\\nIn manufacturing industries and in bituminous coal mining, wage rates since 1933\\nhave been greatly increased and hours of work have been substantially reduced. Proponents\\nof these changes have insisted that such wage and hour policies would increase total pur-\\nchasing power and increase employment. The evidence presented below does not sub-\\nstantiate these claims. In fact, employment in bituminous coal mining was lower in 1937\\nthan in 1929 when production was not so great, and employment in 87 manufacturing\\nindustries was slightly lower in 1939 than in 1929 when production was about the same.\\nIn bituminous coal mining and in manufacturing industries money payrolls were about\\n10 per cent below those of 1929, although, owing to a decline in the cost of living, real\\npayrolls were higher than in 1929.\\n\\nA more detailed study of bituminous coal mining shows the changes in per capita in-\\ncome, employee productivity, mechanization, costs, and sales income that were associated\\nwith increases in wage rates and decreases in hours that were introduced beginning in 1934.\\n\\nThere is no one wage and hour policy to which all unions subscribe.\\nGenerally speaking, unions like most employers sell their product at the\\nbest price and under the best conditions that they can obtain. What price\\nthey can command depends on many factors. In the short run if the in-\\ndustry is a profitable one, as for example petroleum refining and automobile\\nmanufacturing, and if the union has substantial bargaining power and its\\nleadership is able and aggressive, relatively high wages and short hours\\nof work may be attained. On the other hand, if the industry is faced with\\nruinous competition and overdevelopment, as for example in cotton and\\ncertain other textile industries, particularly if the scope of union organization\\nis not industry-wide, the workers will have to content themselves with\\nrelatively ow annual earnings and with relatively long hours.\\n\\nOther factors which affect wage and hour levels are (1) the character\\nof the demand for the product, that is, whether the demand is elastic or\\ninelastic, (2) the proportion that labor costs constitute of the total cost\\nof production, (3) the economic organization and financial structure of\\nthe industry, (4) competition from substitute products, (5) general busi-\\nness conditions, and (6) the relation of capacity to demand. Because of the\\noperation of these factors, wage and hour levels and policies vary by regions,\\nmarkets, industries, and often establishments.\\n\\nIn a number of industries, unions, like employers in numerous instances,\\nhave successfully maintained the price of their product during periods of\\ndrastic deflation. In the anthracite industry, for example, the union has not\\ntaken a single wage reduction since the Award of the Anthracite Strike\\nCommission of 1903 and in the building and construction industry it is not\\nuncommon for organized crafts to retain their nominal wage rates during\\nperiods of depression.

In case of bank\\ncredit, the real lenders are the depositors including, notably, the recipients of checks.\\nIt is these whose convenience waiting is combined and coórdinated by the banks and made\\navailable to borrowers who pay for free banking service to depositors. The 100 per cent\\nreserve scheme would make this free service impossible unless subsidized and might con-\\nceivably bring disappearance of deposit banking. Subsidization objected to; perpetual\\ngovernment debt as means to idea of 100 per cent objected to. Why precisely 100 per cent?\\nA sacred number? Possible resulting growth of new type of financial institution through\\nwhich we could still get deflation. Why henceforth deprive depositors of possibility of\\nfree banking service?\\n\\nA number of economists who favor a managed currency, with the idea of\\npromoting stabilization of the general level of prices, have accepted—a little\\ntoo uncritically, I think—the idea of 100 per cent reserves. Objections\\nwhich I cannot but believe have some importance, seem to have been gen-\\nerally overlooked.\\n\\nOne of the principal features of commercial banking, as we know it\\ntoday, is free service to depositors, whereby business can be carried on by\\ncheck and the clerical work of transferring credits from the makers of\\nchecks to the depositors of checks is done without fee—though the depres-\\nsion has brought in, to some extent, the service charge. It is because the\\nbanks have been able to \"lend more than they have,\" because, in short,\\nthey have not been compelled to maintain a 100 per cent reserve, that they\\nhave been able to render this service to depositors without charge.\\n\\nOf course the banks do not really lend more than they have, except as\\nintermediaries or agents for the real lenders. What the banks do is to\\nbring borrowers and lenders together. And the lenders are the bank de-\\npositors. Let us suppose the banks to lend, in the aggregate, several times\\nas much money as they have on hand. The borrowing accomplishes nothing\\nfor those who receive the deposits until they use their newly acquired credit\\nfor the purchase of goods, by writing checks on this credit. When they\\nhave done this, they no longer have claims on the lending banks. But the\\nrecipients of their checks have these claims. Clearly, the banks could not\\nthus lend more than they have on hand and have the lending mean any-\\nthing, if the recipients of the checks drawn on this credit were, every one\\nof them, to insist at once upon taking the money out of the banks. I/ ir\\nIhe recipients of tbe checks, therefore, wbo are really the lenders. They\\nhave given up tangible goods or services and are waiting for payment. For\\nthe checks they have received are but claims on the banks. And the recipients\\nof these checks are still but claimants on the banks after the checks have\\nbeen turned in, until they have actually drawn out the money owed to them\\nor until they have, in their turn, made purchases and passed to others\\nthe claims they hold on the banks. These others then become the claimants\\non the banks.

This is true particularly with\\nrespect to the relative variability of the several items of cost. When the four main divisions\\nof expense for the Class I railroads are compared with the variations in traffic volume\\nover the period from 1922 to 1938, it is found that the items which vary most closely\\nwith traffic are actually those which have commonly been presented as comprising the\\nlargest \"constant\" components (and conversely).\\n\\nThis failure of the facts to support the common pronouncements results from the im-\\nplicit assumption of standards which are essentially rigid. This assumption, and the pro-\\nnouncements based upon it, do not hold for periods longer than approximately a month.\\nWhen considered over a longer period the variable element in all operating costs stands\\nout as the dominant characteristic. This has some significance in connection with the\\ndoctrine of increasing returns; for the extent to which costs are variable directly affects\\nthe increase in returns, as the volume of traffic increases.\\n\\nThe point has been made frequently that fixed or constant costs absorb\\nan abnormally large portion of the income of a railroad. The term \"con-\\nstant costs,\" as used here, refers to those elements in the expenses of a\\nrailroad which are essentially independent of, or not functionally related\\nto, the volume of business handled. This constant characteristic has been\\npointed out particularly with respect to maintenance expenditures, and\\ngeneral expenses. Ripley has said \". . . only about two-thirds of the total\\nexpenditures of a railroad are applied to operation, the remaining third\\nbeing devoted to capital account. Moreover, of these two-thirds of the\\ntotal applied to operating outlay, only about one-half responds to azy\\nchange in the tonnage, the other half being constant up to a certain\\npoint.\"* What this point is Ripley does not say. He admits that the state-\\nment implies a given standard of service, and maintenance, as well as a\\ngiven stage of technological development, but apparently does not consider\\nit necessary to develop the point. That the \"constant costs\" grow with\\nthe growth of traffic over a period of years, however, is implicit in his con-\\ntention that they remain about two-thirds of the total.\\n\\nThe use of the term \"constant\" in referring to any costs is dangerous\\nbecause it suggests an invariability which does not exist, even for relatively\\nshort periods. Moreover, no costs are altogether independent of the volume\\nof business. Given a certain volume of business, on the average, for a\\nperiod of time, then certain expenditures will be made whether that volume\\nof business is moving at the moment or not. But in any business the cost\\nof production is affected by variations in the volume of product; and this\\nis true for a// costs when the variations are large, or extended over a con-\\nsiderable period of time. Railroads are not essentially different from other\\nenterprises in this respect.\\n\\nThe difference in variability among the several elements of cost is\\nessentially relative. The relation of costs to the volume of traffic may be\\neither direct or indirect. This more accurately states the difference between\\n\\n!W. Z. Ripley, Railroads, Rates and.

Such questions are not isolated, but fit into a pattern\\nof development which will be different for different teachers. The teacher is not so much\\nan advocate of views as he is a reporter on observations. The honest teacher makes himself\\nthe ally of history as he understands it; believing that after all economics is an art rather\\nthan a science, he necessarily makes room for deliberate social purpose. The usefulness of\\nquantitative methods should not blind us to the essentially qualitative character of the\\nsubject. Every great teacher of political economy had a thesis. Those who refused to take\\na position added little to thought or action, and are forgotten, \"Indoctrination\" does not\\nimply neglect to explore and to refute. It means simply scrupulous inspection plus earnest\\nrecommendation.\\n\\nIn political economy, over a period, principle derives from practice, and\\nnot the other way round. Sanction follows social convenience. Evolution in\\ndoing compels evolution in doctrine. This does not mean that local and\\ntemporary and partisan interest can immediately alter received rules. And\\nwhere there is a wider and more permanent change of advantage, there is\\nstill the celebrated lag which makes for gradual warping rather than sudden\\nabandonment of old theorems. It is commonplace that a minority equipped\\nwith control of the social means of production may for long keep law and\\nmorals on its side. But in the economist\\'s beloved \"long run\" we learn by\\nliving, and do not live by learning.\\n\\nThis is lesson number 1 in the teaching of political economy. Unless one\\nrecognizes that in economic life there is no absolute, and that trends in\\nthought follow trends in performance, he is not attempting to study social\\nbehavior but is trying to define a theology. Writings reduced to something\\nlike system the elaborate opportunism which went by the name of mercantil-\\nism. After these coercive public policies had been eaten into by private\\ninitiative, the Jaissez faire philosophy was seized upon eagerly because it\\njustifed what was already familiar conduct. And now that individualist\\nenterprise has grown out of all anticipated proportions, and thus taken on,\\ninevitably, the collectivist character, the propriety of public control is again\\nurged. This is historical development, with the unexpected becoming, after\\na time, orthodox.\\n\\nThere have been variants, of course, within the larger cycle. Consider the\\ndissent from classical doctrine inspired by American geographical and eco-\\nnomic conditions at the beginning of the last century. Here was a country\\nnot of decreasing but of increasing returns, in which accessions to popula-\\ntion meant not resort to poorer natural resources but to richer, with the con-\\nsequence of a larger product for each worker.

      "['Problems in the Teaching of Economics\\n\\nAt the last annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Phila-\\ndelphia, one afternoon session was devoted to \"Problems in the Teaching of\\nEconomics.\" Here, one of the speakers proposed that students should be encour-\\naged to spend a year or two out in the business world before coming to college\\nto begin the study of economics. Here, also, another speaker vigorously con-\\ndemned the practice of those teachers who appealed to publishers for revised\\nelementary economic texts that would include the more recent laws and facts\\nrelative to our economy. He, himself, had not earlier envisioned such reforms of\\nhis own text that would make up for the lack of inertia on the part of teachers.\\n\\nNow it may be true that students would better comprehend many economic\\nrelationships following upon a year or two of employment. The same could be\\nsaid about other subjects in the curriculum that the student would pursue upon\\nhis return. Such a proposal for revision in the teaching of elementary economics\\nhas little significance to the more essential nature of the problem involving the\\nbest presentation of the subject matter under the currently accepted assignment\\nfor the teaching of economics in a college education of four years. However\\nmuch the study of economics helps to develop a realistic understanding of Ameri-\\ncan economic life, this can and should be accomplished with an adequate explana-\\ntion of the economic laws and principles that govern it in the course of which\\nthe rich but disorganized personal experience of students can be drawn upon.\\n\\nIn re the charge made in no uncertain terms against teachers of elementary\\neconomics, this much can be said. Academic advancements for the teacher, upon\\nwhich increments in salary are made to depend, flow from \"productive research.\"\\nBecause of academic preoccupations herein, little vital contact is made with the\\nbroader aspect of supplementary pedagogical devices. Teachers have come to de-\\npend upon the list of such devices customarily included in introductory economic\\ntexts. These have taken the shape of bibliographical aids, summaries of conclu-\\nsions and lists of test questions that depart more or less successfully from the\\ncatechetical order. That the clamor for revision carries with it the hope that the\\nnew text will, to all intents and purposes, perform the teaching task in and of\\nitself, is not hard to envisage under the circumstances.\\n\\nPerhaps it can be said that other sessions at this conference meeting were of a\\nmore informative nature to a host of people. But from my knowledge of the reac-\\ntions of others thereto, this thesis would be hard to sustain. Yet, assembled in a\\nsmall room, grossly inadequate for the numbers who thronged the entrances,\\nwas this group of teachers anxiously concerned with the topics under discussion.\\nMany would willingly have voiced their reaction to the contention of the speak-\\ners, if time had not been called. And when the motion was made to petition for a\\nsimilar session at the next annual meeting (after a lapse of three years since the\\nlast of this kind was convened) it was readily carried.

The\\nauthors summarize their conclusion in the following words: \"It may be inferred\\nthat a majority of the Supreme Court now looks with favor upon the use of\\nhistorical cost as the rate-base. No other conclusion is possible in view of the\\nfact that the California Commission in this latest case expressly declared its\\nadherence to historical cost and that it flatly refused to give any consideration to\\nreproduction cost. . . . It seems rather clear that if the reasoning in this case is\\nconsistently followed, there will be few, if any, occasions on which a rate order\\nbased upon historical cost will be disturbed by the Supreme Court.\"? Since this\\ncondusion might be taken to mean that the Supreme Court is at last ready to\\nplace its stamp of approval upon the use of historical or original cost in confisca-\\ntion cases, the discussion of this important decision should be carried a step\\nfurther.\\n\\nThe question before the Court was not one of confiscation, but of procedure.\\n\"As the District Court did not deal with the issue of confiscation and the\\nevidence is not before us, we are concerned only with the question of procedural\\ndue process, that is, whether the Commission in its procedure, as distinguished\\nfrom the effect of its order upon respondent\\'s property rights, failed to satisfy the\\nrequirements of the Federal Constitution.\" And the particular procedural point\\nin dispute related to the method by which the California Commission arrived at\\nits result. The Commission had considered evidence as to cost of reproduction,\\nbut in fixing the rate base it had given weight and effect solely to historical cost.\\nThe precise issue was whether the refusal of the Commission to give weight to the\\ncost of reproduction constituted a denial of procedural due process of law.\\n\\nThe Court held that the procedure of the Commission did not deny the com-\\npany due process. It found that the Commission had duly weighed the evidence\\nas to reproduction cost, and had cast it aside as unsatisfactory; but that it had\\nnevertheless based its valuation upon ample evidence. \"The Commission was\\nentitled to weigh the evidence introduced, whether relating to reproduction cost\\nor to other matters. The Commission was entitled to determine the probative\\nforce of respondent\\'s estimate. That the Commission did so is apparent from\\nboth its statement to that effect and the reasons it gives for considering these\\nestimates to be without positive value. . . . Nor did the ruling with respect to the\\nweight of evidence as to reproduction cost leave the Commission without\\nevidence of the value of respondent\\'s property. We have frequently held that\\nhistorical cost is admissible evidence of value. . . . In the instant case we cannot\\nsay that the Commission in taking historical cost as the rate base was making a\\nfinding without evidence and therefore arbitrary.\"\\n\\nIn other words, this decision only reiterates a well established principle of pro-\\ncedure—namely, that it is essential to examine and give appropriate weight to all\\npertinent evidence of value, so that a decision will not be arbitrary.

The attempt to maintain a fixed price for any com-\\nmodity which may rise, but not fall, in money value, is, in the long run, all but hopeless.\\nImportant paper currencies were stronger than the gold currencies so long as they were\\nkept flexible in gold value but they became at least as vulnerable as any gold currency\\nwhen a relative fixity of exchange rates was sought and, still more, when a rise in their\\ngold value was precluded and a fall regarded with equanimity or deliberately designed. A\\nflexible exchange value of a currency, within a not very narrow zone around the \"point of\\nequilibrium,\" is essential to forestal] the success of bear speculators and defeat of the\\nexchange policy. The vulnerability of a currency to speculative attacks is coeval with other\\nweaknesses in any currencies yet adopted. A money with a goods, rather than a gold, reserve\\noffers the greatest promise not only of invulnerability but also benefaction.\\n\\nThe international gold standard has now, for some years, been moribund,\\nif not dead. It is true that the United States, in somewhat unconvincing\\nfashion, still proclaims its adhesion and allegiance to the royal metal. So\\nfar, however, as money is concerned, it is in no better state than China used\\nto be when it had a metallic monetary standard (silver), of equal virtue\\nwith gold, maintained in isolation from the rest of the world.\\n\\nFor many decades the allegedly outstanding advantage of the gold stand-\\nard was its international character. One or the other (or both) of the great\\ninternational currencies, the pound sterling and the dollar, was always\\nsynonymous with gold, and adherence to gold therefore meant stable ex-\\nchange rates against at least one of these important currencies. With the\\ngeneral abandonment of gold standards, the advantage of automatically\\nstable exchange rates is now lost except, possibly, for the dollar as against\\nthe Belgian franc.\\' In purchasing power, gold has not, over a lengthy pe-\\nriod, been more stable than silver, and it has not been as stable as a well-\\nmanaged paper currency. The maintenance of a gold standard which is no\\nlonger used in the bulk of international transactions therefore involves\\ngold-standard countries, in equa] degree with silver or paper-using nations,\\nin the uncertainties of exchange, and, in possibly greater degree, in the un-\\ncertainties of price levels.

This theory, based on a\\nconfusion of the markets for re/a/] goods and agricultural products, on the one hand,\\nand the markets for retail sites and farm lands, on the other, seems definitely invalid.\\nThe markets for both retail sites and farm lands are imperfectly competitive; and the\\nrent, in both cases, is an imperfectly competitive return.\\n\\nLand ownership has often been referred to as a monopoly. Adam Smith\\'s\\nwell known dictum that \"the rent of land . . . is naturally a monopoly\\nprice\" was followed, in some cases with modifications, by Malthus, Senior,\\nJ. S. Mill, Henry George, and by a few recent economists. This doctrine\\nhas not hitherto met general acceptance, but Professor Chamberlin has\\nrecently given it new prestige in his TPeory of Monopolistic Competition\\nin which he has formulated the novel theory, that while agricultural rent\\nis a purely competitive return, urban rent is a \"pure monopoly return.\"\\n\\nProfessor Chamberlin finds many differences between agricultural land\\nand urban land, and between agricultural rent and urban rent. He contends\\nthat a business site confers no advantages analogous to superior fertility in\\nagricultural rent; that one site \"is capable of Producing as large a quantity\\nof retailing services as another—there are no differences in fertility and no\\nscarcity whatever of the best land in this respect\"; that marginal and sub-\\nmarginal land anywhere— practically free land—is as \"fertile for selling\\nputposes\" as the best shopping site in New York City. Urban rent, which\\nis entirely location rent, is quite different even from location rent of farm\\nland; for the location rent of farm land is due to differences in the cost of\\ntransportation to the market, but the urban land \"carries its market with it.\"\\nThe market for agricultural products is purely competitive, allowance being\\nmade for differences in transportation costs; there are many buyers and\\nsellers, as required for pure competition, and any seller can dispose of an\\nindefinitely large amount of product at the prevailing price. \"The retail\\nmarket, on the other hand, contains monopoly elements, for the factor of\\nconvenience differentiates the product spatially.\" Since buyers do not move\\nabout with entire freedom, the owner of any particularly convenient site,\\naccording to Professor Chamberlin, has a monopoly of the use of the site,\\nand receives a monopoly rent. His site affords a market which is, to a degree,\\ndistinct from the whole; and the amount of product he can dispose of at\\nthe prevailing price is not indefinitely large—as in pure competition.\\n\\nIt is not difficult to agree with much of Professor Chamberlin\\'s argument.\\nIt is quite true that the advantages afforded by good business sites are dif-\\nferent in some respects from those afforded by good land; that low-rent sites\\n\\n\"Third ed., pp. 112, 113, and Appendix D.

Allowance must be made for\\nvarious possibilities in the shifting of indirect taxes and for differences in the tax systems of\\ndifferent states.

An analysis by taxing divisions shows the median income for\\ndividing the tax burden equally above and below was $2,600 for the nation as a whole,\\n$2,000 for state and local taxes (Illinois), and $15,000 for federal taxes. The lower income\\ngroups paid a higher percentage of the tax burden than the percentage of the national\\nincome which they received,\\n\\nThe questions of who pays our taxes and who should pay them are peren-\\nnial.

Economists tend to\\napproach these problems as if they were questions of trade barriers in the international\\nfield and of price rigidity and monopolistic tendencies in the domestic field. Essentially\\nautarchic tendencies in foreign trade and monopolistic tendencies in domestic markets are\\npolitical responses to a shift in the social framework of the market. Traditional economics\\ntends to assume the constancy of this social framework, and then proceeds to a refinement\\nof its analysis within the postulated constancy. Present problems arise because the frame-\\nwork of custom, values and law is shifting. Economics has become increasingly exact in its\\nformulations, and at the same time increasingly irrelevant to the social process it claims to\\nstudy. The essential problems today are: Is the social framework still a constant? and if\\nnot, what difference does it make in the discussion of relevant policy? Until these questions\\nare explicitly faced, divergent policies in international] and domestic markets will be argued\\nwith heat but without light, because the traditional postulate of the economist—the con-\\nstancy of the social framework—eliminates the area in which the real problems arise.\\n\\nA discussion of the relation of. American foreign-trade policy to New\\nDeal domestic policy must be based upon a clear understanding of the\\nnature of the two policies which are in comparison.\\n\\nThere is little difficulty in a statement of our present foreign-trade\\npolicy.\\' Essentially it is designed to broaden trade by a process of negotia-\\ntion of trade agreements with other countries to reduce trade barriers. The\\nobjectives are both economic and political. No discussion of the economic\\nobjectives is required before an audience of professional economists—there\\nis no proposal in the field of economic policy for which so nearly unani-\\nmous support can be found in the profession. The political objective—\\nthe development of an atmosphere in international relations in which\\npeaceful intercourse between nations becomes somewhat more probable\\nor possible—is open to more serious doubt. Few will question the objective\\nitself; but qualified students of international relations might well wonder\\nwhether an expansion of international economic intercourse which was not\\naccompanied by a strengthening of the international political and juridical\\nframework in which the trade relations will develop, might not rather\\neasily promote a variety of international contact that might lead to inter-\\nnational conflict, if no provisions were made at the same time for mech-\\nanisms and institutions of adjustment which would render such conflict\\nharmless from the standpoint of the preservation of peace.

      "['WAGES-FUND THEORY AND THE POPULAR INFLUENCE\\nOF ECONOMISTS\\n', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Aside from discussions over technical aspects of theory, economists as social scientists\\nhave always been concerned with public questions of their day. Although the wages fund\\nis mainly of historical interest in economic theory, it has generally been supposed that it\\nrepresented a subject on which professional economists made a contribution to public\\nopinion of mid-nineteenth century England. Study of the views of a great variety of\\nindividuals as presented in reports of a British Royal Commission in 1867-68 indicates\\nthat the discouraging conclusions of economists on the success or justice of trade-union\\naction to raise wages were not widely known. Individuals and groups to whose interest\\nsuch professional opinion would have been favorable were not familiar with it. John\\nStuart Mill, a prominent public figure at the time and a wages-fund theorist, has been\\nthought to have relaxed the severity of his conclusions in later years, but examination\\nshows that he did not give up the basic concept of the theory.\\n\\nIt is tradition that during the middle years of the nineteenth century the\\ntheoretical views of economists were popularly applied by the British\\npublic to the efforts of trade unions to raise wages. The generally ac-\\ncepted wage theory at the time was that known today as the \"wages fund.\"\\nWages were supposed to have been paid from a fund of capital in the\\nhands of the capitalist-employer. For a given period of time, a year for\\nexample, the size of this fund was fixed. It was a corollary of this proposi-\\ntion which was applied to oppose trade-union action dealing with wages.\\nIf one group of workers increased its share by pressure of a strike, some\\nother group of workers somewhere would have to take less; only a certain\\ntotal amount was available for wage-carners. In the history of the de-\\nvelopment of economic theory it has been represented that this theoretical\\nargument of the ranking economists was used by the general public or\\n\"informed middle-class opinion\"! to demonstrate the futility or inequity of\\nstrike action over wages. The theoretical views of economists were sup-\\nposed to have given this lead to popular thought. Examination of evidence\\navailable shows that these theoretical arguments of economists were not\\nwidely known to the general public, and were practically unknown to\\ngroups with an immediate interest in a wages economy.\\n\\nRicardian economics is the basis for the wages-fund theory, but John\\nStuart Mill is considered to have given it the most concise and generally\\naccepted expression in his Principles of Political Economy, first published\\nin 1848. His much-heralded \"recantation\" of the theory in 1869 is con-\\nsidered to mark its dénouement. Cairnes\\'s reassertion of the doctrine and\\nits implications for trade-union activities in 1874 is looked upon as a dying\\ngasp. It was during the middle years of the century, corresponding to the\\nperiod of Mill\\'s preéminence as an economist, that the general public is\\nsupposed to have been most interested in the economists\\' theoretical views\\non wages.

Mr. Villard takes issue with this view on the ground that it\\nassumes an unrealistic definition of a deposit balance? which we defined as the\\nnet credit balance existing within a bank account at any given time. The writers\\nfeel that this definition is the one generally accepted by bankers, economists and\\nthe public at large. Even Mr. Villard, himself, unwittingly slips into the use of it\\nin his concept of exchange velocity.? Since the disagreement between Mr. Villard\\nand us hinges on a definition, however, the issue at stake is whether his definition\\nor ours is the more suitable for monetary analysis.\\n\\nMr. Villard\\'s definitions of a deposit balance are: (1) \"the amount of checks\\nwhich will be honored when drawn by an individual;\"* (2) \"the right to draw\\na check.\"* How is a deposit balance in either of these senses to be measured?\\nMr. Villard gives no answer. If the net credit balance within a bank account is\\nused as a measure, his definition of a deposit balance agrees with our own. On the\\nother hand, if the amount of the net credit balance within a bank account p/us\\nthe amount of checks accumulating for credit to the account during the interval\\nbetween bank postings is used as a measure, checks which may neither reduce\\nthe deposit balance in the account against which they were drawn nor increase\\nthe deposit balance in the account to which they are credited are treated as\\ndeposit balances. It seems more reasonable to treat checks which are cleared\\nwithin a bank account at the time of bank posting for what they really are—\\nnamely, a distinct form of money independent of deposit balances.\\n\\nMr. Villard\\'s criticism warrants mention of an additional point. Checks which\\nare cleared within bank accounts have nothing to do with velocity in the sense of\\na \"turnover\" of deposit balances. Only to the extent that intra-account clearing is\\nincomplete does a transfer (turnover) of a deposit balance occur. While clearing\\nwithin a bank account is unlikely to be complete at any one posting, the writers\\nhave reason to believe that the volume of intra-account clearing which does\\noccur in this country at each bank posting represents a substantial proportion of\\nthe total volume of monetary transactions in any given period. The intra-account\\nClearing process, in other words, greatly restricts the quantitative importance of\\nvelocity in the \"turnover\" sense. Mr. Villard is undoubtedly concerned about the\\nimplications of this process for the theoretical significance of exchange velocity\\nsince, given our definition of a deposit balance, \"the rest of the argument . . .\\nfollows logically.\"*\\n\\nCHARLES A.

Reynolds\\n\\nIn his review of The Productivity of Labor in tbe Rubber Tire Manufacturing\\nIndustry in this Review (June, 1941, p. 415), Mr. Reynolds made several state-\\nments which require a reply.\\n\\nHe said, \"The conclusion that \"unstable conditions in labor relations have been\\nin large measure responsible for the reduced rate of productivity increase since\\n1933\\' (p. 181) is not supported by adequate evidence.\" The paragraph from\\nwhich this statement, torn from its context, was quoted appears on pages 180\\nand 181 in the chapter entitled \"Summary and Conclusions.\" The evidence in\\nsupport of the statement quoted by Mr. Reynolds is to be found principally on\\npages 106-21 and 172-75. It includes an account of the effects upon the industry\\nof section 7A of the N.R.A.; of the A.F. of L. and the C.I.O. organization drives;\\nand of the spectacular increase in the number and severity of labor disputes. The\\ndiscussions relating to such matters as the controversies over \"majority rule,\" the\\n\"union shop,\" the \"speed-up,\" and the movement toward decentralization afford\\nadditional evidence. Numerous references have been cited to industrial, union\\nand governmental sources of information concerning these topics.\\n\\nMr. Reynolds said, \"The discussion of the distribution of the gains from in-\\ncreased productivity . . . exhibits theoretical confusion at several points. The\\nstatement that money wages in a particular industry \"normally reflect changes\\nin productivity,\\' and that \\'the marked upward trend of wages in the tire industry\\nis largely explainable in terms of increasing labor productivity (p. 144) applies\\nto a particular industry propositions which are true only of the economy as a\\nwhole, and moreover confuses marginal with average productivity.\"\\n\\nI see no reason why the fact that the above statements are true for the economy\\nas a whole should preclude their application to a particular industry. The evidence\\nwhich I have been able to assemble suggests that both generalizations are true\\nof the tire industry. Although the data are much too lengthy to present here\\nthey may be summarized as follows:\\n\\n1. The trends in the average productivity series and in the wages series are\\nsimilar.\\n\\n2. The plants with the highest productivity tend also to pay the highest wages.?\\n\\n3. \"The various incentive wage systems in use in the industry establish definite\\nrelationships between individual earnings and individual output.?\\n\\nIt has not been contended that these conditions exist without exception. Several\\nother factors such as the extent and character of union organization, cyclical\\n\\ninfluences, and institutional changes have been discussed in relation to their\\neffects upon wages. But it is my belief that the evidence substantiates the state-\\nments quoted by Mr. Reynolds.\\n\\nMr. Reynolds\\' charge that my work confuses marginal with average productivity\\nseems to me to be particularly unfounded. In the section of chapter I on MetPods\\nand Procedures (pp. 21-24), special pains were taken to prevent any reader\\nfrom falling into this error. Moreover, the paragraph immediately following\\nthe statements citicized by Mr. Reynolds for confusing marginal with average\\nproductivity reémphasizes the distinction as follows: \"It should be noted again\\nthat the productivity measures used in this study represent changes in physical\\n\\n*!

We refer to his Deutscher Sozialismus,\\npublished about a year and a half after Hitler\\'s advent to power and made\\navailable to the English-reading public several years later under the innocent\\ntitle, 4 New Social Philosophy? \\'There is some danger that in the heat of\\nour conflict with German fascism, a conflict which will endure for some\\ntime, whatever precise form it may take, Sombart\\'s notable contributions\\nwill be obscured and repudiated. Particularly will this be so if we assume\\nthat in a spirit of moral abnegation he surrendered to the newly risen\\npower in his country.\\n\\nIt is not the primary purpose of this paper to investigate the subjective\\npremises behind his apparent surrender to fascism. It is necessary, never-\\ntheless, to examine briefly the hypothesis that Sombart \"sold out,\" partly\\nthat no unjust stigma may be attached to an important figure, but more\\nparticularly in order to justify our examination of his work as a social\\nscientist. With respect to the latter, it is clear that the work of a man lack-\\ning in courage and integrity contains no significant continuity, except the\\ncontinuity of opportunism; and that is hardly the premise for interesting\\nimplications, unless it be the repudiation of opportunism.\\n\\nIt is my belief that Sombart did not so much surrender to National\\nSocialism as espouse it. This judgment is premised upon the following\\nconsiderations: (1) the courage and independence manifested by Sombart\\nthrough a large part of his career; (2) his allegiance to certain vital aspects\\nof his plan of a National Socialist constitution of society for a number of\\nyears prior to Hitler\\'s advent to power; (3) certain fundamental social out-\\nlooks and qualities of temperament which characterized the man through-\\nout his life.\\n\\nFor a period of at least two decades Sombart avowed himself a Marxian,\\nin the face of obviously great hindrance to his academic advancement. De-\\nspite spectacular success as a lecturer and notable scholarly achievements,\\nSombart was confined for fifteen years to the lowest professorial rank at the\\nprovincial university of Breslau. In 1905, several years after the appear-\\nance of the first edition of Der Moderne Kapitalismus, he was called to a\\nprofessorship in Berlin, not to the University of Berlin, but to the College\\nof Commerce (Handelshochschule).

Unfor-\\ntunately, economic research is a peculiarly difficult thing to define. More-\\nover, the difficulties are far greater in the case of government, and I believe\\nin that of business, than they are for a research institution or even a uni-\\nversity.\\n\\nIt has been frequently suggested that a running inventory should be\\nmaintained of research projects under way in government.

Such undertakings are vastly more numerous than research proj-\\nects which promise to be of material value.\\n\\nLet me illustrate some of the problems of defining economic rescarch\\nin government which such a running inventory would meet. A cabinet\\nofficer or other high executive desires information on the best way to\\nfinance new industrial facilities to support the defense program. He asks\\nfor a confidential memorandum. Or perhaps this government executive\\nplans to make a speech on the subject of industrial facility financing and\\nasks to have a draft prepared for him.

In each case\\nthe government employee of whom the executive makes his request is\\nseeking to give the best answer he can to a question which most of us\\ntoday would regard as definitely in the realm of economics. Is the process\\nof preparing the memorandum or draft, letter or speech, to be regarded\\nas economic research? Is it equally economic research if the government\\nemployee is allowed on the one hand two or three hours for the task and\\non the other two weeks or possibly two months, or even more?

In this article the róle of product variation and the interrelations\\nof these three variables are emphasized. Diagrammatics analogous to those customarily\\nused in price-output problems are developed and these are later employed to demonstrate\\nthat the incidence of relevant technological innovations upon the quality of the product\\nof the firm are independent of abnormal profits or of monopolistic advantage. Finally, the\\njoint determination of output, product and promotion is considered. Normally, the ex-\\nploitation of every profit possibility until marginal costs and receipts were equated would\\nbe expected. Available funds may, however, be limited and certain policies may earn\\nlosses unless more intensively pursued. In this case certain profit possibilities must\\nbe passed over in favor of others, the marginal net return on working capital will vary\\nwith different employments, and as the amount of such funds available changes the manner\\nof their expenditure may differ markedly.\\n\\nEntrepreneurs must determine, nter alia, the price and output of their\\nproduct, its specifications, and the amount and type of selling effort.! The\\nlogic and illustrative diagrammatics of the entrepreneurial determination\\nof output and price are familiar. Similar methods, developed below, are\\napplicable to the problems of determining the optimum degree of dura-\\nbility and of other product attributes. The procedure used is shown to be\\nrelevant to a consideration of the incidence of improved technology on\\nprices and quality. Finally, the joint determination of price, product,? and\\npromotion? is attempted. In the following discussion it is assumed that the\\nproducts of immediate rivals are heterogeneous and are considered by\\nconsumers to be close but not exact substitutes: they are \"differentiated\" one\\nfrom another either because the product (or service) is tangibly different,\\nor because it has been made to seem so, or because of location. The time\\nperiod relevant to the considerations of this paper is not the long run, but\\na short period in which there is, however, sufficient time for some rather\\nfundamental adjustments by entrepreneurs: the product of each firm is held\\ncapable of considerable modification, but the possibility of changing over\\nto a radically different type of product with altogether dissimilar uses and\\nattributes is excluded. The location of the enterprise is considered given,\\nbut distribution facilities or delivery services may be modified. The reason-\\ning throughout assumes that entrepreneurs desire profits, have perfect\\nknowledge, and act rationally.\\n\\n1]f the firm has a less than infinitely elastic demand schedule, and one assumes that\\noutput and sales will be equated, then a price decision simultaneously determines output\\n(or vice versa) and this theoretically comprises but one decision.\\n\\n? \"Product\" throughout includes the material good plus all associated intangibles excep?\\nthose resulting from promotion and the peculiar site of the place of sale.

The regulation of railroads, pipe lines, motor carriers, and water lines is also\\nunified and centralized on a pattern largely derived from the earlier rail statutes. In par-\\nticular, maximum, minimum, and exact rates and charges of each of these agencies are\\nsubject to Commission control. Entry into service is also rigidly subject to regulation by\\nmeans of permits and certificates of public convenience and necessity. For the first time a\\nnational transportation policy governing all agencies subject to the Interstate Commerce\\nact has been enacted. Another major feature of the Act is provision for the creation of a\\ntemporary Board of Investigation and Research to study the relative economy and fitness\\nof each mode of transportation, the extent government has subsidized or otherwise aided\\ntransportation, the amount of taxes levied upon transportation by all governmental units,\\nand any other matter likely to lead to improvement of transportation conditions.

The Act is divided into three main divisions, each\\nwith a separate title.

      "['THE ARMAMENTS PROGRAM AND NATIONAL INCOME\\n\\nThe armaments program will probably lead to a smaller increase in the national\\nincome than would a work-relief program involving the same amount of net government\\nspending. This is due to higher leakages in the first-round turnover of armament expendi-\\ntures and to the rapid amortization of privately financed capital equipment in the arma-\\nments field. If the period considered is long enough for complete amortization to take place,\\nthe expansionary effect of induced investment will be neutralized by depreciation charges.\\nThe argument may be generalized for use in the evaluation of the income-increasing\\npotential of any spending program.\\n\\nThe purpose of this note is to point out that the dollar-for-dollar value\\nof an armaments program in increasing the national income may well be\\nless than that of a work-relief program.\\n\\nIn appraising the income-increasing value of any expenditure we have\\nto consider not only the ze/ addition to the income stream which that\\nexpenditure represents, but also the direction of the expenditure. It is the\\nsecond of these considerations which is being dealt with in this note. As far\\nas government programs are concerned the first point has been pretty well\\ncovered in recent discussions of tax policy, and I have nothing to add here.\\nWhat is being compared is the dollar-for-dollar value of two types of\\nprograms—armaments and work relief—with the comparison put on a\\nnet basis. Any difference due to choice of fiscal methods is ignored.\\n\\nThe effect of a spending program on total income is governed by\\n(1) the spending reactions of recipients at all stages, or \"rounds of\\nincome,\" and (2) the amount of induced investment, also at all stages.\\nIn order to compare two programs, however, it is necessary to follow the\\nspending only through the hands of one set of ultimate consumers, on\\nthe assumption that, for all practical purposes, spending reactions and\\ninduced investment after the initial expenditure has completed an \"income\\nround\" will be the same regardless of the purpose or source of the original\\nexpenditure.!\\n\\nIt is fairly certain that a work-relief program has a greater potential\\nas an income-increasing force if investment induced by the primary expendi-\\nture is not considered, attention being focussed on first-round spending\\nreactions alone. The direction of work-relief spending is such that leakages\\nare at a minimum. There is, of course, the familiar proposition that workers\\nin the industries supplying goods for rearmament enjoy a higher income\\nthan relief workers and hence are likely as a group to have a lower marginal\\n\\n\"This assumption is, of course, contrary to fact. Ultimate recipients of the primary\\narmaments expenditures are a quite different group than WPA workers; the reéxpenditures\\nmade by the two groups may differ somewhat in direction as well as in volume. If the\\ndifference is significant there might be an advantage, one way or the other, in investment\\ninduced by secomd-round (and subsequent) spending. Also, no account is taken of the\\nimpact of different programs on \"confidence.\" In my judgment, these factors, while im-\\nportant in some respects, are of insignificant magnitude in the special case being con-\\n\\nsidered, and their inclusion in the analysis here would make it unnecessarily cumbersome\\nwithout altering the substance of the conclusions.\\n', 'This content downloaded from\\n137.158.158.62 on Wed, 26 Jan 2022 19:41:44 UTC\\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n']\n",

      "['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'RECENT CHANGES IN WORK-RELIEF WAGE POLICY\\n\\nRecent changes in WPA wage policy have been substantial. The relief act of 193\\nrequired that regional differences in monthly earnings should be based on differences i\\ncost of living. \"Cost of living\" may refer to the income needed to maintain (1) a uniforn\\nlevel of living, or (2) the actual levels of living that prevail in different regions. The nex\\nWPA. wage schedule, revised in accordance with a qualified cost-of-living concept, raised th\\nnational average approximately $2.50 a month. Substantial increases were made in unskille\\nearnings in the South with only small changes elsewhere. The 1939 act also established a uni\\nform work month of 130 hours, thus abandoning the prevailing-hourly-wage policy. Thi\\nprovision has increased efficiency in various respects. Changes in work-relief wage polic\\nhave been associated with shifts in the distribution of emphasis between the work an\\nrelief aspects of such programs. In recent years, a growth in legislative determination o\\nwage and hour policy has accompanied increasing emphasis upon the efficient accomplish\\nment of useful work.\\n\\nAn analysis of work-relief wage policy covering the period 1930-37 wa:\\npublished by the present authors in a previous issue of the Review. Since\\n1937 the wage policy of the Work Projects Administration has been\\nchanged materially, particularly by the Emergency Relief act of 1939.\\n\\nIn general, work-relief wage policy has reflected the peculiar position\\nand the innumerable difficulties of a work-relief program. Work relief is\\nà hybrid, combining many of the aspects of normal employment with those\\nof relief. Because it is a compromise between work and relief, a number\\nof special features are found in a work-relief program: (1) need is the\\nprimary basis for employment while occupational fitness is secondary; (2)\\nprovision of employment is the chief objective and the completed work\\nis subordinate so that the major canon of efficiency is maximum direct\\nemployment and not minimum cost of completed work—in other words,\\nneed for the completed public work is subordinated to the need for em-\\nployment of otherwise-idle labor; (3) work completed is presumed to be\\nthat which otherwise would not have been undertaken currently; (4) wage\\npayments are primarily for subsistence, the gui4 pro quo aspect being\\nsubordinate.\\n\\nWork relief, of course, can emphasize either work or relief. The de-\\nvelopment of work relief during the 1930\\'s was consistently in the direction\\nof approximating regular work as much as possible. Although the WPA\\nembodies more of the features of regular public work than any of the\\npreceding work-relief programs, it is still a compromise. During the course\\nof its operations, WPA has developed a body of principles and practices\\nwhich are unique in the field of project operation and employment. Because\\nof its relief aspect, work relief is distinguished from \"normal\" public work\\nby such peculiar features as the low ratio of non-labor costs and the provi-\\nsion of the maximum possible amount of direct employment, as well as by\\nspecial problems of project operation arising from the necessity of selecting,\\ncombining, and shifting types of projects to meet rapid changes in relief\\n\\n!

When the four items are\\nranged in magnitude, there are seven limitations upon their size—usually in the ratio of\\none item to a second item. Transgressions of those mathematical ratios in estimates in-\\nevitably cause \"Discrepancies due to errors and omissions.\" This contributes to pure\\nscience. Further, the new analysis can sometimes be put to guarded use in localizing and\\nbracketing errors in balance-of-payments estimates.\\n\\nItem-by-item differences between two 4-item balances of payments, both in equilibrium,\\nlikewise make a 4-element equation. Therefore, fluctuations of estimates for one year com-\\npared with the estimates of each other year of a series can condemn a specific estimate. The\\nestimated item may be jointly erroneous with each of the three others, in turn, and always\\ntoo large or always too small. A \"joint error\" with gold is especially condemning ; because\\nold statistics are often trustworthy.\\n\\nThe accountancy plane of equilibrium in international dealings has been\\ndismissed, sometimes, as too simple to warrant much analysis. That plane\\nhas heretofore been supposed to involve merely the simple arithmetic of\\ndouble-entry bookkeeping: the adding and subtracting of equals. Because\\nthe debit and credit of each international transaction are equal the totals of\\nall international transactions must likewise be equal.\\n\\nOf the two entries for each transaction with foreigners, one inevitably\\naffects the international movement of short-term capital; barter is rare\\nenough in practice to be ignored. Each credit in our balance of payments\\nis an increase of American deposits abroad (a balance-of-payments debit) ;\\nor, it is a reduction of foreign deposits in the United States (also a balance-\\nof-payments debit) . The reverse is true of each debit in our balance of pay-\\nments. Even when dollar paper currency is spent abroad or is mailed there—\\nby tourists, immigrants and others—the currency pours through the \"re-\\nservoirs\" of short-term capital, usually with little lag, freezing or thawing.\\nFurther, gold shipments, often falsely declared to be the balancing item in\\na balance of payments, are not exceptions; these, too, have double-entries\\naffecting the international movement of short-term capital.\\n\\nThus offhandedly, the accountancy plane of international equilibrium\\ncould be well enough pictured, heretofore. What challenged the wits and\\nknowledge of many of the keenest thinkers among economists were other\\nplanes of equilibrium. The accountancy plane was supposed to stop, dead,\\nwith equal debits and credits.\\n\\nThis paper will describe some neglected mathematical relationships be-\\ntween groups of debits and credits, inside the balancing grand totals of\\ninternational accounts. What was speciously so simple will be shown to be\\ncomplex. Equilibrium on the accountancy plane will emerge with new\\nproperties which, incidentally, hold not only in international dealings but\\nalso in domestic trade and virtually throughout all human economy.\\n', 'This content downloaded from\\n137.158.158.62 on Wed, 26 Jan 2022 19:42:51 UTC\\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n']\n",

Mr. Hudson contended that a\\nknowledge of economic principles should be required of all students before ex-\\nposing them to such a course as public finance. This knowledge would include\\nan understanding of such concepts as (1) supply and demand, (2) law of\\nmonopoly price, (3) principle of diminishing utility, (4) theory of economic\\nrent, (5) interest rate theory, (6) economic meaning of surplus and cost, (7)\\nequation of exchange.\\n\\nThis writer believes Mr. Hudson\\'s view, which is probably shared by a ma-\\njority of teachers of economics, has fundamental weaknesses which are becoming\\nmore and more apparent. It is not always wise to introduce the subject of eco-\\nnomics to students by presenting abstract assumptive concepts. The writer\\'s rea-\\nsons include the following:\\n\\n(1) Many students are discouraged from taking advanced economic courses\\ndealing largely in factual concrete materials because of their inability to\\ngrasp abstractions presented in the beginning principles course. Would\\nit not be better for a student to have a well grounded factual knowledge\\nof the economic system than to have frozen knowledge of theory and no\\npractical application at all?\\n\\n(2) Neo-cdassical economic theory has demonstrated its limitations in dealing\\nwith the complications of the post-World Wr I period. To assume that\\nbecause a student has memorized these principles he is better qualified\\nto study these complications is an assumption which needs careful re-\\nexamination.\\n\\n(3) The principles of economics widely required of all beginning students in\\neconomics are tools and tools only. It is easier to show a student how\\nto use these when actually working with a particular subject such as\\npublic finance or transportation, than in a course of principles which\\nIs merely an abstract prologue.\\n\\n(4) The dissatisfaction and confusion now prevalent in the teaching of eco-\\nnomics is evidence that the deductive method is not effective. Experiments\\nin inductive, teaching give some hope for the future. We have probably\\nhad the cart before the horse.

Villard\\n\\nIn his review of the above book in the December, 1940, issue of the American\\nEconomic Review Mr. Villard not only misses the fundamental purpose of the\\nanalysis but he also definitely misquotes and misstates our position with respect\\nto important questions.\\n\\nHe quotes from the jacket that the volume contains \"a comprehensive analysis\\nof the phenomenon of idle money, idle factories, and idle men,\" to which he\\nadds,—.e., of the business cycle. The phrase, Z.e., of the business cycle, provides\\nthe key to Mr. Villard\\'s dissatisfaction with the volume. He is evidently altogether\\ncertain that the business cycle, properly interpreted, can explain everything. Be-\\ncause we do not approach the problem from the point of view of cycle theory\\nhe says the book lacks focus—which merely means that it has not the focus which\\nhe would have given it. It i; focussed upon the factors which many have ad-\\nvanced in explanation of the failure of the recovery movement which began in\\n1955 to materialize into full-fledged prosperity—some finding the explanation in\\n', 'Comment on Incidence of Taxation\\n\\nIn an article on the incidence of taxation, appearing in the December, 1940,\\nissue of the American Economic Review, Mr. Grenville Holden uses an article of\\nmine, published ten years ago in the same periodical, as a springboard for a\\na dive into what is to him the clear pure waters of the classical analysis of inci-\\ndence of taxation.\\n\\nI do not mind Mr. Holden\\'s selection of my article for that purpose. Indeed,\\nhe is in agreement with my analysis. Nor am I troubled by what he brings up out\\nof the depths of economic thinking in the past. I am concerned only with his\\nmisrepresentation of what I said. Were this a casual mistake, I should probably\\nignore it. But the point is stressed, even to footnotes. Moreover, Professors Fagan\\nand Buehler, who have commented on my article, are brought under the same\\ncriticism to which I am subjected.\\n\\nDemonstration of the misrepresentation by a comparison of the relevant quo-\\ntations is simple. Mr. Holden says (p. 775) :\\n\\n\"In a note appearing in this Review in 1950, M. Slade Kendrick states that\\neconomists have always neglected the effects of public expenditures on demand\\nand incidence, and his criticism appears to be accepted by Elmer D. Fagan and\\nAlfred G. Buehler.\"\\n\\nHere is what I said (/4merican Economic Review, June, 1930, p. 226) :\\n\\n\"Studies of the incidence of taxation coramonly assume that the incidence of\\ncach tax may be examined without reference to the expenditure of the funds\\nexacted by it. The usual discussion proceeds directly from a description of the tax\\nto an analysis of its incidence under the conditions of supply and demand relevant\\ntoa consideration of this incidence.\"\\n\\nNot many words are needed to point out the difference between the phrase,\\n\"have always neglected,\" and the phrases, \"commonly assume,\" and \"the usual\\ndiscussion.\" Moreover, my article was clearly not in the historical emphasis.

But adjustment is stifled at its source by the legal framework of\\nthe business enterprise which allows a discard of workers without any regard\\nfor the ability of the workers to shift their services to other enterprises. In\\norder to maintain full activity in the economy, enterprises must be designed\\nto recognize the fact that workers are not shifted immediately by the process\\nof placing them in the ranks of the unemployed. Ignoring the lack of ability\\non the part of discharged workers to shift immediately relegates the workers\\nto idleness, which in turn forces other enterprises to discard some of their\\nworkers, and does not contribute to an orderly redistribution of effort. It\\nappears, therefore, that the legal framework of the business must be changed\\nwith particular reference to the ability of the enterprise to discard immediately\\nits unwanted workers.\\n\\nThe following statement of a general proposal is, in my opinion, a proper\\nmethod to employ in adjusting the enterprise to the environment.\\n\\n1.

Although no widespread infringement of the sugar regulations\\nis apparent, the experience with tires and gasoline, if it should become\\nmore general, would be tragic. Even with sugar the cost of administra-\\ntion is not to be blinked at in a country straining every nerve toward\\nwar production.\\n\\nA fundamental difficulty with administrative rationing is that equal\\nallotments do not result in equal treatment or equal sacrifice. This has\\nbeen recognized for tires and gasoline, and varying quantities have been\\nallowed different classes of consumers. But no administrative board can\\nappraise the merits of claims for allotments above the minimum, nor\\ncan it control the disposition of the commodity once allotted.

The presence of extensive exchange controls in a country long\\ndistinguished as the foremost champion of free exchange raises ques-\\ntions of the most far-reaching significance for the future course of\\ninternational finance. It will be the concern of this paper to examine the\\ncircumstances under which the American controls operate with a view\\nto determining what conditions may be necessary or desirable before\\nthe United States can safely reopen its money markets to foreigners.\\n\\nThe immediate objective of any exchange control is to bring foreign\\ntransactions under the scrutiny of a governmental agency in order that\\nthe particular purposes of the government may be enforced. While\\nthese purposes differ widely among the various countries, they ordi-\\nnarily are concerned with (1) the rationing of foreign exchange ren-\\ndered scarce by continued strains, arising from the balance of payments,\\non cash resources,? and/or (2) the supervision of imports with a view\\nto influencing the terms of trade or in support of internal economic\\npolicies of the government. In general it may be said that government\\nintervention in the foreign exchange markets has been provoked in most\\ncases either as a necessary feature of governmental regulation of trade,\\nor as a sort of temporary receivership for deranged national accounts,\\nwhere the alternatives—uncontrolled currency depreciations or formal\\ndevaluations—were thought to be more onerous methods of securing\\nthe needed correction in the balance of payments.\\n', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'I.

The relation\\nbetween the theoretical and practical aspects of his analysis has been either\\nignored, misunderstood or distorted.\\n\\nGesell\\'s objective as a social reformer was to attack rentier capitalism and\\nto substitute in its place an interest-free society. To fortify his reform posi-\\ntion Gesell developed a system of economic theory in which he tried to demon-\\nstrate that the nonutilization of resources and the presence of nonfunctional\\nincome are the inevitable accompaniments of prevailing financial institutions.\\nThe most important single phase of his theory as a whole is his theory of\\ninterest. In its critical aspect this theory represents an attempt to show that,\\nin a system of conventional money, interest income is a payment to prevent\\nthe hoarding of money. In its positive aspect the theory is an attempt to\\nshow that the introduction of stamped money would eliminate \"basic interest\"\\nand thus pave the way to an interest-free economy, The purpose of this note\\nis to show that Gesell\\'s theory in general and his theory of basic interest in\\nparticular represent an argument for his stamped money proposal. This may\\nbest be shown by indicating that the practical insight which led Gesell to\\npropose a tax on money was chronologically as well as logically prior to his\\ntheoretical system.\\n\\nThat the practical aspect of Gesell\\'s thought was chronologically prior is\\nnot difficult to demonstrate. In 1886, at the age of twenty-four, Gesell mi-\\ngrated from Europe to the Argentine to engage in foreign trade and small-\\nscale manuíacturing. There he witnessed one of the most speculative episodes\\nin the history of modern capitalist development. The great boom from 1885\\nto 1890 preceded a long and severe depression which lasted for the duration\\nof Gesell\\'s stay in the South American republic. The frustration of industrial\\nactivity produced a strong current of resentment against the speculating\\nfinanciers, brokers, stock jobbers and mortgagees. As one whose interests\\nwere directly affected, and as one whose indignation was aroused by this\\nfinancial debauchery, Gesell participated actively in the opposition to the\\ngroup interests which appeared to be responsible for the chaotic state of\\n\\n!

      "[\"It is now widely admitted in informed circles that even a return to the pre-\\nwar methods and to the rates of taxing personal and corporate incomes in the\\nUnited States would seriously reduce the survival prospects of private enter-\\nprise because of their repressive effects on private investment. Whether the\\nAmerican economy is to be essentially a private enterprise economy or essen-\\ntially a publicly planned and controlled economy may depend on the kind\\nof tax structure which will confront American business at the outset of the\\nconversion period. The latest Ruml plan and the Twin Cities plan formulated\\nby an able group of Minnesota business men pose the issue clearly—personal\\ntaxation vs. business taxation. The one looks primarily toward the personal\\nincome tax while the other recommends heavy reliance on a business tax on\\ncorporate earnings with an arbitrary exclusion of 40 per cent of dividends\\nfrom the gross income of dividend receivers.\\n\\nI treated this issue in a study which was reviewed in the June, 1944, number\\nof the Review.

The evolution\\nof the tax is well known. By the early twenties it had become a special\\nbusiness tax levied on one particular form of doing business. The result was\\nthat, in combination with the personal income tax, after the latter became\\nsharply progressive, it imposed a double tax on investments through the cor-\\nporate device so heavy as to discourage the launching of new ventures out-\\nside the umbrella of existing corporate entities, favored the retention of\\nearnings within these entities, so far as the large taxpayers were concerned,\\nand seriously overtaxed the small investor who was obliged to pay a multiple\\nof what he would have been liable for if his share of corporate earnings had\\nbeen taxable to him at the highest rate to which he was liable under the\\npersonal income tax.\\n\\n'There is no good reason why the corporation as such should be taxed\\n\\n!

      "[\"The curves could be drawn either in the manner of my article in the June\\nnumber or in the manner of Professor Clark's suggestion. Either method is\\ncorrect, according to the fundamental assumptions made.\\n\\nClark assumes (Figure 2) d continuous adjustment both of expenditures\\nand of tax rates. Thus his curves rightly would start from points H and F.\\nI, on the other hand, assumed an increase in expenditures adequate to bring\\nabout full employment together with a single change in tax rates adequate to\\nbalance the budget at that full employment level. Thus Clark is right in\\nassuming that I have in mind mainly the terminal full employment point.\\nThe lines in my chart, connecting the initial and the terminal points, are\\nnevertheless significant. The dotted lines connecting the points indicate how\\nvarious income levels are disposed of as between consumption and saving on\\nthe basis of the new tax rate structure. The income would vary as changes\\noccurred in the volume of public outlays and private capital outlays com-\\nbined. Clark, on the other hand, is continuously adjusting at each point on\\nthe income scale both the expenditures and the tax rates. In other words, my\\nlines disclose the new consumption and savings function on the basis of the\\nnew tax structure. This new tax structure would mean a somewhat lower\\nvolume of consumption, also a somewhat lower volume of savings, for example,\\nat income OL. Thus, my dotted curves do not coincide with the solid lines\\nat points H and F.\\n\\nWith respect to Figure 3, under Clark's assumption, the new dotted curves\\nstart at H and F; but on this basis, how would one get any expansion, since\\nthe assumption is that the expansion comes about from the reduction in tax\\nrates? If this initial difficulty could be overcome, Clark's chart, in view of\\nhis assumptions, is quite valid. His assumption is that there is a continuous\\nprocess of tax reduction going on at each income level. I assume, on the\\nother hand, that a sharp reduction in rates is made once and for all. On the\\nbasis of this new tax structure, my dotted lines now reveal what the con-\\nsumption and savings would be at every income level.

      "['I\\n\\nIn Chapter XII of his recent book, T\\'e Road to Serídom, Professor\\nHayek undertakes to show that the political philosophy of German national\\nsocialism has its roots in the teachings and doctrines of German socialists.\\nProfessor Hayek claims that \"the support which brought these [national\\nsocialist] ideas to power, came precisely from the socialist camp,\" that, at\\nleast in Germany, *the connection between nationalism and socialism was\\nclose from the beginning,\" and that *it was largely with the assistance of\\nold socialists that the beginning which produced national socialism rose\\nduring this period.\"? This paper will examine the correctness of these state-\\nments in view of the political and economic ideology of German socialism.\\n\\nProfessor Hayek bases his argument on two types of evidence. First, he\\nreminds us that pre-1914 German socialism counted among its forbears the\\nsame men—-Fichte, Rodbertus, and Lassalle—who are at present recognized\\nas the intellectual fathers of national socialism, Second, he quotes several\\nauthors whose ideas he claims were formed by their study of Marxian writ-\\nings and who expressed strongly nationalistic views. These two facts he con-\\nsiders sufficient evidence to convict the German socialist movement of ad-\\nherence to extreme nationalism, to a glorification of state power at the ex-\\npense of the individual, and to an ideology diametrically opposed to that of\\ntraditional liberalism.\\n\\nA proper analysis of the economic and political ideology of any group con-\\nsists in tracing the historical influences operative on the representative ex-\\nponents of the group and in fully discussing their views. With the exception\\nof Bebel, none of the men referred to by Professor Hayek can be regarded\\nas having held leading positions among socialist writers or politicians. The\\nappeal to Fichte, Lassalle, and Rodbertus is also deceptive. The fact that\\nthese men are regarded as intellectual forbears of socialism and of national\\nsocialism does not mean much by itself unless a thorough analysis is made\\nof why they have attained this position and which parts of their theories\\nhave been taken over. How misleading the simple appeal to spiritual father-\\nhood can be is shown by reference to contemporary America, where we find\\nsuch diverse groups as the Republicans and the Communists appealing to\\nLincoln as their political ancestor; where we find monopolists calling on\\nJefferson to protect their \"freedom of enterprise\" from the trust-busters who\\nclaim to act on principles of that same Thomas Jefferson.\\n\\nBefore we can clearly understand the influence of Fichte, Lassalle, and\\nRodbertus on both the socialists and national socialists, we must investigate\\nbriefly the part of their doctrines that has been adopted by each group.\\nFichte started as an admirer of the French Revolution and in his younger\\nyears published political tracts abusing the feudalistic and absolutist trends\\n\\n!

As the following\\ntable shows, however, there have been over this period important changes in\\nthe asset composition of the total public debt with a shift away from market-\\nable long-term bonds in favor of shorter issues and non-marketable issues.\\n\\n!P.

Both techniques may be considered at the same time and be\\ncombined with other approaches not directly concerned wth the size of the\\ndeficit.

Cassel\\'s international repute rested upon his extensive writing\\nthrough the greater part of his seventy-eight years of life, his active partici-\\npation in public affairs both at home and abroad, and his influence as a teacher\\nand publicist.\\n\\nCassel\\'s contributions to the literature of modern economics are found\\nprincipally in the four fields of value theory, monetary problems, the analysis\\nof business cycles, and the critique of socialism. His first notable publication\\nwas made in the field of value and distribution theory in TZe Nature and\\nNecessity of Interest (1903). He was chiefly concerned in this work to dem-\\nonstrate a separate productivity inhering in capital, explicable on the grounds\\nof scarcity of supply without recourse to psychological determinants; but the\\ntreatise illuminated the theory of capital in many ways. The services of capital\\nwould be scarce and valuable even in a socialist state: the problem of why\\ninterest exists should not be confused with the ethical issues raised by the\\npossibility of living through owning. Students of capital theory will recall also\\nCassel\\'s suggestion of what we now call a backward rising\" capital supply\\ncurve, and his idea that interest rates (expressed as the number of years\\npurchase) may have some connection with average life expectancy.\\n\\nHis systematic works in value theory include Outlines of an. Elementary\\nTheory of Prices (1899), Fundamental Thoughts in Economics (1925), and\\nA Theory of Social Economy, first published in German in 1918, but not\\navailable in English until 1924. Translated into several languages, the Social\\nEconomy came quickly to be a standard treatise and a widely used textbook\\nin universities throughout the world. It departed from the neoclassical tradi-\\ntion in rejecting what the author regarded as unprofitable speculations as to\\nthe subjective attitudes of suppliers of economic services. Though this ap-\\nproach would be favored by the behaviorist psychology, Cassel\\'s substitution\\nof a mere principle of scarcity for the idea of subjective value underlying the\\nphenomenon of price has not found general acceptance, witness the current\\npopularity of the indifference analysis. The work recommends itself chiefly\\nas a particularly lucid exposition of price theory along the lines of the Walras\\ntradition.\\n\\nCassel\\'s influence upon the world of practical affairs has been largest, how-\\never, in the realm of monetary phenomena. It is here that we find the largest\\npart of his writing for scientific journals and newspapers, and his excellent\\ntracts for the times: TZe World\\'s Monetary Problems (1912), Money and\\nForeign Exchange after 1014 (1922), Outlines of the Development of the\\n', 'Gustav Cassel\\n1866-1945\\n']\n",

Before this\\nmeasure is introduced in Parliament, however, companies are urged to\\nbring their practices in line with the committee\\'s proposals, a suggestion\\nwhich has been followed by a number of prominent firms.\\n\\nThe Cohen committee expresses satisfaction that the great majority of\\nof public and private limited liability companies are managed honestly and\\nare of marked benefit to British trade and industry. The fullest practicable\\ndisclosure of information concerning the activities of companies, in its\\nopinion, will lessen the opportunity for abuse and coincide with an aroused\\nSocial consciousness. The suggestions of the Amendment Committee have\\nbeen aimed at aiding shareholders to exercise a more effective general con-\\ntrol over the management of their companies, although they indicate that\\nthis aim will be attained **more by selection of the proper governing body\\nof each company than by the provisions of any statute.\"\\n\\nWhen viewed in its entirety, the Company Law Amendment Report is\\nseen to stress that the future system of private enterprise must operate with\\ncomplete honesty and with full publicity.

So widespread, in\\nfact, has this procedure become that in 1943 over 600,000 individual hold-\\nings of stocks and shares were registered in the name of nominees of joint\\nstock banks alone.

      "['1946] COMMUNICATIONS 661\\n\\nMr. Sumberg\\'s Interpretation of the Soviet Turnover Tax\\n\\nIn the March, 1946, issue of this Review, Mr. T. A. Sumberg in his article,\\n\"Soviet Union\\'s War Budgets\" provides a valuable summary and analysis\\nof Russian wartime finance. In speaking of the \"turnover tax,\" Mr. Sum-\\nberg states: \"The tax is the main financial instrument by which the Russian\\nstate curtails consumption in order to promote capital construction and\\nnational defense. Offering no possibility of evasion by the taxpayer-\\nconsumer, it is also an efficient weapon for the forced mobilization of the\\ncommunity\\'s savings in the interest of rapid industrialization and urbaniza-\\ntion.\"! This statement suggests a point of view which, it seems to me, should\\nnot be left unchallenged. It is difücult to understand how the tax can\\noperate to curtail consumption. The allocation of resources in Russia as\\nbetween production for war and for civilian purposes has been determined\\nby direct rather than by financial means. The over-all plan predetermined\\nwhat resources were to be devoted to war needs and what to civilian uses.\\nIf by \"consumption,\" is meant \"real\" consumption, it is not clear how the\\nturnover tax made any difference in the quantities of civilian goods made\\navailable to the general public. Soviet civilians would not have had more\\nfood if the tax had not been imposed.\\n\\nOne may also question whether the tax should be regarded as borne by\\nconsumers. In a socialistic state, the price of products sold by the trusts are\\nestablished by administrative rule. Whether the tax raises prices depends\\nnot upon the tax itself but, rather, upon the accompanying instructions, if\\nany, to trust price-fixers as to what price changes are to be made. If no price\\nchange is made with the imposition of the tax, the taxis without significance.\\nA change would be made in accounting terminology only. Instead of all of\\nthe net return of the trusts being called \"profits,\" a part would be called\\n\"turnover tax yield\" and the remainder, if any, \"profits.\" Such a procedure\\nwould alter labels, not substance.\\n\\nThe Soviet practice appears to adjust prices in accordance with changes\\nin the rates of the turnover tax. Even in this event, the tax itself is also of\\nlittle significance; what is important is the decision to charge the public\\ndifferent prices. In a setting of diminishing supplies of real things, Soviet\\nofficials were forced to decide to what extent to employ price and to what\\nextent to employ direct controls to ration the limited supplies among the\\nmembers of the public. A decision to ration by price alone would call for\\nraising prices under such conditions. The price policy of the government is\\nimportant because it determines to what extent monetary mechanics\\n(money expenditures and prices) are to be used to ration available supplies to\\nthe public. Whatever its price policy, it seems untenable to hold that the\\ncivilian population as a whole would be worse off, even if prices were set so\\nhigh as to make all non-monetary rationing devices, such as rationing cards,\\nselected admittance to special stores, standing-in-line, unnecessary. The\\npopulation as a whole would get the same quantities, but a decision to use\\nprice alone to ration might, and probably would, have given some people\\n\\n1 Am. Econ.

CaRL POINDEXTER*\\n', 'Recent preoccupation with the issues of fiscal policy and the na-\\ntional debt has engendered widespread interest in the collateral prob-\\nlem of possible fiscal techniques for minimizing the debt and tax\\nburdens associated with prevailing financial practices.\\n\\nAs is well known, the process of bank-credit creation has long pro-\\nvided the basis for an irrepressible philosophy of monetary reform\\nwhich would eliminate interest payments on government debt arising\\nout of government borrowing from commercial banks. The arguments\\nof its adherents run as follows: The coinage and regulation of money\\nis an exclusive and sovereign prerogative of government; government\\nborrowing from commercial banks is not \"genuine borrowing\"; the\\ngovernment should not be obliged to pay, in perpetuity, hundreds of\\nmillions a year to the banks for the deposit currency which the banks\\nsimply manufacture and turn over to the government in exchange for\\nits bonds; if a fiscal policy which involves the creation of new money\\nis to be pursued, the government, rather than private issuing agencies\\n(banks), should enjoy the seigniorage on the new money issues. In\\nother words, most exponents of these views relating to present fiscal\\npolicy regard government interest payments to the banks as wholly or\\npartly unearned and, at least, a partially unnecessary burden on the\\ngovernment and the taxpayer. They insist, therefore, that if the banks\\nare to be permitted to create the funds which they advance to the gov-\\nernment, a new, fiscally less burdensome method of compensating\\nthem for manufacturing credit for the government should be instituted.\\n\\nOne possible and representative method calls for the issuance to the\\nbanks of special, non-marketable, non-interest-bearing securities. This\\nmethod contemplates that, in return for the monetization of each se-\\ncurity of a given denomination, the banks be paid a \"reasonable\"\\nservice charge at the time of issuance, but nothing in the way of interest\\nthereafter. The criterion of repayment of even the principal of such\\nsecurities would be inflation control, not contractual obligation.\\n\\nAs safeguards against possible inflation, the more subtle proponents\\nof this sort of fiscal innovation propose that the monetary authority be\\ninvested with plenary powers over reserve requirements, open market\\noperations and, in addition, the power to impose special taxes to re-\\ntrieve inflationary excesses in the money supply.\\n\\n\\'\\n* The author is professor of economics at Roanoke College.\\n', 'This content downloaded from 128.235.251.160 on Thu, 1 Jan 2015 05:16:10 AM\\nAII use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\\n']\n",

These objections should not be dismissed\\ntoo lightly. Any outright rejection of methods of visual presentation on\\nthese grounds tends, however, to overlook the fact that economic theory,\\nand for that matter all theoretical thinking, operates with intellectual\\nmodels designed to simplify reality in order to interpret it. Supply and de-\\nmand curves are extreme simplifications whose mechanistic nature has\\noften been questioned by critics of modern value theory. Yet, it will be\\nreadily admitted that these tools, if properly qualified, need not mislead.\\nThey have, in fact, proved to be highly valuable aids of analysis. In short,\\nvisual aids in teaching are not meant to be substitutes for logical thinking.\\nThey are designed to facilitate the process of analysis, especially at the\\nelementary level.\\n\\nWith these qualifications it may even be said that the visual presentation\\nof economic problems has two fundamental advantages. First, it is particu-\\nlarly well adapted to the illustration of complex concepts and ideas through\\noperational definitions. For example, the concept of money is understood\\nfully only in terms of what money does (how it operates) in the economic\\nprocess. If this be true, that is, if we agree with Bridgman that \"the proper\\ndefinition of a concept is not in terms of its properties but in terms of its\\nactual operations,\" it is evident that visual presentation is likely to point\\nmore directly to the phenomena than any spoken or written language. In\\nfact, if properly organized and arranged, visual aids in the teaching of eco-\\nnomics can furnish the mind of the beginner with concepts which, because\\ntheir meaning has been conceived from the very outset with reference to\\nexperience, are bound to correspond more closely with reality than has been\\nthe case hitherto. Secondly, to the extent that methods of visual presenta-\\ntion play a role in the teaching of economics the quality of teaching can be\\nimproved simply by better technical means of presentation (such as dia-\\ngrams, charts, pictures, films) and depends less upon the number of good\\nteachers which, of necessity, is limited at any given time.\\n\\nK.

It is\\nhis fear that public resistance to the necessary taxes would be greatly aug-\\nmented \"were it understood that the government does not have to pay\\ninterest on, or (perchance) even the principal of its debts.\"* In evaluating\\nthis argument we must remember that taxes used to make payments of\\ninterest on principal on the national debt will have considerably less anti-\\ninflationary effect than taxes going into a retained budget surplus, and that\\nconsequently the piling up of an interest-bearing debt will increase the total\\namount of taxes it would be necessary to collect before tax collections began\\nto have an appreciable anti-inflationary effect.

The grounds for\\nthe rejection arise only in small part from peculiarities in my presentation—\\nwhich is termed a \"\\'strict application of \\'pecuniary\\' marginalism\"; much\\nmore they arise from alleged defects inherent in **marginal analysis.\" Thus\\nhis criticisms also refute, or fail to refute, modern price theory.

There is some ambiguity concerning the object of Lester\\'s\\nattack, but it seems a fair inference that to him the empirical content of\\nprice theory is seriously deficient, while the logical structure is usually, but\\nby no means always, valid.

If Professor Lester grants all this,\\nwhat is left of his case against marginal productivity theory?) Professor\\nLester is mistaken in thinking that to take account of such matters is\\n\"troublesome to a marginalist.\" No trouble at all. The cost of changing the\\nwork force is one of the causes—besides the smaller elasticity of the short-\\nrun sales curve and the difficulties of certain types of technical substitution\\n—why marginal productivity curves are less elastic in the short run than\\nin the long run. (Or, if one prefers to look at change-over costs of this sort\\nas part of the conditions of labor supply, they will make the marginal factor\\ncost curve less elastic in the short run than in the long run.) The **mental\\nruts of the marginalists\"? are equipped to take care of all the economic con-\\nsiderations which Professor Lester has mentioned as factors in business de-\\ncisions.

Anyone who reads the symposium on inflation\\nof ten leading economists in the Review of Economics and Statistics for\\nFebruary 1948 cannot fail to be impressed with its thoroughness, its scope,\\nand its fair-mindedness. Vet because of the very meticulousness with which\\nan attempt is made to cover the whole field, resulting impressions are some-\\nwhat blurred. There is, in particular, one vital question the impact of which\\nis obscured and which is left largely to implication. I refer to the relation\\nbetween inflation and the distribution, or rather redistribution, of wealth.\\nHere is a point at which all the most important ideological and social currents\\nof the modern world meet in fateful flow.\\n\\nThe ten participants are in notable agreement on the immediate facts.\\nAIl concede that we are, for the present, in a capital-hungry world. The\\nmemory of secular stagnation troubles Dr. Boulding somewhat, but the\\nother contributors say very little on the subject. While the writer does not\\nwish to beg a vital question, space is lacking in this brief communication for\\nan extended factual argument. We shall here assume (with, however, the tacit\\nsupport, as it seems to me, of most of the participants) that this state of capital\\nhunger is likely to endure—long enough, indeed, for us to begin to treat the\\nsecular problem as inflation rather than the reverse. If more definite statement\\nis demanded, I should say about 25 years. Basis for such an outlook is found\\nin the following considerations: (1) a straight line /ong run trend in consump-\\ntion paralleling output, if anything proportionately higher in future; (2) im-\\nmense increase in public demand for government-provided welfare services\\nrequiring a great deal of capital; (3) general determination of backward\\ncountries to industrialize as quickly as possible and probable willingness of\\nAmericans to help finance the process. These alone, I believe, could account for\\nlong run upward pressure. Add to them the threat of war, and the prospect of\\nsecular upward price trends seems overwhelming.\\n\\nSuch a point of view does not deny the possibility of short-run depression.\\nBut any such stoppages (as Dr. Mills! essay rather clearly shows) are more\\nlikely to be the product of cost-price maladjustment; or *over\"-investment ;\\nor may even conceivably be of an \"Austrian\" character—that is the type of\\ndisturbance analyzed by Lionel Robbins, Hayek, and more recently by J.

      "['Mr. Boulding\\'s Criticism of the Net National Product Concept\\n\\nIn the March 1948 issue of this Review, Mr. Boulding wrote that the\\nconcept of the net national product leads to absurdities and should be\\navoided by those expounding a theory of employment. His argument, as it\\noriginally appeared, was based on a misunderstanding of the currently used\\nconcept of net national product. He wrote (pp. 101-102):\\n\\n\"The *net\" national product is usually defined as the gross product less *\\'de-\\npreciation\"—depreciation being usually confined to plant and machinery. But\\ndepreciation is merely one form of consumption: and if we subtract one part of\\nconsumption (depreciation of industrial fixed capital), why not subtract\\ndepreciation of consumers capital, of houses, automobiles, etc.? And is there any\\nlogical difference between consumption which is spread out over a life-period\\nof a commodity (depreciation) and the consumption of one-use goods such as\\nfuel and foodstufís? It would seem, therefore, that any attempt to define a net\\nproduct by subtracting \"depreciation\" from a gross product will land us\\nlogically in a definition which makes the net product equal to the gross product\\nless all consumption—which is to make the net product equal to accumulation,\\nin which case a stationary society, however rich, would have no net product!\\n\\nThus Mr. Boulding argues that while the concept of gross national prod-\\nuct is meaningful, the attempt to subtract out certain commodities used up\\n\\n?

These may be briefly indicated.\\n\\nFundamentally, Professor Frisch\\'s problem amounts to a determination of\\nthe magnitude of dS/dx, where S represents the skewness of the trade matrix\\nand x represents in turn each of several possible operations which seek to\\nreduce S to zero, subject to the restraint that the reduction in the total\\nvolume of world trade be minimized. Professor Frisch is specifically con-\\ncerned with contrasting the use of proportional import restrictions and cer-\\ntain designated non-proportional import restrictions.\\n\\nHowever, in comparing these alternative operations, Professor Frisch íails\\nto consider the long-run effect of each operation in terms of its inter-country\\nrepercussions. Not only does his analysis rest upon the *asymmetry assump-\\ntion\" noted by Dr. Polak, but it makes the further assumption that when\\nthe active balance of a surplus country is reduced by the import restrictions\\nof the deficit countries, the former country will retain its imports from all\\ncountries at the initial level in spite of the fact that its national income will\\nbe falling due to the decline in its export balance. This unrealistic assumption\\nis merely indicative of the more general neglect in Professor Frisch\\'s analysis\\nof such important coefficients as the marginal propensity to import, income\\nelasticity of demand for imports, price elasticity of demand for imports, and\\nprice elasticities of supply, as well as the total multiplier for each country.\\n\\nThis is indeed a formidable list.

If these repercussions were con-\\nsidered, the results of Professor Frisch\\'s operations may well be the opposite\\nof those presented in his article, depending upon the numerical values of the\\ncoefficients.

The real stimulus can come from the\\nconsumption side. We might put the matter as follows: the people have\\nbecome accustomed to demanding a certain rate of increase of real income.\\nPrice control and restriction of investment might, for a time, halt inflationary\\nprice rise.

The suggestion was incidental to their effective presenta-\\ntion of the case for larger imports. But, in itself, it raises questions—eco-\\nnomic, ethical, political, and administrative—that merit critical examination.\\n\\nAs a matter of economics, the proposal has much to commend it. If assur-\\nance of compensation for possible losses would serve, in fact, to quiet opposi-\\ntion to economic reform, it should justify itself by facilitating adaptation to\\nchanges in the conditions of supply and demand, improving the allocation of\\nresources, and raising planes of living. The cost of such a program should\\nbe far less than that of protecting investors and workers by freezing the pat-\\ntern of production and checking the shift of resources into occupations where\\nthey could be more effectively employed.\\n\\nThe principle of compensating those who may incidentally be harmed by\\naction taken in the general interest appeals, likewise, to the sense of justice.\\nBut it should be noted that this principle has rarely been applied in practice.\\nVarious payments have been made to veterans on the ground that time spent\\nin military service has impaired their relative position in civilian life.

The work of the so-called Douglas Committee is an outstanding\\nachievement. It made a rapid and yet thorough survey of the facts and\\nopinions on the subject and an extremely intelligent appraisal of them, and\\noffered clear-cut, unambiguous recommendations. This report may be con-\\nsidered as a public judgment rendered on the controversy between the fiscal\\nand the monetary authorities. Whether the full Committee accepts the re-\\nport or not and whether Congress takes any action to carry out the Sub-\\ncommittee\\'s recommendations, the fact that such a report has been made may\\nexert a useful influence on the attitudes of the Treasury and the Federal\\nReserve authorities on matters in which their major responsibilities appear\\nto conflict.\\n\\nAn element that adds strength to the report is that its membership included\\nrepresentatives both of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, Re-\\npublicans as well as Democrats. The Senate members were Paul H. Douglas\\n(D., IIl.) chairman, distinguished economist and former president of the Amer-\\nican Economic Association, and Ralph E.

The Committee favors the more impersonal\\nand democratic approach through the money flow over more dictatorial ap-\\nproaches through direct intervention in the economic behavior of individuals.\\n\\nMore specifically, the Committee takes the stand on fiscal policy that it\\nshould contribute to economic stability and should not be dominated by\\nfaith in the curative effects of an annually balanced budget.

AnROW!\\n\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'I\\n\\nPrescriptions for economic policy have been an integral and, indeed,\\ncontrolling part of the economist\\'s activities since the days of Jean Bodin.\\nSuch recommendations can be interpreted as assertions that the proposed\\nchange will increase \"the welfare of society,\" and therefore, by implica-\\ntion, involve a knowledge both of the consequences of the proposal for\\neconomic behavior and of the relation between such behavior and social\\nwelfare. Since Adam Smith, the central proposition has been that welfare\\ncan best be increased by relying on competition and self-interest, though\\nexceptions to this rule were first given prominence by Marshall? In this\\ncentury, there has arisen a considerable literature dealing with the more\\nprecise and logical interpretation of thése propositions. The discussion has\\ntaken several directions: (1) What is the meaning of increasing or maxi-\\nmizing *community welfare\"? Both of the words in quotation marks lead\\nto problems. (2) What are the precise statements of the \\'\\'optimum\" condi-\\ntions? (3) What are the circumstances under which these conditions do\\nnot coincide with the operations of perfect competition? (4) What are the\\nimplications of the answers to (2) and (3) for practical economic policy,\\nincluding the choice between capitalism and socialism and the proper\\neconomic policies under each?\\n\\nMr. Little\\'s new book? has much to say about all four major issues of\\nwelfare economics, but particularly about the first. His fundamental thesis\\nis that the policy recommendations of current work on welfare economics\\ncannot be taken as a safe guide to action because they tend to disregard\\nthe problem of distribution of income and because the empirical assumptions\\nare usually unrealistic. Supplemental to the major theme is a contrapuntal\\nfigure in the bass to the effect that the terminology used by welfare econo-\\nmists has strong emotive connotations, so that statements which are really\\nlogical deductions from doubtful postulates appear to be injunctions to\\naction.\\n\\nThe earlier part of the book is devoted to a critical examination of some\\nof the philosophical problems in the formulation of welfare economics, such\\n\\n!\\'The author is associate professor of economics and statistics at Stanford University.\\nThis paper was partly supported by the Office of Naval Research.\\n\\n?Le, within the framework of orthodox theory.

      "['Some Balance of Payments Pitfalls: Comment\\n\\nI share with Mr. Stephen Enke the opinion expressed in his communica-\\ntion Some Balance of Payments Pitfalls\"* that the terms receipts and pay-\\nments, as used in balance of payments presentations, may be somewhat mis-\\nleading. As may be seen from an examination of our articles in the Survey of\\nCurrent Business, we dropped the terms receipts and payments beginning with\\nthe figures presented in the issue of June, 1950.\\n\\nThe terms receipts and payments may, however, not be so confusing as Mr.\\nEnke seems to suggest. It is true that a credit entry is made for any trans-\\naction which results, or would ordinarily be assumed to result, in a claim on\\nforeign countries, or a reduction of foreign claims on the exporting country.\\nHowever, except in the case of gifts in kind, an offsetting debit will appear,\\nusually in one of the capital accounts, and this debit can be considered to\\nrepresent the payment\" for the export. This Mr. Enke concedes in the para-\\ngraph on the top of page 163. This being the case, where does the confusion\\narise? True, it might be more accurate to label the items \"transactions giving\\nrise to receipts\" instead of just \"receipts,\" as in ordinary bookkeeping sales\\nare usually referred to as receipts. In both cases it might be argued that the\\nreal receipt is the increase in an asset (e.g., cash), which, of course, is by\\nitself a debit entry.\\n\\nThe foregoing notwithstanding, I too prefer the use of the terms debits\\nand credits, although we customarily explain their use in terms of the rule\\ngiven in an elementary accounting text. This rule is simply to debit increases\\nin assets and decreases in liabilities and to credit decreases in assets and in-\\ncreases in liabilities.\\n\\nWith the exception of the unilateral transfers (gifts) and, possibly, income\\non investments, all of the entries in the balance of payments record the re-\\nduction or increase of an asset or liability. Exports of merchandise and\\nservices are credits because they represent a transfer of assets from the re-\\nporting country to foreigners. Similarly, an increase in a United States invest-\\nment abroad is represented by a debit entry because it is an increase in assets\\nof this country. A reduction of foreign investments in the reporting country\\nis a debit because it is a reduction of the country\\'s international liabilities.\\nOf course, it must be kept in mind that (except for the nonmonetary gold\\nentry) only transactions with foreigners are to be recorded in the statement.\\n\\nFor example, if wheat is exported against payment from a foreign dollar\\naccount in New York, the reduction in an asse£ (wheat) is recorded by a\\ncredit entry and the offsetting reduction in a liability is a debit. If a foreign\\ncurrency or bill of exchange had been accepted in payment, the second entry\\nwould still be a debit, of course, but because it reflected an increase in an\\nasset—a claim on foreigners.\\n\\nIt seems to me that this is a much simpler explanation of the debits and\\ncredits than the discussion of cla?ms by Mr. Enke. Actually, in these days\\nall business transactions are settled in claims of one sort or another. If an\\nAmerican exporter receives \"payment\" for his export either in the form of a\\nbalance in a foreign bank or a bill of exchange on the foreign importer, he has,\\n\\n!

I think the answer\\nis yes or no.\\n\\nPrice control on cigarettes worked very well in this country in World\\nWar II even when the shortage was pronounced. The opposite case,\\nwhere price control will not work well without rationing, is aptly\\nillustrated by meat and by clothing.

Many other persons still\\nbelieve that the conflict with Russia will continue to be a cold one\\nindefinitely if we increase our bargaining power by building up our\\nmilitary strength. And for this purpose, partial mobilization is said to\\nbe enough. But for either full or partial mobilization some sorts of\\ndirect price and wage-rate controls are said to be necessary.

How-\\never, what valid inferences can or cannot be drawn from these statistics are\\nnot so generally understood, and the terminology is at times confusing. Most\\npeople know that ** the balance of payments must always balance,\" at least in\\nthe forms usually published, but not so many understand why or how. The\\npurpose of this paper is to indicate a few balance of payments pitíalls.\\n\\nThe international transactions of governments, firms, and residents (as\\ndistinct from citizens) in the United States are recorded in the various ac-\\ncounts of the U.S. Balance of Payments by either plus or minus entries. For\\nexample, it has long been customary to record the sale of exports as a \\'favora-\\nble\" or plus action, and the purchase of foreign securities as an *unfavorable\"\\nor minus action. The algebraic sum of all these recorded transactions should\\nbe zero for any given accounting period, whether it be a week or a year, if all\\nthe conventions are followed and the data are complete and accurate.*\\n\\nLogically, if export sales are positive and a zero balance is to be approxi-\\nmated, any transfers of funds by foreign importers to American exporters\\nmust be viewed as negative. International trade gives rise to two entries in\\nthe U.S. Balance of Payments. The act of sale occasions a plus entry in the\\nmerchandise trade account and the act of settlement occasions a minus\\nentry in some other account. Whether the foreign buyer accepts a bill of\\nexchange or settles in cash, there is a subtraction from one or other of the sub-\\nsidiary Short Term Capital accounts of the United States.\\n\\nA difficulty arises over what to call these plus and minus entries. Some\\npeople—the writer included—refer to plus items as Credits and minus items\\nas Debits. However, the Department of Commerce, and hence an increasing\\nnumber of people, uses the terms Receipts and Payments, respectively. How-\\never, this latter terminology is often confusing because many people not un-\\nnaturally suppose that Recepits of $x for exports means that U.S. exporters\\nreceived $x in funds for their exports and that a minus entry of $y on short-\\nterm bank holdings means that Americans have paid out $y to foreign resi-\\ndents. Actually, each inference would be quite invalid.\\n\\nA Receipts entry of $x on account of exports really means that exporters\\nhave established, through sales during the accounting period, claims to re-\\nceive $x.

Human Action, makes various criticisms of the book\\nwhich deserve reply.\\n\\n1. Schuller claims that Mises asserts a *law of social development whereby\\nthe majority in the long run . . . chooses the system which provides the\\nhigher standards of living.\" Mises makes no such absurd claim. What he does\\nsay is that the majority of a people choose that form of government which\\nthey believe will provide them with highest standards of living. This is\\nsimply saying that all exercise of power rests on the consent to obey by most\\nof the inhabitants.\\n\\n2. Schuller maintains that Mises \"provides no clear test of incorrect versus\\ncorrect praxeological reasoning. \\'\" The tests are, on the contrary, clear\\nenough. Praxeology consists of two main elements: (1) the fundamental\\naxioms, and (2) the propositions successively deduced from these axioms.\\nNeither the axioms nor the deduced propositions can be \"tested\" or verified\\nby appeal to historical fact. However, although the axioms are a Priori to\\nhistory, they are a posteriori to the universal observations of the logical\\nstructure of the human mind and human action. The axioms are therefore open\\nto the test of observation in the sense that, once postulated, they are univer-\\nsally recognized as true. Such recognition may be accused of being \"intro-\\nspective,\" but it is nonetheless scientific, since it is an introspection that can\\ncommand the agreement of all. The deductive propositions are tested accord-\\ning to the universally accepted laws of logic. (Laws, incidentally, which are\\nalso a priori to historical fact.)

Developing Ohlin\\'s work further, Hansson\\'s paper is helpful in relat-\\ning conceptually the structure of production—conceived in terms of the rela-\\ntive abundance or scarcity of different factors of production—in different\\ngroups of economies, to the anticipated and actual pattern of trade between\\nthese groups of economies over different periods in their development. The\\npaper thus sheds light on the way in which complementary patterns of factor\\ndistribution facilitate the multilateral clearance of international accounts.\\n\\nWhile recognizing the importance of his paper, I nevertheless believe Hans-\\nson has erred on several significant points of omission and emphasis:\\n\\n1. Hansson begins his \"general theory\" with the broad statement that *in-\\nternational trade takes place in response to the unequal distribution of the\\nfactors of production\" (p.61). This is, obviously, a relevant generalization but,\\nat least in its present form, misleading. Adam Smith attributed the flow of\\ntrade to the gains from international specialization and division of labor. This\\nneed not—though it »ay—conflict with Hansson\\'s generalization. Consider,\\nfor example, the economic development of that group of underdeveloped\\neconomies referred to by Hansson as \"The Tropics\" (p. 59). As their economic\\ndevelopment proceeds, the structural relationship between the factors of pro-\\nduction—measured in terms of machinery per worker or per square kilometer,\\nwhich are the indexes suggested by Hansson—may be expected to move in\\nthe direction prevailing in the more developed economies; in other words, the\\nsupply of capital in the Tropics may be expected to increase relative to the\\nsupply of land and labor. Does this mean that the stimulus to trade between\\nthe Tropics and the more developed areas will diminish because capital in the\\nTropics comes into relatively moderate\" or *ample\" supply, and hence there\\nis less inequality in factor distribution? Hansson\\'s initial generalization would\\nappear to imply that a more equal distribution of factors of production will\\nrestrict trade. Presumably an exactly equal relative distribution of factors of\\nproduction would eliminate trade entirely among the economies concerned.\\nThis conclusion would appear to be inescapable if trade is presumed to depend\\nsolely on inequality of factor distribution. I submit that this is unacceptable.\\nEven with a similar productive structure in terms of a similar relative abun-\\ndance or scarcity of the same basic factors, it will still be profitable for the\\nfactors to be concentrated on the production of some commodities in one\\ncountry, others in a second country, and for surpluses to be traded. The classi-\\ncal arguments on the gains from international division of labor are obvious\\nand familiar and need not be elaborated. However, they represent a separate\\nstimulus to trade which is lacking in Hansson\\'s schema.\\n\\n2. In Hansson\\'s simplest case (pp. 61 and 63), capital-intensive goods are\\nbought by economy A, which is short of capital but rich in labor, from\\neconomy C which is short of land and rich in capital; economy B, which is\\nrich in land but short of labor, buys labor-intensive goods from A; and\\n\\n* K, E.

The fact, for example, that Canada's trade with the\\nUnited States over the past two decades has been expanding in both directions\\nin real terms at the same time that Canada's pattern of factor distribution has\\nbeen coming closer to that of the United States, indicates empirically that\\nthere is considerably more involved in determining trade pattern and volume\\nthan the relative distribution of the basic factors of production.\\nCuanLEs Worr, Jn.*\\n* The author is presently employed with the Technical Cooperation Administration of\\n\\nthe Department of State.

      "['Reply\\n\\nMy differences with Professor Fellner may be focussed on a single issue of\\ncentral importance. Fellner maintains, in both his Tables I and II, that upward\\ncross-elasticities must be zero between any two firms in atomistic competition\\n(pure or differentiated) ; and he holds, similarly, that positive upward cross-\\nelasticities necessarily imply oligopolistic interdependence. It is my view that\\ncross-elasticities (upward and downward) may be positive, and indeed very\\nlarge, without implying oligopoly. Specifically, cross-elasticities will be high\\nbetween any two members of a large-number group when the products of the\\nrival firms are sufficiently near the homogeneity pole. Fellner\\'s conclusion\\n(usually without the upward-downward distinction) has been the instinctively\\nplausible one to many people.* Hence it is all the more important to emphasize\\nthe grounds for my different view. I do so by means of a numerical example.\\n\\nImagine 1,000,001 suppliers of physically comparable but very, very slightly\\ndifferentiated products. Assume that the firms are all charging equal prices and\\nselling equal quantities. Assume, furthermore, that if the ith firm\\'s price is\\nraised very slightly (with all other prices constant), all but a negligible frac-\\ntion of the business lost by that firm is transferred, in equal amounts, to the\\n1,000,000 other firms in the group. This means that the change in g; will be\\n(approximately) 1,000,000 times the opposite change in any other group\\nmember\\'s g;—in both absolute and percentage terms. For example, if 5; is\\nincreased so that g; declines by 1 per cent, each q; will increase by (approxi-\\nmately) .000,001 per cent. This is the negligible impact of one atomistically\\ncompetitive firm on its fellows. I propose to show that it does not necessarily\\nimply a \"zero\" or negligibly \"small\" cross-elasticity.\\n\\nSuppose, now, that the ith firm\\'s own elasticity E;; (up or down) is\\n—1,000,000,000. To reduce g; by 1 per cent, 5; need be raised by only\\nabout .000,000,001 per cent. Hence the cross-elasticity Ej; is approximately\\n1,000, since the .000,001 per cent increase of g; is 1,000 times the initiating\\npercentage increase of 5;.\\n\\nNow I beg the reader who sits in judgment to contemplate: (1) this very\\nlarge number of firms; (2) this enormous own elasticity, implying a remark-\\nably close approach to product homogeneity; and (3) this very high cross-\\nelasticity!

It seems reasonable to suppose that the optimum rate of population\\ngrowth would be higher during the earlier part of this period when the ratio\\nof population to land and other resources was extremely low and the total\\npopulation was well below an optimum. Further, the inflow of foreign capital\\nduring the first part of this period would raise the optimum rate of growth for\\nthat period. It is also possible that the rate of population growth during part\\nof this period may have exceeded the optimum by a substantial margin.\\n\\nMore recently, the population of the United States has probably approached\\nan optimum and may well have passed it. Accordingly it seems probable that\\nthe optimum rate of growth is now substantially lower than it was during the\\nearlier part of the period, say before 1900. Some economists, in particular\\nthose of the secular stagnation school, are inclined to believe that the rate of\\ngrowth in recent decades has been below the rate necessary to maintain a high\\nlevel of employment. However, the occurrence of two world wars and a great\\ndepression makes the period since 1910 difficult to interpret and a more de-\\ntailed study will be needed to determine whether the optimum rate of growth\\nhas declined more or less than the actual rate of growth in recent decades.

      "['Comment\\n\\nTn an article in the September 1950 issue of this Review Messrs. Ta-Chung\\nand Ching-Gwan Chang argue that the price level should be introduced into\\nthe consumption and investment equations. In justification of this it is argued\\nthat, though this procedure gives *about an equally good\" fit for the prewar\\nperiod it gives a better fit for the three postwar years for which data are\\navailable.\\n\\nThis argument, however, is open to the following criticism. Both the con-\\nsumption equations, the one using and the other ignoring the price term,\\nunderestimate the actual data for the postwar years; this is only as it should\\nbe, for during this period the data were influenced by a special factor, the\\npent-up war demand. In order to derive the true relationship, one would have\\nto subtract this factor from the actual data, and since we do not know how\\nlarge this factor is, we cannot say that the equation coming closer to the actual\\ndata (in a linear way only, for there are points of inflexion in neither the\\ndata nor the estimating equations for these years) gives a better indication of\\nthe true relationship. This consideration is enhanced by the fact that a small\\ndifference in the estimation of the pent-up demand would destroy the signifi-\\ncance of the price term, for the differences between the equation using the\\nprice term and the equation ignoring it are 1/10, 1/8 and 1/3 (for 1946, 1947\\nand 1948 respectively) of the pent-up demand as measured by the difference\\nbetween the actual data and the better fitting of the two equations. Thus the\\nonly evidence to show that the equation using the price term is superior is that\\nof 1948, when the pent-up demand must have been of less importance than in\\nthe two preceding years. To argue from the evidence of one year is obviously\\nmost tenuous. À similar consideration throws grave doubt upon the estimated\\nvalue of the price parameter, the calculated value of the price elasticity and\\nalso on the introduction of a price term in the investment equation.\\n\\n\\'THoMAs Mavzn*\\n* The author is an economic analyst in the office of the chief economist, Bureau of\\n\\nMines.

Since the Magnuson\\nvolumes are undoubtedly the most important study of the financing and\\norganization of medicine since the famous reports of the Committee on the\\nCosts of Medical Care more than twenty years ago, it might be well to\\npresent to economists another version of What Every Economist Should\\nKnow about Medicine.\"\\n\\nLet me say at the outset that Ginzberg makes many wise and penetrating\\nremarks about the economics of medicine and about the Report under discus-\\nsion. As Ginzberg contends, there is little use of pumping more money into\\nmedicine unless an attack on shortages of personnel, equipment, and facilities\\nis also made. Otherwise the effect is likely to be inflation rather than improve-\\nment of service. But this is a principle well known in Washington. Even in\\nthe presentation of its program of National Health Insurance (NHI) the\\nTruman administration time and again stressed the need of limiting addi-\\ntional demands on services to those markets where they were equal to the\\nstrain. No one conversant with recent British experience could be blind to\\nthe danger of a hasty expansion of services offered not offset by an adequate\\nprovision of future supplies. Nor was the Commission blind to this considera-\\ntion.\\n\\nGinzberg raises questions concerning the shortage of personnel, an issue on\\nwhich the Commission is eloquent. The application of doctor-population ratios\\nin rich states to the nation necessarily reveals a shortage of physicians. This\\napproach, credited to the Commission, is faulty, as Ginzberg contends.\\n(Though this is not the only approach used—see Vol. I, p. 13.) Ginzberg\\nreally seems to believe that there is no shortage of physicians. He should\\ncompare each of the following variables for 1900 and 1950: the supply of\\ndoctors, the number of annual medical graduates, per capita national income,\\npopulation, the demands put upon the medical profession by increasing births\\nand the proportion of the aged in the population, the additional needs related\\nto improved financing and organization, the requirements (present and\\nprospective) set by the cold war, the scarcities of psychiatrists and the in-\\ncreased need for them, the increased complexities of medicine, the maldistri-\\nbution of personnel both geographically and occupationally (inclusive of an\\nexcessive number of specialists relative to practitioners). Against these factors\\nall pointing to additional needs (often unmet because of financial obstacles to\\nseeking medical care), we can only weigh the improved quality of the doctor,\\nthe greater ease of getting around, and, as the American Medical Association\\nso frequently points out, improved teamwork. (Nurses complain bitterly, how-\\never, of the unwillingness of physicians to allow them to assume responsibili-\\nties of which they are capable.) On the issue of teamwork, it might be said\\n', '922\\n', 'THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\\n']\n",

      "['International Price Ratios and International Trade Theory\\n\\nIn the absence of trade, or when the obstacles to trade in the form of tariffs\\nand costs of transport are significant, the price structure in one country would\\nnot be expected to duplicate the price structure in another. Differences in factor\\nendowments in the various countries would normally lead to a wide difference\\n\\naP4 yP4\\nand (or to put this differently, between\\nzP, B yP, B yP. A\\n\\nbetween the ratios\\n\\nand Pr where P is the price of A4, Ps the price of B, and the subscripts\\nyPs\\n\\nx and y refer to the two countries X and Y. This is the familiar basis of inter-\\n\\nnational trade theory, and it is commonly employed to account for the composi-\\n\\ntion of trade.\\n\\nIn theory too, when trade is unhampered and costless these differences in\\nprice ratios disappear. If such differences can still be observed after trade is\\nopened, they are taken to reflect the existence of transport costs, tariffs, or\\nother expenses of trade. To explain trade, then, we must first account for such\\ndifferences in price structure as would exist were trade impossible; and in\\norder to explain the observed differences in price structures once trade is\\nopen, we must look for various costs of transfer.\\n\\nAn explanation along these lines is generally put forward when we seek to\\nshow why, for instance, Canada sells us wood pulp, while she buys automo-\\nbile parts from us. The two products differ so greatly that we may reasonably\\nhope to explain, in terms of the different factor endowments of the two coun-\\ntries, why the ratio of the Canadian price of wood pulp to the U.S. price of\\nthe same product would, in the absence of trade, be much lower than the\\ncomparable ratio for automobile parts. We would have looked, until recently\\nat any rate, for the Canadian price (in the absence of trade) to be especially\\nlow for that product which required for its production a relatively large\\namount of the factor which Canada possesses in relatively (to the United\\nStates) ample supply.* Finally such price discrepancies as are seen to exist, are\\nsupposed to reflect tariffs and other costs of transfer, and they would not be\\nexpected to exceed these transfer costs.\\n\\nWithin certain classes of products, however, we should have no obvious\\nreason to expect different price ratios, despite the different factor endowments\\n\\n? But recent work on both the theoretical and statistical basis for this view shows that\\nit may not be correct; see for example, S. F. James and I. F. Pearce: \"The Factor Price\\nEqualisation Myth,\" Rev. Econ.

      "['Sales and Output Taxes\\n\\nThe application of K. E. Boulding\\'s asset-indifference technique! to taxation\\nproblems is of particular importance? to economists interested in public policy\\nbecause the results occasionally differ markedly from those obtained from the\\ncustomary analysis based on the assumption that production always equals\\nsales. The purpose of this note is to re-examine two of the tax cases Boulding\\ntakes up and then to analyze briefly a third important case. A more meaningful\\nand realistic result is obtained in Boulding\\'s first case when an important\\nassumption of his is removed and his analysis extended. A serious error in\\nreasoning is discovered in his second case.\\n\\nSince Boulding\\'s asset-indifference apparatus is perhaps not, as yet, well\\nknown, a short preliminary explanation of this technique seems in order. Its\\nbasic assumption is that firms aim at preferred holdings of goods and other\\nassets at a point of time rather than mere profit maximization over a period of\\ntime. The initial asset position of the firm is depicted by P, in Figure 1. The\\nordinate of P, shows the firm\\'s initial money stock and the abscissa the original\\ncommodity stock. P,R,P, is the firm\\'s *production opportunity line\" or total\\ncost curve showing the possible combinations of money and commodity attain-\\nable by producion. P,R, represents the total fixed cost and R,P, the total vari-\\nable cost in the present period. If the firm does not produce in this period, its\\nmoney stocks will simply fall by P,R, and the firm\\'s new asset position will\\nbe R,. The marginal cost of production, the slope of R, P, is assumed in this\\ndiagram to increase as output increases.\\n\\nP,K;, the firm\\'s *exchange path,\" shows the amount of money obtainable\\nby selling the commodity in the market. Since a perfect market is assumed\\nin Figure 1, total revenue increases at a constant rate. Thus the slope of P,K,\\nis constant and its absolute value equals the market price. The firm will ex-\\nchange commodity for money until it has reached the highest indifference curve\\ntouching its exchange path. It is readily seen from the diagram that, to get as\\nhigh up the utility surface as possible, this perfectly competitive firm will move\\nalong its production opportunity line, P,R,P;, to that point where an exchange\\npath is just tangential to it and then will proceed along that exchange path to\\nK, where an indifference curve is tangential to it. Optimum output is then\\nQiP,, optimum sales P,S,, and optimum inventory accumulation S,Q,.\\n\\nL A Fixed Tax on a Perfectly Competitive Firm\\nBoulding concludes that a fixed tax on a perfectly competitive firm (1) will\\nnot affect production, sales or price if the marginal rate of substitution is\\ninvariant with respect to the amount of money and (2) will affect sales but\\nneither production nor price if the indifference curves are not parallel. The\\nsecond conclusion seems faulty* since it is incorrect to assume the market price\\n* K, E. Boulding, A.

His investigations led him to believe\\nthat these same four factors are likely to be operating in the future, assuring\\nthat organized labor will *grow steadily in the long run.\" It is apparent that\\nto \"grow steadily in the long run\" encompasses a very wide range of possi-\\nbilities, but it is clear from the entire context of the article that Bernstein is\\noptimistic concerning the prospects for the future growth of organized labor.\\nBernstein also analysed the relation of the business cycle to union growth,\\nand concluded that unionism will \"suffer little or no loss in bad times.\"\\n\\n*I.

He\\nfurther concludes that cyclical changes are \"useless\" in understanding secular\\nexpansion in union membership and only sporadically helpful in respect to\\nshort-term changes.\\n\\nOn the affirmative side, Bernstein summarizes his findings as follows:?\\nA multicausal system (including the cycle) is necessary to account for\\nthe rise of trade unionism. The primary forces that have shaped secular\\ngrowth are the expansion of the labor force, growing social acceptability\\nof unionism, increasing homogeneity in the working class, and extension\\nof collective bargaining provisions for union security.

      "['Reply\\n\\nMy excise tax article, against which Professor Buchanan directs most of his\\nfire, was devoted exclusively to the effects of excise taxes alone. Any tax in\\nisolation reduces private spending and is deflationary since it takes money\\nfrom private individuals. The nature of this deflationary effect is properly the\\nsubject of monetary theory. Rather than conduct an exercise in monetary\\ntheory every time one says something about a particular tax, it is convenient\\nto ignore—or abstract from—the tax\\'s deflationary impact. Throughout my\\nexcise tax analysis I therefore relied on a \"compensating variation\" in the\\nform of *a reduction of personal income taxes, or an increase in government\\ntransfer payments, or both, so as to keep the level and distribution of dis-\\nposable income unchanged\" (p. 300). This assumption was simply a method-\\nological device to avoid handling the deflationary impact that a tax in isola-\\ntion exerts. I was not concerned with the effects of personal income taxes\\nand/or transfer payments on capital values, asset earnings, or the capitaliza-\\ntion rate. More accurately, I was ignoring whatever effects exerted by other\\nfiscal acts like my hypothetical compensating variation, government spending,\\ndebt operations, or any other actions that would in real life prevent the defla-\\ntion that a tax in isolation would cause. I implicitly assumed that the particu-\\nlar compensating variation I employed was \"neutral\" and would not affect\\nasset earnings, the capitalization rate, or capital values.\\n\\nBuchanan, however, asserts that the reduction of personal income taxes\\n(and the increase of transfer payments), with the imposition of my general\\nexcise tax, will increase asset earnings and the rate of return in such a way as\\nto offset exactly the effects I attribute to the excise tax alone. Hence he\\nappears to reach the same general capitalization outcome I reach, although\\nfor different reasons.\\n\\nBuchanan holds the capitalization rate is derived from the cash payout of\\nassets after personal income taxes (and transfer payments). He suggests that\\n', 'tax must allow another tax to be reduced in like amount or allow government\\nincome to increase in the same magnitude. The economist, when considering\\nfiscal actions, is placed under much the same restrictions as the double-entry\\nbookkeeper, and íallacious conclusions are often analogous to unbalanced\\naccounts.\\n\\nIt has not been the purpose of this note to suggest that the so-called general\\ntaxes do, in fact, tend to be capitalized. As Einaudi suggests, the final results\\ncannot be determined from any simple sort of analysis. The effects of the levy\\nof a \"general\" excise, corporation income, or property tax, combined with the\\nnecessary offsetting variations in other taxes and/or government expenditures\\nmay increase, reduce, or leave unchanged the average net yield on real capital.\\nSimilarly such action may increase, reduce, or leave unchanged the rate of\\ninterest which is appropriate for capitalization purposes.\\n\\nJAMES M.

In the latter con-\\nnection, it should be noted that Rees at one point merely claimed that \"it is\\nequally easy to argue that collective bargaining in the basic steel industry\\nduring this period kept wages below the level which they would otherwise\\nhave reached, or to argue that it raised wages above such a level.\" However,\\nit is elsewhere made abundantly clear that he regarded the first inference as\\nmore equal than the second.

Our comments follow this\\norder.\\n\\n1. Money is unique in the sense that no other financial asset is exactly like\\nit. But as much, or rather as little, could be said for any financial asset. The\\nimportant consideration here for monetary, interest, and price-level theory\\nis how the demand for money is affected by demand for and terms of supply\\nof other financial assets. And on this point we share the general belief with\\nCulbertson that money has many close substitutes. He cites as examples\\ntreasury bills, time deposits, savings bonds, and savings and loan shares. To\\nthe extent that such substitutes are available, then, the demand for money\\nis less than it otherwise would be. This is the essential point: the \"uniqueness\\nof money\" is a red herring.\\n\\n2. The manner in which financial assets are to be grouped or ranked de-\\npends on the problem. A way of grouping financial assets that is appropriate\\nfor one array of problems does not preclude other ways that bear on different\\nproblems. Our main interests are in analyzing the relationship between real\\ngrowth and financial growth, in isolating the function of intermediation for\\nspecial study, and in considering the relative roles during the growth process\\nof monetary and nonmonetary intermediaries. Since the accumulation of\\ndirect (or primary) debt almost inevitably accompanies real growth, and\\nsince a principal function of the monetary system and other financial inter-\\nmediaries is to purchase direct debt from and issue indirect debt to non-\\nfinancial spending units, the framework of direct and indirect debt seems\\nadmirably suited to our interests.\\n\\nWe do not object to other schemes for classifying financial assets. The\\ndifference between equity and debt, ambiguous though it is, can be useful in\\nstudying business organization, business incentive and motivation, or stability\\nof business income and spending. The difference between short-term and long-\\nterm securities, arbitrary as it is, is relevant to study of the interest-rate\\nstructure. A ranking of financial assets along a liquidity spectrum may be\\nuseful in explaining asset-holders\\' behavior on the commodity markets, which\\nmay or may not be the problem Culbertson has in mind (he never says) when\\nhe advocates such a procedure. All of these methods can be useful, but to\\nimply, as Culbertson does, that one has to settle once and for all on money-\\nbonds, liquidity-illiquidity, direct-indirect, or some fourth or nth grouping\\nand stick with it through thick or thin without stipulating the purpose for\\nwhich it is used, is to miss the mark completely.\\n', 'Reply\\n', '132\\n', 'THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\\n']\n",

The first reference to\\nA & P [9, p. 922] is included in a general description of the importance of the\\ntwenty companies in their respective industries and the extent to which they\\n\"dominate a whole industry and are price leaders.\" The second reference [9,\\np. 935] has to do with the pricing practices in specific markets of several\\ncompanies, including A & P. In the first context, it is my position that A & P\\ndoes not dominate nor make decisions for a whole industry in the sense that\\nU. S. Steel does. However, the District Court decision is replete with evidence\\nof how A & P brought its absolute resources to bear against actual and poten-\\ntial competitors in particular localities—a pattern of behavior which A & P\\nhas rationalized as *meeting competition.\"\\n\\nOn the issue of the A & P case in question, Adelman is rolling a rusty hoop.\\nIf, as Adelman asserts, A & P\\'s objective in operating unprofitably for sev-\\neral weeks was purely and simply to reduce its \"expense rate,\" one is en-\\ntitled to inquire: Why was this effort to reduce expense rates not undertaken\\nearlier? Was it mere coincidence that A & P\\'s prices were lowered t4e day\\nbefore the opening of a Giant Fagle store in Pittsburgh, that six weeks fol-\\nLlowing the opening of a Food Fair store in Richmond a \"special competitive\\ncompaign\" was inaugurated by A & P, and that \"special programs\" were set\\nup £Aree weeks ahead of the opening of other Food Fair stores (see below)?\\n\\nThe A & P cases and Adelman\\'s defense of A & P have been so widely read\\nand extensively reviewed [1] [2] [3] [4] [5], that it seemed unnecessary to\\nevaluate once again the facts and evidence upon which the District Court\\nbased its decision, upon which the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the de-\\ncision, and upon which A & P had to make its determination not to appeal\\nfurther. However, since Adelman\\'s observations would leave the impression\\nwith the reader that I had only very skimpy evidence for my conclusions on\\nA & P\\'s practices, some of the numerous examples of A & P\\'s policy of selec-\\ntive price cutting, ?lanned losses, and subsidy policy must be mentioncd.\\nMany examples could be cited, but because of space limitations I am not able\\nto provide all of the relevant quotations from the decisions of the courts.\\n\\nMany units of the company operated at a loss over extended periods of time\\n[13, pp. 664-69], e.g., Boston and Providence from 1934 through 1941;!\\n\\n\\' Even after all credits, the Boston and Springfield units lost money for five years in\\nsuccession, and the Los Angeles unit lost $1,406,194 over the 1932-1940 period [4, p. 18].\\n', '679\\n', 'COMMUNICATIONS\\n']\n",

I would like to go further and suggest that\\nthe Presidential Advisory Committee (or Weeks) Report shows a striking\\nlack of general economic intelligence which involves it in at least two basic\\ninconsistencies. If the issues to be raised here were outdated there would of\\ncourse be no reason to subject the Weeks Report to further scrutiny at this\\ntime. However, the basic inconsistencies continue to permeate discussions of\\nnational transportation policy to such an extent that it is important to bring\\nthem out into the open.\\n\\nAs is well known, increased reliance on competitive forces in transportation\\nis the major general recommendation of the Weeks Report and one which\\nhas received fairly widespread support. It is unquestionably true that the\\nmonopoly position of the railways is much weaker than before 1920 but to\\nargue that the entire transportation industry operates under the checks and\\nbalances of vigorous and pervasive competition is going a bit too far. Those\\nwho talk in these terms are moving in the direction of identification of the\\ntransport market as a whole with perfect or, at least, monopolistic competi-\\ntion. For example, the Weeks Report argues that the *net result [of the\\n*transport revolution] is a competitive system of transportation that for all\\npractical purposes has eliminated the monopoly element which characterized\\nthis segment of our economy some thirty years ago\" [8, p. 1]. Though not\\ngoing quite so far, many economists have emphasized the strength and\\nubiquity of competitive elements in transportation [4, p. 918] [5, pp. 26-28].\\n\\nBut economists have also frequently pointed out the complexities of the\\ntransport market [3, p. 83] [6, p. 245], complexities which are largely\\ninconsistent with competitive models. Transportation service is supplied by\\nhighly diverse enterprises operating under widely different technical, economic\\nand market conditions. The unit of output is much more complex than an\\nalleged homogeneous ton-mile. It involves considerations of speed, flexibility,\\nsafety, and dependability, all of which differ substantially among the various\\nmedia. Thus in the transport market we have naturally heterogeneous products\\nemanating from the different competitiors and vast differences among the\\ncompetitors themselves with respect to production costs (the level, structure\\nand shape of the cost functions) and physical facilities. Depending upon the\\nparticular needs or preferences of various shippers, these differences engender\\nvastly different elasticities of demand for the services of a particular medium\\nin the various segments of the market, and hence varying degrees of monopoly\\npower even on those route segments where a variety of transport forms of all\\ntypes are available. But in fact both the availability of forms of transport\\nand numbers of firms differ substantially throughout the country.\\n\\nThese complexities on both the supply and demand side of the various\\nmarket segments render transportation a hodgepodge running the gamut\\nfrom conditions of nearly perfect competition to near monopoly.

      "['The Pure Theory of International Trade: Comment\\n\\nIn his admirably lucid and comprehensive survey of The Pure Theory\\nof International Trade\" [1] Robert Mundell ends his analysis by a com-\\nmendable attempt to see how far the results of the simple two-country\\ntwo-commodity model remain valid in a multicountry multicommodity\\nworld. He concludes that in the latter case it is necessary to assume that\\ntax proceeds are spent entirely on domestic goods in order to establish the\\nconclusion that the terms of trade are improved by a uniform import duty,\\na consumption tax on imports, or a production tax on exports [1, pp. 105-7,\\nesp. n. 30], whereas in the former model this conclusion can be derived on\\nthe assumption that tariff proceeds are redistributed and their expenditure\\ndivided between the goods in accordance with marginal propensities to con-\\nsume. The contrast between the results for the two models is curious in view\\nof the well-known Hicksian theorem that a bundle of commodities whose\\nprices change in the same proportion can be treated as a single good; and\\nit turns out that the difference is due to an error in Mundell\\'s treatment\\nof the income effect in his elasticities of demand for imports. When this\\nerror is corrected, it appears that there is no difference between the two\\ncases. For brevity, the demonstration is confined to the effect of a uniform\\nimport duty.\\n\\nMundell shows that, on the assumption that all export goods are gross\\nsubstitutes (an increase in the price of one country\\'s exports, other prices\\nconstant, improves the balance of payments of every other country), a\\nchange in one country\\'s policy will definitely improve its terms of trade if\\nit has the effect of worsening the balance of payments (at initial prices) of\\nevery other country. The problem is therefore to determine the effect of\\nthe policy change on the balance of payments of the typical other country.\\nFor a tariff whose proceeds are spent on home goods, Mundell writes this\\neffect as —7;015o, where Io is the initial quantity imported from country 7\\nby country O (which has imposed the tariff). The elasticity y;o is described\\nas \"the elasticity of demand for imports (with respect to own price) ...\\nfrom country j to country O\" [1, p. 106]. If this is understood in the usual\\nsense of the elasticity with respect to the price of 7\\'s good, Mundell\\'s ex-\\npression for the effect of the tariff is clearly erroneous, since the tariff\\nchanges the prices of the other countries\\' exports to country O, with cross-\\neffects on O\\'s imports from j which are not represented in the formula.\\nMundell has since explained (in correspondence) that he meant «jo to stand\\nfor the elasticity with respect to the price of country O\\'s domestic good;\\nthe revised definition is assumed in what follows.\\n\\nSince mo is positive by the gross-substitutes assumption, country j\\'s\\nbalance of payments is necessarily worsened; hence a tariff whose proceeds\\nare spent on domestic goods necessarily improves the terms of trade of the\\n', 'CURIE er UTR DUE\\n\\nPAUL A.

Hagen\\'s hypothesis\\nthat birth rates depend on death rates but that \"birth rate and size of family\\ncalculus . . . is imbedded in unconscious motives relating to sex and family\\ninculcated in children during their first six years\" (p. 319) seems to me an\\nobvious oversimplification.! Various objections are possible but in my judg-\\nment the most important is that the hypothesis ignores the fact that many\\nchildren are \"unwanted\" in the particular sense that they would not be born\\nif birth control or abortion were readily available.?\\n\\nRecent Japanese experience provides remarkable evidence of the extent to\\nwhich children may in this sense be unwanted.\" Currently, between 40 and\\n60 per cent of all pregnancies (depending on the number of unreported abor-\\ntions) are being terminated by abortion, which is both legal and financed by\\nthe national health insurance program. As pregnancy rates have not declined\\nsignificantly, it seems clear that the drop in the Japanese birth rate from 34.3\\nin 1947 to 17.2 in 1957 can only be attributed to the legalization and wide-\\nspread utilization of abortion.\\n\\nDevelopments in Japan obviously cannot be explained by Hagen\\'s hypothe-\\nsis. If decisions regarding family size were in fact inculcated in children during\\ntheir first six years, then the number reaching child-bearing age in a decade\\ncould explain a halving of the birth rate only if new mothers had been incul-\\ncated to want no children whatsoever—in this case during the height of\\nJapanese militarism!\\n\\nBut it is not the technical inadequacy but the inadequacy of the policy\\nimplications of Hagen\\'s hypothesis that I want to stress. If one took his\\nhypothesis literally, birth rates could only be lowered by reducing death rates\\nand then waiting a generation for changing subconscious inculcations to reduce\\nbirth rates. Actually, even if we accept his formulation for \"wanted\" children,\\nso long as unwanted\" children are being born birth rates can be lowered as\\nrapidly as birth control or abortion can be made available. Perhaps the propor-\\ntion of *unwanted\" pregnancies in Japan is higher than it will be found to be\\nin other areas.

      "['Elementary Economics and Depreciation Accounting\\n\\nMost introductory courses in economics describe depreciation, a technical\\naccounting concept with far-reaching implications for economics, in extremely\\nmisleading terms. Students are confused by depreciation in abbreviated ex-\\nplanations of business financial statements or in discussions of national income\\naccounts. Kuhlman and Skinner, in a recent text, are typical of the first.\\n* Businesses, like consumers, save by not spending all of their income. They\\nmay set aside depreciation and obsolescence allowances in order to be able to\\nreplace plant and equipment\" [9, p. 180]. The explanation does not jibe with\\nPaton and Littleton on corporate accounting standards: \"Under accrual ac-\\ncounting, depreciation is not a valuation process nor a means of capturing re-\\nplacement prices from customers\" [11, p. 17]. Jome, in a text on money and\\nbanking, states that Good accounting policy seems to dictate that the purpose\\nof the depreciation charge, after all, is to recover the money paid for an asset\\nalready constructed\" [7, p. 429]. But the accountant May denies this policy:\\n\"Tt is a gross error to assume that it is a part of the function of accounting\\nto insure by depreciation charges or otherwise, the return of the investment\\nthat has been made in the entity\" [10, p. 24].\\n\\nThe basic problem here is that economists are using a word which has a\\n\"dictionary\" or layman\\'s meaning, but which also has a technical definition in\\nthe field of accounting. If economics insists on precise definitions for its own\\npurposes of such common words as investment, capital, labor, profit, and\\ncompetition, then should it not also recognize this practice in other fields?\\nAccountants draw a clear distinction between Webster\\'s definition of depreci-\\nation and their technical one, which they describe as an artificial convention.\\nThe American Institute of Accountants has formulated a standard expression\\nfor this arbitrary or conventional usage which can be duplicated by reference to\\nleading authorities in the field of accounting. *Depreciation accounting [is] a\\nsystem of accounting which aims to distribute the cost or other basic value of\\ntangible capital assets, less salvage (if any), over the estimated useful life\\nof the assets in a systematic and rational manner. It is a process of allocation\\nand not valuation\" [3, p. 76].\\n\\nThe outlook of accounting records is to the past. Depreciation charges refer\\nto an expenditure which has taken place, and are merely a special method of\\nwriting history. Depreciation accounting enables the business firm to make\\nseveral ledger entries, instead of one, when a capital expenditure occurs. The\\nproblem of replacement, which is not the purpose of depreciation, requires an\\noutlook to the future. Sunk costs, expenditures which have already taken\\nplace, have no relevance to present or future investment opportunities. The\\naccountants\\' use of depreciation—merely a method of recording a cost—en-\\nsures that no backward glance to a past expenditure which is over and done\\nwith can influence the rational consideration of a new decision on capital\\ninvestment.\\n\\nSome text-writers, fascinated by the role of \"internal\" funds in expanding\\nbusiness capacity, discuss depreciation charges as a source\" of money capital.\\n*Among the various sources of capital, depreciation charges are extremely\\n', '154\\n', 'THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\\n']\n",

But during the\\nfirst half of the twentieth century, certainly, the overwhelming majority of\\neconomists, following Alfred Marshall [8, pp. 71-72], have shown a tendency\\nto use the concept of capital as applicable only to that portion of the non-\\nhuman, material, man-made stock of wealth which is utilized directly in fur-\\nther production.\\n\\nIn spite of \"majority opinion\" the application of the capital concept to\\nman has not disappeared from economic literature? and the past few years\\nespecially have witnessed a revival of the idea in U.S. economic journals. In\\nthe forefront of scholarly efforts in this direction stands the work of \\'Theo-\\ndore W. Schultz [13]-[17].\\n\\nI shall grant unequivocally that theoretical models, incontestable from\\nan abstract or mathematical point of view, can be built on the basis of the\\napplication of the capital concept to man. Yet, I shall contend that it is gen-\\nerally inadvisable to treat man as human capital.\\n\\nSchultz believes that the main reason for the opposition to the human cap-\\nital concept is based on a somewhat irrational fear that to accept the concept\\nwould be morally wrong and degrading to free man [13, p. 572] [16, p. 2]\\n[17, p. 110]. This, however, is not the reason for my opposition. It is my con-\\ntention that, mainly for three reasons, economics has little to gain and much\\nto lose by the universal application of the capital concept to man:\\n\\nFirst, *investment in man\" is essentially different from investment in non-\\nhuman capital. The difference arises largely from the fact that, as a general\\nrule, at least a part of any one direct expenditure for the improvement of man\\nis not investment as the term is usually used, i.e., it is undertaken for reasons\\nother than the expectation of a monetary return, it has no traceable effects on\\nfuture output and it satisfies wants directly. To the extent to which any part\\nof such an expenditure is investment in this sense it is rarely if ever \"rational\"\\ninvestment based on a careful comparison of alternate investment opportuni-\\nties, with the anticipated monetary return and the degree of safety as guiding\\nrods. Furthermore, any such part is inseparable from other parts which, not\\nbeing classified as investment, are then conveniently referred to as consump-\\ntion expenditure.\\n\\nSecondly, were it possible to separate consumption expenditure from invest-\\nment in man it would still remain a virtual impossibility to allocate a spe-\\ncific return to a specific investment in man (though aggregate expenditures for\\nthe improvement of man\\'s skill, abilities, and productive capacities certainly\\n\\n* See for instance [11] [19, pp. 265-66] [5, p. 13] [4, p. 65].\\n?

Harry G. Shaffer discusses some of the minor\\ndifficulties that arise in practice in distinguishing between consumption and\\ninvestment expenditures in the formation of human capital and then examines\\nin considerable detail, and in my judgment correctly, some major difficulties in\\nidentifying and measuring the earnings (return) that are associated with a\\nparticular investment in man. Shaffer does not object to the concepts of in-\\nvestment in man and human capital; on the contrary, he explicitly accepts\\nthe underlying theory. He is, also, careful to disassociate himself from those\\nwho believe that it is morally wrong to apply the concepts of investment and\\ncapital to people. However, if any new knowledge were attainable by the use\\nof these concepts, despite the empirical difficulties, Shaffer appears to believe\\nthat such knowledge would be grossly misused—by implication, more so than\\nother economic knowledge—in making policy decisions. This view of the rela-\\ntion between economic analysis and policy seems unreal and irrelevant.\\n\\nShaffer\\'s first point is addressed to the question: When are educational ex-\\npenditures consumption and when are they investment? This question deserves\\ncareful investigation because so much depends upon the correctness of the\\nanswer. To follow the conventional procedure of treating all such costs as\\nserving only current consumption will not do. But to allocate all of these costs\\nto investment in future earnings, is fully as extreme and unwarranted. Al-\\nthough the economic logic for allocating the costs of education is clear and\\ncompelling, no one has as yet developed a wholly satisfactory empirical pro-\\ncedure for identifying and measuring the particular resources that enter into\\neach of these components. Faced with this difficulty, any allocation that one\\nmakes, based on such clues as seem relevant, must in all honesty be labeled\\n\"arbitrary.\" There is little intellectual comfort in the fact that a similar brand\\nof arbitrariness characterizes other areas of analysis, for example, in the way\\nexpenditures for electricity and for automobiles used by farmers are divided\\nand distributed between household and farm expenses, or the way a part of\\nthe costs of some private residences used for offices, libraries or studies are\\ntreated as business expenses.\\n\\nIn discussing the central question of allocating resources between consump-\\ntion and investment, Shaffer emphasizes two facts, namely that most students\\nattend public schools, and that up to a certain age school attendance is com-\\npulsory. But neither of these facts is relevant to a logical basis for distinguishing\\nbetween consumption and investments.

But most thought it would be\\nhealthy if it led to a better understanding of Solovian growth. So the King\\nappointed a task force to learn the facts of Solovian economic life.\\n\\nThe committee reported that the labor force and population in Solovia grew\\nexponentially at the rate x. The number of working Solovians, JV;, at time £\\nwas therefore given by\\n\\n(1) N,-— Ner, Y.\\n\\n\\'The report expressed confidence that Solovia\\'s supply of natural resources\\nwould remain adequate. It portrayed a competitive economy making full and\\nefficient use of its only scarce factors, labor and capital, in the production of a\\nsingle, all-satisfying commodity. Returns to scale were observed to be con-\\nstant, and capital and labor were found to be so substitutable that fears of\\ntechnological unemployment were dismissed.\\n\\nThe committee described the steady progress in Solovia\\'s ways of produc-\\ntion. It estimated that the efficiency of Solovian capital was increasing at the\\nrate À and that Solovian labor was improving at the rate y. A continuation of\\nthese rates of technical advance was anticipated. Therefore production, P;, at\\ntime £4, was the following function of available capital, K;, and the current\\nlabor force:\\n\\n(2) P, — F (PK, , e! N,), 20,5420\\n\\nThe report acknowledged further investigation of the production function\\nmight prove to be desirable.\\n\\n\"Then the task force approached the growth issue. It doubted that technolog-\\nical advance could be accelerated and it took no positive stand on popula-\\ntion increase. If y , 4 and y. were fixed parameters, then hope had to rest en-\\ntirely on investment. While maintenance of the existing ratio of capital to\\nlabor would permit output per worker and per head to grow by virtue of\\ntechnical progress, the report voiced the hope that higher incomes and perhaps\\na greater growth rate would be sought through a continuous increase in capital\\nper worker, or what the task force called capital-deepening. It concluded by\\ndeclaring the proper pace of capital-deepening to be a momentous question for\\nSolovian political economy.\\n\\nThe King commended the task force for its informative and stimulating re-\\nport. He invited all his subjects to join in search of an optimal investment\\npolicy. Solovian theorists considered dozens of fiscal devices for their effi-\\n', 'COMMUNICATIONS\\n']\n",

The National Service Life Insur-\\nance dividends paid out early in 1950 were regarded as windfall income, and\\ntwo regressions were computed, both using disposable income and windfall in-\\ncome as independent variables. In the first equation total consumption was the\\ndependent variable while in the second equation durable goods purchases were\\nexcluded. The regressions showed \"that the marginal propensity to consume\\nout of windfall income does not appear to be appreciably lower than the mar-\\nginal propensity to consume out of regular income\" [3, p. 614]. And this\\n\"strong tendency to spend windfall income\" is at variance with the permanent\\nincome hypothesis.\\n\\nSince data concerning the behavior of windíall income recipients is rela-\\ntively scanty, and since such data can constitute an important test of the\\npermanent income hypothesis, it is of interest to bring to bear on the hy-\\npothesis whatever information is available. One such body of evidence is con-\\ntained in the Israeli Survey of Family Savings of 1957/58.! That survey\\ncollected data on the behavior of recipients of lump-sum personal restitution\\npayments from Germany. About 4 per cent of the urban population received\\nsuch payments during the year covered by the survey, averaging 3000 Israeli\\npounds per recipient family. Average disposable income of these families was\\n1£3400. Since the payments considered here were nonrecurring and since\\nthey were not anticipated well in advance, they can be regarded as windfall\\nincome.\\n\\nIn order to appraise the effect of restitution payments on consumption, the\\nbehavior of spending units receiving such payments was compared to that of\\nnonrecipients belonging to the same socio-economic group. It was found that\\n\"consumption outlays (including the purchase of durable consumer goods)\\nper pound of current income were about 375 times as much as outlays per\\npound of one-time receipts\" [2, p. 18]. In the case of nondurable consumption\\nthe equivalent ratio was 515. On the basis of this comparison it was esti-\\n\\n!

      "['The Burden of the Public Debt: Comment\\n\\nThe DBowen-Davis-Kopf thesis presented in \"The Public Debt: A Burden\\non Future Generations\"! purports to show that, under certain circumstances,\\nthe burden of a portion of the national debt can be shifted to future genera-\\ntions. What Bowen e£ al. have succeeded in demonstrating is that a given\\ngeneration (Generation I) could pass the burden of a deficit-financed project\\nto a future generation (Generation II) by selling their bonds (to Generation\\nII) and using the proceeds to raise their level of consumption.\\n\\nThe possibility of this eventuality, it should be noted, existed long before\\nthe days of multibillion-dollar deficit finance and existed even in the absence\\nof deficit finance. The older members of any economy which incorporates the\\nprinciples of private property and the right of transfer are always free to sell\\ntheir creditor claims. The sale may be made to other members of Generation I\\nor to those of Generation II. If, during the lifetime of Generation I, there had\\nbeen no deficit finance, they would still be free to liquidate o£Aer forms of cred-\\nitor claims—life insurance, industrial bonds, common stock, etc. As a general\\nrule, however, Generation I does not sell its creditor claims (or savings) to\\nGeneration II—the transfer is made by bequest.\\n\\nNone of this denies the possibility of the Bowen-Davis-Kopf conclusion; it\\nmerely questions the plausibility. In special cases, as where, for example,\\nsubstantial damage to the productive facilities of the economy, or to some fac-\\ntor, during the lifetime of Generation I result in a low level of living relative to\\nprevious levels, the bondholders would be tempted to liquidate their bonds in\\nan attempt to maintain their standard of living. In such a case, the shift of\\nburden would, of course, be more probable.\\n\\nHowever, even if one assumes that Generation I does sell its bonds to Gen-\\neration II, it does not necessarily follow that increased consumption by Gen-\\neration I after the transfer has occurred will require decreased consumption by\\nGeneration II. Conceivably, if this bond transfer takes place during a period\\nin which substantial quantities of economic resources are idle, Generation I\\'s\\nattempt to increase consumption may increase aggregate income and, in turn,\\nlead to a general increase in consumption—including consumption by Gener-\\nation II. Thus, the existence of unemployed resources at the time of Gener-\\nation Is increase in consumption would dissolve *the burden of the debt.\"\\n\\nReflection upon the years following the second world war lends the above\\nconsideration additional importance. While we describe the period as one of\\nfull employment punctuated by mild recessions, in few of the years, if any,\\nwere resources utilized to the fullest extent.

Engrossing though the work has been and much as I shall\\nmiss it, I am certain that it is wise for the responsibility for selecting the contents of the\\nmajor publication of the major economics association to be passed on fairly regularly to\\na younger member of the profession who will view current research afresh.\\n\\nThe Association is fortunate that John G. Gurley is willing to assume these responsi-\\nbilitie. Given his previous experience on the editorial board of the Journal of Finance\\nand his recent three-months period as acting managing editor during my absence, I know\\nthat the transition will be a smooth one. His good judgment, his catholic interests in\\neconomics, his keen analytical mind, and his fine critical sense will serve the Review and\\nthe profession well.\\n\\nHe will find, as I have, that the work can only be done at all satisfactorily if he has\\nthe conscientious help of many members of the profession. A genuine concern for the\\nadvancement of economics and a strong sense of responsibility to the Association have\\nmade some of the most brilliant younger economists willing to serve on the editorial\\nboard during my eleven years—and I would have been badly off indeed without their\\nadvice and good judgment. Literally hundreds of other economists have read manu-\\nscripts for me and appraised them critically—írequently contributing substantially (but\\nanonymously) to the research results of many, particularly younger, authors. Hundreds\\nof economists have been willing to set aside other, more interesting work to perform the\\nvery important task of book-reviewing. To all of these people, the economics profession\\nis heavily indebted—and so, in particular, am I. I wish it were possible for me to thank\\nevery one of them individually.\\n\\nThe exercise of judgment in the final selection of materials to be accorded publication\\nis the most difficult—and sleep-disturbing—responsibility of the managing editor. No\\nmatter how much good advice may be at his disposal, he finally has to decide which of\\nmany good articles should be accepted. When space limitations permit only the acceptance\\nof 12 to 16 per cent of the manuscripts submitted, many authors have to be disappointed.\\nFortunately the really important contribution nearly always is published, even though\\nthe first journal to which it is submitted may not be able to use it. And the competition\\nfor publication undoubtedly has a good effect on the quality of research in our field.\\nNevertheless, rejection hurts; and I want to express my appreciation to the many hundreds\\nof authors whose papers I have been unable to accept for the almost unfailing good\\nnature and understanding they have shown in their acceptance of my decisions—even\\nthough they did not always think them wise ones.\\n\\nFinaly, I must add my appreciation for the constant helpfulness, complete devotion\\nto the task, and intelligent good judgment of my editorial assistant, Miss Doris Merriam,\\nwho after sixteen years with two managing editors of the Review has been unable to\\ncontemplate the prospect of breaking in still a third managing editor. I know that the\\nmany members of the Association who have known her, at least through correspondence,\\nwill join me and other officers of the Association in wishing her well in her new career\\nwith the Peace Corps in Latin America.\\n\\nTo John Gurley go my best wishes for a highly successful term as the fourth managing\\neditor of the American Economic Review.\\n\\nBrnwamp F.

Forecasts of national income, for\\nexample, influence private investment outlays which, in turn, help to deter-\\nmine the level of national income. It is sometimes suggested that econ-\\nomists\\' forecasts are \"self validating,\" implying that a forecast will be\\nmore nearly correct if it is made public than if it is kept a dark secret.\\nAlmost at the other extreme, there is the view that publicly announced fore-\\ncasts must inevitably be invalidated by the response of the business world\\nto the forecast. On a slightly different plane, it is sometimes argued that the\\ninstability of the economy can be traced, at least in part, to faulty fore-\\ncasting and would be reduced by an improvement in the quality of fore-\\ncasts.\\n\\nThis paper will examine the validity of these three points. It will be shown\\nthat when the variable to be forecast is itself influenced by the forecast\\n(a) the announcement of a forecast does not necessarily validate, or tend to\\nvalidate, the forecast, (b) accurate forecasting may be impossible, (c) even\\nperfectly accurate forecasting, if it were possible, may add to the instability\\nof the economy.

She is afraid\\nthat the courts will interpret the amended Section 7 of the Clayton Act so\\nas to prohibit only those horizontal mergers that would combine suppliers\\nof \"large! percentages of the output of some \\'product,\\' or would increase the\\nshare of the *product\\' accounted for by a firm with an already \"large! exist-\\ning share\" [8, p. 644].

The concept of the cost\\nof capital has been the subject of considerable theoretical controversy, and\\nthere is a great need for empirical research to improve the factual basis of\\nour knowledge on the subject. It is therefore most unfortunate that the errors\\ncommitted by Benishay both in formulating his model and in interpreting his\\nfindings are so numerous and serious that his results probably do more to\\nconfuse than clarify the issues.\\n\\nIt will be useful to begin with a brief statement of the theoretical back-\\nground for the paper. According to neoclassical theory, when the future is\\nknown with certainty a firm increases its value by undertaking any investment\\nwith a rate of profit greater than the rate of interest. Those who accept the\\ntheory, let us call them capital theorists, consider problems of finance such as\\nthe determination of a corporation's optimum dividend rate nonsense prob-\\nlems. Under neoclassical theory, the value of a firm is independent of the\\nway in which it is financed.\\n\\nIn contrast with the capital theorists, financial analysts observe that cor-\\nporations do not use the rate of interest as the cost of capital! and that cor-\\n\\nThe cost of capital is the rate of return a firm requires as a condition for undertaking\\nan investment.

      "['Economic Forecasting When the Subject of the Forecast Is\\nInfluenced by the Forecast: Comment\\n\\nIn a recent paper [4], Kemp discussed the question of self-validation of\\nforecasts when the subject of forecast is influenced by the forecasts them-\\nselves. His interpretation of the term \"\\'self-validating\" is based on the cri-\\nterion of numerical accuracy; to qualify for this epithet, a forecast must\\nresult in a smaller absolute forecasting error when it is announced than\\nwhen it is kept secret. Suppose an official forecast is that income will rise to\\n$500 billion. Further suppose that, with the forecast kept secret, income\\nwill actually be $490 billion, but with the forecast made public, income will\\nreach $520 billion instead. In this example Kemp would conclude that the\\nforecast is *\\'self-destructive,\" because the error when the forecast is made\\npublic (—520— 500) exceeds the error when the forecast is kept secret\\n(— 500—490).\\n\\nHowever, this term can also be interpreted alternatively in a directional\\nsense. An official forecast may be considered \"\\'self-validating\" as long as\\nits publication causes the variable in question to move in the direction of\\nthe forecasted change, regardless of the magnitude of forecasting errors.\\nIn the example above, since the forecast of an increase does cause the\\nvariable to assume a larger value than it would in the absence of the fore-\\ncast, we may indeed consider the forecast as having validated itself. To\\navoid confusion, let us refer to this latter sense of validation as \"\\'self-rein-\\nforcement.\"\\n\\nShort of taking a poll, it would be difficult to say which interpretation\\nis the more widely held. It appears, however, that a stronger case can be\\nmade for the directional than for the numerical interpretation, because\\nwhen forecasts influence economic behavior they may serve as an instru-\\nment of control, and in such instances, as Kemp recognized [4, p. 496], the\\nnumerical accuracy of forecasts loses its relevance, and the reinforcement\\neffect takes on the major significance. But at any rate, as long as the possi-\\nbility exists that those who claim the never-failing self-validation of official\\nforecasts may actually have the directional interpretation in mind, Kemp\\ncould have missed the whole point, or at best have only dealt with part of\\nthe question. This paper seeks to fill the gap by examining the reinforce-\\nment aspect of that claim.\\n\\nI.

Bodkin and Jones used income and ex-\\npenditure data for those consumer units who had received the soldiers bonus\\n(National Service Life Insurance dividends) during 1950, the year of the\\nurban consumption survey [4]. These bonuses were regarded as windíall\\ngains for the purposes of their analyses.\\n\\nProfessor Reid used data from the same survey, but her windíall gains\\nwere represented by \"other money receipts.\" These are defined as \"inherit-\\nances and occasional large gifts of money from persons outside the family\\n\\n. . and net receipts from the settlement of fire and accident policies\" [4,\\nVol. 1, p. xxix]. She assumed that the soldiers! bonus was included, and that\\nit accounted for about one-half of other money receipts. Here she made an\\nunfortunate mistake in interpreting the data for the main critical purpose of\\nher article.\\n\\n\"The soldiers! bonus is not part of *other money receipts\" (O) but rather\\na part of \"disposable money income\" (Y). It is the main part of an item in\\nthe disposable money income category called \"military pay, allotments, and\\npensions\" [4, Vol. 11, p. xxix].\\n\\nThis would appear to alter completely the relationship of Professor Reid\\'s\\nmain findings to the Bodkin results and to change the windfall interpretation\\nof the O variable. Surely, fire and accident policy settlements are not windfall\\nincome, but rather a (partial) recovery of real assets previously lost. Like-\\nwise, inheritances are probably best considered as a long-anticipated increase\\nin assets—not an increase in transitory income.\\n\\nThe discovery of this error probably does not affect whatever importance\\nProfessor Reid\\'s secondary finding may have: ^. . . the need, in any study of\\n', 'FRANCO MODIGLIANI AND MERTON H.

Before turning to the major points of disagreement\\nbetween the authors and myself, it would be useful to emphasize the major\\npurpose of my article as well as the questions to which my analysis was not\\naddressed. I was not attempting to evaluate, predict, or even suggest the\\ndeterminants of the level of stock market prices.

My purpose was to\\nshow that, apart from these factors, it is possible to define a meaningful\\nstructure of share prices at any point in time, and that the level and structure\\ncan change in the absence of changes in growth rates and risk premiums. Per-\\nhaps the most interesting and important results of this analysis concerned\\nthe volatility of growth stocks. Abstracting from all the reasons usually ad-\\nduced to explain the greater volatility of growth stocks, such as those sug-\\ngested by Friend and Cave, I found an important additional reason to ex-\\npect such a pattern.

      "['Professor Samuelson on Theory and Realism\\n\\nIn a discussion of \"Problems of Methodology\" at an AEA meeting [4],\\nPaul Samuelson embarks on a critique of theories which employ unrealistic\\nassumptions. He concludes with this strong indictment of \"unrealistic, ab-\\nstract models\": *If the abstract models contain empirical falsities, we must\\njettison the models, not gloss over their inadequacies\" [4, p. 236].\\n\\nLet us first indicate how Samuelson reaches this judgment. He defines a\\ntheory *as a set of axioms, postulates, or hypotheses that stipulate something\\nabout observable reality [4, p. 233]. Denoting the theory as B, the *conse-\\nquences\" derived from it as C, and the \"assumptions\" antecedent to it as A,\\nhe argues that 4, B, and C must actually be identical in meaning, mutually\\nimplying one another. Thus, he holds, if the assumptions are empirically false,\\nand the theory therefore unrealistic, the deduced consequences cannot pos-\\nsibly be empirically valid. In other words, an unrealistic theory cannot yield\\nrealistic consequences.\\n\\nSamuelson also considers the possibility that the assumptions are wider\\nthan the theory, and that the theory is wider than the consequence, so that\\nthere is a subset C — of C, while A is a subset of A. In this case 44d- may\\nimply B, without B implying A-- ; and C may imply C—, without C— im-\\nplying C. If C— happens to be empirically valid, does this *validate\" the\\nwider theory B, or the even wider set of assumptions, A4-d-? Samuelson ex-\\nplicitly rejects this. He regards as \"nonsense\" the claim that the validity of C—\\njustifies holding an unrealistic theory B, let alone the completely unwarranted\\nset of assumptions At.\\n\\nWhat Samuelson does here is to reject a// tAeory. A theory, by definition,\\nis much wider than any of the consequences deduced. If the consequences\\nwere to imply the \"theory\" just as the theory implies the consequences, that\\ntheory would be nothing but another form of the empirical evidence (named\\n*consequence\") and could never \"explain\" the observed, empirical facts.\\n\\nIn addition, Samuelson errs in another way. We never deduce a conse-\\nquence from a theory alone. We always combine the postulated relationships\\n(which constitute the theory) with an assumption of some change or event\\nand then we deduce the consequence of the conjunction of the theoretical\\nrelationships and the assumed occurrence. Thus, we do not infer C or C—\\nfrom B, but rather from the conjunction of B and some occurrence O. If C —\\ncan be deduced from B cum O; and if both O and C— are found to corre-\\nspond to data of observaton which can be regarded as the empirical counter-\\nparts (referents, proxies) of the theoretical O and C — ; then we rule that the\\ntheory B has sustained the test. This test does not prove that B is \"true,\"\\nbut we have no reason to \"jettison\" B—unless we have a better theory B\\'.\\n\\nLet us now leave aside the argument by which Samuelson reached his\\ndecision against \"unrealistic, abstract models\" and theories; let us, instead,\\nconfront Samuelson\\'s judgment with Samuelson\\'s pattern of theorizing when\\n', '733\\n', 'COMMUNICATIONS\\n']\n",

      "['Fluctuations in Economic Activity: Planned\\nand Free-Market Economies, 1950-60\\n\\nThree of the many claims to superiority made for planned economies over\\nfree-market economies stand out clearly: first, that they grow faster; second,\\nthat they provide full employment; and, third, that they are not subject to\\nfluctuations in outputs [12, pp. 95-102] [23, pp. 19-35]. The first claim has\\nbeen discussed at some length in Western literature. Independent indexes of\\ngrowth for the planned economies have been developed by Western scholars,\\nand the results have been analyzed and compared with similar indexes for the\\nfree-market economies [1] [11]. Considerably less attention has been paid to\\nthe second claim, possibly because measuring the degree to which the two sys-\\ntems utilize available inputs is an even more complex problem than the\\ncalculation of growth indexes. Little attention has been devoted to the\\nthird claim? that \"Socialism is characterized, above all, by the absence of\\ncyclical disturbances in production\" [14, p. 9]; no statistical comparisons of\\nfluctuations in economic activity in the two systems are available.\\n\\nThe purpose of this paper is to compare the year-to-year fluctuations in\\noutput for a group of planned and a group of free-market economies. The\\nfirst section describes the scope of the project and the data used, the second\\npresents the results, and the third comments on the findings.\\n\\n\\'The possibility of underutilization of inputs in planned economies has been pointed\\nout, among others, by Joseph Berliner [2, pp. 358, 363-66], Emily Brown [3, pp. 181-\\n82], Robert Campbell [4], Naum Jasny [9], Alec Nove [15, p. 579], Alfred Oxenfeldt\\n[21], and Lazar Volin [35, p. 306].\\n\\n?Fluctuations in the Soviet Union are discussed by Naum Jasny [10, pp. 11-13], G.\\nW.

      "['A Controlled Evaluation of *The American Economy\"\\n\\nDuring the 1962-63 academic year 27 students at the University of Ne-\\nbraska took their principles of economics through the CBS-TV college credit\\ncourse, The American Economy.\"\\' These students viewed the halí-hour\\ntelevision lectures four days per week, each lecture being followed by 10-15\\nminutes of questions and answers or elaborating comments by the professor\\nsupervising the television course. Students in the television group were all\\nfull-time university students rather than public school teachers or casual\\nadult viewers. The lecture group with which the television group was com-\\npared was a quite sizable class of 107 students whose program of instruction\\nconsisted primarily of three 50-minute lectures per week. Both groups—the\\ntelevision group and the lecture group—used the same textbook and the\\nstudy guide which accompanies it. The television group also used the tele-\\nvision study guide, TZe American Economy [2], while the lecture group did\\nnot.\\n\\nThis over-all arrangement afforded a unique opportunity to evaluate\\nthrough a controlled comparison the relative performance of the television\\ngroup and the lecture group. The general dearth of scientific investigation\\nin the teaching of economics [3] and the recent interest in economic educa-\\ntion seemed compelling reasons for undertaking such an evaluation.\\n\\nI. Testing Techniques and Procedures\\n\\nThe television group and the lecture group were given two multiple-choice\\nexaminations totaling 170 questions. The first examination of 120 questions,\\nwhich we shall refer to hereafter as the Course Examination, was prepared\\nby the authors of this paper. The questions on this examination were of three\\nquite distinct types: factual, conceptual, and problem-analytical. The 20\\nfacutal questions were of a \"basic data\" character: At what average annual\\nrate has the U. S. gross national product increased over a period of years?\\nWhat is the single most important source of revenue and type of expenditure\\nof the federal government? What is the most important cause of the public\\ndebt? Sixty questions were designed to evaluate the student\\'s ability to de-\\nfine or identify basic economic concepts, e.g. the marginal propensity to\\nconsume, marginal cost, the multiplier, the short run, price elasticity of de-\\n\\n?\\'The underlying assumptions and character of this course have been summarized by\\nthe national teacher.

The Brown decision ostensibly settles one of the thorniest issues in\\nantitrust law: the issue of market definition in merger cases. In holding that\\nrelevant submarkets, product and geographic, may exist within the bound-\\naries of the broad market, the Court apparently ruled that the market may\\nbe drawn more narrowly in a merger case than in a monopoly case. Unfortu-\\nnately, the decision is not altogether clear on this point. After stating that\\nsubmarkets are germane in a Section 7 case, the Court proceeded to argue\\nthat the relevant market must be drawn broadly enough to recognize com-\\npetition where it exists and to correspond to economic reality. Obviously, a\\nmarket drawn to include competitive products and suppliers traces out the\\ntrue boundaries of a market, regardless of whether it is termed a broad\\nmarket or a submarket.\\n\\nMartin argues, however, that in the Brown case the Court did not accept\\nthe Sherman Act guidelines to market definition in merger cases.

      "['The Unimportance of the Embodied Question\\n\\nIn a recent article in this journal, Moses Abramovitz noted that Robert\\nM. Solow and I obtain different estimates of the effect on economic growth of\\nalternative investment rates because of different appraisals of the importance\\nof embodiment of new knowledge in capital goods. Abramovitz suggested *\\'an\\nissue of first-rate importance is, therefore, posed\" [1, p. 773]. Recent litera-\\nture seems to imply that the issue can be resolved by discovering what fraction\\nof developments that can potentially raise productivity must be embodied in\\ncapital. I wish to suggest here that the whole embodiment question is of little\\nimportance for policy in the United States; that the issue is not usefully\\nformulated in terms of the fraction of progress that is embodied; and that the\\nright question can\\'t be answered beyond a showing that it s unimportant.\\n\\nThe argument that the question was of no great consequence that was\\ngiven in my Sources of Economic Growth may be stated as follows [2, pp.\\n234-37, 254-55]. The embodiment effect operates through the age distribution\\nof the gross capital stock of business. This distribution can be summarized ac-\\ncurately enough by average age, provided weights of different types of capital\\ngoods (particularly structures and equipment) are held constant. Suppose\\nthen the growth rate of output per man is 1.6 per cent a year, of which .6\\nper cent is due to advances in knowledge (my estimates for the 1929-57\\nperiod). Suppose we can change the average age by one year from 1960 to\\n1970.* In so far as productivity-changing developments are embodied, we will\\nthen be working in 1970 with the technology that we would be using in 1971\\nif average age did not change. If nothing is embodied, the change in average\\nage of capital will not affect output. If all advances of knowledge but not other\\nproductivity-affecting developments are embodied, 1970 output will be .6\\nper cent higher than if nothing is embodied and the 1960-70 annual growth\\nrate .06 percentage points higher. If everything affecting output per man\\nfavorably or unfavorably is embodied, 1970 output will be 1.6 per cent higher\\nas a result of the reduced age of capital and the annual growth rate .16 per-\\ncentage points higher. If half of either is embodied, the amounts will be half\\nas large. After 1970 the growth rate will be the same as otherwise unless the\\naverage age is again changed. Thus the most extreme assumptions yield\\nannual growth rates, calculated over a ten-year period, that differ by .16\\npercentage points for each year that the average age of capital changes; there-\\nafter, for as long as the new average age is maintained, the levels of national\\nincome differ by a constant 1.6 per cent.\\n\\nThe force of the calculations depends on the fact that average age is a\\n\\n!]f average age (and the rate at which knowledge advances) does not change between\\ndates or assumed situations, the calculated growth rate is the same whether advances are\\nor are not embodied in capital.\\n', 'COMMUNICATIONS\\n']\n",

      "['Cost Functions and Progress Functions: An Integration\\n\\nThe relationship between unit production costs and the level of output per\\nproduction period has come to be depicted in economic analysis by U-shaped\\nor L-shaped functions, indicating that, as the level of output increases, unit\\ncosts fall over a certain range and then either rise or remain constant. In\\nengineering studies, the relationship between unit production costs and the\\nlevel of output has come to be depicted by hyperbolic \"learning curves\" that\\nshow unit costs declining as accumulated total output increases over time. The\\napparent incongruence of these two conceptions has stimulated at least one\\nmajor econometric study [5] and two serious attempts at a theoretical integra-\\ntion [1 and 6] [4]. The purpose of this note is to present a straightforward\\nalgebraic and graphic integration of static cost functions and dynamic progress\\nfunctions and an illustration of the empirical relevance and interpretative\\nusefulness of these analytical constructions.\\n\\nI. The Cost-Output Relation\\n\\nThe static cost function of economic theory does not require elaborate\\nexposition; the standard reference is the well-known article of Viner [8],\\nsupplemented by the more recent contribution of Wolfson [9]. A few funda-\\nmental features of the static cost concept of special relevance for the present\\n', \"that Russonia's more generous aid-giving policy would have led Thirdonia to\\nmove politically away from Russonia.\\n\\nAnother step toward the real world is taken if we allow for multilateral aid\\nagencies or for aid-giving countries other than Usonia and Russonia. Taking\\nthe most worrisome unstable case where a neutralist country faces aid-giving\\nbehavior that penalizes neutralism (the 4/-PN combination), it appears that\\nthe function of multilateral aid or of aid from countries other than the two\\nsuperpowers may well be to restore stability by stepping up aid from these\\nsources as Thirdonia moves to neutralist ground. In this way the total aid\\navailable to Thirdonia from all three sources of aid could approximate the\\nNPN rather than the PN shape and stability would be restored. It is con-\\nceivable that Usonia and Russonia, realizing the domestic policy constraints\\nunder which they operate, find it difficult in their bilateral relations with\\nThirdonia to adopt anything but the PN-type of aid-giving behavior; it would\\nthen make good sense for them to foster deliberately multilateral aid or aid\\nfrom other industrial countries in such a way as to compensate for their\\ninability to make their own bilateral aid-giving behavior conform to the\\nrequirements of stability.\\n\\nFinally, it might be tempting to analyze how the behavior of each of our\\nthree principal actors is shaped by expectations about that of the other two.\\nBut before the resulting complications are explored, it was perhaps worth\\nwhile to show that a simple static model can account satisfactorily for a va-\\nriety of real-life situations and can even yield some suggestions for policy.\\n\\nALBERT O.

MopniGLIANI\\n\\nWe share the feeling of Professors Friedman and Meiselman that this\\nexchange has had some merit in clarifying the meaning of their original\\npaper, and in bringing all of us closer to agreement on two conclusions:\\n(1) that the single-equation tests under discussion cannot be expected to\\nthrow much useful light on the relative importance of money supply and of\\nautonomous components of demand and fiscal policy variables in the deter-\\nmination of the levels of output and employment; and (2) that insofar as\\nthe outcome of these tests indicate anything, they do not warrant the con-\\nclusion that either the relation between expenditure and money or that\\nbetween expenditure and the above autonomous variables is \"consistently\\nand decidedly\" more stable than the other.\\n\\nWe cannot, however, accept what seems to be FM\\'s main criticism of\\nour procedure for testing the income-expenditure model, namely, that we\\nare wrong in using C/ as the induced component and Z^ and X? as autono-\\nmous variables, and that we \"leave loose ends of income dangling\" [3, Sec.\\nV, paragraph 4]. \"The specification of our model was chosen to fit, as closely\\nas possible, the standard Keynesian formulation. We have accordingly\\nregarded aggregate output (as measured by JN) as the variable to be pre-\\ndicted, and Y4 (not N) as the income total inducing C, the major part of the\\ninduced component of output. The reader can verify that the resulting\\nmodel corresponds to the one given by FM under the heading \\'\\'A Slightly\\nMore Complex Model\" [3, Sec. III.B], by noting the following identities\\nrelating their symbols to ours:\\n\\nUzCcTZizmC Y\\'zyst A1mZ- LXX;\\nAe — Qe X9;\\nA-Z; Y-UXTAsS(CM-Z)4Z iN.\\n\\nThe induced part of the income total to be predicted (Y z N) is thus C-4-Z:\\nwhich is our C/, and not C/— X^, as FM maintain in their reply [3, Sec.\\nIV.C]. X», like M, is not a part of the income total to be predicted.\\nFurthermore, it is apparent that in our formulation both 4; and 4; are\\npartly induced and partly autonomous. Hence, as FM correctly hint in\\ntheir discussion of their more complex model, the solution for the induced\\ncomponent (U 2C) is a linear function of Z* and X^ (and not of Ze-- X,*\\nexcept under a set of very special assumptions, as we spelled out in our\\npaper).!\\n\\nAs for the issue of which variables should be treated as autonomous, we\\n\\n!

This is especially so with\\nrespect to the question of whether or not the tests must predict all of the\\nendogenous part of income. We admitted that it would be useful to test the\\nrelative performance of money and \"A\" in predicting inventory, imports,\\nand so on. But each of these are separate reduced-form equations. What\\nFM wish to do really adds together all the reduced-form equations for the\\ninduced components of income. Why do this?\\n\\nIf the basic purpose of the research had been to predict income, then\\nneither our approach nor the FM model would have been adequate. A user\\nof FM\\'s model first has to determine government expenditures and taxes,\\nexports and imports, private domestic investment, and so on. He then finds\\nconsumption as the induced variable. To use our model he does not need\\nto know imports, taxes, or inventory to find consumption. However, he\\nstill has to find them (by separate equations) to determine total income.\\nFM overlook all this because they apparently forget that the government\\ndeficit is the result of two variables: government expenditures and taxation,\\nand that net exports are also the result of two variables. An excellent\\nexample of this confusion is their claim that they are able to predict total\\nincome using a smaller proportion of income than we do. This is illustrated\\nin their Table 3.

Rather\\nthan letting the correlation coefficients determine the definitions, we settled\\non our formulations from the start. They were not the ones with the highest\\ncorrelation, as Appendix Table A shows.\\n\\nIronically, the grounds for our a priori determination of autonomous ex-\\npenditures are not crucial.

      "['*Neutral\" Tecbnological Change and the Isoquant Map\\n\\nThe concept of *neutrality\" in technological change that has been found\\nmost useful in models of economic growth is that offered by Harrod [4, p.\\n23]. According to this view technological progress is neutral if it leaves the\\ncapital-output ratio unaltered at a given rate of profit. In principle this differs\\nfrom the concept of neutrality offered by Hicks [5, p. 121], in which the cap-\\nital-labor ratio remains unaltered at a constant ratio of factor prices.\\n\\nSince each classification has been widely used, it is only natural that the\\nconnection between the two has been analyzed. The basic result for one-sec-\\ntor models in which capital goods are produced is that Hicks and Harrod\\nneutrality come to the same thing only if the elasticity of substitution be-\\ntween capital and labor is unity. The situation is slightly more complicated in\\nmultisector models, as the value of the capital-output ratio in sectors not pro-\\nducing the capital good depends in part on the price ratio between the output\\nof that sector and machines.\\n\\nThe purpose of this article is to show how relationships involving Harrod\\nneutrality can be illustrated and proved by use of the isoquant diagram. Al-\\nthough such a diagram offers a natural means of illustrating the Hicksian\\nclassification of technological change, it does not seem to have been used here-\\ntofore to discuss the Harrod definition.? It turns out to be surprisingly\\nsimple to employ the isoquant map to illustrate Harrod neutrality in single\\nand multisector models and thus also to illustrate certain key relationships in\\na neoclassical model in which growth proceeds at a constant rate of profit.\\n\\nAs a preliminary step I demonstrate how it is possible to calculate the\\nelasticity of substitution of an isoquant diagrammatically.? Consider Figure 1,\\nwhere K and L represent quantities of capital and labor. The initial equilib-\\nrium is at A with the ratio of wages to rents given by the (absolute value of\\nthe) slope of line (1) and the capital-labor ratio by the slope of (3). In moving\\nto point B the capital-labor ratio increases to the slope of line (4), while the\\n\\n* Cf. Meade [10, Ch. 5], Uzawa [13], Kennedy [7], Asimakopulos [3], and Amano\\n[1].\\n\\n?

Joan Robinson [11] used the average and marginal product\\ncurves of capital in discussing the definitions. This is the kind of diagram also used by\\nAsimakopulos [3]. In more recent work [12, p. 419], Mrs. Robinson employs a diagram\\nshowing output/man against the real capital ratio (capital in wage units).

      "[\"The Overvaluation of the Dollar: A Note on the\\nInternational Price Mechanism\\n\\nDuring the past few years it has become clear that the U.S. dollar is over-\\nvalued. The extent of the resulting deficit is indicated by average annual\\nincreases in foreign holdings of liquid dollar assets and sales of monetary\\ngold of between $3 and $3.5 billion over the period 1958-62. An estimate\\nof the degree of overvaluation using the purchasing-power-parity approach\\nhas been constructed by H. S. Houthakker [5], who concludes that the dol-\\nlar is overvalued with respect to the major European currencies by 20 per\\ncent. This paper presents an alternative upper-limit estimate of the magni-\\ntude of the existing exchange-rate disequilibrium and concludes that an\\novervaluation of more than 10 per cent is highly implausible. It also pro-\\nvides evidence that, aside from speculative forces, the foreign exchange\\nmarket will be highly stable.\\n\\nOur procedure will be to construct a model of the effects of a devaluation\\non the balance of payments and to develop estimates of the parameters in\\nthis model. An estimate of the overvaluation, or the magnitude of devalua-\\ntion which would be required to close the apparent deficit, can then be calcu-\\nlated. The major problem is that of obtaining estimates of the demand and\\nsupply elasticities of exports and imports. Most of the existing statistical\\nestimates of the demand elasticities for imports and exports are subject to\\nsevere downward bias, and estimates of the elasticities of supply of exports\\nand imports are, as far as I know, nonexistent.? There are, however, more\\nreliable estimates of the domestic supply and demand elasticities of particu-\\nlar goods. This paper will make use of the fact that a country's elasticities\\nof demand for imports and supply of exports depend upon the domestic sup-\\nply and demand elasticities for the goods in question and upon the ratios of\\n\\n1 Kenen [6] presents an excellent discussion of the problems involved in estimating the de-\\ngree of disequilibrium.\\n\\n? The downward bias in the demand elasticities stems from two main sources. First, since\\nthe demand for imports is the excess of the domestic demand over the domestic supply of im-\\nport goods, the quantity demanded will be a function of the domestic supply conditions as\\nwell as relative prices and incomes. Failure to take shifts of the supply function into considera-\\ntion results in statistical estimates of the price elasticity of demand for imports which are too\\nlow. Second, in the great majority of the estimates, no attempts were made to incorporate long-\\nrun adjustment into the statistical models. Since domestic supply of import goods is likely to\\nrespond fully to price changes only after a considerable lag, the omission of long-run adjust-\\nment is likely to result in a substantial downward bias of the price elasticity of demand for im-\\nports. Estimates which used data for the interwar period were further hampered by lack of\\nvariability of prices relative to incomes. More detailed discussion of these issues is given by\\nOrcutt [8] and Harberger [2] [3]. More recently a study by Ball and Mavwah [1] of the\\nU. S. demand for imports has incorporated long-run adjustment and utilized data for the\\npostwar period.\\n\", 'COMMUNICATIONS\\n']\n",

If with a given quantity of capital, one man-year\\nof U.S. labor is equivalent to, say, three man-years of foreign labor, then the\\nU.S. labor force must be multiplied by three in comparing the relative amounts\\nof labor and capital with that of foreign countries. That would mean that in\\n1960 the U.S. labor force numbered not 70 but 210 million of \"equivalent\"\\nforeign man-years, making it a relatively labor-abundant country.

Stein presents a theory of\\nthe optimum foreign exchange market to demonstrate *how social welfare\\ncriteria can be used to evaluate the desirability of alternative foreign exchange\\nmarkets.\" Arguing on the basis of a simple model, he is able to obtain con-\\nclusions of far-reaching significance. For an economy with idle resources, he\\nconcludes, a free exchange market is more efficient than a stabilized exchange\\nmarket if the balance of payments tends towards deficits in periods of output\\ncontraction and surpluses in periods of output expansion; on the other hand,\\na stabilized exchange market is more efficient than a free exchange market, if\\nthe balance of payments tends towards surpluses in periods of output con-\\ntraction and deficits in periods of output expansion. For a full-employment\\nexport economy with fluctuating productivity, a foreign exchange market\\nstabilized at the \"equilibrium rate\" is found to be more efficient than a free\\nexchange market. Thus, it appears that the long and arduous controversy over\\nthe relative desirability of freely flexible and fixed exchange rates has found a\\nstartlingly simple solution: depending upon the \"structure\" of the economy in\\nquestion, Stein\\'s theory would permit an unequivocal choice between the two\\ntypes of exchange-rate systems.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the promising prospect turns out to be a mere mirage.

Within the firm, specialization and the division of labor\\nin production were considered to be well developed. But this factor in\\nitself could not explain the existence of firms, since the same phenome-\\nnon occurred among firms as well as within them. Rather the existence\\nof these relatively large organized units was to be explained by the ex-\\nistence of externalities—gains obtained and losses avoided as the re-\\nsult of collaborative action. An important aspect of this was thought to\\nbe the economies resulting from centralized direction of activities.\\n\\nThe rise of management science, without changing this picture fun-\\ndamentally, has provided major new insights into the complexity of\\nenterprise organization—a complexity which persists even when quite\\nmodest numbers of people are involved. The growing specialization\\nand division of labor within management itself has provided much evi-\\ndence of this complexity. Closely related is the role of information,\\ncommunication procedures, and uncertainty in influencing enterprise\\ndecisions. But the picture of the firm which emerges from this line of\\nstudy is still restricted by the limited range of organizational forms\\navailable for study in Western countries, and particularly in the Unit-\\ned States, where the bulk of the work still seems to be done. In a com-\\nplex organization burdened by substantial externalities, there may be a\\ngreat deal to be learned by varying the form of organization.

      "['In the brief time allotted to me I want to outline two provisional\\npropositions concerning the new economic history.\\n\\nThe first proposition is that one can observe in the work of the new\\ngeneration of economic historians a departure from the past sufficient\\nto justify a title like new economic history.\\n\\n\"The departure is not to be found in the realm of subject matter. The\\nnew generation has not turned away from the traditional theme of its\\ndiscipline. The central interest of the new economic historians is still\\nthe description and explanation of economic growth. This continuity\\nwith the past holds in the small as well as in the large. The specific re-\\nsearch projects of the new generation focus on such familiar issues as\\nthe developmental impact of railroads and canals [14] [17] [22]\\n[36], the effect of changes in supply and demand on the growth of the\\niron industry [40] [12], the profitability of slavery [6] [13] [39]\\n[44], the factors affecting the growth of productivity in agriculture\\n[35], the effect of federal land policy on the distribution of income\\n[3] [16], the influence of foreign trade on the creation of a market\\neconomy [33], the sources of the capital required for industrialization\\n[9] [43], the explanation of urbanization [8] [38], and the causes\\nof economic fluctuations [43].\\n\\nThe novel element in the work of the new economic historians is\\ntheir approach to measurement and theory. Economic history has al-\\nways had a quantitative orientation. But much of the past work on\\neconomic data was limited to the location and the simple classification\\nof the numerical information contained in government and business\\nrecords. While continuing this pursuit, the new economic history\\nplaces its primary emphasis on reconstructing measurements which\\nmight have existed in the past but are no longer extant, on the recom-\\nbination of primary data in a manner which enables them to obtain\\nmeasurements that were never before made, and on finding methods of\\nmeasuring economic phenomena that cannot be measured directly.\\n\\nIn performing these tasks, the new economic historians draw on vir-\\ntually the whole gamut of the theoretical and statistical models of eco-\\nnomics.

This difference itself seems to me to reflect a fact direct-\\nly relevant to the discussion; namely, that economists are accustomed\\nto proceed by generalization, conceptualization, and the explicit con-\\nstruction of theoretical systems embracing and relating a wide variety\\nof experiences; whereas most historians (although there are outstand-\\ning exceptions) are traditionally averse to model building, receptive to\\nthe idea of the \"uniqueness\" of events, and hypersensitive to the ap-\\nparent complexity of particular historical situations.\\n\\nIn these necessarily abbreviated remarks, however, I want to beg\\nsome of the more obvious questions—and in particular the problem\\n(or, perhaps, the pseudoproblem) of whether or not history exemplifies\\nsignificant patterns or illustrates usable \"laws.\"\\n\\nThat history is relevant seems to me to be beyond doubt.

Indeed, to contrast opposites may sometimes be more illuminat-\\ning than to compare similarities.\\n\\nOn the other hand, quite apart from the precise nature of the possi-\\nble relevance of past to present, any problem in the social sciences can\\nonly be approached by the use of conceptual devices and the deploy-\\nment of models of greater or lesser sophistication.

Currently the vast majority of professional economists are\\ntrained in graduate schools that require their students to take course\\nwork or examinations in economic history. (My own institution, one of\\nthe last holdouts, only this year adopted such a requirement.) The an-\\nswer, therefore, can only be a categorical *yes.\" A more meaningful\\nformulation of the question would be, what is the role of economic his-\\ntory in an economist\\'s education? Or even, what should be the role of\\neconomic history?\\' The answers in these cases are not only more con-\\ntroversial, but, especially the latter, doomed to perpetual discussion,\\nsince the question implies a normative judgment.\\n\\nIn analogous discussions concerning the role of theory in historical\\nresearch the argument is frequently made (perhaps because it is valid)\\nthat the historian will inevitably be guided by some a priori ideas. It is\\ndesirable, therefore, that these ideas be made explicit and systematized\\nif possible. The choice, in other words, is not between theory and no\\ntheory, but explicit, consciously formulated theory and implicit, un-\\nconscious theorizing. Much the same can be said for the use of history\\nby theorists. Even the most scornful ahistorical economist makes some\\nuse of history: his own experience, the experience of his generation, or\\nthe loose historical generalizations which abound in the folklore of\\neven highly sophisticated societies. Historians are not the only users,\\nperhaps not even the most frequent users, of some such phrase as\\n\"history proves. . . .\"? Whether or not history proves anything in any\\nmeaningful sense is another question; but there is no doubt that histo-\\nry is used and, when used properly, useful. The role of economic histo-\\nry in the economics curriculum is thus to try to assure that it is used\\nproperly.\\n\\n* My colleague J. G.

      "['The subject of this session is the \"domestic implications of the\\nevolving international monetary mechanism.\" The word \"evolving\"\\nseems rather unnecessary here, because the recent evolution of the in-\\nternational monetary system, though providing for larger and more eas-\\nily available credit facilities, has not changed the fundamental prob-\\nlem. In essence, the system is one in which the national currencies used\\nto transact international business are normally traded against each\\nother in the exchange markets at fixed rates. While the authorities\\nhave considerable leeway to support the rate, by allowing fluctuations\\nin reserves and by lending or borrowing from each other, they are con-\\ntinually forced to give attention to securing external equilibrium.\\nHence, our question really is the implications for domestic objectives\\nand use of policy instruments of the need to aim simultaneously at ex-\\nternal balance. To see both sides of the matter, however, we should\\nalso ask the complementary question of what are the implications for\\nbalance-of-payments policy of domestic economic objectives.\\n\\nFirst, a few words about policy objectives in Europe. These are, uni-\\nversally, the familiar trio of full employment, price stability, and ex-\\nternal equilibrium. Among these objectives, full employment has a\\nvery high priority and tends to be defined with really minimum mar-\\ngins of unemployment. One could not say, however, that it has an\\noverriding priority, since this objective has been relaxed from time to\\ntime when needed to assure other aims. Price stability is a more fuzzy\\npolicy aim, partly because the variety of price indexes usually show\\ndivergent results and partly because of a resigned acceptance that\\nsome rise in the cost-of-living index is difficult to avoid in a full em-\\nployment economy. External equilibrium is also a rather nebulous ob-\\njective, because the concept itself is not clear cut. In fact, it is more\\nmeaningful to say that the operating objective is a fixed exchange pari-\\nty, with, at least, maintenance of gold and foreign exchange reserves.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that fixed exchange rates have a high priority. In\\nrecent years, there have been no cases of conflict between fixed rates\\n\\n189\\n', 'By MirvroN GirLBERT Gzd WARREN MCCLAM\\nBank for International Settlements, Basle\\n', 'DOMESTIC AND EXTERNAL EQUILIBRIUM:\\nEUROPEAN OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES\\n', 'DOMESTIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVOLVING\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY MECHANISM\\n']\n",

      "[\"I find this an elusive subject for a number of reasons, one of which\\nis the difficulty of defining the international monetary system.\\n\\nWhere does the international monetary system leave off and the do-\\nmestic monetary system or domestic economic policy begin? We may\\nsay that the international monetary system is the system by which the\\nquantities of different kinds of money that people want to hold and the\\nquantities of different kinds of money available are adjusted to each\\nother. If this is the definition, then what we commonly call domestic\\neconomic policy is a main component of the system. Even if we confine\\nourselves to the system by which the supply and demand for foreign\\ncurrencies are adjusted to each other, domestic policy is a large part of\\nthat system. Wasn't the recent tax cut a measure of international\\nmonetary policy? Would a description of the present international\\nmonetary system have as one of its features that a country in the in-\\nternational and domestic position of the United States in 1964 should\\ncut taxes? I suppose so.\\n\\nIt is difficult to draw a line between the international system and do-\\nmestic policy because on the one hand there are hardly any important\\npolicies that are purely domestic in their effects and on the other hand\\nthere are hardly any important policies that are not mainly domestic\\nor national in the responsibility for them and in their motivation. I\\nthink a good deal of the problem with which we are concerned here is\\nwrapped up in this fact.\\n\\nHowever, in order to conform to the title of our session and to avoid\\nenmeshing myself in a general equilibrium system that I could not\\nhandle, I will adopt a certain definition of the international monetary\\nsystem. I mean by the international monetary system as it now is\\nevolving the arrangements by which some governments or treasuries or\\ncentral banks extend credit to others for reasons other than the direct\\nreturn on the investment. The nature of this system consists of the\\namounts of credit that will be extended, the circumstances, terms, and\\nconditions on which it will be extended, and the institutional arrange-\\nments by which all of this is determined. The evolution of the system\\nis the evolution of these characteristics.\\n\\n200\\n\", 'By HERBERT STEIN\\nCommittee for Economic Development\\n', 'THE EVOLVING INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM\\nAND\\nDOMESTIC ECONOMIC POLICY\\n']\n",

      "[\"I. Introduction\\n\\nIf I were asked to sketch the main features of the world economy as\\nit exists today, with particular reference to the advanced industrial\\ncountries, I would describe the situation in the following way:\\n\\n1. Each country insists on the free exercise of its sovereign authori-\\nty to regulate its level of internal demand for the purpose of maintain-\\ning suitable economic conditions at home in terms of employment and\\nthe behavior of its internal price level. In addition, the idea of govern-\\nmental responsibility for the attainment of a satisfactory rate of long-\\nterm economic growth is widely accepted, and some efforts are made to\\ninfluence the composition of demand in favor of investment-type activ-\\nities as a means of accelerating growth.\\n\\n2. In many countries, fiscal policy is, as a practical matter, a rela-\\ntively inflexible instrument, partly because of unsatisfactory adminis-\\ntrative arrangements and in some cases also because of outmoded and\\nunenlightened views about budget deficits. Monetary policy is adminis-\\ntratively more flexible, but, in practice, freedom to use it for domestic\\npurposes has become increasingly limited by balance-of-payments con-\\nsiderations.\\n\\n3. Free international movement of goods and of capital as a means\\nof achieving efficient use of resources is generally accepted as a goal,\\nand substantial progress has been made in achieving it. In particular,\\nsince the advent of general currency convertibility in 1958, controls\\nover the international flow of capital have been relaxed and investors\\nhave become increasingly inclined to shift funds internationally in re-\\nSponse to differential changes in expected rates of return.\\n\\n4. Subject to some important qualifications to be discussed below,\\ntrade is conducted under a system of fixed exchange parities, with ac-\\ntual exchange rates fluctuating only within very narrow limits around\\nthese parities.\\n\\n5. Countries hold limited supplies of monetary reserves in the form\\nof gold, foreign exchange, and lines of credit at the IMF. The reserves\\navailable and potentially obtainable set a limit—albeit a somewhat\\nelastic one—on the cumulative size of a country's balance-of-payments\\ndeficit. For this reason, each country operates subject to a balance-of-\\npayments constraint—not in the sense that the balance of payments\\n\\n208\\n\", 'By WannEN L.

Families with\\nlarge amounts of wealth were sampled at higher rates than is custom-\\nary in consumer surveys in order to provide averages more reliable\\nthan those usually obtained for the top wealth groups. For example, 23\\npercent of those interviewed had wealth of $100,000 or more. Without\\ndifferential sampling rates, it is estimated that only 2 percent would\\nhave had wealth of this size. As a result, means for the top wealth\\ngroup, $500,000 or more, are based on about 280 cases and those for\\nthe $100,000-$499,999 group are based on about 320 cases.\\n\\nThe first portion of the analysis deals with the broadest definition of\\nwealth that seemed feasible under survey procedures. The analysis is\\nin terms of six major components of wealth or net worth: own homes;\\nautomobiles; savings in the form of life insurance, annuities, and re-\\ntirement plans; investment in businesses and professions; liquid assets\\n(exclusive of currency); and investment assets—mainly stocks, mar-\\nketable bonds, and investment real estate. The debts secured by these\\nassets have been deducted from the value of the assets.\\n\\nThe second part of the analysis is confined to consumer portfolio;\\nthat is, liquid and investment assets.

The rapid\\ngrowth of savings accounts and shareholdings in savings and loan asso-\\nciations and credit unions makes it urgent for purposes of monetary\\npolicy to obtain new insights into the uses to which these funds may be\\nput. Builders of econometric models also have an interest in the ques-\\ntion, what is money, when they introduce the money supply into their\\nmodels.\\n\\nAs Chart I implies, a rapidly expanding volume of consumer trans-\\nactions has been supported by a medium of payment—currency and\\ndemand deposits—which has expanded much less sharply. To what ex-\\ntent have rising time and savings balances contributed to this result, as\\nthey have contributed to fill the visual gap in the chart? The question\\ncannot be answered by reference to a dictum of monetary theorists that\\nmoney consists of those assets that are \"more certainly realizable at\\nShort notice without loss\" and/or bear no interest because interest is\\npaid as compensation for parting with liquidity.\\' For purposes of\\nmonetary management the *moneyness\" of savings balances cannot be\\ndetermined by such formal criteria. The problem is not primarily one\\nof the depositories\\' readiness to redeem the passbooks at short notice\\nand in full. What is mainly in question is how savers view various\\nkinds of assets, why they accumulated them, and for what purposes\\nthey are willing to draw them down. If the savings balances really take\\nthe place of money nowadays in the minds and operations of the\\nholders, what tendency may they have to encourage waves of impulse\\nspending or of stock market investment? The answers depend on the\\ncircumstances and basic attitudes of the depositors.\\n\\nThe present study of the liquidity of near-money assets started from\\nthe proposition that the liquidity (or closeness to money) of a financial\\nasset depends not only on the properties of the asset itself but also, and\\nmore significantly, on the plans and purposes of its owner.

Introduction\\n\\nIt is well known that firms typically undertake a variety of activities,\\nsuch as formal training, industrial engineering, and operations research\\nprograms, that are peripheral to their direct production processes. In\\ngeneral these techniques are used to increase the flow of a process\\'s\\nvalue added and thus to make the process **more efficient\" in the eyes\\nof the entrepreneur. Without paying any attention to these activities,\\nmanagement scientists and economists have reported on the observed\\nphenomenon of firm learning or manufacturing progress where the num-\\nber of direct labor hours needed to produce a unit of product decreases\\npredictably as the firm gains experience in the production of the product.\\nThis is equivalent to saying, as before, that the firm\\'s rate of value\\nadded increases.\\n\\nIt would seem reasonable to suppose that firm learning should be re-\\nlated to these peripheral activities. If a firm expends resources in select-\\ning and training personnel for a given process, the process should be\\nmore efficient at the outset than with a lesser or nonexistent effort on\\npersonnel selection. Also a firm using operations research and industrial\\nengineering methods on a given process would expect the process to\\nbecome more efficient or to exhibit a faster rate of learning than without\\nthe use of these techniques.\\n\\nEconomists have overlooked both the phenomenon of firm learning\\nand the techniques by which the firm may influence its rate of learning\\nin constructing production functions of firms. Typically these functions\\nshow the maximum rate of output measured in value-added terms that\\ncan be obtained from given rates of inputs. \\'The efficiency level of the\\ninput factors is assumed to be invariant and their adaptation to one\\nanother and the process instantaneous and complete, so that the firm\\non selecting the rates of input for the various factors will begin and\\nmaintain its production at the maximum rate.

Introduction\\n\\nThe specification of a criterion which may be used to determine the\\noptimum longevity of capital in an economy has been the subject of\\nsome controversy in the literature. The contributions to the solution of\\nthis problem fall into two distinct categories. One approach to the prob-\\nlem of determining the optimal longevity of capital emphasizes micro-\\neconomic criteria based on profit maximization or cost minimization\\n[1] [2] [12] [14]. A second approach emphasizes macroeconomic cri-\\nteria based on the impact of changes in the longevity of capital on the\\nlevel and rate of growth of aggregate consumption and output [3] [4]\\n[8] [9]. To the extent that economic policy is oriented toward the pre-\\nvention or elimination of technological obsolescence, it is important to\\nknow the relationship between these two criteria. However, these two\\napproaches to the problem of determining an optimal longevity of capi-\\ntal have been developed more or less independently of one another with\\nno consideration having been given to the possibility that these two\\napproaches might lead to identical results.\\n\\nIt is the purpose of this paper to determine within the context of a\\nneoclassical growth model the conditions which must be satisfied in\\norder for the micro- and macroeconomic criteria to lead to similar re-\\nsults. In the next section a macroeconomic growth model is specified\\nand the equilibrium properties of this model are described. In Sections\\nIII and IV, respectively, the macroeconomic and microeconomic capital\\nreplacement criteria are explicitly derived. The implications for the life\\nof capital of each of the two criteria are compared in the final section\\nand the conditions which must be satisfied for their equivalence are de-\\nveloped.\\n\\n* The study resulting in this paper was supported in part by a fellowship granted by the\\nFord Foundation and in part by the National Science Foundation.\\n\\n1 A related point which will become more apparent below is that it is important to know\\nthe relationship among the level and rate of growth of aggregate consumption and output,\\nthe longevity of capital, and the share of investment in output. Policies oriented toward the\\nprevention or elimination of technological obsolescence may well have an impact on the share\\nof investment in output and hence on the level and rate of growth of output. Conversely,\\n\\npolicies oriented toward increasing the share of investment in output may well affect the\\nlongevity of capital.\\n']\n",

It is large; that is, the highest ranking members know less than\\nhalf of all the members personally.\\n\\n2. A majority of its members are full-time workers who depend\\nupon their employment in the organization for most of their incomes.\\n\\n3. The initial hiring of personnel, their promotion within the organi-\\nzation, and their retention therein are at least theoretically based upon\\nsome type of assessment of the way in which they have performed or\\n\\n439\\n', \"Introduction\\n\\nIt is ironic that bureaucracy is still primarily a term of scorn, even\\nthough bureaus are among the most important institutions in every na-\\ntion in the world. Not only do bureaus provide employment for a very\\nsignificant fraction of the world's population (probably over 18 per-\\ncent of the U.S. work force, for example), but also they make critical\\ndecisions which shape the economic, political, social, and even moral\\nlives of nearly everyone on earth. Yet economists and political scien-\\ntists have largely ignored bureaucratic decision making in constructing\\ntheir theories of how the world operates.\\n\\nIn this paper, I shall attempt to describe a theory of bureaucratic\\ndecision making aimed at achieving such predictability. My theory is\\nbased upon the fundamental hypothesis that bureaucratic officials, like\\nall other agents in society, are motivated by their own self-interests at\\nleast part of the time. Therefore, this theory follows the tradition of\\neconomic thought from Adam Smith forward and is consistent with re-\\ncent contributions to political science made by such writers as Simmel,\\nTruman, Schattschneider, Buchanan, Tullock, Riker, Simon, and\\nMarch.\\n\", 'By AuTHONY Dowws\\nReal Estate Research Corporation, Chicago\\n', 'A THEORY OF BUREAUCRACY\\n', 'NONMARKET DECISION MAKING\\n']\n",

      "['The question, What is the difference between a political party and\\na department store?\" sounds like a riddle, but I suggest it as a serious\\nsubject for inquiry. The two types of organization clearly are very\\ndifferent, and specifying the differences is a good exercise for an econo-\\nmist who is interested in applying the tools of his trade to the study of\\npolitics. The subject of this paper came to me while I was engaged in\\njust this exercise (which may or may not be regarded as a recom-\\nmendation). One of the conspicious differences is that the department\\nstore will normally own its own plant, while the political party does\\nnot. The political party may, of course, own some office furniture, but\\nthis is only a tiny part of the capital that it will use to serve its cus-\\ntomers if it is successful in the competitive struggle. This difference\\nbetween the political party and the department store is such an ob-\\nvious one that, like the purloined letter, it is almost invisible. We are\\nalso so accustomed to it, that a question as to why it should exist may\\nseem eccentric, but, as I hope to demonstrate, it has an economically\\ninteresting answer. This is one field where an essentially political prob-\\nlem can be treated entirely as an economic problem, specifically as an\\nexample of the problem of controlling natural monopolies. Looked at\\nin this way, we will see that there is a method of controlling natural\\nmonopolies which has not been much discussed by economists but\\nwhich has been in use by practical men for many years.\\n\\nThree techniques are normally suggested for dealing with natural\\nmonopolies: we can leave them alone, letting their managers do as they\\nwish, we can subject them to regulation, or they can be publicly owned\\nand operated. If you will bear with me in considering the government\\nitself as a natural monopoly, it will be obvious that none of these tech-\\nniques are suitable for dealing with it. Leaving the monopoly alone,\\nwhich if we are talking about government means a despotic state, is\\nnot at all impossible. In fact, this has been by far the commonest way\\nof handling the problem if we consider the whole of man\\'s history. I\\nsuspect, however, that there is no one in this room, no matter how de-\\nvoted to laissez faire, who will advocate this solution for this type of\\nnatural monopoly. In a sense the whole point of democracy is to pre-\\nvent this sort of \"free enterprise.\"\\n\\n458\\n', 'By GonpoN TULLOCK\\nUniversity of Virginia\\n', 'ENTRY BARRIERS IN POLITICS\\n']\n",

At the time, this doctrine looked like Lerner at his wildest—today it\\nis fiscal orthodoxy not only in the classroom but in many treasuries and minis-\\ntries of finance as well.\\n\\nThe idea can be extended into the international sphere. There is a lively\\ndiscussion going on today of whether or not the supply of international liquid-\\nity is adequate; and if not, what would constitute an adequate level. There is\\nmuch disagreement and little hope of its ever being resolved. All parties to the\\nargument, however, seem to agree on one thing: if the supply of liquidity were\\nto be brought to what is considered an adequate level, all would wish to keep\\nit stable at that level, or, at the most, increase it at an annual rate of three per\\ncent—which is the limit to which respectable economists are willing to stretch\\nthe meaning of the word stable, as a concession to the realities of our ex-\\npanding universe. The reason why the warring factions can agree on this one\\npoint is that they all believe in the desirability of balancing, in the long run,\\nthe balance of payments. Disagreement on how large a supply of liquidity is\\nadequate is disagreement on how long the long run should be. AIl economists\\nseem to agree that in the long run, however defined, each country shou!d\\nmaintain balance-of-payments equilibrium.\\n\\nLet me point out first of all that this is a moral doctrine. Our moral con-\\nscience tells us that it is not rigAit for anyone or any country to get something\\nfor nothing—although that, precisely, is what an indefinite balance of pay-\\nments deficit implies. If the deficit is on the current account of the balance of\\npayments, there is the further connotation that the country lives beyond its\\nmeans and spends more than it earns, with all the moral disapprobation that\\nthis calls forth. It is all right to run a deficit temporarily, in an emergency,\\nand as long as one's reserves allow; but people consider it morally imperative\\nthat these reserves be finite and either of the kind that have been earned be-\\nforehand or of the kind that must be repaid afterwards. This is the puritan\\nethic of international trade. What is wrong with it?\\n\\nWhat is wrong with it, I think, is that it is ethics rather than economics.\\nNot only is it perfectly good economics occasionally to get something for\\nnothing; it is or should be one of the economist's main preoccupations. It is,\\nindeed, the subject matter of welfare economics. To move from a non-optimal\\nto a Pareto-optimum situation is the art of getting something for nothing. A\\n\\n* I am indebted to Professors Alvin H. Hansen and Abba P. Lerner for reading the manu-\\nscript and making many valuable suggestions.\\n\", 'COMMUNICATIONS\\n']\n",

Foreign\\nstudents inevitably raise problems for the universities. While the problems are\\nnot different in kind, they are certainly exaggerated in degree from those asso-\\nciated with training Americans.

The chief fault in Turvey\\'s\\notherwise excellent paper is that he does not clearly state the relation be-\\ntween these critical assumptions and his conclusions for public policy. It\\nshould be useful to examine in more detail exactly which conditions must\\nbe present for one or the other of these regulations to in fact be necessary\\nfor a Pareto-optimum.\\n\\nIt is well known that if institutions are such that technological external-\\nities are present, competitive equilibrium will not be Pareto-optimal. Tur-\\nvey states that two kinds of external diseconomies are present in the kind\\nof competitively organized, single-trawl fishery which he considers. In the\\nfirst place, a fish caught by fisherman A reduces the stock of fish available\\nto other fishermen, increasing the amount of resources which these others\\nmust use to land a given catch. Secondly, a fish caught today by fisherman\\nA will not be around tomorrow as a larger, more valuable fish, again impos-\\ning additional costs upon the industry as a whole.\\n\\nLet the set of all fish in the banks be divided into two subsets: fish that\\nhave reached catchable size (called the **fish stock\") and fish which have\\nnot yet reached that size. The size of the smallest fish in the fish stock is\\ndetermined by the size of the mesh in nets used by the fishermen. Turvey\\nstates [1, p. 65] that operational models used by biologists to assess\\nfisheries commonly make the following assumptions: (a) growth of fish\\nand natural mortality are functions of age, (b) fishing mortality rate (catch)\\nis proportional to \"effort,\" and (c) recruitment into the fish stock, i.e., the\\nnumber of fish reaching catchable size, is exogenous.\\n\\nIf assumption (c) is taken literally, then \"weight recruitment,\" or\\npounds of fish reaching catchable size per time period, would depend only\\non mesh size, since larger mesh would lead to recruitment at a heavier\\nweight. Specifically, the number of fish in the fish stock or the size of the\\ncatch would not affect recruitment. It seems reasonable to assume that the\\nnumber of fish eggs laid per year is proportional to the number of fish in\\nthe banks, and that the number of fish hatching is proportional to the\\n', 'REFERENCES\\n1.

This communication will be limited to\\nan examination of the authors! contentions about steel industry technology.\\nAlthough several other assertions of the authors justify a re-examination,\\nspace limitations are such that this communication will not be able to examine\\nthese in the detail necessary.\\n\\nThe authors contend that U.S. steel producers have lagged behind foreign\\nproducers in investing in technologically improved facilities and, further, that\\nthey have invested in obsolete equipment and that improvements have been\\nadopted only when the industry has been forced to do so by the increasing\\npressure of foreign competition [1, pp. 626, 646]. To support their charges,\\nthe authors cite the examples of the oxygen furnace and the continuous-cast-\\ning process.\\n\\nSpecifically, the authors state that during the 1950\\'s, the U.S. steel industry\\nbought 40 million tons of the wrong kind of capacity, namely the open-hearth\\nfurnace. They state that *Much of the U.S. industry\\'s current investment in\\nplant and equipment is calculated not to add to capacity, but to correct the\\nembarrassing investment errors of the last decade\" [1, p. 627].\\n\\nIncreases in open-hearth capacity in the steel industry are shown in Table\\n13\\n\\nAlthough there was a net increase in open-hearth capacity of nearly 40 mil-\\nlion tons, only about 1614 million tons were accounted for by the construction\\nof new facilities during this period.

The one with which I am\\nparticularly concerned here is that of the role of knowledge in social\\nsystems, both as a product of the past and as a determinant of the fu-\\nture. There is a little terminological problem here, that the word\\n*knowledge\" in English has some tendency to approach the meaning of\\n*truth.\" We really have no convenient word to describe the content of\\nthe human mind without regard to the question as to whether this con-\\ntent corresponds to anything outside it. For this reason I have in the\\npast used the term \"image\" to mean this cognitive content of the\\nhuman mind.? But this term also is subject to misunderstanding, so for\\nthe purposes of this paper I will revert to the term \"knowledge,\" with\\na warning, however, that I make no assumptions about the content of\\npeople\\'s minds being true. We may recall the classic bon mot attributed\\nto Will Rogers, that *the trouble isn\\'t what people don\\'t know; it\\'s\\nwhat they do know that isn\\'t so.\" So little accustomed are we to ana-\\nlyzing this problem that there is even an ambiguity in the word *igno-\\nrance.\" It may mean that people have no image at all about something\\nwhere an image is possible, or it may mean that they have images\\nwhich are false or untrue. The pursuit of the question as to what we\\nmean by truth or untruth, however, leads us into a philosophical mo-\\nrass from which, as David Hume suggested, the only escape is to climb\\nout, clean oneself off, and go home and have a good dinner and forget\\nall about philosophy.

      "['By KARL SHELL\\nMassachusetls Institule of Technology\\n\\nI. Introduction\\n\\nIn at least two recent models of economic growth, the rate of techni-\\ncal change depends upon other economic variables. The first, a model\\nintroduced by Kaldor [3] [4] [5], assumes a positive relationship (the\\ntechnical progress function) between relative changes in productivity\\nper worker and relative changes in gross investment. The technical pro-\\ngress function is an eclectic amalgam summarizing basic technical and\\ninstitutional forces in a free enterprise economy. Kaldor takes the\\nSchumpeterian view that the creation of new ideas largely occurs at\\nan autonomous rate, but that the implementation of these new tech-\\nniques by entrepreneurs can be explained by economic phenomena.\\nObviously, if the implementation of a new technique requires new capi-\\ntal equipment as opposed to mere organizational change, increased pro-\\nductivity can only be transmitted through new (gross) investment. In\\naddition, Kaldor argues that for a capitalist economy the higher the\\nrelative rate of gross investment the higher the degree of \"technical\\ndynamism.\" Technical dynamism is a mass measure of entrepreneurial\\npsychology including the readiness to adopt new methods of production.\\n\\nIn the second model with endogenous technical change, Arrow [1]\\nconcentrates upon the relation between learning and experience. Eco-\\nnomic learning results in higher productivity, while cumulative gross\\ninvestment is the measure of economic experience. Therefore, in refining\\nthe technical progress function, Arrow explicitly postulates that produc-\\ntivity per worker is determined by accumulated gross investment. The\\nproduction of new technical knowledge (invention) and the transmission\\nand application of that knowledge (innovation) are treated as by-\\nproducts in the production and adoption of new capital goods.\\n\\nWhile it is doubtlessly true that technical change is related to gross\\ninvestment both as a by-product of capital goods production and as a\\nvehicle for embodying new techniques in new capital equipment, it is\\nalso true that the rate of production of technical knowledge can be in-\\ncreased by increasing the allocation of economic resources explicitly\\ndevoted to inventive activity.\\n\\n* Research for this paper was supported in part by National Science Foundation Grant\\nGS-95, *Economic Growth of the United States.\"\\n62\\n', 'TOWARD A THEORY OF INVENTIVE ACTIVITY\\nAND CAPITAL ACCUMULATION*\\n']\n",

      "['I. Introduction\\n\\nMost economic theorists have embraced the principle that certain\\nkinds of education—the three R\\'s, vocational training, and higher edu-\\ncation—equip a man to perform certain jobs or functions, or enable a\\nman to perform a given function more effectively. The principle seems\\na sound one. Underlying it, perhaps, is the theory that education en-\\nhances one\\'s ability to receive, decode, and understand information,\\nand that information processing and interpretation is important for\\nperforming or learning to perform many jobs.\\n\\nIn applying this principle we find it fruitful to rank jobs or functions\\naccording to the degree to which they require adaptation to change or\\nrequire learning in the performance of the function. At the bottom of\\nthis scale are functions which are highly routinized: e.g., running a\\npower saw or diagnosing a malfunction in an automobile. In these func-\\ntions, the discriminations to be made and the operations based on them\\nremain relatively constant over time. In the other direction on this\\nscale we have, for example, innovative functions which demand keeping\\nabreast of improving technology. Even a highly routinized job may\\nrequire considerable education to master the necessary discriminations\\nand skills. But probably education is especially important to those\\nfunctions requiring adaptation to change. Here it is necessary to learn\\nto follow and to understand new technological developments.\\n\\nThus far, economic growth theory has concentrated on the role of\\neducation as it relates to the completely routinized job. In its usual,\\nrather general form, the theory postulates a production function which\\nstates how maximum current output depends upon the current services\\nof tangible capital goods, the current number of men performing each\\nof these jobs, the current educational attainments of each of these job-\\nholders, and time. To simplify matters, some analysts have specified a\\nproduction function in which output depends upon tangible capital and\\n\"effective labor\"; the latter is a weighted sum of the number of workers,\\nthe weight assigned to each worker being an increasing function of that\\nworker\\'s educational attainment. This specification assumes that highly\\neducated men are perfect substitutes for less educated men (in the\\ntechnical sense that the marginal rate of substitution between them is\\nconstant). Actually, it is possible that educated men are more sub-\\n\\n69\\n', 'By Ricuanp R. NgrsoN, RAND Corporation\\nand EjoMuND S.

The list of those\\nparticipating is impressive: Kuznets, Hayek, Gerschenkron, Kindle-\\nberger, Hirschman, and Mahalanobis, to mention only a few. In ab-\\nbreviated form the issue has been stated as that of \"labor intensive\\nversus up-to-date technology\" [4, Chap. 10]. It is, of course, conceiva-\\nble, and in a few cases perhaps even practically possible, to use rela-\\ntively more labor advantageously with a modern technology. Also, an\\nolder piece of capital equipment may not necessarily embody an out-\\ndated technology, may little affect labor requirements, and may be\\nworthy of consideration mainly because of savings in capital cost.\\nSimilarly, a useful distinction can be drawn between the problems of\\nchoosing between industries with different capital requirements and\\nthe problem of choosing between more or less capital-oriented technol-\\nogies for performing a specific industrial or other economic function.\\nIn short, the problem is considerably more complex than choosing be-\\ntween a labor intensive or an up-to-date technology. At a minimum, it\\nwould seem appropriate to distinguish between: (1) old versus new\\ntechnologies; (2) old versus new equipment; (3) labor-oriented versus\\ncapital-oriented industries; and (4) labor-oriented versus capital-ori-\\nented technologies for a given industry.\\n\\nAIl except the third of these issues would appear relevant for trans-\\nport planning in less developed countries. Even outside of transport,\\nthe importance of the third or \"industry choice\" issue can easily be ex-\\naggerated for countries that are truly in their initial stages of develop-\\nment. For such countries the planning choices are usually quite lim-\\nited: almost any conceivable or sensible plan will include some consid-\\nerable emphasis on development of agriculture, transportation, con-\\nstruction, and public utilities (not to mention education and other so-\\ncial services).

      "[\"I. Introduction\\n\\nInvention and innovation in the less developed countries present\\nparticular problems for analysis because of the special characteristics\\nof the organization of their economies, their resource proportions and\\ntheir relations with more advanced economies and partly because of\\nthe intensity with which their economic growth is being pursued. In\\nthis paper I hope only to illustrate rather than resolve the difficulties\\nin understanding the role of technical change and in making policy for\\nit.\\n\\n'The distinction which I shall adopt between invention and innova-\\ntion is between the processes by which new products or processes are\\ncreated and the actual implementation of the new processes and pro-\\nduction of the new products. I shall not try to maintain the distinction\\nwhich has been made much of in the past, especially by Schumpeter,\\nbetween the first use of a new technology and its subsequent imitation.\\nIn some instances that distinction may be profound but I think those\\ncases are exceptional. The limited literature with which I am familiar\\non the sociology of innovation suggests to me that the distinction is\\nusually a matter of degree and that the psychological and cultural bar-\\nriers to imitation of a technological change are often no less significant\\nthan those to the first use. The innovation-imitation distinction may\\nalso be given an economic interpretation in terms of the relative risks\\ninvolved. It might be argued that except where monopolization is com-\\nplete the first innovator creates a true externality which reduces risk:\\nthe knowledge of his success or failure. But success or failure is not\\nalways quickly identified, except in extreme cases, and even in the case\\nof success in less developed countries neither the original innovator nor\\nhis potential imitators may be fully aware of how much is due to the\\nnew seed or new product, for example, or the special attention and fa-\\nvors of government officials.\\n\\n'The role of process innovation in directly increasing factor produc-\\n\\n! Professor E. Hagen's On the Theory of Social Change (1962) has influenced my views,\\nthough I cannot find a particular supporting quotation. The frequent references to the\\n\\ndifficulties of dispersing the technical changes demonstrated in pilot projects may also be\\nadduced in partial support of this view.\\n\\n98\\n\", 'By RicHanmp S.

The organizational reforms\\nannounced by Premier Kosygin in his speech to the Central Committee\\nof the Communist Party on September 27, 1965 [17], may be inter-\\npreted as the first stage in the revamping of the Soviet industrial sys-\\ntem—the stage of Libermanism. The announcement of the reforms came\\nthree years after the now famous article by Professor Evsei Liberman\\nin Pravda, September 9, 1962 [20]. I would characterize the reforms\\nas potentially significant, but not radical. It is likely they will not pro-\\nvide a fully satisfactory answer to the Soviet leaders! search for a more\\neffective economic system. It therefore seems useful to examine what\\nalternatives are open to them if they should choose to make other,\\nmore radical changes.\\n\\nWhat roads are open to Soviet leaders? In addition to the Liberman\\nroute of freeing the enterprises from some of the \"petty tutelage\" in\\ndeciding how to produce the goods the plans call for, and making sales\\nand profits the major success indicators, or the retention of the present\\ncommand system, there are two more radical roads. The Soviet leaders\\ncould adopt the prescriptions of Norbert Weiner\\'s Soviet disciples,\\nsuch as V. Glushkov and M. Fedorovich, and attempt to move toward\\nan efficiently run, centralized command system with the help of mathe-\\nmatical models and electronic computers. Or, alternatively, they could\\nadopt the recommendations of Soviet and East European economists\\nsuch as A. Birman and O. Sik who consciously or subconsciously are\\nattempting to adapt some features of Adam Smith\\'s \"invisible hand\"\\nto the problems faced in their socialist economies. This alternative\\nwould employ mathematical programming and computers to arrive at\\nbetter aggregative plans, but disperse detailed decision making to the\\nproductive units and attempt to structure incentives to make private\\nbenefits correspond to social benefits.

Coe has not found its way into patent policy.\\nThe Patent Code of 1952 stipulates that *patentability shall not be\\nnegatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\"? It appar-\\nently precludes discrimination in the granting of patents based on\\nwhether the discovery is the predictable result of organized, commercial\\nresearch, or the fruit of independent research, or a \"flash of genius.\"\\nNeither is there basis for discrimination predicated on the extent to\\nwhich one or a group of patents *\\'prevent the independent use of modern\\ntechnical information\" by other firms. That is, until the patent privi-\\nlege is abused by its use in price fixing, market sharing, or other mono-\\npolistic practices, its actual or potential effects on technical progress and\\non competition are immaterial to its validity.\\n\\nI shall not suggest a specific, alternative policy in this paper. It will\\nbe argued, however, that it is impossible fully to reconcile existing pa-\\ntent policy with the objectives of the antitrust laws and, indeed, with\\nthe constitutionally stated purposes of patents themselves.

In the analysis, quality of\\nschooling is explicitly considered as a principal contributor to produc-\\ntivity. The population considered consists of rural farm males, twenty-\\nfive years of age or older, that earned income in 1959. Persons who had\\nattended college are excluded from consideration in this study so that\\nan estimate of the quality of elementary and secondary schools can be\\nobtained. The original observations are for fifty-seven \"states\"; ten\\nsouthern states! being designated as two \"states,\" one consisting of\\nwhite persons and the other of nonwhites. Alaska, Hawaii, and Rhode\\nIsland are omitted.\\n\\nThe preliminary discussion focuses upon a procedure for the pre-\\ndiction of individual income by years of school completed for each\\nstate, holding age, race, and the ownership of land and buildings (of\\nfarm operators) constant. The adjusted income-schooling profiles are\\nthen compared to profiles **predicted\" by a market in which all labor\\nis freely mobile. The conclusion of this comparison is that the re-\\nturns to education are likely to be affected by differences both in the\\nquality of schooling and in the return per unit of education. Finally, the\\nanalysis proceeds to a production function framework in which a\\nsearch for the factors affecting quality of schooling is made, holding\\nother productive inputs constant. In the production function analysis,\\ntwelve additional states are excluded from consideration because of in-\\nsufficient school systems data.? Thus, the data reported in this paper\\nare for the remaining forty-five \"states.\"\\n\\nThe empirical analysis requires several transformations of the data.\\nThese transformations result in a set of parametric estimates whosc\\nprobability distribution is unknown.

While it is clear that textbook pub-\\nlishing is a profitable business, it is not so clear that textbook writing\\nis generally profitable. This paper examines two questions of concern\\nto authors and publishers. First, how are authors paid for their effort\\nand, second, a related question on which economic analysis should\\nshed light: how are textbooks priced. The focus in this paper is on col-\\nlege textbooks. The study is based on a questionnaire sent to authors\\nof recent economics textbooks and on consideration of some elemen-\\ntary aspects of price theory.\\n\\nPricing Textbooks\\n\\nThe process by which publishers determine prices is somewhat mys-\\nterious.

An estimate is made\\nof the direct costs of a first printing equal to estimated sales. This cost\\ncan be estimated quite accurately. While per-unit costs could be low-\\nered somewhat by a printing run larger than estimated sales, there is a\\nstrong aversion to carrying inventories. This is not irrational. Invento-\\nry-carrying costs can easily outweigh the modest savings from larger\\nprintings. The resulting cost figure is then multiplied by some number\\nto determine list price. This number varies from publisher to publisher\\nand from book to book, but is generally around 374 to 5.\\'* This provides\\nthe margin for overhead, royalties, advertising, and retailer profit.\\n\\n* A higher multiplier is generally used for trade books, primarily because of the larger\\nretailer markup on trade books. \"These comments are based upon discussions with several\\n\\n412\\n', 'THE PRICING OF TEXTBOOKS AND THE\\nREMUNERATION OF AUTHORS\\n\\nBy PAuL M.

But two demands have created what has become a\\nperennial source of tension because they propose somewhat conflicting\\nobjectives. One demand has been for \"more significant and more diver-\\nsified\" programming. The second has simply been for the availability\\nof more \"choice\" within the existing framework of program offerings.\\n\\nGenerally, the first demand has been based on the view that an\\ninsufficient fraction of television programming has been of high quality\\nor of high purpose, or conversely that too large a fraction has been of\\nmediocre caliber aiming at the lowest common denominator among the\\npublic in order to yield the largest size of audience. Put another way,\\ntoo little television time has been devoted to serious drama, serious\\nmusic, ballet, art, etc., and too much to light entertainment that simply\\namuses or entertains—but does not edify or challenge or uplift. These\\ncriticisms, for shorthand purposes, have often been summed up as\\ncharging a lack of diversity in television programming.\\n\\nThe conventional answer to this criticism has been that the public\\nchooses its programs freely and that broadcasters simply respond to\\nconsumer choice; that is, the public gets the kind of programming it\\ndesires. But to this answer, three kinds of response have been made.\\n\\nFirst, and at the most naive level, has been the claim that television\\nprogramming has simply not met the desires of the bulk of the Ameri-\\ncan public; in other words, that the broadcasters have simply misun-\\nderstood consumer demands.\\n\\nA second response is the assertion that while commercial television\\nprogramming may satisfy a majority of the public, a large minority of\\nthe American public is vastly dissatisfied.\\n\\nA third and more sophisticated level of criticism argues that, while a\\nmajority of the public may be satisfied with television fare, they are\\nnot really very satisfied. In fact, the peculiarities of this particular\\nmarket, it has been argued, are such that competition leads not to opti-\\nmum response to consumer desires but rather to the acceptance by the\\nconsumer of a kind of second best.

      "['The importance of private foundations in the production of econom-\\nic knowledge is generally conceded. Examples abound of foundations\\nthat have played Maecenas to neoclassical and Keynesian theory\\nbuilders, to linear programmers and games players, to data-makers\\nand data-takers, and to other laborers in the economic vineyards.\\nWhether given to research institutes for large-scale, long-range proj-\\nects, to groups of university scholars, or to individuals for the leisure\\nto think, foundation grants often have meant the difference between\\nunfinished exploration and discovery.\\n\\nI make this assertion with confidence, not only because I believe it\\nto be correct, but also because it presently can be neither precisely re-\\nfuted nor confirmed. As the paper will repeatedly demonstrate, we as\\nyet do not have the data, much less the tools of analysis, for precise\\nmeasurement of effects. I therefore have taken as my assignment the\\nmarshaling and presentation of readily available data which, hopeful-\\nly, might permit at least some rough measurement of the magnitude of\\nfoundation spending on economic research. To begin, I shall briefly\\nsummarize the level and trend of total foundation giving.\\n\\nMost recipients of foundation grants may be pardoned if they are\\nunclear as to the effects of foundations on their fields of interest.\\nLarge-scale foundation spending is so recent that its accumulating\\neffects are still very much in the process of being realized.

Most of the ex-\\nplosion relates to the thousands of small foundations spawned in the\\n1950\\'s and 1960\\'s. However, there has also been a considerable in-\\ncrease in the number of the large ones that account for the bulk of\\ngrants. The history of the Ford Foundation is typical.

      "[\"This paper is intended to discuss only a fragment of the sweeping\\nsubject suggested by the assigned title. It is limited to some observa-\\ntions on the use of economic knowledge in the conduct oí public\\naffairs.\\n\\nIn his presidential address last year, Stigler advanced rather inci-\\ndentally the thesis that the influence of economists and theory upon\\nthe formulation of policy had usually been small (1, p. 12]. Certain-\\nly few of us can be satisfied with the knowledge we possess for policy\\nguidance, or with the record of explicit policy achievements over the\\nyears and across the wide range of policy problems confronting the na-\\ntion. Yet somehow the ideas of economists have had a vast and in-\\ncreasing influence on public affairs. That influence, often with a nota-\\nble lag, has been felt on central banking, monetary policy, fiscal policy,\\nSocial security, tax policies, wartime price and production controls,\\ntrade policy, international monetary policies, defense policies, defense\\nmanagement, foreign aid, economic development, and countless other\\nprograms. Both economists and their theory have gained in influence\\nsince the 1930's, especially since 1941, and even more since 1961. The\\nenormous improvement of economic data available has been both a re-\\nsult and a means of extending that influence. Advances in economic\\nknowledge have not only placed economists in positions to influence\\npolicy, but, because of it, the goals and methods of policy in many\\nareas are far more precise and ambitious than they were a generation\\nago. What then accounts for the seeming contradiction?\\n\\nThe fields I have mentioned are among those in which economists\\nhave worked extensively. Although their studies may seldom have been\\ndesigned directly for policy formulation, they have nevertheless\\ninfluenced policy. Moreover, in these areas economists have exerted an\\ninfluence in the councils shaping policy by taking an active part as ad-\\nvisers or officials. Stigler refers particularly to policy areas in which\\neconomists have done comparatively little work or work that is inade-\\nquate to guide important policy judgments. In addition he may be\\nlooking for a more direct line of influence than is ordinarily visible in\\nthe intricate process of policy formation—a process which has been\\nlittle understood and often oversimplified.\\n\\n530\\n\", 'By RonznT D.

I would not ex-\\npect anyone in this audience to doubt the existence of this trend, dat-\\ning rather from Cournot (1838) than from Smith himself.

In short, what we are\\ntrying to find out is how a person\\'s probability of being in the labor\\nforce is affected by the amount of formal schooling he has had.\\n\\nAside from pure intellectual interest, there are several justifications\\nfor studying the relation between educational attainment and labor\\nforce participation.

When private\\ngoods, such as personal favors or money, can be exchanged for a vote commit-\\nment, then the problem of paying the cost of a public good arises. For if a\\nvote commitment is purchased, to be cast in favor of a collective action, then\\nall who favor the action gain, but only the individual who purchases the com-\\nmitment pays the cost. As Olson's work implies, this can lead to failure to\\npurchase vote commitments which are too costly for one individual to pur-\\nchase, but which would provide a benefit to each if costs were appropri-\\nately allocated.\\n\\nIf all the goods used in exchange are votes in actions of collectivity, the\\nproblem of paying the cost of obtaining a vote commitment is less serious,\\nthough it still exists. If A gives up a vote on one action for a vote on a second,\\nhe incurs a utility loss in loss of control of the first votes. He is paying the cost\\nof the public good, but it is a public cost, since the vote he gives up is a public\\ngood. It is a cost experienced by all those who agree with him on the action\\nwhose vote he gave up, just as there is a gain experienced by all those who\\nagree with him on the action whose vote he gained. Thus there is a sharing of\\ncosts just as there is a sharing of benefits of the exchange. But those who op-\\npose him on the first action but agree with him on the second action experi-\\nence a gain in both actions, and those who agree with him on the first and op-\\npose him on the second experience a loss on both. Thus we cannot say that\\nthere is a sharing of costs and benefits, as is necessary in the rational provi-\\nsion of a public good.\\n\\nAltogether, I have no quarrel with Mueller, and fully accept his\\nmodification of the theory I proposed in my paper (with the amendment\\nabout full negotiability of vote proxies). However, there remain a number of\\ndifficult problems that neither he in his comments nor I in my paper have ad-\\ndressed, as I have indicated in my comments above.

      "[\"Wages and the Guideposts\\n\\nEconomists seem quite unsure of whether the guideposts are working and\\nare divided on whether they like them. Among those who don't, a further\\ndivision exists between those who don't like them because they don't work\\nand those who don't like them because they do. In any case, some facts\\nwould help everyone decide on which grounds to oppose or defend the guide-\\nposts, the facts, of course, being incapable of actually changing anyone's\\nbasic position for or against them.\\n\\nOne casual argument that is made is that the guideposts are no longer a\\nfactor, witness the various wage increases that have shattered them. Iam\\nprepared to argue from casual evidence, and shortly will. But some settle-\\nments, or even all settlements, being made above the Administration's cen-\\ntral figure of 3.2 per cent show nothing. The interesting question is whether\\nwage (and price) changes have been smaller than they would have been\\nwithout the guideposts.\\n\\nTo test this, one needs an estimate of what they would have been; an in-\\nvestment in one method of making such an estimate [1] led me to look at\\nthis question. The method is to use an equation for estimating wage changes\\n(straight time hourly earnings of production workers) in manufacturing\\nbased on postwar quarterly data.

According to this ap-\\nproach a country is to maintain *\\'the kind of balance of payments that best\\nserves its domestic goals\" rather than an equilibrium in the balance of pay-\\nments for its own sake. It is a credit to his ingenuity that once his scheme is\\nadopted, the level of unemployment will decrease, international liquidity\\nwill increase, and at the same time developing countries of the world will\\nreceive unrequited assistance.\\n\\nThe gist of this scheme is to allow the deficit country to obtain exchange\\nreserves from a reformed International Monetary Fund with goods and\\nservices produced in the country. The surplus country will eventually hold\\nthese newly created reserves, and developing countries will receive the addi-\\ntional products. A problem arises, however, as to the size of exchange re-\\nserves to be given to the deficit country in exchange for the products.\\nProfessor Scitovsky proposes that the new reserves created should be equal\\nto the value of the products to be transferred to developing countires.

      "['A HisTORICAL NOTE FROM THE PRESIDENT\\n\\nFollowing the events which took place in Chicago during the week of the Democratic\\nParty Convention I received large numbers of telephone calls, letters, and petitions from\\nour members urging us to move the 1968 meeting, scheduled for Chicago, to another city.\\nThere were a smaller number of communications on the other side. The question whether\\nto stay in or move from Chicago therefore came to involve an active decision. The neces-\\nsity for a decision was reinforced by the decisions of our sister associations—the sociolo-\\ngists to boycott Chicago for ten years, the psychologists to move their 1969 meeting, and\\nfinally the historians\\' decision to move their meeting which was scheduled at the same\\ntime as ours.\\n\\nI was in Montreal at the Congress of the International Economic Association from Sep-\\ntember 2-6, and took the opportunity provided by the presence there of a considerable\\nnumber of our members to call a special, informal meeting of members of the A.E.A. to\\ndiscuss the matter. A variety of views were expressed, and a straw vote at the end of\\nthe meeting resulted in the following ballot: 43 voted to move from Chicago, and 15\\nvoted to stay; 34 said they would boycott the meeting if it was held in Chicago, and 24\\nsaid they would not boycott the meeting. Even though this was only about 0.5 per cent\\nof the membership, it was suggestive of the depth of feeling involved.\\n\\nHarold Williamson, our Secretary, and I therefore decided to meet in Evanston, at the\\noffices of the Association, on September 7, with representatives of the Chicago Arrange-\\nments Committee, the Convention Bureau and the hotels. In the meantime we had re-\\nceived invitations from two other cities and we had polled all available members of the\\nExecutive Committee by telephone or cable. The vote was evenly split.\\n\\nWe also consulted the other societies with which we have joint meetings; one society\\nprobably would wish to move, and three to stay. In light of the split vote of the Execu-\\ntive Committee the responsibility for the decision rested with me. Immediately after the\\nmeeting, then, I made my decision and wrote the following letter, which was sent out to\\nthe membership.\\n\\nDear Colleagues:\\nThe events in Chicago during the Democratic Convention, and especially the police\\naction as witnessed on television, have exploded a wave of shock through the minds\\nof men, and created a sense of moral anguish, which I have shared, and which has not\\nleft our Association unmoved. We have had to make a decision, therefore, on whether\\nto move the December 1968 meeting, scheduled for Chicago, to some other city. The\\nExecutive Committee of the Association has voted, by telephone canvass, 5 to move\\nand 5 to stay; one member could not be reached. The decision therefore has become\\nmy personal responsibility, as President of the Association. I have canvassed opinion\\nas widely as possible. It would be feasible, though diffcult, to move to another city,\\nend it is likely that a clear majority of our members would support such a move.\\nFurthermore, a meeting in Chicago may be boycotted by a considerable number of\\nour members, for reasons which I personally respect and share.\\nNevertheless, my decision is to hold the meeting in Chicago, and not to move it,\\nbecause I believe that the meeting can be used, more effectively, in Chicago, as a\\nfulerum to help move the future rather than as a stick to belabor the past. I pro-\\npose that we devote time, outside the formal program, to a searching discussion of\\nthe agonizing discontents of our world, along with representatives of the city, with\\nthe object of asking ourselves, both as professional economists and as citizens, what\\nwe can do towards making the future better than the past. If we can turn the steam\\nof our legitimate anger and anguish into some engine of solid proposals for social\\nchange, the chance for a better future is enhanced. I hope my friends will forgive\\nthis decision, and my foes will refrain from applauding it. I will welcome any com-\\nmunications in the ensuing weeks which will help us in organizing constructive dis-\\ncussions at the meetings. And I hope my successors will not have to make decisions\\nas difficult as this one.\\n\\n\"The following supplemental letter was sent out later, and may help to clarify some of\\n\\nthe issues.\\n', '1509\\n', 'NOTES\\n']\n",

      "['Macroeconomics of Unbalanced Growth: Comment\\n\\nIn a recent article in this Review [1], W. J. Baumol describes two sectors\\nin the economy: one \"technologically progressive\" and the other registering\\nonly \"sporadic increases in productivity.\" The latter includes services ren-\\ndered in municipal government, education, the performing arts, restaurants,\\nand leisure time activities, as well as certain types of labor-intensive goods\\nlike the \"fine pottery and glassware produced by the careful labor of skilled\\ncraftsmen\" or \"large and stately homes\" [1, p. 41]. Baumol finds that inno-\\nvation, capital accumulation, and economies of large scale are lacking in these\\nactivities, and that in this sector of slow growth \"for all practical purposes the\\nlabor is itself the end product\" [1, p. 416]. He also states that the actual\\ngrowth of productivity in a given activity *is a manifestation of the activity\\'s\\ntechnological structure, which determines quite definitely whether the produc-\\ntivity of its labor inputs will grow slowly or rapidly\" [1, p. 416]. I suggest\\nthat the slow-growth activities with which Baumol is concerned reflect not the\\ntechnological structure of their own production but the current technology of\\nconsumption as well, and that the latter has been strikingly neglected in mea-\\nsuring output. Consequently, the input-output ratio used to measure produc-\\ntivity in goods industries is frequently inapplicable to the service industries.\\n\\nI\\n\\nBy their very nature, services entail little or no lapse of time between their\\nproduction and consumption; goods, by contrast, are typically produced at\\none point in time while distribution, purchase, and consumption in the sense\\nof use occur later.

      "['A Paradox on Profits and Factor Prices: Comment\\n\\nAccording to an interesting paradox discovered by R. R. Nelson [2] and\\nrediscovered (and extended) by P. A. Meyer [1], an increase in the price of\\none factor of production can, in the short run, lead to an increase in the\\nprofits of a competitive industry. The rise in costs can induce a reduction\\nin output sufficient to raise product price by more than average variable\\ncost.\\n\\nMeyer concludes that the paradox depends on a variety of complex con-\\nditions. He states that profits respond positively to a factor-price change\\n\"when the absolute value of the ratio of demand elasticity to supply elas-\\nticity is less than the ratio of the share of all other productive factors to the\\nshare of the higher-price factor. .. . It is more likely that profits willin-\\ncrease (1) the smaller the share of the higher-priced input, (2) the more in-\\nelastic is demand, or (3) the more elastic is supply\" [1, p. 539].\\n\\nHowever, if the industry total-variable-cost function has the form TVC\\n—g0\"(a» 1), the paradox will hold for any product-demand schedule of\\nless than unitary elasticity, assuming the initial factor-price change causes\\na proportional shift in the cost functions. The result appears to be quite in-\\ndependent of the elasticity of the supply function (as represented by a) and\\nof the share of the price-rising factor in total cost.\\n\\nA proof is relatively easy if factor supplies are infinitely elastic to the in-\\ndustry. Marginal cost will be agQ^^. At an initial output Qi, with product\\nprice equal to MC, total revenue will be agQ:*, total variable cost will be\\n£0s*, and gross profit ( »- TR — TVC) will be (a — 1)gQy.\\n\\nNow we assume that an increase in a factor price causes the TVC func-\\n', 'REFERENCE\\n\\n1.

Miller\\n[2] and D. J. Aigner and A. J. Heins [1] attempt to explain state-to-state\\nvariations in income concentration by means of cross-sectional multiple\\nregression analysis for the United States. Aigner and Heins indicate that\\ntheir purpose is \"to report further evidence of the tendency for the personal\\nincome of a region to be more equally divided the more maturely developed\\nis the region\" [1, p. 175]. Al-Samarrie and Miller conclude that the level of\\neducation is \"highly [inversely] correlated with income concentration\"\\n[2, pp. 61 and 71]. Simon Kuznets examined international and interregional\\ndata and reported that countries and regions at a lower level of income tend\\nto have a greater income inequality [5] [9]. The conclusions of these and\\nother writers support the commonly held view that the distribution of in-\\ncome is more equal the higher the level of income or schooling in a region.!\\n\\nAigner and Heins state that *\\'there is no formal theory available which\\nsatisfactorily concerns itself with the relationship between development\\nand the inequality of incomes\" [1, p. 176]. They also indicate that they have\\nnothing more than a \"\\'naive theory\" for relating their variable for level of\\nschooling (which they use to \"describe the basic skill level of each state\\npopulation\") to income inequality [1, pp. 177-78]?\\n\\nI have two purposes in writing this note. I wish to show that a specific\\ntheory, the theory of investment in human capital, may be used to demon-\\nstrate that, across regions, the level of schooling can be related to income\\n\\n1 This view is so common among economists that it is frequently expressed in textbooks on\\neconomic principles without qualifications. For example, see P. Samuelson [11, p. 111, note to\\nfigure 6-3(a) ].\\n\\n? Kuznets indicates that we lack **a firm set of links between the observable changes in the\\nproduction structure that constitute economic growth and the observable associaled changes in\\nthe income distribution\" [9, p. 2]. In his discussion of the relationship between the level and\\ninequality of income there is an absence of an explicit consideration of the effect of training or\\nschooling on the distribution of income (8] [9].\\n', 'COMMUNICATIONS 495\\n\\n5.

      "[\"The Myth of Absolute Advantage: Reply\\n\\nProfessor Anspach argues that Ricardo really had a third productive re-\\nsource, Land, in mind when he presented his exposition of absolute advantage.\\nIf he is correct in this interpretation (which can only be derived by inference\\nsince Ricardo certainly did not say so), then Ricardo's example of absolute\\nadvantage becomes nothing more than a case in which the resource endow-\\nments (including Land) of England and Portugal are such that England has a\\n\", 'ceivable that one region\\'s population may be composed of people like Mr. A,\\nand another\\'s of people like Mr. B, so that interregional absolute advantage\\nmust also be admitted.\\n\\nThe other great heuristic value of absolute advantage is that it helps us to\\nshow that trade is beneficial to both countries even if one country can produce\\nboth goods more efficiently (ie., with less of every resource) than another.\\nIndeed, it should be noted that the only reason we need to use the term com-\\nparative advantage is the existence of absolute advantage. The adjective, com-\\nparative, was introduced to show that, even if A has an absolute advantage\\n(or disadvantage) in both goods, it can still gain from trade if its advantage in\\none good is larger than in the other—i.e., if relative prices differ in the two\\nregions prior to trade. In the pure Hecksher-Ohlin case, where absolute advan-\\ntage cannot exist, there is no reason for any adjective. A country simply has\\nan advantage in one good, a disadvantage in the other.\\n\\nI conclude that it is futile to search for absolute truth about absolute ad-\\nvantage, and premature to speak of discarding it as a myth. Whether or not\\nthe concept is useful and meaningful depends on the context.\\n\\nJawzEs C.

      "['A Note on the Equivalence of Tariffs and Quotas\\n\\nIn his recent article on the equivalence of tariffs and quotas [1], Jagdish\\nBhagwati argued that the equivalence— defined *\\'in the sense that a tariff rate\\nwill produce an import level which, if alternatively set as a quota, will produce\\nan identical discrepancy between foreign and domestic prices [implicit tariif |\"\\n[1, p. 53]—followed from the universal assumption of competition, namely\\n(a) competitive foreign supply, (b) perfect competition in domestic produc-\\ntion, and (c) a quota which was allocated so as to ensure perfect competition\\namong the quota holders, and that this equivalence generally broke down with\\nthe introduction of monopoly elements into any one or more of these listed\\nareas.*\\n\\nHe then examined some of the implications of the nonequivalence proposi-\\ntion, including problems such as the protective effect of tariffs when combined\\nwith quotas (when, despite the implicit tariff being greater than the explicit\\ntariff, it was shown that there could be a net protective effect from the pres-\\nence of the explicit tariff whereas traditional analysis in terms of the equiva-\\nlence proposition would declare the explicit tariff to be redundant in this case).\\nBut, while Bhagwati\\'s definition of equivalence is adequate for the purposes to\\nwhich it has been put by him, it is not readily and always useful if one\\'s pri-\\nmary interest is in determining whether tariffs and quotas lead to equivalent\\nprotective effects, either in terms of reducing imports or with respect to their\\neffect on domestic importable production.\\n\\nIt thus turns out that, while tariffs and quotas are not equivalent sometimes\\nin Bhagwati\\'s sense, they are equivalent in terms of giving rise to identical pro-\\ntective effect, although the breakdown of equivalence in one sense implies\\nbreakdown of equivalence in the other sense in most cases. In the following, I\\nshall attempt, first, to set out a concrete case of such a conflict of results per-\\ntaining to equivalence, and by so doing I hope to supplement Bhagwati\\'s arti-\\ncle, since this attempt involves an analysis of a case which he left specifically\\nunexamined, namely the one involving monopolistic sale from foreign sources\\n[1, p. 54]. Secondly, I shall try to shed some light on the significance of the\\nequivalence of tariffs and quotas in their protective effects with monopolistic\\nsupply from abroad, in the development of practical commercial policies by an-\\nalyzing the so-called *Voluntary Export Restrictions.\"\\n\\nI. The Equivalence of Tariffs and Quotas Under Monopolistic Foreign Supply\\n\\nSuppose that our primary interest is in the protective effect of tariffs and\\nquotas, then what really matters is whether the prevailing domestic prices of\\nthe importing country are the same or different, when a given level of imports\\nis produced by means of a tariff or alternatively by a quota.

      "['More on the Equivalence of Tariffs and Quotas\\n\\nIn an earlier paper on the equivalence of tariffs and quotas [1], I argued\\nthat this equivalence—defined such that a tariff would lead to a level of im-\\nports which, if alternatively set as a quota, would generate the same implicit\\ntariffÉ—followed from the assumptions of competitive domestic production,\\nsupply of imports, and holding of quotas. This universality of competitiveness\\nsufficed to guarantee equivalence, as defined. It was further argued that a de-\\nparture from these assumptions could, in general, destroy this equivalence and\\nseveral such departures were analyzed: (1) perfect competition in domestic\\nproduction replaced by pure monopoly in production; (2) perfect competition\\namong quota-holders replaced by monopolist-holding of quota; and (3) simul-\\ntaneous presence of monopoly in quota-holding and in domestic production\\n[1, p. 54].\\n\\nRecent communications, however, from Hirofumi Shibata [2] who has ana-\\nlyzed the case where there is monopolistic supply of imports, and from G.\\nYadav [5] who has analyzed the case where there is monopolistic import\\nunder both tariffs and quotas, have suggested the following clarifications and\\nextensions of some importance.\\n\\n1. The definition of equivalence, as stated above, will run into some diffi-\\nculty if the tariff situation is itself characterized by a discrepancy between the\\nc.i.f. import price and the domestic price (and hence an implicit tariff) which\\ndiffers from the tariff rate. In this case, is a tariff which gives rise to an import\\nlevel which, in turn, set as a quota, gives rise to an implicit tariff which is un-\\nequal to the tariff bu£ equal to the implicit tariff under the tariff situation itself\\nto be regarded as equivalent to that quota?\\n\\nIn the original analysis, which treated only cases where the tariff situation\\nwas characterized by a discrepancy between the c.i.f. import price and do-\\nmestic price (and hence an implicit tariff) which could not depart from the\\nexplicit tariff, this question could not arise.

      "['The Graduated Fair Return: Comment\\n\\nIn the June 1966 issue of this Review, Alvin K. Klevorick offers and per-\\nsuasively defends an ingenious proposal for offsetting the distortion—noted by\\nAverch and Johnson and Wellicz and elaborated by Westfield and Shepherd\\n[1] [26] [27] [18]—that is introduced into the investment decision of\\npublic utility companies by a system of regulation that consists primarily of\\nholding them to some fixed rate of return on investment [14]. His solution—\\nto graduate the permissible return downward with progressively larger stocks\\nof capital—is appropriate to the problem in question. If correctly applied, it\\nwould offset any tendency for regulated companies to make investments whose\\nmarginal value product is less than their marginal cost.\\n\\nThe purpose of this communication is to raise the question whether the par-\\nticular distorting factor he seeks to offset represents a more or a less powerful\\ninfluence on investment than another, the recognition of which has a much\\nmore venerable tradition in the literature, and which operates in the opposite\\ndirection: monopoly itself. The Klevorick proposal could make matters worse\\nrather than better, depending on which of these two influences is the stronger.\\n\\nThe private marginal revenue product of public utility investments can di-\\nverge from the social for two, partially offsetting reasons. The \\'\\'A-]-W effect\"\\n(let us so identify it, after Averch, Johnson and Wellicz) increases the former\\nrelative to the latter, because to the net revenues directly generated by incre-\\nmental investments, if they fall short of yielding the allowed rate of return, can\\nbe added the revenues the company can recoup by raising rates on other parts\\nof its business, so long as the regulatory authority has previously prevented it\\nfrom fully exploiting its monopoly power in those markets.\\' The monopoly\\n\\n!

      "['Railroad Social Saving: Comment\\n\\nThe introduction by Robert W. Fogel of the concept of social saving into\\nthe world of the economic historian has formulated a revolution, the results of\\nwhich certainly have not been fully digested [2]. Fogel calculated the social\\nsaving (the flow of income from the resources freed by an innovation, ex-\\npressed as a percentage of national income) for the railroad in 1890. This he\\naccomplished by comparing the actual situation, favored with the railroad, with\\na hypothetical alternative of the economy, deprived of the \"iron horse\" but\\nadjusted to the next-best alternative. He found an optimistic social saving of\\n6.3 per cent due to the presence of the railroad but considered a figure of less\\nthan 5 per cent to be more realistic [2, p. 223].\\n\\nThis raises the question of the significance of this finding. Does 5 per cent\\nrepresent a large or a small number? Fogel was specifically testing the hypoth-\\nesis that the railroad was indispensable to American economic growth. He\\nclearly believed that this figure, calculated at the peak of the railroad\\'s influ-\\nence, demonstrated that it was not. (Furthermore, if we read Fogel correctly,\\nhe never implied that the railroad was unimportant, as often alleged—only that\\nsignificant growth could still have occurred in its absence.) It however appears\\nto remain for the reader to agree or disagree, since there exists no objective\\ncutoff between dispensable and indispensable.\\n\\nRecently E. H. Hunt, in this Review, raised the question of interpreting\\nFogel\\'s findings [5]. He concludes that the correct interpretation of the social\\nsaving attributed to the railroad would support the traditional view of the rail-\\nroads significance. Even though Mr. Hunt\\'s analysis has been challenged in\\nthe note immediately preceding this one, the question that he raised is real\\nenough. In this note we tentatively offer an alternative way of evaluating the\\nsignificance of Fogel\\'s findings. We suggest that one could proceed by asking a\\n', 'to this method GNP is decreasing at an increasing rate, eventually it will reach\\nzero and become negative. The error is that Hunt subtracted 5 (not 5 per cent\\nof the change) from GNP.

Susan Rose-Ackerman (1978 P. 9) Also Motivates Her Inquiry Into Corruption With A Similar Observation. She Writes: *... Corrupt Incentives Are The Nearly Inevitable Con- Sequence Of All Government Attempts To Control Market Forces ... .\" However, She Does Not Pursue This Line To Discuss  194  The Optimal Mixture Of Market Failure And Corruption, Which Is The Focus Of Our Paper.  ? See Maurice Crozier (1964), Guy B. Peters (1989), Or James Q. Wilson (1989) On The Role And Duties Of Bureau- Cracies. These Studies Substantiate Our Assumption That It Is Not Possible To Have Government Intervention Without A Sizable Bureaucracy And That Bureaucrats Will Have An Infor- Mational Advantage Over Their \"Principal.\" For Example, Peters (1989 P. 196) Writes: \"The First And Perhaps Most Important Resource Of The Bureaucracy Is Information And Expertise.\"\n",

      "To Participate In 401(K) Plans, And More Than 36 Million Workers Made Contributions To These Employer-Provided Saving Plans. In 1995, The Last Year For Which The U.S. Department Of Labor Has Released Definitive Data, 401(K) Contribu- Tions Amounted To $87.4 Billion, Or 55 Percent Of All Contributions To Employer-Sponsored Pension Plans. The Level Of Contributions, And Their Share Of All Pension Contributions, Is Probably Signifi- Cantly Higher Today.  The Spread Of 401(K) Plans Is The Most Important Indicator Of The Move To Personal Retirement Saving. In 1980, Almost 92 Percent Of Pension-Plan Contributions Were To Tradi- Tional Employer-Provided Plans, And About 64 Percent Of These Contributions Were To Conventional Defined-Benefit Plans. Today, Almost 60 Percent Of Contributions Are To Personal Retirement Accounts, Including 401(K), Ira, And Keogh Plans. Including Employer- Provided, Non-401(K) Defined-Contribution Plans, Over 76 Percent Of Contributions Are To Plans That Are Controlled In Large Measure By Individuals. These Individuals Make Partici- Pation, Contribution, Asset-Allocation, And Withdrawal Decisions.  In This Paper, We Describe The Likely Impor- Tance Of 401(K) Assets For Future Older Ameri- Cans And The Effect Of Investment Decisions On Asset Accumulation. We Also Examine The Extent To Which Retirement Assets May Be Affected By Several Decisions: Preretirement Withdrawals, Management Fees And Expenses, Contribution Rates, And Early Retirement.

The Views Expressed Herein Are Those Of The Authors And Not Necessarily Those Of The Federal Reserve Bank Of Minneapolis Or The Federal Reserve System.  ! Regarding Theoretical Reasons To Expect Gains, A Partic- Ularly Interesting Idea Can Be Traced Back 40 Years To Gary S. Becker (1957) And Armen A. Alchian And Reuben A. Kessel (1962). It May Be That A Firm Or Industry With Monopoly Power May Face Restrictions On Its Ability To Pay Pecuniary Returns To Itself. Given This Constraint, The Mo- Nopoly Chooses To Take More Return In Nonpecuniary Payoffs (Like Leisure On The Job) Than Would Otherwise Be The Case. As Competition Increases, Some Of These Nonpecuniary Re- Turns Are Rolled Back (See More Discussion On This Below). Good Surveys On Other Ideas Are Found In F. M. Scherer And David Ross (1990 Pp. 667—72) And Stephen J. Nickell (1996). See Stephen L. Parente And Edward C. Prescott (1999) For An Interesting Model. Regarding The Evidence Supporting The View That Competitive Pressure Increases Productivity, Scherer And Ross (1990 Pp. 667—72) Provide Extensive References But Still Conclude That \"The Evidence Is Fragmentary,\" While Nickell Calls The Evidence \"Very Thin.\"  ? Recent Theoretical Papers Illustrating Connections Be- Tween Tariff Reductions And Productivity Include Marc Melitz (1999) And Thomas J. Holmes And Schmitz (2001).\n",

While This Paper Examines The Importance Of Short-Run (Binding) Constraints That May Be Present During College, There Exist Other Types Of Credit Constraints That Could Influence Higher Educational Attainment. For Example, Family Constraints During A Child'S Youth Could Influence Higher Educational Attainment Of The Child By Affecting His/Her Human Capital Accumulation At The Time Of High School Graduation (Cameron And James J.

Heidhues Gratefully Acknowledges Financial Support From The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Through Sfb/Tr-15.  ! Indirect Evidence For This Fact—Often Referred To As Price Stickiness—Is Provided By Anil K. Kashyap (1995), Margaret E. Slade (1999), And Judith A. Chevalier, Kashyap, And Peter E. Rossi (2003), Who Document In Various Retail Industries That Regular Prices Typically Do Not Change For Months At A Time. There Is Also Direct Evidence That Marginal- Cost Changes Are Sometimes Fully Absorbed By Retailers (Competition Commission Of The United Kingdom 1994, 150, Sect. 7.41). And Evidence On Countercyclical Markups Reviewed In Julio J. Rotemberg And Michael Woodford (1999) Suggests That Even When Prices Do Adjust To Circumstances, They Move Less Than Marginal Costs.\n",

Heidhues Gratefully Acknowledges Financial Support From The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Through Sfb/Tr-15. Kószegi Thanks The National Science Foundation For Financial Support Under Award 440648659.  ! See, For Inetance, Lawrance M. Ausubel (1997), Thomas A. Durkin (2000), Kathleen C. Engel And Patricia A. Mccoy (2002), Oren Bar-Gill (2004), Elizabeth Warren (2007), And Bar-Gill (2008).  ? David I. Laibson, Andrea Repetto, And Jeremy Tobacman (2007) Estimate That To Explain A Typical Household'S Simul- Taneous Holdings Of Substantial Illiquid Wealth And Credit-Card Debt, The Household'S Short-Term Discount Rate Must Be Higher Than Its Long-Term Discount Rate. Complementing This Finding, Stephan Meier And Charles Sprenger (2009) Docu- Ment That Low- And Middle-Income Individuals Who Exhibit A Taste For Immediate Gratification In Experimental Choices Over Monetary Payments Have More Outstanding Credit-Card Debt. Laibson, Repetto, And Tobacman (2007) Calculate That Many Households Are Made Worse Off By Owning Credit Cards, So The Fact That They Get Those Cards Suggests Some Degree Of Naivete About Future Use. Consistent With This Idea, Consumers Overrespond To The Introductory \"Teaser\" Rates In Credit-Card Solicitations Relative To The Length Of The Introductory Period (Haiyan Shui And Ausubel 2004) And The Post-Introductory Interest Rate (Ausubel 1999), Suggesting That They End Up Borrowing More Than They Intended Or Expected. Paige Marta Skiba And Tobacman (2007) Find That The Majority Of Payday Borrowers Default On A Loan, Yet Do So Only After Paying Significant Costs To Service Their Debt. Calibrations Indicate That Such Costly Delay In Default Is Only Consistent With Par- Tially Naive Time Inconsistency. For Further Discussions As Well As Evidence For A Taste For Immediate Gratication In Other Domains, See Stefano Dellavigna (2009).\n",
