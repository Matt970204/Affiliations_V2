      "['Two Liquidity Functions and the Rate\\nof Intetest: |. A Simple Dynamic Model\\n\\nThis paper contains a model describing the determination of the rate of interest.\\nThe model is in principle founded on the Keynesian theory of the interrelation between\\nthe quantity of money and the rate of interest. When using this theory it is important\\nto distinguish between different kinds of \\'\\'interest rates\" and different kinds of\\n\" money.\" The model is concerned with the latter distinction, which is stressed by\\nintroducing two sectors—\\'\\' the banks\" and \\'\\'the public \"—whose dispositions on\\nthe credit market will be treated separately. In consequence two \\'\\' quantities of\\nmoney \"\\' and two liquidity functions are obtained. The importance of this distinction\\nis further stressed by introducing the banks\\' reserve ratio of cash to the public\\'s\\ndeposits as a link between the two liquidity functions. The model operates exclusively\\nin terms of these two functions and thus the analysis of the determination of the rate\\nof interest concentrates on the monetary sector of the economy. But in this respect\\nthe model is to be regarded only as a first step towards a more complete treatment.\\n\\nThe aim of the analysis is not limited to giving a dynamic and differentiated\\nmodel that still in principle runs on traditional lines. When trying to make precise\\nthat model in a sequence there appear certain weaknesses in the use of given liquidity\\nfunctions. The confusions partly concern the meaning of a successive movement along\\nthe liquidity curve and partly the constancy of that curve itself when the successive\\nmovements are carried out. The problems are raised when the given changes in \\'\\' the\\nquantity of money \" have to be \\'\"\\' translated \" into those bond transactions that a\\nmovement along the liquidity curve actually imply. This consideration is an out-\\nstanding feature of the model. It will possibly give a more clear picture of price\\nformation on the credit market and suggest some completions and modifications of\\nthe traditional theory.\\n\\nDEescRIPTION or THE MopEL\\n\\nUsing Keynesian terminology the cash-holding of the public for transaction\\npurposes is assumed to be constant since variations in income and employment are not\\nconsidered in the model. Further, the speculative cash-holding of the public is assumed\\nexclusively to take the form of bank deposits. The banks need a certain transaction\\ncash determined by the amount of deposits. The amount of this reserve cash is assumed\\nto bear a fixed ratio of total deposits (given by convention or by law). The banks are\\nassumed to hold their cash in the form of money (liquid claims on the central banks).\\nThe speculative cash-holding of the public and of the banks is assumed to depend on\\nthe rate of interest. In equilibrium the amount of the speculative cash-holding, both\\nof the banks and of the public, corresponds to the rate of interest according to individual\\nliquidity functions. And at the same time that part of the banks\\' total cash which is\\nnot held for speculation exactly amounts to the given quota of public\\'s deposits.!\\n\\nWhat happens if in an equilibrium the total cash-holding of the banks is increased ?\\nFor simplicity the primary change in cash-holding is assumed to concern only the\\nbanks and, e.g., depends on a redemption of governmental bonds. The banks are\\nconfronted with surplus cash which they try to place in iriterest-bearing paper. This\\n\\n1 It is a$sumed that the necessary reserve cash is primarily supplied out of total cash. The remaining\\n\\npart makes up for the speculative cash. The two types of cash cannot replace each other. (Cf. Keynes,\\nGeneral Theory, p. 199.)\\n\\n98\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 09:42:39 UTC\\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n']\n",

The notes that follow are based on excerpts from a lengthier paper on the\\ntheory of consumers\\' choice under rationing,! most of the results of which had—I\\nfind—been anticipated by Paul A. Samuelson in his Foundations of Economic Analysis.?\\nI shall, therefore, present them in the form of an extension of, and commentary upon,\\nhis analysis; and shall adhere as far as possible to his notation, which deserves to\\nbecome standard. The matters primarily discussed are: (7) the interpretation of the\\nSlutsky equation when point-rationing is in force, and (i?) the use of this equation in\\nconnection with the measurement of changes in real income resulting from the intro-\\nduction of point-rationing. First, however, we shall summarise some of Professor\\nSamuelson\\'s results. This is done in 2 (1) and 2 (3) below. 2 (2) contains some com-\\nments on them.

      "['Advertising Costs and Equilibrium :\\nÀ Reply\\n\\nIn the thirty-second issue of this REviEW Professor Chamberlin criticised the\\narticle of mine on this subject which appeared in its fourth issue. While I do not\\nwish to defend my article in toto, as I should now present the point somewhat\\ndifferently, I am also not willing to accept the whole of his criticism. This falls into\\nthree parts: he argues that I have misunderstood and misrepresented a section of\\n\" \\'The Theory of Monopolistic Competition\" ; that my own suggested technique is\\nbased upon error; and that the problem created for economic analysis by the fact\\nthat advertisement creates interdependence between cost conditions and demand\\nconditions cannot be eliminated by devising a technique of subtraction.\\n\\nOn the first of these points I am prepared to let the case rest; both texts are\\navailable, and where difference arises it is only reasonable that Professor Chamberlin\\'s\\ninterpretation of his own works should be accepted. On the third, I am in complete\\naccord, and only the clumsiness of my presentation could have conveyed a different\\nimpression, particularly, as Professor Chamberlin notes, in view of my subsequent\\nwork in the same field. I therefore devote the greater part of this note to developing\\nthis more fruitful theme. The second I cannot accept. In a note in the Qwarterly\\nJournal of Economics for May, 1935, \" Discontinuous Demand Curves and Mono-\\npolistic Competition,\" quoted in the bibliography to the fifth edition of \\'\\' Monopolistic\\nCompetition\", I present the full diagram of which only a part appears in my REvIEW\\narticle, and from it the argument is self-evident. Or it can be proved in the following\\nmanner, for which I am indebted to Dr. E. G. Phillips of this University.\\n\\nIf & is the total expenditure on advertising, ? the price, and x the quantity\\ndemanded for any combination of ? and &, then the height of the curve PQ on my\\ndiagram is y — $ — \" when $ is given.\\n\\nIf k is given, this equation gives a family of curves, each for a value of ?$.

It thus denotes, for any given quantity of sales, the point of maximum revenue.\\n\\nI should not now claim that the conditions of full equilibrium were to be derived\\nfrom my diagram.

      "['A Note on Profit Maximisation\\nand its Implications.\\n\\nThat the entrepreneur aims at maximising his profits is one of the most fundamental\\nassumptions of economic theory. So much so that it has almost come to be regarded\\nas equivalent to rational behaviour, and as an axiom, which is self-evident and needs\\nno proof or justification. Doubts have been raised by several writers whether maximis-\\ning his profits is always the entrepreneur\\'s best policy.! But such doubts were few\\nand have died away without reverberation ; mainly, I think, because it has never\\nbeen made clear what exactly profit maximisation implies ; and perhaps also because\\nwe have a vested interest in maintaining this assumption—it makes economic analysis\\nso much simpler.

Naturally we have to labour under the most trying circum-\\nstances. As far as research is concerned, the chief difficulties are that we\\nhardly receive all the important books and periodicals from abroad for\\nlack of foreign exchange, and for those which our library can afford to\\npurchase, they come in after great delay. It may be of interest to you\\nthat important as your book is, I guess there are no more than ten copies\\nin free China! And we suffer most interruptions from air bombing, which\\ntakes place practically every day. With all this you may have ready\\nsympathy since we now are not in too different positions.\"\\n\\nProfessor Li\\'s point is very similar to that raised by Professor Lange,\\n(cf. REviEw or Ecowowuic SruDpirEs, October, 1940). But it is clear that\\nProfessor Lange\\'s note, and Professor Hicks\\' reply had not penetrated to\\nChungking when Professor Li wrote his note. It is felt that in view of all the\\ncircumstances the note will be of considerable interest to readers of the\\nReviEW.—Editor.\\n\\nIn Professor Hicks\\' Value and Cafital, most of the necessary tools for the\\ntheory of dynamics, which is developed in the second part of the treatise, are\\nfound in the first part on the theory of statics.

It seems, however, there are difficultues\\narising from Professor Hicks\\' exposition and analysis. It is with these difficul-\\nties that this note is concerned.\\n\\nWe are concerned with the analysis of relative price movements of com-\\nplementary and substitute goods. Let us note at the outset that when X and Y\\nare complementary, a fall in the price of X, increasing the demand for X, will\\nraise the demand for Y and its price, and that when they are substitutes, it will\\nlower the demand for Y and its price.! Here it is obvious that the price move-\\nments of X and Y will run opposite to each other when they are complementary,\\nand in the same direction when they are substitutes. This proposition is deduced\\nby Professor Hicks in section 4 of the chapter on the Working of the General\\nEquilibrium System and henceforth is given the status of a \\' rule.\" Thus when\\nhe comes to analyse the changes in prices as a result of an increased desire for\\nsome particular commodity X on the part of a small number of the persons\\n\\n1!

      "['A. View of the Aggregation\\nProblem\\n\\n1l. INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe aggregation problem is concerned with the relationship between macrotheory\\nand microtheory. Its usual formulation (as set out, for example, by Klein [4, 5], Balderston\\nand Whitin [1], or Theil [10]) involves a comparison between the predictions obtained\\nfrom a large economic model with many equations and variables and a smaller model in\\nwhich the variables and parameters are aggregates of those in the larger model. In\\nparticular, it is desirable that the aggregated predictions of the micro model should not\\nconflict with those of the macro model. A simple example is provided by de Wolff [14].\\nAssuming that an unambiguous meaning can be attached to the income elasticity of\\ndemand of an individual consumer, he investigates those circumstances in which similar\\nprecision can be attached to the concept when applied to a group of consumers.\\n\\nIn a recent book by Theil [10] it is shown that where a set of linear micro equations\\nis to be aggregated into a single macro equation, aggregates can always be defined so that\\npredictions from the micro equations do not contradict those from the macro equation.\\nSimilarly, such *\\' perfect\" aggregation is frequently possible when the micro equations\\nare non-linear?\\n\\nWhere there are several macro equations to be derived, a less satisfactory state of\\naffairs prevails. While it is always possible to obtain macro reduced form equations from\\nlinear micro reduced form equations, this situation corresponding to the single macro\\nequation case, it is rarely possible to obtain macro structural equations in the same way.\\nThe reason for this is that the same micro variables will usually be aggregated differently\\nin different macro reduced form equations, but to obtain the macro structural equations\\nit is required that these aggregates be identical?.\\n\\nThe position adopted in this paper is that the attempt to solve the aggregation problem\\nby means of the definition of indices of micro variables is bound to be unsatisfactory,\\nand leads to a mistaken view of the relationship between micro and macro theory. Apart\\nfrom the possibility of the non-identity of indices*, the present view is unacceptable because\\n\\n\\'\\'The author has benefited considerably from discussion of this topic with Professor Baumol of\\nPrinceton University. He is also indebted to Messrs. Archibald, Lipsey and O\\'Leary of the London\\nSchool of Economics for valuable discussion of an earlier draft.\\n\\n* An example is provided by Klein [4]. If each firm\\'s production function may be represented by an\\nextended version of the Cobb-Douglas production function, he shows how a production function of the\\nsame type may be derived for the economy as a whole.\\n\\n* Theil [10, p. 152] discusses a situation in which two macro reduced form equations each contain an\\nincome index, but these two indices are as a rule not identical.\\n\\n* [t is worth noting that in his reply to Klein Shou Shan Pu [9] pointed out that these indices may have\\nonly the most tenuous connection with variables appearing in macro theory.\\n\\n58\\n\\nThis content downloaded from\\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 05:55:09 UTC\\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n']\n",

First, the\\nassumption of closure is inessential to my argument and to demand theory, one merely\\nredefines the notion of compensation, so that the consumer is compensated if he receives\\nthe greatest lower bound of incomes which permit him to reach a position at least as good\\nas he could achieve under the initial conditions.

In the preceding note, Beckmann shows how the conclusion given by Samuelson!\\nthat 3b' 8x z» 0, where the vector of activities x changes as a result of a change of the vector\\nof revenues b, can be generalized to include changes in the vector of factor availabilities c\\nand in the technology matrix 4. These results are arrived at solely by consideration of\\nknown relationships among the vectors in question, not by any explicit consideration of\\nthe restraints applying to the individual elements of these vectors. It is the purpose of\\nthe present note to show the further considerable sharpening of these results which may be\\nobtained by taking into account the specific restraints on the individual variables. We shall\\nfind, in fact, (a) that the two quantities in Beckmann's expression (9) are individually\\nsubject to a corresponding restraint ; (b) that the restraint applies not merely to the vector\\nproducts shown but to each term in the vector products ; and (c) that a simple rule separates\\nthose cases in which the equality sign holds in these expressions from those cases in which\\nthe inequality sign holds.\\n\\nIn section 2 the assertions (a) and (5) will be simultaneously demonstrated ; in sections\\n3 and 4 the consequent sharpening of Beckmann's result will be applied to the special\\ncase he considers in his section 2 of a change in a single technological coefficient ; in\\nsection 5 some further consequences of (a) are examined ; in section 6 the rule mentioned\\nin (c) is set out and demonstrated in detail ; and in section 7 the rule (c) is illustrated using\\nthe example from Marshall given by Beckmann in the preceding note.\\n\\n2.

In fact, in order to avoid grouping, one should have\\nnot only to distinguish between all the different brands and grades of a given commodity,\\nbut also to use such small units of time that quantities purchased, at different points of\\ntime, within a unit period could be regarded as perfect substitutes. It is seldom possible\\nto adopt such a procedure, and, consequently, the demand functions whose parameters\\nwe attempt to estimate from empirical data are not, usually, identifiable with the demand\\nfunctions of economic theory. Indeed, the so-called parameters of such equations are,\\nin most cases, not parameters at all ; for, even if the tastes and income of every consumer\\nin the market and the prices of all commodities outside the group were to remain constant,\\nthere would, generally, be no constant relation between the price and quantity indices for\\na given group of commodities.\\n\\nThis leads to the question of what we are trying to measure when attempting to esti-\\nmate the parameters of stochastic demand equations involving groups. Are we trying\\nto estimate the values of certain constants which, assuming a complete knowledge of con-\\nsumers\\' preferences, could be deduced from economic theory, or are we performing\\nmeaningless arithmetical operations?\\n\\nConsider the n demand equations :\\n\\n(1) qi — f(pi (D, Pa (D, . «Pu Psi (0, pao m) i — 1... .n\\n\\nin which q(f),p.(t) and m(r) are the quantity of the ith commodity, the price of the ith\\ncommodity and money income respectively in period z. | Let P(t) be any index of the prices\\nof the first »? commodities which varies in proportion to these prices when they all change\\nin the same proportion, and let Q() be the quantity index defined in such a way that P(f) Q(1)\\nalways varies in proportion to the expenditure on the group.

      "[\"Welfate Economics of Variable astes\\n\\nI\\n\\nWelfare economics in its present form has to make the unrealistic assumption\\nthat the consumers' tastes remain constant in the period under investigation. The\\npurpose of this paper is to try to find a method of dispensing with that assumption,\\nand of dealing with changes in the consumers' welfare when their tastes change, with\\nor without changes in other economic and non-economic conditions.\\n\\nFor this purpose we must go beyond the assumptions of the usual ordinal utility\\ntheory. We shall assume, not only that consumers are able to compare the utilities\\nthey would derive from different groups of commodities at a given moment (on the\\nbasis of given taste), but also that they are able to compare the utility (subjective\\nsatisfaction) they derived from one group of commodities at the time /A,, when their\\ntaste was T, with the utility (or subjective satisfaction) they now derive from another\\ngroup of commodities at the time Z,, when their taste is T,. The empirical justification\\nof this assumption will be examined in Section 2.\\n\\nIt should be noted that this assumption, though it goes beyond the usual ordinal\\nutility theory, does not depend on the concept of cardinal utility since it by no means\\nrequires that differences between different levels of utility should be comparable. The\\nconcept of utility that we shall use is an ordinal utility concept, though an ordinal\\nutility concept of a special kind.\\n\\nAdopting this assumption, one may still describe a given taste T, of a certain\\nindividual in terms of any arbitrarily chosen ordinal utility function with the only\\nrestriction, as usual, that preferred positions must be assigned a higher value of the\\nutility function, and that equally preferred positions must be given the same value.\\nOur assumption entails an additional restriction only in the case when this individual's\\ntaste changes (say, to 7), for this new taste must now be described in terms of a utility\\nfunction consistent with the one defined for the taste T,. In other words, if certain\\nobjective situations have the same value for the individual on the basis of his present\\ntaste T, as certain other situations had on the basis of his previous taste T4, they must\\nbe assigned the same value of the utility function as the value ascribed to the latter\\nsituations.\\n\\nFor instance, let us assume that the left-hand graph of Fig. r represents an\\nindividual's indifference map belonging to the taste T4, and that the right-hand graph\\nof the same Fig. shows his indifference map corresponding to the taste T',. If we\\ndisregard the utility indices appearing on the graphs, it is impossible to tell whether a\\ngiven point of the right-hand map represents, in terms of the taste 7;, a utility higher\\nor lower than, or equal to, the utility of any particular point of the left-hand map in\\nterms of the taste T,. To decide this, we need the additional information as to which\\nindifference curves on the one graph and which indifference curves on the other graph\\nare equivalent to each other, i.e. represent the same level of utility for the individual.\\nThis piece of information may be called the correspondence rule between the two in-\\ndifference maps. Our assumption of the comparability of the utilities corresponding\\nto two different (subsequent) tastes of an individual implies the existence of such a.\\ncorrespondence rule between his subsequent indifference maps.\\n\\nThis correspondence rule is expressed by the utility indices of the two graphs of\\nFig. r. The indifference curves AB, CD and EF of the left-hand graph have been\\narbitrarily assigned the utility values 4 — I, 4 — 2 and w — 3 respectively.

      "['A Rejoinder\\n\\nMr. Prest\\'s summary of my argument is hardly fair in detail or in general\\nimpression. While I do hold that calculations of aggregate national income figures are\\nsubject to severe limitations, for policy decisions, among other reasons, I specifically\\nemphasised that they are o£ \\'\\' useless \". It also seems unreasonable of Mr. Prest to\\nattribute to me sweeping generalisations such as that \\'\\' model building is a mirage,\"\\nthat \\'\\' evaluation of local food sales is not of much interest,\" or that attempts \"\\' should \"\\'\\nbe made to forecast food production. I would, moreover, point out : (r) High labour\\nturnover in particular industries is not inconsistent with resources being specific : men\\nmay, and do, move between agriculture and mining without being available for skilled\\nbuilding jobs. (2) To say that lack of development involves reliance on the proceeds of\\nexports, is not to define \\'* underdevelopment,\" still less does it imply that the United\\nKingdom or New Zealand is underdeveloped.! (3) To accumulate several years\\' data\\none need not wa?! several years : one can estimate tables for past years. (4) Discrep-\\nancies between movements of aggregates make it difficult to pass from \\'\\' demand \"\\nto \"supply \" analysis : this difficulty is not removed by calculating both aggregates.\\n\\nTwo of Mr. Prest\\'s arguments are based on misunderstanding. My point about\\n\" a large fraction of all economic transactions\" being covered by readily available\\naccounts was meant to refer to the \\'\\' transactions \" one has to estimate for tables of\\nnational accounts. The total of such \\'\\' transactions \"\\' is indeed of virtually no interest,\\nbut this is irrelevant to the question whether a set of such tables can usefully be con-\\nstructed, which was the question under discussion.\\n\\nSecondly, what one includes in an account depends largely on statistical conve-\\nnience. The account for the \"transport system \" will, admittedly, be confined to\\ntypes of transport for which statistics are readily available, mainly public transporta-\\ntion, and I should perhaps have made that clear. Such an account may well be of\\nlimited significance in some territories, but, fortunately, it will in many cases cover a\\nlarge proportion of the transport of exports, and thus help to show how income from\\nexports spreads through the economy—which I believe to be one of the main purposes\\nof national accounting in underdeveloped areas.? Incidentally, the fact that transport\\nmay be undertaken by the same man who processes or distributes the commodity does\\nnot necessarily make meaningless the attempt to show the \\'\\' transport \" component\\nseparately. In the example given by Mr. Prest, the canoe may carry other things\\nbesides dried fish, and the question of substituting a lorry for the canoe may arise one\\nday. However, I agree that one can sometimes leave a large undifferentiated category\\nin the national accounts without too much loss.\\n\\nTo turn to the issue of application of national accounting in underdeveloped\\nareas, Mr. Prest once more exaggerates my position. It would certainly be incorrect\\nto make an \\'\"\\' assertion that voluntary personal saving can be taken as zero.\" What I\\nactually said was that \\'\\' we might not be far wrong to assume as a working hypothesis\\nthat voluntary savings will be zero.\" The procedure suggested is to forecast various\\nitems of a \\'\\' savings-and-investment \" table, and to show what demand for personal\\nsavings will be implied by various sets of,policies for development, the budget, etc.\\nIf the demand is large, this suggests certain dangers of inflation, and it is in this sense\\nthat one uses a \"\\' working hypothesis \" of zero savings. The practical conclusions to\\n\\n1 This implication is a nice illustration of the fallacy of the undistributed middle.\\n?

In this paper it will be shown that the \\'\\' principle of increasing\\nrisk \" does not provide a sufficient explanation of the limit of the rate of investment\\nin the general case, for although the entrepreneur\\'s risk and the lender\\'s risk increase\\nwith the size of the loan, given an arbitrary amount of the entrepreneur\\'s own capital,\\nthe risk of the enterprise as a whole declines with increasing size.

The Theory of Monopolistic\\nCompetition attempts to explain how investment per unit time is determined, but the\\nexplanation is clearly inadequate :\\n\\nImperfect competition . . . operates to limit the portion of & (the available\\ncapital) invested in any particular field, but not the limit to the total amount of &.\\nOn the other hand, imperfect competition cannot account for the fact that in a\\ngiven industry large and, small enterprises are started.

According to Kalecki (4, 5, 6) the limiting factor is the in-\\ncreasing risk attached to the marginal unit of investment, and not the declining\\nmarginal efficiency of capital :\\n\\nThere are two reasons for the increase of marginal risk with the amount\\ninvested. The first is the fact that the greater the investment of an entrepreneur\\nthe more is his wealth position endangered in the event of unsuccessful business.\\nThe second reason is the danger of \\'\\'illiquidity \" . . . the amount invested &\\nmust be considered as a fully illiquid asset in case of a sudden need for \\'\\' capital.\"\\nIn that situation the entrepreneur who has invested in equipment his reserves\\nand taken \\'\\' too much credit \" is obliged to borrow at a rate of interest which is\\nhigher than the market one. . . . If, however, the entrepreneur is not cautious\\nin his investment activity it is the creditor who imposes on his calculations the\\nburden of increasing risk charging the successive portions of credit above a certain\\namount with rising rate of interest. [Kalecki (5, p. 442).]\\n\\nInvestment is thus determined by the intersection of the marginal efficiency of\\ncapital curve with the increasing risk curve. The smaller the initial capital of the\\nentrepreneur, the greater is the entrepreneur\\'s risk at any given level of investment.\\nThe smaller the entrepreneur\\'s investment, the less can be borrowed, and hence the\\nsmaller the maximum absolute expansion per unit time.

The first steps of Mr. Houthakker\\'s proof, which build upon the work of\\nSamuelson? and Little,? may be quickly summarised as follows :\\n\\nLet P\\' be a set of prices of » goods (f, 5f, . . ., $45), with the condition 5j! — 1\\nimposed to avoid complications due proportional price sets.

These sequences\\nare all constructed through intermediate price-sets that are linear combinations of\\nP? and P!.

Another batch of goods X??, bought at prices P?, is shown to be\\npresumably equivalent to X? by direct comparison of the two batches. It is then\\nnecessary to show that if X! is presumably equivalent to X?, X? presumably equivalent\\nto X!, and X?? presumably equivalent to X?, then X?? and X? are identical batches.\\n\\nMr. Houthakker uses a reductio ad absurdum proof by assuming first that\\nP?X?? — P?X?, and letting P?X23? — P?X? — 4D.

      "['Àn Exposition of the Keynesian System\\n\\nI.\\n\\nThe rudiments of the Keynesian system as applied to a closed economy may be\\npresented to beginning students by means of a simple, linear model consisting of six\\nvariables, two parameters, and six equations. The variables are Y, C, 7, R, M, and M;.\\nY is the aggregate flow in income during a specific period. C represents aggregate\\nexpenditures by the private sector of the community on consumer goods and services.\\nI represents net expenditures by the private sector of the community on investment\\ngoods. R, the rate of interest, symbolises the structure of interest rates rather than\\n\" the \" rate of interest.? M, stands for that portion of the money supply held for the\\npurpose of satisfying the transactions and precautionary motives. M, represents\\nmoney held as an asset—that is, to satisfy the speculative motive.\\n\\nThe parameters of the model are » and g, representing the quantity of money and\\ngovernment expenditures on goods and services, respectively. These parameters are,\\nconsequently, exogenous to the private economy. Changes in the parameters indicate\\nintervention by the government through monetary and fiscal policy.\\n\\nThe system of equations which connect and determine the six variables is :\\n\\n(a) Y-—CcI-c-g\\n\\n(b m-—M,r-M,\\n\\n(6) C-F(Y)\\n\\n()  I—E(R)\\n\\n(6) M,—T(Y)\\nR — L(Mj).\\n\\nEquation (a) states that aggregate income is composed of consumption and invest-\\nment expenditures on the part of the private economy plus total government expendi-\\ntures on goods and services.? Equation (b) gives us the Keynesian classification of\\nmoney balances.\\n\\nThe consumption function, equation (c), is a schedule of consumption expenditures\\nat various levels of income, where O — dC/dY — r. The shape of the consumption\\nfunction depends upon a host of other variables assumed to be constants in the model.\\nThese constants include: the community\\'s attitude toward thrift; expectations\\nregarding prices, the supply of consumer goods, and the level and certainty of income;\\nthe tax structure ; the social security system ; the distribution of income and wealth,\\nand the form in which wealth is held ; population size and distribution ; the extent\\nof foreign trade ; corporate dividend policy ; education; and advertising.\\n\\nEquation (d) is the investment demand function, or the schedule of the marginal\\nefficiency of capital. This function shows the relation between R and 7. That is, given\\nthe schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital, the rate of interest determines the\\nrate of investment. Other variables, for our purposes assumed to remain constant,\\nwhich determine the shape of this function include: entrepreneurial anticipations\\nwith respect to market demand, the algebraic rate of change in the level of income,*\\nthe community\\'s stock of capital, the rate of innovation, the marginal physical pro-\\nductivity of capital goods, and the tax structure.\\n\\n1\\'* Investment \"\\' in the sense of an addition to real capital should be distinguished from \\'\\' investment \"\\nin popular usage which includes the purchase of securities and existing real assets.\\n\\n* It would perhaps be more realistic to treat R as an index of the availability of capital rather than as\\na structure of posted interest rates.\\n\\n3 Since taxes have not been introduced explicitly, government expenditures are financed by borrowing\\n\\nor by printing paper money.

      "['Ihe Speculative Demand for Securities\\nand Carty-Over\\n\\nI.\\n\\nNearly all writers on interest theory, whether they favour a stock approach or a\\nflow approach, seem now to be agreed that the demand for securities of speculators\\nmust be included in any analysis of the formation of interest rates. There is perhaps\\na smaller degree of agreement as to whether analysis in terms of the demand and\\nsupply of money is permissible. This latter problem boils down to the question of what\\nassumptions are made. If bonds and money are the only assets held by wealth-owners\\nand if the aggregate demand for both goods and factor services equals their aggregate\\nsupply, then any excess demand for money must reflect an equal and opposite excess\\nsupply of bonds. In such circumstances, we can say indifferently that the bond-rate\\nof interest is determined by the demand and supply of money or by the demand\\nand supply of bonds. An analysis restricted by such assumptions can, however, only\\nbe a first approximation. Where we wish to consider, say, shares and short-loans as\\nwell as bonds and money, discussion of the price-formation of any of the first three\\nis best carried out in terms of the demand and supply of the asset in question.\\n\\nNo analysis of speculative demand can be satisfactory unless the existence of a\\nmoney-market is assumed. Only if short-loans to the Stock Exchange exist can the\\nactivities of bull speculators be adequately included, since if there is no short borrowing\\na speculator\\'s money balance can only be positive and never negative, thus making\\nthe analysis asymmetrical. Granted this, the case is made for analysing the price of any\\nsecurity in terms of its demand and supply.\\n\\nThis paper is concerned with only one type of demand, speculative demand.\\nFirstly, an attempt is made to restate the main determinants of the position and shape\\nof the stock speculative demand curve for shares which, as this is a second approxima-\\ntion only, are assumed to be homogeneous. Secondly, having assumed carry-over\\nfacilities to exist for share transactions, an analysis is given of the determination of\\nthe contango (or backwardation) rate.!\\n\\nII.\\n\\nTo start with we must explain the meaning given in this paper to the term\\nspeculator. As Dr. Wilson? has pointed out, Keynes\\' \" speculators who are trying to\\nbeat the gun are a very different type from Mr. Kaldor\\'s careful arithmeticians with\\ntheir eyes fixed on the relationship between expected short-term rates and the yield\\non high-grade bonds.\" Here we shall define a speculator as a person or institution\\nwhose security transactions are made largely in order to secure short-run capital gains.\\nThis is nearer to the Keynesian type than to Mr. Kaldor\\'s.\\n\\nBy the stock demand curve or schedule of a speculator we mean the curve or\\nschedule relating the number of shares he wishes to hold at the end of the current\\n\\n1! Much of the analysis is based on Mr. Kaldor\\'s \\'\\' Speculation and Economic Stability \" (REvrgWw or\\nEconouirc SrupiEs, October, 1939), though there is the important difference that his equations seem to\\nrelate to the market as a whole, whereas my equations relate to an individual speculator and no unanimity\\nis assumed.

Little objects\\nstrenuously to some remarks made by Mr. A. M. Henderson in a recent issue of this\\nReview. Mr. Henderson put forward the notion that the Cabinet is the proper agency\\nto translate \\'\\' the national interest \"\\' into a series of specific goals. Further, he implied\\nthat as economists we must wait for the Cabinet\\'s interpretation, accept it, and then\\nproceed with the construction of our deductive systems.\\n\\nTo all this Mr. Little protests. After stating that the role of the economist is (hope-\\nfully) broader and less servile than Mr. Henderson implied, Mr. Little goes on to argue\\nthat the value premises used by the welfare economist can originate in a great many\\nplaces: in the Cabinet, Parliament, the local pub, or in the mind of the individual\\nperforming the deductions. For this reason he feels that Mr. Henderson was wrong\\nin restricting the economist to those value premises enunciated by the Cabinet.\\n\\nIt is my contention that Mr. Little was right in objecting to the Henderson\\nposition—but for inappropriate reasons. If I have read the arguments of these two\\nmen correctly, there is no necessary antagonism between their positions. Mr.\\nHenderson probably accepts the idea that \\'\\' value conclusions can only be deduced\\nfrom value premises.\" Further, he undoubtedly realises that these premises can arise\\nfrom any of a wide variety of sources. The problem, however, is not where they could\\narise but where they should arise.\\n\\nTo reach the conclusion that the Cabinet should select the detailed ends toward\\nwhich the whole society ought to move, Mr. Henderson must have had some set of\\npostulates about the political system in the back of his mind. But Mr. Henderson has\\nshrouded in secrecy the postulational system from which he deduced his conclusion\\nabout the Cabinet. Both Mr. Little and I are inclined to disagree with Mr. Henderson\\'s\\nchoice of the Cabinet as the end-selecting agency, but until he is more specific about\\nthe reasons for his choice, it is impossible for me to state with any certainty the nature\\nof my objections. They could either be with his postulates, his deductions, or with\\nboth.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nWhether or not Mr. Henderson had stated explicitly his assumptions concerning\\nthe political system, it seems to me that one may still object to the narrow role assigned\\nthe economist. Let us suppose that initial ends (postulates) have been given to the\\neconomist (by himself or others) and that he has accepted the task of performing\\ndeductions. This is the conventional picture of the economist\\'s role and is, therefore,\\nsuitable for analysis. Notice that in his generally accepted capacity of deducer, the\\neconomist is permitted at most to restate the ends and then only in a manner which\\nwill not influence the choice of the agent who does the selecting. But what if the ends\\nturn out on examination to be inconsistent ? Surely the economist has a right to\\nmention these inconsistencies. Presumably, the economist can also tell the selecting\\n\\n1I.

The approach has some\\nresemblance to certain aspects of bivariate information theory. The present paper takes\\nthis theory as a starting point to provide an alternative method of analysis. The empirical\\npart of the paper is based on the same data as those which are used by Waelbroeck. It\\nturns out that the two methods yield virtually equivalent results, which is not really\\nsurprising, but which sheds an interesting light on the nature of the RAS method.\\n\\nSection II considers international transaction shares from the standpoint of information\\ntheory; section III considers some empirical results, and a third prediction method;\\nsection IV the RAS method; section V, the information inaccuracy of forecasts of import\\nand export distributions for individual regions; and section VI traces the E.E.C. and\\nCommunist policy effects.\\n\\nIL.

      "['Economic Interrelatedness\\n\\nThis paper associates with every input-output matrix an order matrix, and defines for\\nevery submatrix of the order-matrix it defines an interrelatedness function. For certain\\nclasses of submatrices, the interrelatedness function has an economic interpretation. On\\nclosed input-output matrices, where irreducibility is of theoretical importance, irreduci-\\nbility is associated with a condition on the interrelatedness function. On open input-\\noutput matrices, the function is a way of interpreting certain propositions found in econo-\\nmic history. Interrelatedness is also associated with diversification (and hence speciali-\\nzation) in a simple way. It is empirically possible (using Leontief\\'s data for the U.S.\\neconomy in 1919 and 1929) to examine the way in which interrelatedness has changed over\\ntime, and to make predictions about hypotheses such as technological convergence, which\\nhave so far been difficult to subject to empirical analysis.

Firstly, there is a savings replacement effect which\\nleads to a reduction in personal savings and, secondly, an induced retirement effect which\\nleads to an increase in savings which has to be spread over a longer retirement period.\\nIt is argued that as a scheme becomes more established the induced retirement effect\\ndiminishes. This implies that when one comes to consider the effect of changes in pension\\nbenefits and contributions with a well-developed scheme the savings replacement effect\\noperates almost in isolation.\\n\\nIn this paper a private pension scheme is introduced from which the individual can\\nreceive a pension some years before he becomes eligible to receive the state pension.

INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe study of competitive equilibrium has always been concerned with the *' stability\\nof that price structure which clears the commodity market. The earlier economists defined\\nthe concept of stability, and tended to assume it without giving a rigorous analysis of the\\nstability hypothesis. Hicks [8] presented well-known conditions for stability, but in so\\ndoing failed to consider the dynamic process of price adjustment through time. None-\\ntheless, in a classic paper Metzler [12] pointed out that if all commodities are gross\\nsubstitutes, the Hicksian conditions for perfect stability are identical to the conditions for\\nstability in a dynamic sense. This discovery, brilliant as it was, turned out to be only a\\nprelude to a more exciting theme. In later developments, it was established by Negishi\\n\\n15], Hahn [7], Arrow and Hurwicz [2], and Arrow, Block and Hurwicz [1] that a com-\\npetitive equilibrium is indeed dynamically stable for a gross substitute economy.\\n\\nDespite the central place it occupies, the assumption of gross substitutability represents\\na serious drawback to the stability literature. Although we can certainly dispose of com-\\nplementarity of a technical nature often observed among several commodities by a simple\\nprocess of aggregation, it is impossible to assume away weak gross complements without\\nloss of generality. It should be noted, however, that the absence of gross complements\\nis by no means a necessary condition for dynamic stability. Thus, the difficulty associated\\nwith universal gross substitutability should not totally undermine the stability hypothesis.\\nThis point, well recognized in the literature, is of course of little interest unless one is able\\nto identify meaningful classes of competitive systems in which both complementarity and\\nstability are present. This paper attempts to proceed a few steps forward in this direction\\nvia the natural route of extending the Metzlerian gross substitute system.\\n\\nWe shall first propose three distinct, but closely related generalizations of the\\nMetzlerian system. Subsequently, in Section III, these generalized systems will be shown\\nto be locally stable even though they may include elements of gross complementarity.\\nTo indicate the extent to which the Metzler theorem carries through, we shall also demon-\\nstrate that the Hicksian conditions are necessarily satisfied for a particular pair of these\\ngeneralized systems. From this, we can directly proceed to comparative statics. In\\nSection IV we shall present a result of comparative statics closely analogous to the one\\nobtainable for the original Metzlerian system. This result, far stronger than the one\\nimplied by the Hicksian conditions, will be seen to hold for a (different) pair of the proposed\\ngeneralizations. To illustrate the nature of our concepts, a numerical example will then\\nbe considered briefly. Finally, in Section V, we shall discuss some related literature,\\nespecially an alternative line of generalization suggested by Morishima [13], [14].\\n\\n1 First version received November 1970; final version received October 1971 (Eds.).\\n\\n2 'This paper is taken from my Ph.D. thesis submitted to the University of Rochester in February\\n1972.

These models possess a number of features on which they may\\nbe compared and contrasted. The most important of these features are the ways in which\\nthe existing parties or firms compete against each other for votes or profits, and types of\\nexpectations the incumbents have about the responses of potential entrants to changes\\nin their decisions. In most of the cases an electoral or oligopolistic competition is\\nrepresented by some type of a non-cooperative game played by parties or firms.\\n\\nIn this paper we also consider a non-cooperative model of electoral race where the\\nestablished parties (incumbents) compete against each other by offering positions\\n(*ideologies\") to the population of voters. Given the profile of voters! preferences over\\nthe space of *\\'ideologies\" (or, issue space), each of the established parties attempts to\\nmaximize its vote share. In making their choices, the incumbents, however, anticipate\\nthat a new party (an entrant) will join the electoral race. Consistent with the other parties\\'\\nobjectives, the entrant is assumed to maximize its share of voters while taking the\\nincumbents\\' choices as given. The resulting non-cooperative game possesses, therefore,\\na structural hierarchy: the established parties behave as Nash players with respect to each\\nother, whereas acting as Stackelberg leaders with respect to the entrant and correctly\\nanticipating its vote-maximizing response to their choices in the issue space.\\n\\nThe main purpose of this paper is to study the properties of the game we described\\nand, in particular, to characterize its equilibrium, which we will call **hierarchical equili-\\nbrium\".

MOTIVATION\\n\\nFor games in which firms producing identical products compete in prices there are several\\nwell-known results relating mixed-strategy Nash-equilibria to the Walrasian equilibrium\\n(e.g. Allen and Hellwig (1986), Vives (1986)).! The purpose of this paper is to show that\\nsome of these results remain true if one replaces the concept of mixed-strategy Nash-\\nequilibria by the concept of iterated elimination of dominated strategies.\\n\\nThe paper has two motivations. One is that in our opinion the use of a more\\nelementary solution concept makes the above results more transparent.\\n\\nThe other is that, as a model of non-cooperative behaviour, the concept of iterated\\nelimination of dominated strategies assumes less coordination of the players! choices\\nthan the concept of mixed-strategy Nash-equilibrium does. This is important in our\\ncontext because the Walrasian equilibrium is intended to describe decentralized\\neconomies, and hence a model providing non-cooperative foundations for Walras' concept\\nis the more attractive the less coordination is assumed to exist exogeneously.\\n\\nThe difference between the concept of iterated elimination of dominated strategies\\nand the concept of mixed-strategy Nash-equilibrium can be viewed in several ways. One\\nis that the iterated elimination of dominated strategies is a procedure which in principle\\nevery agent can carry out for himself. The analogue is true for mixed-strategy Nash-\\nequilibria only if there is a unique equilibrium. If there are multiple equilibria then some\\nkind of explicit pre-play communication is required to ensure that players coordinate to\\nplay one particular equilibrium.\\n\\nAt a deeper level one can compare the formal informational assumptions required\\nto justify the iterated elimination of dominated strategies with those required to justify\\nmixed-strategy Nash equilibria. A natural framework for such a comparison is a formal\\nmodel of common knowledge of the type suggested by Aumann (1976, 1987).\\n\\n1.

Optimal policy requires a subsidy on interim unskilled jobs.\\n', 'The primary aim of this paper is to consider why unemployed skilled workers are\\napparently reluctant to take temporary unskilled jobs, preferring to \"stick to their trade\",\\nand accepting a possibly long unemployment spell, during which little search may occur.\\nWhilst commonplace in Britain, this phenomenon is also significant in the U.S.—for\\nexample, Clark and Summers (1979). Bulow and Summers (1986) capture this in a dual\\neconomy model by assuming that primary sector jobs are offered to the unemployed, but\\nnot to secondary sector workers.\\n\\nFour reasons have been advanced to explain why a competitive unskilled jobs sector\\nmight fail to absorb unemployed workers not undertaking significant amounts of search\\nwhile waiting for a skilled job. First, the level of unemployment benefit may discourage\\nsuch work. Second, the threat of unionization may cause the unskilled wage to be set\\nabove the market clearing level. Third, in the segmented labour market literature, taking\\nbad jobs has been conjectured to have a long term \"\\'scarring effect\", reducing skills and\\nthereby future earnings. (See Taubman and Wachter (1986).) Fourth, the remote location\\nof secondary sector employment may prevent on-the-job search for primary sector jobs\\n(Harris and Todaro (1970)). In the model described in the next section workers\\' reluctance\\nto take interim jobs arises because secondary sector employment reduces future earnings,\\nbut unlike the segmented labour market models, unskilled work need not reduce future\\nproductivity.\\n\\nThe primary hypothesis advanced here is that under a plausible behavioural assump-\\ntion—namely, that within a skill category, more productive workers find skilled work\\nmore satisfying or less arduous than less productive workers—job search decisions may\\nact as a productivity signal.

INTRODUCTION\\n\\nIn most economic models of communication, information is collected once and transmitted in a\\nsingle piece from a sender to a receiver (Crawford and Sobel, 1982; Aghion and Tirole, 1997;\\nMorris, 2001). In many realistic settings, however, a sender receives multiple pieces of informa-\\ntion over time and is asked to convey his opinion multiple times as more information comes in.?\\nFormal sequential reports are frequently observed in congressional committees, accounting (Dye\\nand Verrecchia, 1995), capital budgeting (Arya et al., 1997), and the financial market (Penno,\\n1985). Informally, consultants, doctors, and other professionals are often asked to convey their\\nearly opinions before giving a final assessment.\\n\\nIn many of these environments, information received later may contain less noise than that\\nreceived earlier and is thus of higher quality. For instance, a December survey of consumer de-\\nmand for hybrid cars next year may be more accurate than a similar one taken in July. Moreover,\\nthe sender's ability to observe the underlying true state of the world may improve as he becomes\\nmore familiar with the task at hand. In either case, the sender typically cares about how all his re-\\nports reflect on his ability. This paper investigates how an agent of privately known ability reacts\\nstrategically to improvement in the quality of his information under a sequential reports system.\\nIt also applies these insights to the optimal choice of reporting protocols. Namely, it identifies\\nconditions under which the principal should require a single report after the agent has received\\nall the information, and conditions under which she should ask for sequential reports instead.\\n\\nl1.

INTRODUCTION\\n\\nInstitutions are important determinants of economic development, as different strands of research\\nhave emphasized. Political institutions, in particular, influence policy determination by placing\\nconstraints on the behaviour of leaders and inducing them to take into account the well-being of\\ntheir citizens. When these institutions are weak, examples abound of rulers who have been able to\\nextract enormous rents from power in a seemingly unconstrained manner.! However, these rulers\\nhave also engaged in extensive redistribution of resources in surprisingly inefficient ways, which\\nsuggests the existence of constraints on the exercise of power. Specifically, they often raised\\nrevenue through costly market manipulations and then spent on inoperative bureaucracies that\\nserved as distribution channels for patronage? Surprisingly, in spite of their conspicuous wealth\\naccumulation and their mismanagement of the economy, many of these leaders have enjoyed\\nactive support from sizeable shares of their impoverished populations.? This raises the following\\nquestions: Why does any part of the population support these leaders? Why do these leaders\\nchoose to engage in wasteful patronage transfers? Why are these leaders seemingly unaccountable\\nto their own supporters?\\n\\nTo answer these questions, this paper develops a simple framework to analyse political ac-\\ncountability when societies are ethnically divided and institutions are weak. The starting point is\\na political agency model in which three assumptions are maintained:\\n\\nl. Since this is particularly the case in post-colonial sub-Saharan Africa, I will concentrate on illustrative examples\\nfrom this continent. Several rulers such as Mobutu, Moi, or Houphouet-Boigny have been estimated to possess personal\\nfortunes equivalent to the total foreign debt accumulated by their countries (see Ayittey (1992) or Mbaku (2000) for an\\naccount of the extent of rent extraction).\\n\\n2.

This support can also include decentralized violence against the opposition such as\\nin Rwanda in 1994 or in contemporary Zimbabwe.

The welfare analysis shows that the current World Trade Organization rules allowing this type of\\nPTAs may be optimal for economically large countries, thus the model can predict the rules we observe.\\nWe also analyse alternative rules that constitute a Pareto improvement.\\n\", '', '', '1. INTRODUCTION\\n\\nPreferential trade agreements (PTAs) are currently among the most important instruments of in-\\nternational economic policy. Since 1995 at least 130 new PTAs were created worldwide, more\\nthan doubling the number created in the previous 50 years. More than a third of world trade is\\nestimated to be carried out under them. Traditionally, PTAs are studied simply as a reciprocal\\nreduction of trade barriers, such as tariffs, among a set of countries. However, such reductions\\nare often not the only or even the main motivation for PTAs. Many PTAs require cooperation\\non issues that are not related to trade policy. The most obvious such agreement is the European\\nUnion (E.U.) and its predecessors, which requires countries that want to accede to change their\\nbehaviour on a broad set of issues such as environmental and labour standards, intellectual prop-\\nerty, human rights, etc. As we describe below, this is far from an isolated case.\\n\\nEconomists generally support free trade, that is, non-preferential trade liberalization, but\\nthere is no such consensus about the preferential liberalization that characterizes PTAs. The key\\nconcern is that PTAs may be \"stumbling blocks\" to multilateral liberalization (Bhagwati, 1991);\\nthat is, PTAs may halt or reverse the process that has allowed members of the General Agreement\\non Tariffs and Trade (GATT)/World Trade Organization (WTO) to reduce their multilateral tariffs\\nby over 9096 in the last 60 years (Staiger, 1995). One important channel through which this can\\noccur is when PTA partners try to prevent reductions in their preference margins. This leads\\nthem to oppose multilateral liberalization because it entails a reduction of tariffs that apply to all\\npartners and thus it erodes preference margins.
