It is a task which I do not approach with the calm cheerfulness\ndisplayed by little Johnny who was busy with pencil and paper when his\nmother asked, \"What are you drawing, son?\" \"I am drawing a picture of\nGod, mother.\" \"But,\" objected mother, \"no one knows what God looks\nlike.\" To this came the reply, \"Well, they will when I get through.\"\n\nI doubt whether any one knows what the government's defense fiscal\npolicy is; nor is any one wise enough to know for sure what it should be.\nWhat is said, therefore, in this article must be regarded as a tentative\nattempt at explanation and evaluation. That such attempts should be made\nin a democracy is of first importance, provided that they are made in the\nproper spirit, even though the outsider does not have the data for discussing\nthese subjects that the people actually in Washington have. It is possible,\nhowever, that the outsider has one small advantage. Most of the Wash-\nington experts are engrossed in jobs which, though important, are never-\ntheless only cogs in a very large machine. There seem to be few persons, if\nany, in Washington charged with the duty of taking an over-all view of the\neconomics of the defense program and planning and integrating wise\npolicies. The outsider, as the phrase goes, is less likely to be unable to see\nthe forest because of preoccupation with some of the trees.\n\nA few things need to be said by way of preamble. First, discussion and\nappraisal of fiscal policy are considerably complicated by the peculiar status\nin which the United States is and has been for several months. The con-\ndition has not been one of legal war but it has certainly not been one\nconsistent with what is commonly described as peace. In the past, fiscal\nactivity has been judged on the basis of peacetime Treasury operations\non the one hand and wartime Treasury operations on the other. For\nsome months past, the United States has been in the position of be-\ning economically at war and legally at peace. This condition has made\nboth the administration and the interpretation of fiscal policies rather\ndifficult.\n\nSecond, there is a dictum that has been ascribed to various military lead-\ners which is, \"Three things are necessary to the conduct of a war. They are\nmoney, money, and more money.\" As every economist knows, this state-\nment is true only in a very special sense. An army does not throw dollars\nat an enemy.

This is true of\natchitects and contractors of all types, of the producers and sellers of build-\ning material, and of real estate agents and credit institutions engaged on\nfinancing residential construction and real estate transactions. Also the\nfederal agencies which can claim the merit of having substantially contrib-\nuted toward improving our mortgage system\u2014the Federal Housing Ad-\nministration and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board with its affiliated\ninstitutions\u2014appear to be favorably impressed by the present state of\nbuilding activity, and so far no sufficient consideration appears to have\nbeen given to the question whether this attitude is fully justified. The fact\nis, however, that serious arguments can be advanced in favor of a govern-\nmental policy designed to prevent a building boom from developing.\n\nA somewhat closer examination of the present conditions of the housing\nmarket shows that the initial period of rapidly increasing production for\narmament purposes was preceded by a substantial recovery of residential\nconstruction. After the last building boom had spent itself in 1930, building\nactivity remained stagnant for several years and was very slow in expand-\ning. Between 1925 and 1930 a considerable oversupply of dwelling units\nin relation to effective demand for housing had been accumulated; and no\nbrisk building activity could be expected to take place until this over-\nsupply had been absorbed, and this process lasted until 1938. Even sub-\nsequently, when shortages of dwelling units were slowly developing in\ncertain areas, expansion of building activity was still checked by a con-\nsiderable overhang of real estate repossessed by lending institutions as a\nresult of the large volume of foreclosures which had been the heritage\nof the collapse of the mortgage market in 1931 and 1932.\n\nWhereas an annual supply of approximately 450,000 dwelling units\ncan be assumed to correspond to the effective demand which results from\nnormal replacements and increases in the number of families, the number\nof dwelling units started in 1938 was still considerably below this figure; it\namounted to 347,000 in all non-farm areas of the United States. Residential\nconstruction assumed a more \"normal\" development in 1939 when 465,000\ndwelling units were added to the existing stock. In 1940 also private con-\nstruction was just sufficient to cover the normal increase in demand.

The importance of this formal solution to a program of recon-\nstruction depends upon the degree of approximation of the underlying assump-\ntions to the realities of economic life. The mathematical or logical analysis of\neconomic relations is essentially a static approach. It achieves its solution by\nmaking extremely simple assumptions the logical implications of which are then\nworked out as a theoretical exposition of the possible and \"ideal\" results of the\nassumptions. Perfect competition is the ideal for the maximization of income. A\nplanning board could achieve this result by utilizing the parametric function\nof prices if the assumptions underlying the theory of perfect competition actually\nexisted. But why would a planning board be necessary under such circumstances ?\n\nWhen conditions of imperfect and monopolistic competition, with all the\ncomplexities they present in real life, are encountered, the possibility of using\nthe parametric function breaks down. Prices can no longer be treated \"as if^\nbecause prices are no longer data to which adjustment can be made. The prices\nare part of the adjustment process. The guides of competitive price theory lose\ntheir force because the conditions have been removed, by technical as well as\ninstitutional factors. As competitive forces recede, it becomes increasingly difficult\nto maximize income, and it is impossible to do so under total monoply. Central-\nized planning, by controlling production completely, is faced with the necessity\nof solving a monopoly and not a competitive problem; yet the technique to be\nemployed is based upon competitive theory.

Even when a\nterm seems to have acquired a clear and definite and generally accepted meaning\nin the craft of the economists, there is no guarantee that innovators will not\nadopt a new meaning for it and be extensively imitated.\n\nIt has been so with the word \"rent\" which, to the classical economists, meant\nrent of land but which, about the turn of the century, began to be applied to the\nyield of produced capital. As the then \"modern\" and \"up-to-date\" economists of\nabout the year 1900 began to blur the distinction between land and produced\ncapital and between the income from the one and from the other, and to follow\nthe man in the street in using the term \"rent\" for both, it was still possible for\nthose of us of a different point of view to make ourselves clear by referring to\n\"economic rent.\" By using the modifying word \"economic,\" we could still make\nclear that we were referring to the yield of land as such, Z.e., of land in the\nstrict economic sense, exclusive of improvements made by an owner or tenant iz\nit as well as o7 it.\n\nBut now it begins to look as if even this privilege is to be denied us and as if\nonce more the very terms by which we have tried to emphasize a distinction we\nhave considered important are to be appropriated and turned to other purposes\nby economists who have no sympathy with us. Indicative of this apparent trend is\nthe recent book by Professor Kenneth E. Boulding of Colgate University, entitled\nEconomic Analysis 'To Professor Boulding, economic rent is not just the yield\nof land ownership\u2014indeed, he seems to feel that much of this yield is not even\nto be included in it\u2014but rather is \"any payment to a unit of a factor of production\nin an industry in equilibrium, which is in excess of the minimum amount necessary\nto keep that factor 7z its presen occtipation.\"?\n\nProfessor Boulding makes it very clear that he regards wages as, in part, eco-\nnomic rent. Many workers would stay in the particular line of work they are in,\neven at appreciably lower wages than they now receive, and the excess over the\namount necessary to keep them in that particular line is economic rent. Boulding\nillustrates by reference to the occupation of weaving, in which, at $20 a week,\nhe supposes 1,000 willing to work, each extra dollar per week increasing by 100\nthe number of men \"willing to work at weaving.\"? \u00c1nd, according to Professor\nBoulding: \"The higher the wage, the greater will be the economic rent received\nby all those workers who would be willing to work at a lower wage, and the\ngreater will be the economic rent received by all workers.\"4\n\n!

The Pareto-Hicks indifference curve goes back to Edge-\nworth's Mathematical Psycbics (1881), though Irving Fisher, in his Ma/Pe-\nmatical Investigations in tbe Tbeory of Value and Prices (1892), claimed inde-\npendent discovery and took a position more nearly that of the Paretians than did\nEdgeworth. What I had ia mind in arranging this section of my book was the\nelaboration of the Paretian indifference curve concept, applied in Marshall's\nproblems of international trade, in Edgeworth's article on \"The Pure Theory of\nInternational Values\" (Econ. Jour., 1894), and that by W. E. Johnson on \"The\nPure Theory of Utility Curves\" (Econ. Jour., 1913) ; but probably it would have\nbeen better to confine the name \"indifference curve\" to the Paretian line of\nequal utility and employ some other designation for Marshall's curve. However,\nthere appear to be certain confusions in Mr. Kemp's statement which it may be\nwell to clear up.\n\nIf the Marshallian graph reproduced in my book be compared with, let us say,\nFigure 1 of Hicks's Value and Capital it is evident that, superficially at all\nevents, different topics are dealt with. Marshall was examining the market be-\ntween two trading groups, Hicks the choice of an individual between two com-\nmodities.

That point is that, under\ncertain conditions, a monopolist faced with increasing labor costs might find it\nmore profitable to increase rather than decrease employment.\n\nThe conditions under which this is likely to obtain are (1) that the demand\nschedule for the monopolist's product is more elastic in the lower-price ranges\nthan in the higher-price ranges, and (2) that before wages are raised the\nmonopolist is operating at less than full plant capacity, so that multiple shift\noperations may be introduced. In such a situation, cutting the work week while\nhourly rates were raised would force the monopolist to re-determine his output.\nGiven a demand of sufficient elasticity along its lower reach, the monopolist\nmight find it to his advantage to operate two (or more) rather than a single\nshift. Thus, employment and output would be increased and unit prices would\nfall.\n\nMr. Mosak argues that my view is in error because, if an increase in produc-\ntion would result in larger profits zfter wages are increased, a similar increase\nwould surely have resulted in even greater profits before wages were raised.\nTherefore, if his goal was the maximization of profits, the monopolist should\nhave increased both production and employment without any regard to wage\nchanges. In Mr. Mosak's words, \"if a bigger output is more profitable after the\nincrease, it must have been all the more so before the wage increase.\" This criti-\ncism is not 2 propos. My argument is that, after wages were raised, a bigger out-\nput might yield a greater profit than a smaller output\u2014or vice versa; but under\neither circumstance, after wages were raised, profits would be smaller tban before\ntbe wages were raised.

It includes an account of the effects upon the industry\nof section 7A of the N.R.A.; of the A.F. of L. and the C.I.O. organization drives;\nand of the spectacular increase in the number and severity of labor disputes. The\ndiscussions relating to such matters as the controversies over \"majority rule,\" the\n\"union shop,\" the \"speed-up,\" and the movement toward decentralization afford\nadditional evidence. Numerous references have been cited to industrial, union\nand governmental sources of information concerning these topics.\n\nMr. Reynolds said, \"The discussion of the distribution of the gains from in-\ncreased productivity . . . exhibits theoretical confusion at several points. The\nstatement that money wages in a particular industry \"normally reflect changes\nin productivity,' and that 'the marked upward trend of wages in the tire industry\nis largely explainable in terms of increasing labor productivity (p. 144) applies\nto a particular industry propositions which are true only of the economy as a\nwhole, and moreover confuses marginal with average productivity.\"\n\nI see no reason why the fact that the above statements are true for the economy\nas a whole should preclude their application to a particular industry. The evidence\nwhich I have been able to assemble suggests that both generalizations are true\nof the tire industry. Although the data are much too lengthy to present here\nthey may be summarized as follows:\n\n1. The trends in the average productivity series and in the wages series are\nsimilar.\n\n2. The plants with the highest productivity tend also to pay the highest wages.?\n\n3. \"The various incentive wage systems in use in the industry establish definite\nrelationships between individual earnings and individual output.?\n\nIt has not been contended that these conditions exist without exception. Several\nother factors such as the extent and character of union organization, cyclical\n\ninfluences, and institutional changes have been discussed in relation to their\neffects upon wages. But it is my belief that the evidence substantiates the state-\nments quoted by Mr. Reynolds.\n\nMr. Reynolds' charge that my work confuses marginal with average productivity\nseems to me to be particularly unfounded. In the section of chapter I on MetPods\nand Procedures (pp. 21-24), special pains were taken to prevent any reader\nfrom falling into this error.

It is necessary, never-\ntheless, to examine briefly the hypothesis that Sombart \"sold out,\" partly\nthat no unjust stigma may be attached to an important figure, but more\nparticularly in order to justify our examination of his work as a social\nscientist. With respect to the latter, it is clear that the work of a man lack-\ning in courage and integrity contains no significant continuity, except the\ncontinuity of opportunism; and that is hardly the premise for interesting\nimplications, unless it be the repudiation of opportunism.\n\nIt is my belief that Sombart did not so much surrender to National\nSocialism as espouse it. This judgment is premised upon the following\nconsiderations: (1) the courage and independence manifested by Sombart\nthrough a large part of his career; (2) his allegiance to certain vital aspects\nof his plan of a National Socialist constitution of society for a number of\nyears prior to Hitler's advent to power; (3) certain fundamental social out-\nlooks and qualities of temperament which characterized the man through-\nout his life.\n\nFor a period of at least two decades Sombart avowed himself a Marxian,\nin the face of obviously great hindrance to his academic advancement.

Unfor-\ntunately, economic research is a peculiarly difficult thing to define. More-\nover, the difficulties are far greater in the case of government, and I believe\nin that of business, than they are for a research institution or even a uni-\nversity.\n\nIt has been frequently suggested that a running inventory should be\nmaintained of research projects under way in government. If well done,\nsuch an inventory might be a very useful \"clearing house.\" But to be useful\nit would have to be done with discrimination. Otherwise, it would be\nbogged down with a host of undertakings of little consequence and little\nrelevance. Such undertakings are vastly more numerous than research proj-\nects which promise to be of material value.\n\nLet me illustrate some of the problems of defining economic rescarch\nin government which such a running inventory would meet. A cabinet\nofficer or other high executive desires information on the best way to\nfinance new industrial facilities to support the defense program. He asks\nfor a confidential memorandum. Or perhaps this government executive\nplans to make a speech on the subject of industrial facility financing and\nasks to have a draft prepared for him. Or again one of his correspondents\nhas inquired about this subject, and he requests a draft reply. In each case\nthe government employee of whom the executive makes his request is\nseeking to give the best answer he can to a question which most of us\ntoday would regard as definitely in the realm of economics. Is the process\nof preparing the memorandum or draft, letter or speech, to be regarded\nas economic research? Is it equally economic research if the government\nemployee is allowed on the one hand two or three hours for the task and\non the other two weeks or possibly two months, or even more? Is it equally\ngovernment economic research if the government employee who receives\nthe request for the memorandum or draft is a librarian? a lawyer? a news-\nman? a secretary? a ghost-writer? an economist? Clearly the answer is,\n\"No.\"\n\nNor do these cases exhaust the difficulties of defining economic research\nin government.

In doing so they found themselves faced by\nthe same troublesome circumstance that appeared in the earlier studies of this\nkind: the three variables, pairwise, are very highly correlated. As a consequence\nof this multicollinearity the scatter points in the three-dimensional space tend\nto arrange themselves along a line instead of a plane.\n\n1. Even in the absence of a three-dimensional scatter diagram one can tell\nfrom the bunch maps shown in the article that there is multicollinearity ; but the\nauthors refuse to recognize it and resort to a faulty demonstration of its absence.\nAfter having cut up the total scatter into partial scatters of observations of X,\nand X, for several, relatively narrow ranges of X,, they argue (p. 75) that\nunder conditions of high-degree multicollinearity the partial X,X, scatters\nwould each tend to cluster about a point.\n\nThe fact that instead of clustering about points these scatters seem to spread\nalong lines (Chart III) does not disprove in the least the presence of high-degree\nmulticollinearity. The linear spread could be reduced at will by reducing the\nwidth of the \"capital groups.\"\n\nOther features of Chart III, however, prove the presence of such multicol-\nlinearity. These features are: (a) the closeness of the group regression lines to\neach other and (b) their increasing order number with increasing size of X, or\nX,. Feature (a) points to the fact that by projecting the three-dimensional\nscatter into the X,X, co\u00fcrdinate plane along the X,-axis, we obtain a long drawn-\nout linear arrangement of points instead of a broad scatter that could be reduced\nby the action of X,.

However, it was not the\npresent writer's task to discuss the relative advantages of different monetary poli-\ncies (public works, financed by the creation of purchasing power, are clearly\nsuperior to either gold or silver purchases), but, in a paper of ten thousand\nwords, to render account of the influence of gold on the price level (this is the\ntitle of my paper!). Moreover, even if silver purchases were superior, \"'Zollar for\ndollar,\" they were less significant 2 1010, because the value of the domestic gold\noutput is much larger than the value of the domestic silver output.\n\n3. \"Is it costless if we exchange productive capital goods for non-productive\ngold... ?\" Throughout my whole paper, I take the view that the private demand\nfor credit has undergone structural changes which would not have permitted,\nduring the thirties, a full utilization of American capital goods industries, unless\nthe demand for goods was supplemented and stimulated by gold and silver pur-\nchases and public spending of other kind. Cutting out the gold purchases would,\ntherefore, have implied, other things being equal, larger unemployment and not\na larger production of capital goods for American use. This point is crucial.\n\n* Am. Econ. Rev., Suppl., Feb., 1941, vol. xxxi, pp. 1-17.\n", "The Brookings Institution\n", "Any sale of a capital asset for cash involves a speculation on the future purchas-\ning power of the cash.\n\nMr. Lester states that \"presumably the silver purchases were as 'costless' as\nthe gold purchases,\" which of course is correct. But I see no basis for his comment\nthat our stock of silver is and will be more useful to us for both monetary and\nindustrial purposes than the gold. I do not see that it serves any useful monetary\npurpose, and of course it serves no industrial purpose so long as it is hoarded by\nthe Treasury.\n\nMr. Lester is right in arguing that as a means of stimulating domestic employ-\nment the purchase of domestic silver, or gold, is more effective than the purchase\nof foreign gold. Digging holes in the ground is not an ideal boondoggle, but\nif no better WPA projects can be found it is undoubtedly preferable from the\nstandpoint of the American economy to have the holes dug in this country than\nabroad. It should be noted, however, that the shipment of British gold to this\ncountry to create balances to pay for airplanes and munitions was the 1939-40\nsubstitute for the war loans of 1915-16. As a way of recording the subsidy for\nBritish defense, gold is more acceptable now than bonds; the future value of\nboth is dubious.\n\nCHARLES O.

The first point\nconcerning the interpretation of Chart III in their article seems to have been\naccepted by the authors; but they object against the second point concerning\nthe evaluation of the marginal productivity coefficients.\n\nIn defending their position, the authors use a weapon which shares with\noutworn artillery the property of being more dangerous to the marksman\nthan to the target. I am referring to the argument that \"the problem might\nbe approached from the point of view of elementary regressions.\" True, cor-\nrelation between determining variables is not harmful in fitting equations that\nare designed to furnish best estimates (safest forecasts) of some dependent\nvariable. In ordinary regression analysis, where such estimates are sought, we\ncan neglect multicollinearity if we are ready to assume that the true degree\nof intercorrelation between the pairs of variables is the same in (a) the set of\nobservations from which the estimating equation has been calculated and (b) the\nobservations that are used in making the estimate (forecast). This has been\nmentioned in my former criticism.\n\nAs far as I am aware, these production functions have not been computed\nfor the purpose of estimating the value of production on the basis of known\ncapital and labor inputs. They are established for quite a different purpose,\nnamely, the estimation of the structural relationship among the three variables.\nThe new as well as the older functions are used in order to estimate marginal\nproductivities of labor and capital and to compare these estimates with in-\ndependently derived shares of labor and capital in the product of industry.\nElasticities of demand for labor and other structural characteristics are derived\nfrom the functions. The authors fail to realize that this purpose does not\njustify the ordinary approach of regression analysis. What is correct proce-\ndure in setting up an es//matimg equation for X, is not necessarily correct\nin evaluating the s/ruetural relationship between X,, X,, and X.. The two pur-\nposes can be served by one and the same method only if all \"disturbances\" are\nconcentrated in X,, while X, and X, enter into the computations with their\n\"true\" values!

Somebody in the audience thereupon wrote me a letter ex-\npressing a feeling, couched in the form of a question, to the effect that\nMarshall's message would pass away much as Mill's message had, or for\nthat matter that of Adam Smith. I will put what I have to say in the form\nof an answer to that question.\n\nIn one sense Marshallian economics has passed away already. His vision\nof the economic process, his methods, his results, are no longer ours. We\nmay love and admire that mighty structure which, battered by the impact\nof criticisms and of new ideas, still spreads its majestic lines in the back-\nground of our own work.

It\nwas in 1894, if my memory serves me, that H. A. Lorentz said he felt\nthat theoretical physics had attained perfection and therefore had ceased to\nbe very interesting.

Instead, we see the disorder\nof a battlefield \u2014unco\u00f3rdinated masses of fact and pieces of technique, no\nprospect at all of fitting this heap ever again into an architectural struc-\nture.

Traditional monetary tools apply only to general\nunemployment and full employment, and not to the intermediate stages. Since to reach\nfull employment the economy must pass through successive stages of decreasing total\nunemployment, with full employment appearing much earlier in some sectors than in\nothers, a policy relevant to this development at any intermediate stage is necessary. The\nrecent experience of Great Britain, Canada, and Germany, in passing through this period\nof segmentary full employment, indicates a need for new controls over the distribution\nand amount of savings. In order to channelize the flow of funds into non-saturated felds,\nthe federal government in this country might well consider: (1) licensing of new\nsecurity issues; (2) differential reserve requirements for commercial banks; (3) increased\ncontrol over the disposable funds of other financial institutions; (4) revival of the un-\ndivided profits tax; and (5) Treasury absorption of private savings. Still other measures\nmight be used when it becomes necessary to enlarge the total supply of savings, such as:\ndirect propaganda, curtailment of certain types of consumption, increased social security\npayroll taxes, and \"deferred savings certificates\" to government bondholders. A numerical\nestimate of maximum diversion can be made on the basis of these proposals.\n\nGovernment expenditure, expanded by war needs, now absorbs more\nthan one-half the national income of most of the belligerent nations.

Japan and Italy use at least 50 per cent,\nalthough no complete data are available? and Canada is apparently divert-\ning about 30 per cent.* The United States, with the addition of the lease-\nlend program, will probably reach 20 per cent of an 80 to 85 billion dollar\nnational income during 1941.5\n\n' This percentage, as well as the others, is a very rough approximation, useful only to\nshow order of magnitude.

New Yor\u00a3 Times, January 24, 1941, p. 5,\nindicates that government plans call for 4.5 billion yen of taxes in addition to all borrow-\ning.

Eight months after the so-called \"China Incident\" which started on\nJuly 7, 1937, the Chinese national government had to suspend this policy\nand to institute other measures of exchange control. Since March, 1938,\nforeign exchange has been obtainable from the governmental banks at the\nofficial rates only on application.

In this article the r\u00f3le of product variation and the interrelations\nof these three variables are emphasized. Diagrammatics analogous to those customarily\nused in price-output problems are developed and these are later employed to demonstrate\nthat the incidence of relevant technological innovations upon the quality of the product\nof the firm are independent of abnormal profits or of monopolistic advantage. Finally, the\njoint determination of output, product and promotion is considered. Normally, the ex-\nploitation of every profit possibility until marginal costs and receipts were equated would\nbe expected. Available funds may, however, be limited and certain policies may earn\nlosses unless more intensively pursued. In this case certain profit possibilities must\nbe passed over in favor of others, the marginal net return on working capital will vary\nwith different employments, and as the amount of such funds available changes the manner\nof their expenditure may differ markedly.\n\nEntrepreneurs must determine, nter alia, the price and output of their\nproduct, its specifications, and the amount and type of selling effort.! The\nlogic and illustrative diagrammatics of the entrepreneurial determination\nof output and price are familiar. Similar methods, developed below, are\napplicable to the problems of determining the optimum degree of dura-\nbility and of other product attributes. The procedure used is shown to be\nrelevant to a consideration of the incidence of improved technology on\nprices and quality. Finally, the joint determination of price, product,? and\npromotion? is attempted. In the following discussion it is assumed that the\nproducts of immediate rivals are heterogeneous and are considered by\nconsumers to be close but not exact substitutes: they are \"differentiated\" one\nfrom another either because the product (or service) is tangibly different,\nor because it has been made to seem so, or because of location. The time\nperiod relevant to the considerations of this paper is not the long run, but\na short period in which there is, however, sufficient time for some rather\nfundamental adjustments by entrepreneurs: the product of each firm is held\ncapable of considerable modification, but the possibility of changing over\nto a radically different type of product with altogether dissimilar uses and\nattributes is excluded. The location of the enterprise is considered given,\nbut distribution facilities or delivery services may be modified. The reason-\ning throughout assumes that entrepreneurs desire profits, have perfect\nknowledge, and act rationally.\n\n1]f the firm has a less than infinitely elastic demand schedule, and one assumes that\noutput and sales will be equated, then a price decision simultaneously determines output\n(or vice versa) and this theoretically comprises but one decision.\n\n? \"Product\" throughout includes the material good plus all associated intangibles excep?\nthose resulting from promotion and the peculiar site of the place of sale.

These gold im-\nports, which amounted to as much as total relief expenditures, or to four-fifths of\nthe deficits of the federal government during those years, have been paid for by\nthe Treasury simply by issuing an equivalent amount of non-circulating paper\nmoney to the Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nIn his paper Dr. Hardy stated that the gold purchases will continue to be cost-\nless to the American public, except consumers of gold, until we approach \"nor-\nmally full employment\" when the large gold output [in this country?] \"will\nnecessitate a correspondingly curtailed output of useful goods\" [in this country ?].\nProfessor Neisser seemed to conclude that, with idle productive resources, the\nonly possible cost of gold purchases consists of the irreplaceable natural resources\nembodied in the additional exports resulting from gold imports, and spoke of the\nmultiplier effect of the additional exports, whereby \"gold imports increase the\nnational income by more than their value\" !\n\nQualifications to their conclusions on the costless character of the purchase of\n$16,000,000,000 of gold from abroad may be indicated by such questions as the\nfollowing: If the U.S. Treasury had continued the 1936-38 gold sterilization pro-\ngram, would the gold purchases have been costless to the American public? Have\nthe higher required and excess reserves, as the result of gold imports, not cost the\nbanks or bank customers something? Would the gold already imported cost us\nmore if we experience a marked price inflation, permitted and encouraged by the\nincreased reserves that have arisen from huge gold imports? Is it costless to this\ncountry if we exchange interest-bearing securities or profitable investments for\nbarren and \"rather useless\" gold imports? Is it costless 1f we exchange productive\ncapital goods for non-productive gold which we could not use to buy the same\namount of goods from foreign countries?\n\nThe speakers failed to indicate clearly that most of the proceeds foreigners\nobtained for imported gold during the period from 19534 through 1940 were\nused to acquire capital items (securities, property, bank deposits, etc.) rather\nthan to purchase American goods, so that the stimulating secondary effects on\nAmerican employment through exports, which were mentioned by Professors\nMachlup and Brown and stressed by Professor Neisser, were distinctly limited\nto a fraction of the $16,000,000,000 paid for gold imports. None of the speak-\ners pointed out that in this respect our silver purchases were, dollar for dollar,\nmore potent and beneficial to domestic employment than were our gold pur-\nchases, for less than one-seventeenth of the gold purchased during those years\nwas currently produced in the United States, whereas about one-fourth of the\n\n!

There is a tradition\u2014-an honorable tradition \u2014of\nscientific aloofness, of exclusive concern with the affairs of the mind and\nthe spirit at such times, but it is a tradition difficult to keep alive in an era\nof total war. As individual human beings, of course, scholars feel the\nweight of conflict. Many are affected as disciples of arts that have important\nuses in the prosecution of war. Most immediate is the impact of revolu-\ntionary war on social scientists, for the very subject matter of their disci-\nplines may be altered under the stress of profound civil disturbance. Not\nleast is economics involved in such changes. The full violence of the present\ndisorders has perhaps not yet been experienced by our science, but it needs\nno prophet to suggest that the effects will be far-reaching and enduring.\n\nSome of these effects we have already felt. Abroad, in regions where\nfreedom of economic thought has long prevailed, we have seen economics\nreduced to a subservient art. Our colleagues have been silenced. The great\neconomic journals of continental Europe are dead. Throughout the world\nopportunity for objective study has been seriously impaired, at a time when\nit is sorely needed. But these are not the only reasons for disquiet. If we\nface the realities of economic life, and set against these realities our theories,\nour analytical tools, our ability to devise and direct instruments of control,\nwe must confess to inadequacy. Our needs outrun our means of under-\nstanding. In his presidential address five years ago Maurice Clark said that\nthe mood of our generation of economists is one of doubtful potency in\nthe face of a great crisis. That mood has not been relieved, certainly, by\nany lessening of the crisis since he spoke.\n\nThis feeling stands in sharp contrast to that of our nineteenth-century\npredecessors. Except for a few troubled spirits, these economists felt at\nhome in a mastered world. The institutional framework had been set. The\nessential nature of economic processes, tending eternally toward equilibrium\nin this enduring framework, had been established.

With the present rapid\nsurge toward full employment and the special pressures for arms production, conflicts of\ninterest appear likely, especially over wage increases. Adoption of a stable policy \"rule\"\n(such as price stabilization) as the basis for monetary and fiscal policy might provide the\nbasis for a workable \"truce\" between labor, monetary authorities, and those in charge of\nrearmament.\n\nOther primary advantages of monetary stabilization around a stated \"rule\" are (1)\nthe basis it provides for \"equity,\" (2) its stabilizing effect on business conditions, and (3)\nits elimination of the necessity for further centralization of power in the hands of dis-\ncretionary monetary \"authorities,\" The arguments that adoption of such a stable policy\nwould involve loss of desirable flexibility have been much overstated.\n\nThe choice between alternative \"stable money\" policies is largely a matter of expe-\ndiency.

This is due to higher leakages in the first-round turnover of armament expendi-\ntures and to the rapid amortization of privately financed capital equipment in the arma-\nments field. If the period considered is long enough for complete amortization to take place,\nthe expansionary effect of induced investment will be neutralized by depreciation charges.\nThe argument may be generalized for use in the evaluation of the income-increasing\npotential of any spending program.\n\nThe purpose of this note is to point out that the dollar-for-dollar value\nof an armaments program in increasing the national income may well be\nless than that of a work-relief program.\n\nIn appraising the income-increasing value of any expenditure we have\nto consider not only the ze/ addition to the income stream which that\nexpenditure represents, but also the direction of the expenditure. It is the\nsecond of these considerations which is being dealt with in this note. As far\nas government programs are concerned the first point has been pretty well\ncovered in recent discussions of tax policy, and I have nothing to add here.\nWhat is being compared is the dollar-for-dollar value of two types of\nprograms\u2014armaments and work relief\u2014with the comparison put on a\nnet basis. Any difference due to choice of fiscal methods is ignored.\n\nThe effect of a spending program on total income is governed by\n(1) the spending reactions of recipients at all stages, or \"rounds of\nincome,\" and (2) the amount of induced investment, also at all stages.\nIn order to compare two programs, however, it is necessary to follow the\nspending only through the hands of one set of ultimate consumers, on\nthe assumption that, for all practical purposes, spending reactions and\ninduced investment after the initial expenditure has completed an \"income\nround\" will be the same regardless of the purpose or source of the original\nexpenditure.!\n\nIt is fairly certain that a work-relief program has a greater potential\nas an income-increasing force if investment induced by the primary expendi-\nture is not considered, attention being focussed on first-round spending\nreactions alone. The direction of work-relief spending is such that leakages\nare at a minimum. There is, of course, the familiar proposition that workers\nin the industries supplying goods for rearmament enjoy a higher income\nthan relief workers and hence are likely as a group to have a lower marginal\n\n\"This assumption is, of course, contrary to fact. Ultimate recipients of the primary\narmaments expenditures are a quite different group than WPA workers; the re\u00e9xpenditures\nmade by the two groups may differ somewhat in direction as well as in volume. If the\ndifference is significant there might be an advantage, one way or the other, in investment\ninduced by secomd-round (and subsequent) spending. Also, no account is taken of the\nimpact of different programs on \"confidence.\" In my judgment, these factors, while im-\nportant in some respects, are of insignificant magnitude in the special case being con-\n\nsidered, and their inclusion in the analysis here would make it unnecessarily cumbersome\nwithout altering the substance of the conclusions.\n", "This content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Wed, 26 Jan 2022 19:41:44 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["John Lindeman"], "stable_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1804228"}, "1804229": {"affiliations": {"found": "STRIKES IN A DEMOCRACY\n\nThe popular notion that strikes are unreasonably costly is not well founded. Real and\nfancied strike evils have led to many \"solutions.\" These solutions generally fail to distinguish\nbetween strikes over rights and strikes over interests. The former may be adjudicated, the\nlatter may not. The ordinary strike to increase wages, shorten hours or improve working\nconditions is a democratic alternative to authoritarian determinations. Some limitations on\nstrikes now exist, and others could be introduced without violating the principles of\ndemocracy. It would be reasonable to compel adjudication of disputes involving rights, to\nprohibit altogether strikes in public utilities, to compel settlement in any strike when the\npublic is suffering seriously, and to require limited production of certain commodities\nand services during some strikes. These restrictions would raise the struggle for status\nto a higher level and would protect the public interest.\n\nThe common belief that unreasonably great losses of time and money\nresult from industrial disputes is not well founded. Most of the production\nlost during a strike is usually made up either before or after the strike, by\nthe persons directly involved or by others. Indeed, it is not possible to\nestimate accurately the simplest and most objective elements of strike costs\n\u2014namely, the man-days or wages lost; \"and any figure on the total cost of\nstrikes would be even more fictitious.\" Nor can the direct and indirect\ngains to be used as offsets be measured, such as reductions in waste and\ninefficiency and increased use of machinery, where these occur.\n\nEven if exaggerated estimates of strike losses should be accepted as\nreasonably accurate, it would still be true that those losses are relatively\nsmall. The annual cost of industrial accidents in the United States has\nbeen estimated at between three and five billion dollars, and the cost of\nSickness at from eight to ten billion dollars. The cost of unemployment not\nthe result of strikes, accidents and sickness is tremendous, especially that\nof recent years, and more especially if the unemployment of land, capital\nand management is included, as it should be. These estimates, it should\nbe noted, are also commonly exaggerated, but when all allowances are\nduly made, the losses are still appreciably greater than those occasioned by\nindustrial disputes.\n\nThe real and fancied evils resulting from strikes have led to many pto-\nposed \"solutions.\" One extreme proposal, rarely advanced openly, is that\nthey should be completely outlawed and that the free play of competitive\nforces should be depended upon to establish desirable conditions of em-\nployment. As a \"solution\" of the problems involved, this proposal has no\nmerit whatsoever. For prohibiting the strike would not establish sufficient\nfreedom of competition to bring about desirable conditions, and such an\nabsolute prohibition could not possibly be enforced in a democracy. An-\nother extreme proposal is that strikes should be permitted without restric-\ntions or regulations of any kind.

The relief act of 193\nrequired that regional differences in monthly earnings should be based on differences i\ncost of living. \"Cost of living\" may refer to the income needed to maintain (1) a uniforn\nlevel of living, or (2) the actual levels of living that prevail in different regions. The nex\nWPA. wage schedule, revised in accordance with a qualified cost-of-living concept, raised th\nnational average approximately $2.50 a month. Substantial increases were made in unskille\nearnings in the South with only small changes elsewhere. The 1939 act also established a uni\nform work month of 130 hours, thus abandoning the prevailing-hourly-wage policy. Thi\nprovision has increased efficiency in various respects. Changes in work-relief wage polic\nhave been associated with shifts in the distribution of emphasis between the work an\nrelief aspects of such programs. In recent years, a growth in legislative determination o\nwage and hour policy has accompanied increasing emphasis upon the efficient accomplish\nment of useful work.\n\nAn analysis of work-relief wage policy covering the period 1930-37 wa:\npublished by the present authors in a previous issue of the Review. Since\n1937 the wage policy of the Work Projects Administration has been\nchanged materially, particularly by the Emergency Relief act of 1939.\n\nIn general, work-relief wage policy has reflected the peculiar position\nand the innumerable difficulties of a work-relief program. Work relief is\n\u00e0 hybrid, combining many of the aspects of normal employment with those\nof relief. Because it is a compromise between work and relief, a number\nof special features are found in a work-relief program: (1) need is the\nprimary basis for employment while occupational fitness is secondary; (2)\nprovision of employment is the chief objective and the completed work\nis subordinate so that the major canon of efficiency is maximum direct\nemployment and not minimum cost of completed work\u2014in other words,\nneed for the completed public work is subordinated to the need for em-\nployment of otherwise-idle labor; (3) work completed is presumed to be\nthat which otherwise would not have been undertaken currently; (4) wage\npayments are primarily for subsistence, the gui4 pro quo aspect being\nsubordinate.\n\nWork relief, of course, can emphasize either work or relief. The de-\nvelopment of work relief during the 1930's was consistently in the direction\nof approximating regular work as much as possible. Although the WPA\nembodies more of the features of regular public work than any of the\npreceding work-relief programs, it is still a compromise. During the course\nof its operations, WPA has developed a body of principles and practices\nwhich are unique in the field of project operation and employment. Because\nof its relief aspect, work relief is distinguished from \"normal\" public work\nby such peculiar features as the low ratio of non-labor costs and the provi-\nsion of the maximum possible amount of direct employment, as well as by\nspecial problems of project operation arising from the necessity of selecting,\ncombining, and shifting types of projects to meet rapid changes in relief\n\n!

Further, the new analysis can sometimes be put to guarded use in localizing and\nbracketing errors in balance-of-payments estimates.\n\nItem-by-item differences between two 4-item balances of payments, both in equilibrium,\nlikewise make a 4-element equation. Therefore, fluctuations of estimates for one year com-\npared with the estimates of each other year of a series can condemn a specific estimate. The\nestimated item may be jointly erroneous with each of the three others, in turn, and always\ntoo large or always too small. A \"joint error\" with gold is especially condemning ; because\nold statistics are often trustworthy.\n\nThe accountancy plane of equilibrium in international dealings has been\ndismissed, sometimes, as too simple to warrant much analysis. That plane\nhas heretofore been supposed to involve merely the simple arithmetic of\ndouble-entry bookkeeping: the adding and subtracting of equals. Because\nthe debit and credit of each international transaction are equal the totals of\nall international transactions must likewise be equal.\n\nOf the two entries for each transaction with foreigners, one inevitably\naffects the international movement of short-term capital; barter is rare\nenough in practice to be ignored. Each credit in our balance of payments\nis an increase of American deposits abroad (a balance-of-payments debit) ;\nor, it is a reduction of foreign deposits in the United States (also a balance-\nof-payments debit) . The reverse is true of each debit in our balance of pay-\nments. Even when dollar paper currency is spent abroad or is mailed there\u2014\nby tourists, immigrants and others\u2014the currency pours through the \"re-\nservoirs\" of short-term capital, usually with little lag, freezing or thawing.\nFurther, gold shipments, often falsely declared to be the balancing item in\na balance of payments, are not exceptions; these, too, have double-entries\naffecting the international movement of short-term capital.\n\nThus offhandedly, the accountancy plane of international equilibrium\ncould be well enough pictured, heretofore. What challenged the wits and\nknowledge of many of the keenest thinkers among economists were other\nplanes of equilibrium. The accountancy plane was supposed to stop, dead,\nwith equal debits and credits.\n\nThis paper will describe some neglected mathematical relationships be-\ntween groups of debits and credits, inside the balancing grand totals of\ninternational accounts. What was speciously so simple will be shown to be\ncomplex. Equilibrium on the accountancy plane will emerge with new\nproperties which, incidentally, hold not only in international dealings but\nalso in domestic trade and virtually throughout all human economy.\n", "This content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Wed, 26 Jan 2022 19:42:51 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Ray Ovid Hall"], "stable_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1804232"}, "1804233": {"affiliations": {"raw": {"1": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "RUPEE CIRCULATION IN INDIA\n\nSince the outbreak of the European war, the flow of rupee coins back from circulation\nto reserves, which has been going on for many years, has been reversed. The stock of rupee\ncoin in the Reserve Bank of India decreased from 750,000,000 rupees in September, 1939,\nto 300,000,000 rupees in July, 1940; while circulation increased from about 1,500,000,000\nto 1,950,000,000 rupees. This increase of coin circulation has been due partly to the\nproportional increase of note circulation, for which the coins serve as small change, and\npartly, in all probability, to some tendency to hoard coins in preference to notes, although\nat the present or any probable future price of silver they are not worth melting. To avoid\nexhaustion of the Reserve Bank's supply of coin, the government of India, in July, 1940,\nbegan the issuance of 1-rupee notes, which would be counted as \"rupee coin\" in the\nReserve Bank's accounts. Finally, in December, 1940, it announced a reduction in the fineness\nof the rupee from 11/12 to 0.500. It remains to be seen whether this section will be accept-\nable to the population.\n\nAt the outbreak of the European war in September, 1939, the circulation\nof rupee coins in India had reached its lowest level since the World War.\nIn that era the use of paper notes had perforce been greatly increased; in\nthe succeeding two decades they had become pretty generally acceptable.\nRupee coins had been steadily flowing back from circulation into the gov-\nernment's paper currency reserve prior to 1935 and thereafter into the issue\ndepartment of the Reserve Bank of India which took over the management\nof the paper currency on April 1 of that year.\n\nIn September, 1939, the quantity of rupee coin and of bullion derived\nfrom coins withdrawn from circulation was approximately as follows:\n\nMillions Equivalent\n\nof rupees millions of\n\nfine ounces\nIn circulation (including hoards) 1,500 500\nIn issue department of Reserve Bank 750 250\nTotal in monetary system (all in coin) 2,250 750\n\nHeld by government, withdrawn from monetary\n\nsystem (coin and bullion) 480 160\n\nAt the same time, the circulation of paper notes, issued in dominations\nof 5 rupees and upward, amounted to about 1,800,000,000 rupees, or con-\nsiderably more than the coin circulation, especially when allowance is made\nfor hoarded coins not in active use.\n\nAt the outbreak of the war in September, 1939, the price of silver in\nBombay jumped about 15 per cent, and has since remained, with minor\nfluctuations, at a level equivalent to about 50 cents per ounce as compared\nwith the American price of 35 cents. This disparity is caused by the exist-\nence of an import duty on the white metal in India and by restrictions on\nthe supply of exchange for purchasing it, so that the Bombay market is\n\"insulated\" from the American one. During the autumn of 1939 there\ndeveloped a large demand in Bombay for silver bullion.

The merit of the plan is that it\ntends to prevent investment in excess of voluntary savings. Other claims for the scheme\nare extravagant. Some of the advantages claimed can be obtained with less radical reform ;\nothers involve accompanying and offsetting disadvantages. Reduction of national debt, for\nexample, could be obtained through the 100 per cent plan only at the expense of bank\nearnings. Economic fluctuations would not be entirely eliminated. Indeed, minor changes\nin demand for idle cash balances can be better met under the present system. Since some\ndemand deposits are savings in the relevant sense, and some time deposits are not, the\nplan does not guarantee equality of savings and investment. It does tend to minimize\ndivergencies between them. If over-investment is not a problem of the real world, the\nplan is of no practical significance. Equality of saving and investment is not a sufficient\ncondition for a high level of income and employment. While too much has been claimed\nfor the plan, a step in its direction deserves serious consideration in view of the large excess\nreserves and the stimulus of armaments expenditures.\n\nControversy over the 100 per cent reserve plan has been revived by the\nappearance of two articles on the subject in a recent issue of this Review.*\nThe revival is opportune. The possibility that a strong recovery will de-\nvelop is no longer remote, member banks are in possession of nearly seven\nbillion dollars in excess reserves, and accordingly discussion of measures\nfor control of monetary expansion is no longer purely academic.\n\nAdvantage of the Plan\n\nContrary to Thomas,? it is my opinion that the chief argument in favor\nof the 100 per cent plan rests upon the monetary theory of the trade cycle?\nand that the peculiar feature of the scheme is that it appears to provide an\nautomatic check to investment in excess of voluntary savings.* The degree\nof effectiveness of the plan in preventing over-investment depends upon\nthe extent to which time deposits can be identified with savings, and\ndemand deposits with money. It is true that under a rigorous 100 per cent\nreserve plan, so long as the supply of currency is fixed, no increase in the\ntotal volume of demand deposits could arise except through a withdrawal\nof currency from private circulation. There is some justification, then, for\nregarding an increase in volume of demand deposits as the result of a\n\n?

Perhaps\nthe best known presentations of this theory are by Hayek (Prices and Production, London,\n1935, and Profits, Interest, and Investment, London, 1939) and Robbins (Te Great De-\npression, London, 1934) ; but it is worth noting that even some of the \"Keynesians\" have\nreverted to explanations of disturbances in terms of discrepancies between savings and\ninvestment.

Professor Schumpeter,! of course, has virtually dis-\nregarded both possibilities by means of the inadequate declaration that war is\nan external factor of declining significance to the cyclical processes of the cap-\nitalistic economy. For Dr. Kuznets, the emphasis on the external factor of war\nin the explanation of 50-year swings in economic activity is unsatisfactory in\nthat it fails to demonstrate its \"cyclical character in their tendency to recur as a\nresult of an underlying mechanism.\" With Professor Bernstein, the suggestion\nis brushed off as a sidelight to his own important explanation of post-war busi-\nness cycles in terms of monetary adjustments and maladjustments.\n\nIt is significant, however, that Kondratieff's three long waves are centered\nupon major wars, while at the same time, those innovations which \"carry\" Schum-\npeter's three Kondratieff waves reached their large-scale commercial application\n", "Iowa State College\n", "105\n", "1941] Wars, Innovations and Long Cycles: Comment 105\n$ \u20ac)\n\ncave downward (Waugh) are opposite to each other, and no standardization is\nreached.\n\n(6) The expression convex or concave to the origin cannot be applied for\ncurves which go through the origin, as the total revenue curve, the total cost\ncurve, and many others (Curve B).\n\n(7). It also cannot be applied to curves which are known only in part and\nof which it is unknown whether they cut the j-axis above or below the origin,\nas some cost curves (Curve E).\n\n(8) Convex curves may become concave if shifted up or down or to the left\nor to the right without actually changing their shape, if the terminology convex\nor concave to the origin is used. The Curve C is convex to the origin, the Curve\nA is concave to the origin, and the Curve B is neither the one nor the other.\n\n(9) The only type of curve for which the terminology convex or concave to\nthe origin would have some advantages are curves which are double valued\n(Ze, which have two j-values for each x-value) and which have no tangent\nfrom the origin (Curve F). Such curves, however, do not occur frequently in\neconomics. (An example is the demand curve for an inferior good, or see the\ncurves in Gottfried Haberler, Tbe Tbeory of International Trade, 1937, pp.\n155f.)

He\npoints out that an actual deterioration of individual economic welfare may be\nnaively classified as \"progress\" because of the illusion which results from the\nconversion of free goods into marketable products. Moreover, economists who\nare aware of the limitations of market measurement may use language insuffi-\nciently guarded to warn laymen and legislators from drawing false conclusions.\nIf this is true with reference to much of the literature dealing with individual\neconomic welfare, and it is, it seems equally appropriate to emphasize some\nrelated flaws in the exposition of the conception and measurement of \"the na-\ntional income.\"\n\nForemost among the difficulties confronting those who attempt measurement\nof \"the national income\" is the really insurmountable obstacle of the inappro-\npriateness of the market yardstick. All that the market yardstick can do is to\nyield a figure which shows the aggregate of all the incomes of the individual\nincome recipients of the nation. Such an aggregate no doubt has some usefulness,\nbut it is a mistake to label this aggregate a measure of \"the national income.\"\nEvery item of individual income entering into it is a relative and gets a par-\nticular numerical value from the fact that it assumes a certain position in rela-\ntion to all the other individual items. The substantive figures of private account-\ning, all of which are relatives, are useful as control devices in determining\ncomparative positions of individual business concerns, including households, one\nwith another. But the sum of the operating results of all these individual units,\nthat is the sum of a series of telatives, is certainly not a mere enlargement of\nindividual items. Among other things, this means that above all we are not\nentitled to take this sum of individual incomes and assume that it indicates any-\nthing with reference to the income possibilities of the economy if the stream\nof income were to be distributed on a different basis. (Shades of Huey Long!)\nHow much would sixty million tons of steel be worth if distributed equally\namong the gainfully occupied population ? On beyond this lies the consideration\nthat the physical items themselves would change if the claims upon the national\noutput were reshuffled. Thus not only may the market measure fail to include\nmany items which contribute to welfare, but it can give us only a very limited\n\n*S. von Ciriacy-Wantrup, Agrarkrisen und.
