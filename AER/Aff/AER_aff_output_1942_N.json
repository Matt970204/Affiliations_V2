On the one hand,\nit has sprung from an interest in adequate food for the poorer mem-\nbers of society, in making democracy mean at least enough to eat. On\nthe other, it is an outgrowth of the recent discoveries of the \"newer\nknowledge of nutrition.\"\n\n'The use of the term *movement\" in this connection is carefully con-\nsidered.

What the confines of\nthis movement will be in the next several decades depends very much\nupon the course of world history. In due time, whatever happens, such\ngains as are achieved will spread out over society and the movement as\nsuch will fade out.\n\nThe time and place of initiation of that part of the movement that\nsprang from the newer knowledge of nutrition are the League of Na-\ntions, in the early 1930's. The Health Organization of the League had\nbeen working for some time on nutrition as a factor in health, and the\nInternational Labor Office had approached it from the standpoint of the\nwelfare of labor.

Bruce of Australia came forward at the\n1935 League of Nations Assembly with his proposal for the *marriage of\nhealth and agriculture,\" and the setting up of a *mixed committee,\"\ndrawn from agriculture as well as from labor and authorities on health,\nto consider the possibilities of a program that would relieve agriculture\nby disposing of its excess output at the same time that it would get\nmore food into the mouths of the world's underfed millions.\n\nThe Mixed Committee on Nutrition that followed comprised repre-\nsentatives of the two groups in the League that had been working on\nnutrition and of the International Institute of Agriculture (Rome),\nand a group of students of nutrition and food supply drawn from dif-\nferent countries. Its report, published in 1937, undertook first to state\nmore or less quantitatively the nature and extent of malnutrition in\ndifferent parts of the world.

Positive action to bring about an orderly utilization\nof world supplies will continue to be necessary. Said Mr. Batt:\n\nThere will be greater confusion of demand when the war is over.\n\nAt the present time, we are confronted with only a limited number of purchasers of raw\nmaterials and there is limited shipping capacity to carry what is available. When the war\nends, there will be a scramble by all nations for available supplies in order to restore their\neconomies to a peacetime basis as speedily as possible.\n\nExperience after the first World War has shown that such a scramble can result in\ncomplete demoralization of supply, price, and other factors in a peace-time economy.

The most important relates to the representation on the\ncontrol authority. At present, only the United States and the United King-\ndom are directly represented on the Combined Boards (except that Canada\nhas been given a place on the Combined Production and Resources Board).\nAllotment by the Combined Boards, unless their membership should be ex-\npanded, would not meet Taussig's desire for a broadly international arrange-\nment. His plan contemplated representation of consuming as well as supply-\ning countries on the central board of control and allotment which he pro-\nposed.

This time, previous experience is being cited. The view appears\nto have gained wide acceptance that it was a mistake to abolish the wartime\ncontrols so suddenly after the last war. The result was a scramble for short\nsupplies, which brought sharp increases in prices and led to wasteful at-\ntempts by producers, handlers, and users to hold large inventories in anticipa-\ntion of further price rises. This, of course, further intensified the general short-\nage. The people in war-stricken areas, who had the direst needs but the least\nability to compete in a sellers! market, found it difficult to get the materials\nrequired to re-start their production, Everywhere complaints were heard of the\nshortage of raw materials. It was one of the principal topics of early post-war\nconferences on international economic questions. The first meeting of the\nInternational Labour Organization (November, 1919) and the first meeting\nof the International Chamber of Commerce (June, 1920) debated raw mate-\nrial allotment. The Council of the League of Nations at its tenth session\n(October, 1920) set on foot an inquiry into the difficulties experienced by\nmany countries in securing the imported materials which they needed,\n\nSuddenly, however, the boom ended, and the raw material situation re-\nversed itself, Before the expert engaged by the League had finished his report,\nprices had slumped disastrously. As the report put it:\n\nAccumulated stocks are vainly waiting for orders from purchasers. . . . Under the pres-\nsure of holders of stocks, the richer States have gradually come to abandon, or at least to\nlimit, the policy of restrictions and of export duties. . . . The decrease in prices is causing\nholders of stocks to place them upon the market at a very low price . . . while consumers\nare waiting for still more favorable purchasing conditions. . . .

To avoid\nthis result it appears essential, first, that the large block of enemy tonnage now idle in\nenemy or neutral ports should be brought into use; and secondly, that it should be used\nunder Allied direction and in accordance with a general Allied plan. . . .\n\nThese recommendations had been unanimously adopted. The statement went\non to say that the same considerations would appear to apply to raw materials\nand other commodities generally, and that persons representing the com-\nmodity interests involved appeared to be in full accord.\n\nIn answer to the telegram from Mr. Cotton, Mr. Hoover sent a message on\nNovember 8, 1918, which read in part as follows:\nThis Government will not agree to any programme that even looks like inter-Allied con-\ntrol of our economic resources after peace. After peace over one-half of the whole export\nof food supplies of the world will come from the United States and for the buyers of\nthese supplies to sit in majority in dictation to us as to prices and distribution is wholly\ninconceivable. The same applies to raw materials; Our only hope of securing justice in\ndistribution, proper appreciation abroad of the effort we make to assist foreign nations,\nand proper return for the service that we will perform will revolve around complete\nindependence of commitment to joint action on our part.\"\n\nMr. Hoover in the same telegram suggested a relief commission patterned\nafter the Belgian relief organization. Such a European relief commission\nwould \"above all\" prevent *the extension of the functions and life of Inter-\nAllied Food and Maritime Councils either now or after peace.\" Secretary of\nState Lansing, in transmitting Hoover's message, added that the Department\nof State entirely approved the policy thus set forth.

During this same period, the\nadversely influenced enterprises will be taking some action to maximize profits\nor minimize losses. If they strive to reduce other costs they are contributing\nin some manner to increased efficiency since the enterprise can save very little\nby not using the productive forces which they are paying, and as the enter-\nprise must continue the purchase of some raw materials for labor to use.\n\nLikewise any action the enterprise takes toward increased income will be\nbeneficial as it will depend on the best use, not disuse, of the existing produc-\ntive facilities. In many cases an enterprise striving to get the most revenue\nout of an overexpanded production, without piling up a tremendous amount\nof inventory, will lower prices.

As one personnel manager put it, there is now a double pressure\nfor uniformity in wages: from competitors and from labor itself. Industrial\nunions in particular are interested in maintaining a stable and uniform wage\nstructure; for price cutting based upon wage cutting by members of the\nindustry endangers the union position. Union efforts to secure and maintain\nuniformity of wage levels in an industry tend to give rise either to simultaneous\nadjustments of wage levels by all firms within an industry, acting as a group,\nor to successive increases which give the appearance of a leader-follower\npattern.\n\nEmployers agreed that union contracts requiring payment of wages on a\npar with rates prevailing for work of a similar nature in other firms in the\nindusty hasten the spread of wage increases through an industry, but some\nalso suggested that such pressure may produce a feeling among company\nexecutives that upward adjustments should not be made unless other firms\nin the industry are making them, or the union demands them, and therefore\nmake for fewer, though larger, wage adjustments.\n"], "4": ["COMMUNICATIONS\n", "1943] COMMUNICATIONS 895\n\nwage increases which vary in accordance with *\u00abmerit\"\u2014or other such im-\nmeasurable intangibles\u2014breed petty jealousies with consequent disruption\nof union morale.\n\nOf course, acceptance by industry of this form of wage adjustment does\nnot imply that supplemental increases of the *old fashioned\" type cannot be\nmade from time to time, Indeed, they are made, but the tendency seems to be\nto make fewer of the individual adjustments and to rely more and more upon\nthe general change. Some employers reported that they are giving up\nattempting to reward efficiency, because if they raise the pay of a good man,\nthe union then demands that this increase also be extended to others in the\nshop who may be less efficient, but who are performing the same work.\n\nTwo other factors have contributed to the spread of the general increase.\nFirst, the rise in the cost of living during the period under study naturally\ngave an impetus to this type of adjustment as the only fair means of dealing\nwith a condition affecting all employees alike. Secondly the gradual adoption\nby industry at large of the technique of scientific management with its job\nevaluation plans, time studies, and other intricacies has tended to introduce\na certain rigidity into the wage structure. The general uniform wage increase\nthen becomes the only means of adjusting wage levels without disturbing\nthe wage relationship of one job to another.\n\n2. Closely related to this first trend\u2014in that it, too, is a consequence of\nunion organization\u2014is the predominance of the \"cents per hour\" wage in-\ncrease. Wage increases in mass production industries, beginning with the April,\n1941, increase in the steel industry, have tended to be in terms of cents per\nhour, rather than in percentages. On the whole, investigation suggests that\nmanagement prefers the percentage increase while unions prefer adjustments\nin cents per hour. A number of employers reported that they disliked the\nlatter form of wage change because it raised the lower paid employee more\nthan in proportion to higher paid personnel and therefore further diminished\nthe differential between the skilled and unskilled.\n\nIn the steel industry, union leaders justified this narrowing process on\nthe grounds that the industry had developed an unwarranted spread between\nthe lowest and highest rate. But the steel executives maintained that this range\nwas consistent with the skills involved; that with a machinist's rate double a\nlaborer's rate there was an incentive for the latter to work himself up, but\nthat with the union narrowing this differential, the incentive to advance will\nbe seriously impaired. Other employers, however, considered the cents per\nhour increase more equitable in times of rising costs of living, since it gives\na larger percentage increase in income to those very groups of wage earners\nwho feel most severely the rise in living costs. Industrial unions are staunch\nchampions of this position; since they draw their membership primarily from\nthe ranks of the unskilled and semi-skilled it is natural that they should\nchampion that form of wage increase which does most to improve the eco-\nnomic position of their principal constituency.\n\n3. A third significant wage trend\u2014likewise a by-product, in part, of indus-\ntry's reaction to unionism\u2014is the spread of leader-follower relationships in\nindustrial wage policies. In industries employing the most wage earners\u2014\n", "895\n"], "3": ["try even if this means higher than average earnings in the company having\nthe bonus plan, because it believes that management would not pay the\nbonus unless it paid for itself. Hence, employees in these companies reason\nthat they must be working harder or more efficiently than \"the other fellow\"\nand therefore deserve higher earnings.\n\nAs a consequence, up to the present, incentive plans have not proved a\nsuccessful means of stemming the rise in the base rate. Labor has been\nunwilling to accept incentive earnings as a substitute for increases in base\npay, because it has been confident of its ability to secure the latter. Now, how-\never, the War Labor Board's firm stand against unwarranted increases in\nbase rates, coupled with its authorization of increased earnings based upon\nincentive pay where such pay is in fact accompanied by increased production,\nmay compel a change in labor's attitude. Labor's traditional aversion to\nincentive plans, based upon a fear (often justified) that management would\nreduce base rates once production increased, need not prove a stumbling\nblock today, for labor's bargaining position under present conditions is so\nstrong that few companies could reduce rates even ii they wanted to. Both\nthe need for increased production and the demands of labor for some form\nof increase in remuneration make it likely that incentive wage plans will\nachieve increased popularity during the duration of the war boom.\n\nIn 1941, a substitute for wage rate increases more acceptable to labor than\nincentive pay was overtime pay. While many companies have adopted this\nmeasure, they realize that labor will not easily relinquish its high earnings\nafter the war, and that therefore substitution of overtime pay may be only a\ntemporary expedient. The final reckoning will come after the armistice when\nlabor may well demand increases in base rates to compensate it for the loss\nof overtime pay.\n\nStudy of wage increases in industrial concerns during the latter half of\n1941 revealed the development of several significant trends in wage policies\nwhich are likely to exert an important influence upon our post-war economy.\n\n1. Evident even to the casual observer was the emergence of the general\nuniform wage increase as the dominant form of wage adjustment in both\nlarge and small companies. General wage increases extending in equal amounts\nto all employees have long been common in large concerns, because they lend\nthemselves well to large establishments, create fewer economic grievances, and\ndo not disrupt job valuations. Until recently, however, wage increases in small\ncompanies were typically not of this kind, but rather varied with the indi-\nvidual according to his length of service, efficiency of production, loyalty,\netc. In the last few years, however, smaller companies have also tended to\nadopt the policy of granting blanket increases of a given percentage or cents\nper hour to all employees in the firm.\n\nEmployers, when questioned, admitted that this is bad policy, that it gives\nthe individual worker little satisfaction, and does not conduce to efficiency;\nyet despite the objections against it, this form of wage change is becoming\nthe dominant form in industry. The principal cause for its spread is union\npressure. Unions favor uniform general wage increases because they conform\nto the union program of \"getting something for everybody\" and because\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "894\n", "[DECEMBER\n"], "2": ["COMMUNICATIONS\n", "893\n", "1943] COMMUNICATIONS 893\n\ning large numbers of employees quickly. Inclusion in government contracts of\ncost-plus or flexible wage rate provisions made it possible for them to pay\nhigh wage rates without detriment to profits and thus considerably simplified\ntheir wage problem.? Other companies less favorably situated embarked,\nhowever, upon a \"middle of the road\" policy, granting wage increases with\none eye on labor turnover and the other eye on the future.\n\nConcerns which during this period were able to pursue successfully a wage\npolicy of moderation despite the growing scarcity of labor included companies\nin small communities at some distance from industrial centers; companies\nwith a record of steady employment? which were able to hold employees by\nreminding them of the temporary nature of defense jobs; and companies with\nfriendly employer-employee relations, sickness, health, and other employee\nbenefits. While factual evidence based upon more recent investigation of\nthese same companies is not available, it seems evident that the number of\ncompanies capable of maintaining a wage policy of moderation has suffered\ncontinual diminution. For one thing, war orders are more generally distributed\nthroughout industry today than was true in 1941 and labor has been quick\nto demand its share of the profits accruing from such production. Companies\nstill engaged in nonessential production find that benefits of employer benevo-\nlence\u2014to be reaped at some future date in the event of sickness or old age\n\u2014cannot compare with the jingle of hard cash as a means of retaining the\nloyalty of a working force depleted by the draft and the attraction of high\nwage war industries.\n\nBonus incentive plans have been seized upon by some companies as an\napparently ideal solution to the wage problem. Such plans would seem to\nafford a means of satisfying labor's demands for higher earnings during the\nboom, and at the same time of keeping costs and prices down, since the\nincreased output they elicit pays for the increased disbursements to labor.\nFurthermore, since bonuses automatically disappear when output is curtailed\nand profits decline, such plans would not burden post-war industry with high\nlabor costs.\n\nInvestigation reveals, however, that in 1941 bonus payments were not\nacceptable to labor as a substitute for wage increases. In a number of com-\npanies having bonus plans, unions insisted that regular hourly base rates be\nkept on a par with the rest of the community or with other firms in the indus-\ntry. Employers suggested two reasons for this attitude:\n\n1. Labor wants to raise base rates as high as possible during the boom so\nthat its earnings after the war will continue at a high level, even if some\nreduction in rates is made. Labor is looking ahead and realizes that, while\nbonuses will automatically disappear when production is curtailed, high base\nrates may stick.\n\n2. Labor insists that base rates be on a par with the community or indus-\n\n?^However, a number of employers with large defense contracts, while compelled to\nmake substantial wage incteases to attract and hold personnel, expressed concern regarding\nthe level of wage rates which would remain when the war boom was spent.\n\n*'There is a definite inverse relation between the average length of service of employees\nin a concern and its labor turnover.\n"], "1": ["Wage Policies and Wage Trends in the War Boom!\n\nAn interesting insight into current wage problems is afforded by a review\nof wage policies and wage trends in the latter half of 1941, a period during\nwhich wage increases represented industry's and labor's reaction to the war\nboom, unfettered by any broad government wage policy.\n\nEmployers in 1941 were for the most part aware that the wage increases\nof that year were only the prelude to other wage adjustments to come, so long\nas the war boom persisted. While some employers were content to deal with,\nlabor on an opportunistic basis, many companies\u2014particularly the large\nones\u2014had at this date already attempted to formulate definite, though\nadaptable, wage policies for the duration, Wage policies of companies with\nlarge defense orders were, of course, dictated largely by the need for attract-\n\n\"The writer is indebted to the Social Science Research Council for making possible a\nfield survey which covered 55 companies in 15 industry groups, including such large con-\ncerns as General Motors and U.

Agriculture has placed itself at a disadvantage in\nits dealings with the industrial section of the economy by assuming an addi-\ntional responsibility. Even though agricultural workers have moved into in-\ndustrial production during periods of expansion (when they were needed\nmost on the farm), these same workers have returned to the land when they\nwere discharged by industry during the periods of economic contraction and\ndepression (when they were needed least on the farm).\n\nThat this responsibility in agriculture was and is based on a family rather\nthan a legal relationship does not remove the fact that the responsibility has\ntended to maintain the real income produced and the employment of the\nfactors of production in agriculture when other sections of the economy were\ndeclining. As long as agriculture was the dominant section of the economy\nand thereby provided the major portion of the real income of the economy,\nthis responsibility tended to mitigate the worst results of an industrial con-\ntraction. The disappearance of the frontier and the dominance of industrially\nproduced goods now places the problem squarely on the doorstep of the\nindustrial section of the economy.\n\nIt is true that agriculture has not prospered in recent times and that farm-\ning is a way of life as well as a business enterprise, which gives agriculture a\nstaying power that the industrial enterprise does not have. Nevertheless, the\nfact that the farmer has made a living while he assumed an additional respon-\nsibility under the worst possible circumstances\u2014alone\u2014should indicate that\nenterprises in general could prosper if the responsibility was universally\nadopted to increase the flexibility of the economy and thereby maintain pro-\nduction and employment in the entire economy.\n\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Gordon F.

In Section I, several\nalternatives to subsidies are explored, since they may be preferable to a\nsubsidy program in particular areas. Under certain conditions, a rise\nof prices might be the lesser evil.' Again, large price increases might be\naverted even in the absence of subsidies. The government has used with\ngreat success the techniques of averaging costs and differential pricing.\nIf these techniques are not practical and a rise of prices is to be avoided,\nthe government may then have to resort to subsidies.\n\nThe objectives of subsidies are considered in Section II. One ob-\njective is a reduction in the cost of living or a moderation in its rate\nof increase. Another and related objective is the prevention of a rise\nof prices for all supplies to a level set by marginal costs. By paying to\nproducers or suppliers in the form of a subsidy the excess of marginal\ncosts over average costs, the government can encourage additional out-\nput and yet prevent a rise of marginal costs from being translated into\na corresponding increase in prices for all units.\n\nThe more important categories of subsidy procedures are examined\nin Section III. (1) Government purchase and resale has been used\nwidely in the industrial area; but not sufficiently for the purpose of\nreducing the cost of living. (2) In subsidizing additional costs involved\nin high cost and additional output, the government has, in various\nways, stimulated output. (3) A disguised subsidy is involved in the\nassumption by the government of certain services which private enter-\nprise is unable or unwilling to perform at a reasonable price, and in\nthe sale of these services by the government, under certain conditions,\nbelow costs.\n\n* As the Director of the Office of Export-Import Price Control for over a year and a\nhalf, Mr. Harris has had considerable experience in the operational part of subsidy pro-\ngrams. Many subsidy programs, of which this paper gives the theoretical background,\nwere worked out in his office.

Blair's review' of my Industrial Concentration and Price Inftexibility\n(Washington, American Council on Public Affairs, 1942) merits rebuttal\npartially on the grounds outlined.\n\nThe reviewer has concentrated upon two chapters of the book dealing with\nthe flexibility of prices relative to costs. The first of these, Chapter V, which is\nconcerned with methods, is somewhat tedious, and if the reviewer passed over\nit in haste he can hardly be blamed. Unfortunately, his criticism of the\nresults of the statistical study, Chapter VI, is largely invalidated by what\nwas written in the preceding chapter on methods.\n\nThe object of the investigation contained in these two chapters should\nbe clarified. It was to determine whether previous studies of the relation-\nship between concentration and price inflexibility (in the sense of amplitude\nof price decline during depression) had ignored variables other than concen-\ntration which would account for inflexible prices. The most important of\nthese other variables which suggests itself immediately but which had gen-\nerally been ignored is variation in prime costs.\n\nIf one industry experiences a drop of twenty per cent in its prime cost in a given period\nand another experiences a rise of ten per cent, it would be unreasonable to charge that,\nbecause the average price of the products of the first industry fell twenty per cent and\nthe average price of the products of the second remained the same, the second industry's\n\nprice was inflexible in view of the changes which occurred.

Caught between falling raw material prices and a diminish-\ning volume of exports, many Latin American countries found them-\nselves faced with the virtual impossibility of continuing their debt\nservice. Chile's exports in 1932, for instance, amounted to no more\nthan 500 million pesos, as. against 2,280 million in 1929, while the\nservice of her foreign debt required 160 million pesos for interest and\namortization, and 440 million on account of short-term maturities.'\nThus, in Chile's case there was hardly an alternative to at least tem-\nporary suspension of payments.\n\nCritics of our foreign lending during the 1920's have frequently\nclaimed that overoptimism, if not downright irresponsibility, on the\npart of the underwriters was the major cause of the defaults. Without,\nhowever, attempting to deny that insufficient care was exercised, and\nthat Latin American countries were encouraged to borrow excessively,\none may question whether these factors were decisive.

But this is an argument, not\nfor abandoning the welfare attitude in monetary discussions, but rather for\nbringing the existing ends to the surface and broadening their scope.\n\nAgainst the present proposal it might be argued that welfare economics\nwould become essentially a defense of the status quo since all existent social\npolicies represent in some sense the collective will? Protective tariffs, for\nexample, have been legislated for three generations by democratically elected\nrepresentatives; hence tariffs are a part of our society's ends. But this argu-\nment is defective on two counts. First, a great many economic policies do\nnot in any important sense represent the collective will; silver legislation and\ndegraded flashlight lamps will serve as examples. Second, and vastly more\nimportant, specific policies are usually means\u2014in many cases mistaken ones,\nthe economist may argue\u2014and not ends. The Iowa farmer votes for protection\nbecause he does not know its effects on his economic position, not because\nhe likes high tariff walls 5er se. Of course this is not strictly true, but to deny\nit categorically is to deny a significant r\u00f3le to rational discussion in the forma-\ntion of social policy.\n\nNevertheless it does seem true that the welfare economics here proposed\nhas a conservative bias. In the nature of things the wideness with which any\nend is accepted depends upon the specificity of that end. As compared with\nthe (unknown!) distribution of income in 1939, almost everyone would agree\nthat the desired end is a more equal distribution. But, assigning some conven-\ntional measure of inequality, the acceptance of this end shrinks as the goal\nof equality is approached. Witness the less than unanimous approval of the\n$25,000 ceiling on salaries. Until the distant day when the welfare economist\ncan assign quantitative orders of importance to various (degrees of fulfill-\nment of) ends, therefore, it seems necessary for him to recommend only\ngradual changes of policy in many areas. This formal conclusion could, I\nthink, be defended on substantive grounds as the only approach which is\ncompatible with democratic social processes.\n\nA century ago John Stuart Mill observed: *Political Economy does not of\nitself instruct how to make a nation rich; but whoever would be qualified to\njudge of the means of making a nation rich, must first be a political econo-\nmist.\" His statement implies the still fundamental and unfulfilled task of\nthe economist.\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n", "359\n", "1943]\n"], "4": ["* The Structure of Social Action (New York, 1937), p. 395.

Com-\npare the bizarre approach of the new welfare economics: it would be possible\nto recompense manufacturers for not degrading the quality of their products.\n\nSecond, as evidence of the fact that an applied ethics is already in com-\nmon use in economics one may suggest the case of monetary theory.

Ax Alternative\n\nOne may still argue along somewhat different lines that the economist may\nnevertheless put behind his recommendations of policy what little prestige\nthe Office of Price Administration has left him. The fundamental point of\nthis alternative approach may be developed by a brief examination of the\nthesis implicit in the newer welfare economics: that all ends other than\nmaximization of income are value judgments (or, in some sense, more de-\nbatable value judgments) and accordingly unsuited for scientific purposes.\n\nThe familiar admonition not to argue over differences in tastes leads not\nonly to dull conversations but also to bad sociology. It is one thing to recog-\nnize that we cannot frove, by the usual tests of adequacy of proof, the supe-\nriority of honesty over deceit or the desirability of a more equal income dis-\ntribution. But it is quite another thing to conclude that therefore ends of\ngood policy are beyond the realm of scientific discussion.\n\nFor surely the primary requisite of a working social system is a consensus\non ends. The individual members of the society simply must agree upon the\nmajor ends which that society is to seek. If any large share of the population\nactively disagrees with the society's ends, and in particular if it believes that\nthe system is unfair by that group's criteria, the social system will surely\ndisintegrate, probably with violence.\n\nThis view is almost axiomatic in modern social theory; a society is in fact\ndefined in some such terms as *a group of individuals held together by a\ncommon dominant purpose and functioning as an entity.\"5 It would be easy\n\n*W.

The free trade argument may col-\nlapse if one desires also (the decreasingly academic objective of) military\nself-sufficiency or a prosperous, independent peasantry or continuance of a\nparticular party in power. Maximum income is never the sole end of policy.\n\nSecond, how could we discover who the thieves are, and how much they\ncould steal, and from whom? But similarly, how can we discover\u2014except in\nthe simplest of textbook cases\u2014who is injured by an economic policy and to\nwhat extent? Theory and statistics are too weak to yield really defensible\nestimates of individual gains and losses. Until the principle of recompensation\nbecomes capable of realistic application it must necessarily appear to be little\nmore than an analytical trick,\n\nFinally, will not the marginal propensity to steal rise under such a system?\nBut again, will not an industry have a claim to recompensation for the benefits\nit would have received if it had asked for a tariff or for a higher tariff?\n\nTo the one formal objection, that maximization of income is not the sole\n\"economic\" end of policy, at least one lesser objection of the same type may\nbe added. There is no reason why a change in policy may not lead to a change\nin the indifference curve systems and then even the formal validity of the\ntheorems is irrelevant. For example, if free trade leads to more farmers, who\nhave different utility functions from urban workers, it becomes impossible to\nstate that they are better or worse off than they were, compensated or not.\n\nOne may therefore conclude that the new welfare economics has been rather\npretentious.\n\n\"UT 4.\n"], "2": ["exchange (including production) or distribution. Nothing scientific can be\nsaid about distribution, but in appraising exchange policies we may make use\nof two well-known theorems:\n\n1. The marginal rates of substitution between commodities must be equal\nfor all individuals. If this is not so, an exchange of goods will help one person\nwithout injuring the other?\n\n2.

If this condition is not met it is pos-\nsible to reallocate resources in such a way as to increase outputs of some\ngoods without decreasing outputs of any.?\n\nIf these theorems are applied to the problem of international trade, for\nexample, they show that income (of all countries together) is maximized by\nfree trade. If landlords are injured by a repeal of Corn Laws, they can be\nrecompensed and there will still be an unencumbered increase in income re-\nsulting from the adoption of free trade. Thus, without facing the ethical ques-\ntion of whether landlords' income is more or less important than consumers'\nincome, one can conclude that free trade is desirable.

Consider theft; our\npresent policy toward this means of livelihood probably has adverse effects\non the national income. Prevention of theft and punishment of thieves involve\nsubstantial expenditures for policemen, courts, jails, locks, insurance salesmen,\nand the like.

A similar argument could, I\nthink, be adduced to show that wars should be fought with checkbooks.\n\nThe replies to this reductio are obvious enough. It may not be quite so\nobvious that they are all applicable to the (typical) case of free trade, so the\nanalogy will be pressed.

But the decline in the published figures (i.e., base price plus\nquantity extras) between the same size groups is only 8.2 per cent. In other\nwords, the decline in the published quantity extras comprises only a small\npart of the total decline shown in the monograph. This generalization, as may\nbe noted from the table, is true of all the other products analyzed in the\nmonograph, with the exception of steel plates for which the published quantity\nextras on very small shipments are comparatively high.\n\nFor Dr. Stigler's contention still to be tenable, it would be necessary that\nthe remainder of the decline in the mill net (i.e., that which is not due to the\nsmall decrease in the published quantity extras) be caused by a decline in\npublished quality extras. The assumption, however, that large buyers generally\npurchase steel of lower quality than small buyers simply has no justification\nin fact. Rather, the converse tends to be true. In the monograph, it was pointed\nout that ^. , . quality demands on large orders are frequently very exacting\"\n(p. 23). This represented a considerable understatement. The practice of the\nautomobile industry in demanding, and obtaining cold-rolled sheet and strip\nof extraordinarily exacting quality specifications is a well-known case in point.\n\nThus it does not appear that a decline either in published quantity extras\nor in published quality extras, or in both, could be responsible for more than\na small proportion of the decline shown in the mill net figures.\n\nThis indicates the existence of hidden concessions from extras, and it was\nconcessions of this type which were regarded in the monograph as discrimina-\ntory. But Dr. Stigler argues that these concessions might be justifiable on cost\ngrounds and therefore would not be discriminatory.\n\nThis may or may not be true. However, this argument that hidden conces-\nsions are not discriminatory if they reflect decreases in costs would indicate,\nif such were the case, that the published extras are discriminatory. In addi-\ntion, the argument is rather academic since no cost data by size of ship-\nment are available (or likely to be available because of the tremendous prob-\nlems of statistical compilation involved) and since it appears unlikely that\ndecreases in costs would be equal to the declines in the price figures, as shown\nin the monograph. One reason that the declines in costs would probably be\nless than the declines in prices is the fact that each shipment usually does not\nrepresent a separate rolling, since it is the practice of steel mills to group\ntogether a number of qualitatively similar orders which are then run as one\nrolling.\n\nFinally, in trying to make the point that price discrimination might not\nbe indicated by the data in the monograph, Dr. Stigler overlooks the declines\nshown in the base prices. These declines can only be regarded as discrimina-\ntory, since for a given product the base price is supposed to be the same for\nall buyers, regardless of the quantity or quality of the purchase,\n\nJouw M.

Second, the spend-\nings tax tends to immobilize savings already made. Especially if rates\nare sharply graduated, individuals with substantial savings are likely to\nhesitate to use them for consumption if a large proportion of this spend-\ning is absorbed as tax. Third, both in the higher and lower income\nbrackets income tax rates can become so high as to reduce incentive to\nproduce. A spendings tax avoids the difficulty by substituting a spend-\nings base for an income base so that marginal income tax rates need\nnot become high enough to exert this effect on incentive. Fourth, the\nincome tax is not sufficiently free from inequities to justify further\nimportant increases in rates without refinements in the concepts of\ntaxable income and the taxpayer unit, and in the rate structure, which\nwill require much time and effort to achieve. The enactment of a spend-\nings tax as a supplement to the income tax would make it possible to\nminimize the effect of some of these inequities because at a certain point\nthe tax base would be changed from income to spendings.\n\n\"The first and second of these arguments in favor of the spendings tax\noffer a means of minimizing price inflation, and therefore constitute\nthe primary reason, in the economic circumstances which have prevailed\nup to and through the winter of 1942-43, for urging the adoption of the\nspendings tax.

If a public debt creates no burden on\nsociety because the cost of servicing the debt is offset by an interest-income-\nstream, the same is true of a private debt.

In the Cement Case before the Com-\nmission in the fall of 1942, counsel for the Commission states: *If a\nsingle corporation owned all the mills and attempted to operate them,\nthat is just what it would do to prevent them from competing with\neach other. Such a monopoly would act just as respondent manu-\nfacturers under separate ownership are acting when they use the\n[multiple] basing point system.\"* This statement is incorrect. A\nmonopolist would never adopt the basing-point system, since he could\nalways increase his profits by leaving the price pattern unchanged and\neliminating cross-hauling. It follows that if, as is contended by its\nopponents, the existence of the system implies collusion, it is collusion\nshort of complete agreement. On the other side, it is contended for the\nrespondents in the Cement Case: \"The term [imperfect competition]\nhas no relation to monopoly, does not shade into monopoly. ... It isa\nnatural phenomenon and is the inevitable form of competition in all\nmanufacturing industry. It is entirely consistent with free competition\nand does not imply less or weaker competition, since it is frequently\nmore keen and vigorous than *perfect competition! would be.\"* Suffice\nit to say that no economist would endorse this statement; but the\nstatement was made by learned counsel who had heard the testimony\nof a galaxy of economic talent.\n\nConvincing evidence can certainly be adduced that the basing-point\nsystem neither conforms to the economist's ideal of perfect competition,\nnor to his anathema, pure monopoly. But surely it is obvious that the\nmonopoly-competition controversy from an economic point of view is\nbarren, since the basing-point system involves imperfect competi-\ntion, containing elements both of competition and monopoly; and to\nabolish the basing-point system and require, say, f.o.b. mill pricing\nwould merely substitute one form of imperfect competition for an-\nother.

Not only has there been unusual activity\nin monetary theory, but extensive transformations have also been made\nin the basic theory of value. The outstanding publications in this field\nare, of course, Joan Robinson's Teory of Imperfect Competition and\nChamberlin's TAeory of Monopolistic Competition, the first produced\nin Cambridge, England, and the second in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nThese volumes mark the explicit recognition of the theory of the firm\nas an integral division of economic analysis upon which rests the whole\nfabric of equilibrium theory. General equilibrium is nothing more than\nthe problem of the interaction of individual economic organisms, under\nvarious conditions and assumptions; as a necessary preliminary to its\nsolution, an adequate theory of the individual organism itself is neces-\nsary. This consists of two main parts: first, an account of the circum-\nstance, or environment, facing an economic organism, described in in-\ndividual demand curves, purchase curves, expectations, and so on,\ntogether with a \"principle of maximization,\" a criterion by which to\njudge the various possible actions of the organism in order to select the\n*best.\" Second, from the principles discovered in the first part of the\ntheory, a technique must be devised to describe the reactions of an or-\nganism to changes in its environment: how, for instance, a change in the\ndemand for its product will affect its sales.\n\nThe \"Cambridge Theory\"\u2014if so we may describe the essentially\nsimilar' doctrines of Mrs. Robinson and Professor Chamberlin\u2014made\none important step forward in the techniques of analysis, 7.e., the use of\n", "Eprrog's Nork: The author, formerly at Colgate University and the Institute for\nAdvanced Studies, Princeton, is now professor of economics at Fisk University, Nash-\nville.\n\n'Probably neither Mrs. Robinson nor Professor Chamberlin would agree that their\ndoctrines are essentially similar: indeed, in regard to the theory of the \"industry\" and of\ngeneral equilibrium there are significant divergences between them.

Partly to answer this question, Ezekiel made two analyses,\none of data on private saving and the other of data on consumption. Un-\nfortunately, both analyses include serious errors of data or of interpretation,\nas we shall briefly point out.\n\n1. Functional Relation of Saving and Income. By an oversight, the values\nfor saving (total offsets to saving, according to the Currie definition) as given\nby Ezekiel in his Tables I and II and also as plotted in his Figures 2 to 5 are\nall erroneous for the years 1929-40 because they omit the net contributions\nof the state and local governments. The omitted amounts varied from 1.4\nbillion dollars in 1931 to minus 1.2 billion dollars in 1934. The corrected values\nare plotted in Figure 1.? Comparison with Ezekiel's corresponding Figure 5\nshows that the corrected points for the seven depression years 1930-36 lie only\nabout half as far, on the average, from the trend line drawn symmetrically\nthrough them.\n\n2. Functional Relation of Consumption and Income. In his Figures 8 and 9\nEzekiel plots consumption as a function of net national income whereas he\nshould have used gross private income as in his Figures 4 and 5. Estimates\nof consumption are obtained by subtracting estimates of saving from estimates\nof income; hence, a plot of consumption vs. income is also a plot of saving vs.\nincome; and the choice of income used determines the kind of saving plotted.\nAs a result of Ezekiel's choice of net national income, his Figures 8 and 9\nand his corresponding equation really relate to net total saving, including\ngovernment net saving, instead of to private saving; hence, no conclusion\nas to spending habits can be drawn from this analysis.\n\n3.

Of prime importance\nin the explanation of the failure of expenses to vary proportionately with gross\nincome are the arbitrary and illogical accounting methods of the rule of *'cost\nor market whichever is lower\" for inventory valuation and the straight-line\nmethod of depreciation. Because of this fact, he says, it is time to re\u00e9xamine\nthese accounting techniques of the individual concern because of the adverse\neffect which they have on the total economy.\n\nBoth of these accounting techniques, according to Professor Buchanan,\naugment profits in prosperous years and diminish them in poor ones.

Alterations of this\nmagnitude have highly significant consequences. One of the most\ndangerous economic fallacies is, then, the idea that saving equals in-\nvestment. Real saving is but another aspect of real investment; but\nit is financial saving, not real saving, that diminishes the demand for\ngoods and expands the demand for securities.\n\nSome precision will be needed in this analysis. The following defini-\ntions are therefore submitted not because they are especially novel,\nbut because the rigidity of concepts characteristic of investment analy-\nsis will facilitate revelation of the elements omitted by Mr. Keynes\nand by many other writers.

The Fall of Selective Price Control\n\nThe freezing of retail prices, on May 18, 1942, brought to an end the\nperiod of so-called selective price control. In September 1940 when\nefforts at price control were first informally begun, there were already\nthose, marked by the experience of 1917-18, who advocated a general\nfreezing of prices and wages. The majority of economists, however,\nopposed such wide and drastic action at that time. The impact of the\narmament program was still extremely uneven, and it was felt that price\nand wage increases in certain areas might usefully serve to redistribute\nresources and to stimulate output, at least up to the level of current\nfixed capacity. Control was instituted in those individual markets where\nexisting and anticipated war demands were most strongly felt and where\nsubstantial price increases had already taken place\u2014at first largely\nmetals and metal products, and lumber. During the year 1941 most of\nthe basic materials, other than farm products, and some semi-fabricated\nand finished goods, were brought under control.\n\nBetween February and December 1941 some 45 formal price sched-\nules were fixed. In December 1941 and January 1942, with the sharp\nacceleration in production and production plans, 42 schedules were re-\nquired.

Sugar, typewriters, bicycles, auto-\nmobiles, tires, and gasoline are already subject to direct administrative\nrationing. Although no widespread infringement of the sugar regulations\nis apparent, the experience with tires and gasoline, if it should become\nmore general, would be tragic. Even with sugar the cost of administra-\ntion is not to be blinked at in a country straining every nerve toward\nwar production.\n\nA fundamental difficulty with administrative rationing is that equal\nallotments do not result in equal treatment or equal sacrifice. This has\nbeen recognized for tires and gasoline, and varying quantities have been\nallowed different classes of consumers. But no administrative board can\nappraise the merits of claims for allotments above the minimum, nor\ncan it control the disposition of the commodity once allotted. Perhaps\nit can determine that a gasoline user's work is important for defense\nand that no public conveyance is available; it cannot judge whether he\ncould shift his residence, change jobs, ride with a neighbor. And most\nof its problems are far more complicated than this one. For success a\nrationing board requires a nearly unanimous feeling by the general pub-\nlic that rationing is necessary, that the board's methods are proper,\nand that its administration is competent, uniform and impartial.\n\nIn our economy goods have normally been apportioned through the\nprice mechanism. The commodity goes to those who want it badly\nenough to pay the price, this being dependent upon need or taste for the\ncommodity, upon the acceptability of substitutes, and especially upon\nincomes. 'The income element in determining the distribution of goods\nand services is always a source of social concern. This concern occa-\nsionally results in direct allocation of goods and services outside the\nprice system, notably free education and medical facilities, and more\noften it leads to efforts to redistribute income, notably through pro-\ngressive income, gift, and inheritance taxes.\n\nIn wartime the r\u00f3le of income in rationing through the price mecha-\nnism becomes crucial, whether the peacetime distribution of income\n", "This content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Fri, 11 Feb 2022 07:59:15 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["W.

To fix prices at the retail level without a general\nplan for rationing would result in an informal sort of rationing by the\nseller wherein any prejudice or preference he may have could exert an\nundesirable influence; iso facto rationing is a prerequisite to any pro-\ngram which would distribute limited supplies equitably to the consum-\ning public.\n\nSince the fundamental theory of rationing is to equate demand and\nsupply and thereby perform (in a limited sense) the function of the\nprice mechanism, any plan of rationing must seek to regulate the flow\nof rationed commodities from the manufacturer to the retailer as well\nas the ultimate sale to the consumer. Once it is decided some form of\nrationing is necessary, fari passu it follows that a complete program\nco\u00f3rdinating output and consumption must be adopted.

It is\nprobably time to integrate these remarks and to see where they lead:\nto contrast them to the older ideas and their end-results.\n\nIn the discussion, attention will first be devoted to the older, and\nmore usual, views of the demand curve. Actually this amounts to an\nexamination of Marshall's assumptions.

As to the particular\ndependence of demand upon income and its elasticity, a relatively\nrecent, and essentially measurement-inspired addition to the econo-\nmist's toolbox, its possibilities for the further development of theo-\nretical reasoning have already been exploited by Bowley and Allen,\nand have certainly contributed to shape Hicks's ideas. In other words,\nMarshall, the theorist, could afford to be content with stating \u00a3e law\nof demand\" ceteris paribus. But attempts at measurement very soon\nmade it necessary to find out what exactly the more important ones\namong the \"other things\" really were. For measurement of the price-\nquantity function is possible only if the influence of the ce\u00a3era is suc-\ncessfully eliminated, and in order to eliminate we must know Aat and\nhow much. The devices invented for the purpose of isolating what to\nMarshall was \u00a3\u00a3e law of demand have in turn proved stimulating to\nreasoning of a purely theoretical kind.\n\nLater I shall examine whether a similar development can be expected\n\n'A paper presented at a joint meeting of the American Economic Association and the\nEconometric Society, held in New York, December 29, 1941.\n"}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Hans Staehle"], "stable_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1803513"}, "1803514": {"affiliations": {"raw": {"1": ["MODERN ECONOMICS AND THE\nINTRODUCTORY COURSE\n", "By RicuagD CLEMENCE azd FRANCIS S.

Students,\nin larger and larger numbers, are looking to the teacher of economics\nfor an explanation of the great changes that are everywhere taking\nplace.\n\nIn quieter times students begin their study of economics without\na great deal of enthusiasm, and the first few meetings of the class often\nsucceed in putting an end to whatever small interest in the subject they\nmay originally have had. In days like the present, however, the teacher\nof economics, in his annual retreat from reality, finds it increasingly\ndifficult to take his students with him. He is brought face to face with\nresponsibilities which become no easy matter to evade. Not that most\nteachers are particularly anxious to evade their responsibilities to their\nstudents, but in more peaceful days they may easily do so without being\naware of the fact. This is no longer possible in periods of rapid and\nviolent change, and the teacher of economics finds himself in a difficult\nand embarrassing position. The teacher himself, we hope to make clear,\nis not wholly to blame for his predicament. It is but one of the\nsymptoms of the generally unsatisfactory state into which the course\nin introductory economics has fallen. Indications are not lacking that\nthere is a growing appreciation of the inadequacy of much of our teach-\ning, and the time may well have been reached for a clear formulation\nof the issues.\n\nThe teacher of economics has accepted a position carrying with it\ngreat responsibilities, for he claims to possess both an understanding\nof the course of events beyond that of ordinary men, and the ability to\nimpart this knowledge to others. The results of current teaching in\nmost courses in general economics, however, make it difficult to believe\nthat most teachers are living up to their claims.

It\nhas little relevance for the distribution of the current war burden, and it\nseems as likely as not to be incorrect in viewing the distribution of income by\nclasses over time.\n\nIt is surely well established by now, though unfortunately not yet recog-\nnized by some of our congressional leaders, that the burden of the present war\neffort cannot be sloughed off by this generation onto later ones, by borrowing\nor otherwise, Thus the argument that future peacetime taxes may be more\nequitably allocated than present ones is largely irrelevant for discussion of an\nequitable distribution of the current war burden, even assuming that future\ntaxes actually can be more equitably distributed (which is far from certain).\nIn considering the allocation of the burden of war financing, the real com-\nparison must be between the distribution of the tax burden now and the bond\nburden now (including the price inflation which will probably come with bor-\nrowing), rather than between present and future taxes. And if it is true that\nthe very low income groups lose especially from inflation\u2014and there is con-\nsiderable truth in the statement\u2014then even the fact that the rich buy the\nbonds does not necessarily mean a more equitable distribution of the present\nburden through borrowing, since borrowing from the rich is especially likely\nto draw on otherwise \"idle\" funds and speed price inflation.\n\nThe question of the relationship of war financing and income distribution\nover time (as distinct from the distribution of the war burden) is a much more\nsubtle one than has been generally recognized.

Only by referring to his general position\nas a reformer can his theory be understood. The leading concept, basic in-\nterest, takes on meaning in terms of the modified behavior of the economic\nsystem which Gesell anticipated would follow from the introduction of\nstamped money. In some important respects his analysis is not fully devel-\noped, but in general the pattern is clear.

His explanation of this is facili-\ntated by the distinction between loan interest and basic interest. Loan interest\nis used in the ordinary sense, referring to the amount of money paid by bor-\nrowers to the lenders of liquid funds. According to Gesell, the loan rate must\nalways equal the rate of return on real capital assets, whether the loan be\nmade in conventional money or stamped money. Loans contracted in stamped\nmoney will bear (loan) interest as long as the demand for loan capital exceeds\nthe supply at a zero loan rate.'* A zero loan rate must await the day when\nunimpeded accumulation causes capital assets to lose their scarcity value.\n\nIn saying that basic interest would disappear with the introduction of\nstamped money, Gesell means that the consequences which flow from the use\nof conventional money would be eliminated and processes set in motion which\nin time would reduce the loan rate and the real rate to zero. When this has\ncome about, interest income will disappear, and rentier capitalism will be at\nan end.\n\nIn this respect Gesell's ideas on long-run social reform are closely analogous\nto Keynes's *euthanasia of the rentier.\"*5 'The secular decline in the marginal\nefficiency of capital is another expression for Gesell's long-term reduction in\nthe rate of return on real capital. Keynes tells us he believes that, within a\nperiod of a generation or two, unchecked accumulation would make capital\nassets so abundant that they would cease to yield a return in excess of their\ncost.^ Both Keynes and Gesell maintain that pure interest can be made to\ndisappear without socializing the instruments of production. In the new so-\nciety individuals would still be free to accumulate, but their wealth would\nnot grow automatically through interest accruals. Nevertheless, skilled risk\ntakers would be free to venture their capital in new and uncertain enterprises,\nand if successful, would get a return in excess of their original investments.\nThus the advantages of individual initiative and enterprise would be retained,\nwhile nonfunctional income and other undesirable features of the capitalist\nsystem would disappear.\n\nThe immediately significant difference arising from the substitution of\nstamped money for conventional forms is that all resources would be con-\ntinuously employed. Basic interest would not exist as a barrier frustrating new\ncapital formation. The *natural\" forces of competitive production would\nadjust to a level of output at which resources would be fully employed. This\n\n?! Natural Economic Order, p. 263.\n\n?

In Hitler's famous list of twenty-five points, one of\nthe two points in bold-faced print calls for the *Brechung der Zinsknecht-\nschaft,\" i.e., for the abolition of *interest slavery.\" Although this anti-finance\ncapital outlook is significant, care must be taken not to identify the liberal,\nhumanitarian premises of Gesell's program with the fundamentally different\ntotalitarian premises of the Nazi party.\n\nIn order to explain how unemployment, crises and unearned income could\nbe remedied, Gesell employs a threefold classification of interest rates: the\nbasic rate (a theoretical rate), the rate of return to real capital (an estimated\nrate), and the loan rate (a contractual rate). Basic interest is described as a\npurely monetary phenomenon which has nothing to do with time-preference,\nwaiting, or the so-called *productivity\" of capital. It does not represent any-\nthing which exists in the real world, or at least there are no direct outward\nmanifestations of its existence. Gesell says, for example, \"Basic interest has\nup to the present escaped observation because it was concealed behind its\noffspring, ordinary interest upon loan-money. . . . Basic interest is a unique\nphenomenon which must be considered by itself; it is a fundamental economic\nconception.\"5 Attempts to apply the test of correspondence between the con-\ncept \"basic interest\" and the object signified by it are certain to yield nega-\ntive results because there is no signification of object. The concept has mean-\ning, but there is no question of its (immediate) truth or falsity. There can be\nno appeal to facts on this level of analysis.\n\nGesell attempts to clarify *basic interest\" by contrasting it with the *rate\nof return on real capital,\" i.e., with the hire price paid to the owners of assets\nother than money. In comparing this rate with the basic rate, he hastens to\nadd: *We ought to cease designating two such fundamentally different things\nby the same word, interest\"? This is the reference of Keynes's statement that\nGesell distinguishes clearly between the rate of interest and the marginal\nefficiency of capital.!?\n\nThis same distinction between basic interest and interest on real capital is\nalso used to contrast the declining rate of return on real capital assets with\nthe constant rate of return on money. In this way Gesell points out that it is\nthe money rate of interest which checks accumulation and impedes production.\nThe accumulation of capital assets in no way reduces the independently de-\ntermined money rate of interest. On the other hand, the accumulation of\ncapital assets does lower the rate of return on real capital. When the latter\nfalls below the basic (money) rate, accumulation ceases because it is now\nmore profitable to hold money than to invest. This forces those who need\nmoney as a medium of exchange to pay the (now) higher basic rate.

His first publication, Die Reformation im Muenzwesen als Bruecke\nzum. Sozialem Staat? contained the kernel of his ideas on monetary policy.\nBetween 1891 and 1898, Gesell published five other works on monetary\npolicy, but nothing specifically on monetary or general economic theory.\nThese were the formative years of his career.\n\nWhen Gesell returned to Europe in 1900 to reside in Switzerland and\nGermany, his practical reform proposals had already been worked out and\npublished in all their essentials. The formulation of his theory came later. In\n1911 he published Die neue Lehre vom Geld und Zins, which formed the\ntheoretical basis for his system of social reform.*\n\nA more detailed discussion is needed to indicate the logical, as distinguished\nfrom the chronological, relation of Gesell's program to his economic theory:\nfirst, because it has been the source of more misinterpretation of his position,\nand second, because of the somewhat more complicated nature of the prob-\nlem. Keynes, for example, has reversed the relation between Gesell's theory\nand program. In discussing Gesell's theory of interest, Keynes says Gesell\n*carried his theory far enough to lead him . . . to the famous prescription of\n*stamped' money.'* Keynes conveys the impression that Gesell arrived at his\npractical suggestion in spite of a *great defect\" in his theory, whereas it would\nbe more accurate to say that Gesell's theory is not, in some important respects,\nan adequate explanation of his practical suggestion. His theory is a refine-\nment of his insight that money should be forced to circulate by means of a\nperiodic tax which would offset the preference of wealth owners for *hoard-\ning\" money rather than spending it for some form of consumable or produc-\ntive wealth.\n\nGesell's contention that interest is a payment to prevent the *hoarding\" of\nmoney classes his interest theory with the \"exploitation\" doctrines of other\nsocialists. He regards the share of total social income represented by interest\nas a deduction from the income created by laborers, including industrial capi-\ntalists. His theory of interest is not, however, the same as the exploitation\ntheory of Marx. Gesell's position is both anti-classical and anti-Marxian. Al-\nthough he avowed himself a socialist and professed to be attacking capitalism\nas a whole, his anti-capitalistic position must be interpreted in terms of his\ndefinition of capitalism as \"the interest exploiting system.\"* In this particular\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n", "349\n"], "1": ["Silvio Gesell's Monetary Theory of Social Reform\n\nIn spite of the attention which has been given to the writings of Silvio\nGesell, the stamped money reformer, the unifying basis of his work has, I\nthink, been neither clearly stated nor satisfactorily elaborated. The relation\nbetween the theoretical and practical aspects of his analysis has been either\nignored, misunderstood or distorted.\n\nGesell's objective as a social reformer was to attack rentier capitalism and\nto substitute in its place an interest-free society. To fortify his reform posi-\ntion Gesell developed a system of economic theory in which he tried to demon-\nstrate that the nonutilization of resources and the presence of nonfunctional\nincome are the inevitable accompaniments of prevailing financial institutions.\nThe most important single phase of his theory as a whole is his theory of\ninterest. In its critical aspect this theory represents an attempt to show that,\nin a system of conventional money, interest income is a payment to prevent\nthe hoarding of money. In its positive aspect the theory is an attempt to\nshow that the introduction of stamped money would eliminate \"basic interest\"\nand thus pave the way to an interest-free economy, The purpose of this note\nis to show that Gesell's theory in general and his theory of basic interest in\nparticular represent an argument for his stamped money proposal. This may\nbest be shown by indicating that the practical insight which led Gesell to\npropose a tax on money was chronologically as well as logically prior to his\ntheoretical system.\n\nThat the practical aspect of Gesell's thought was chronologically prior is\nnot difficult to demonstrate. In 1886, at the age of twenty-four, Gesell mi-\ngrated from Europe to the Argentine to engage in foreign trade and small-\nscale manu\u00edacturing. There he witnessed one of the most speculative episodes\nin the history of modern capitalist development. The great boom from 1885\nto 1890 preceded a long and severe depression which lasted for the duration\nof Gesell's stay in the South American republic. The frustration of industrial\nactivity produced a strong current of resentment against the speculating\nfinanciers, brokers, stock jobbers and mortgagees. As one whose interests\nwere directly affected, and as one whose indignation was aroused by this\nfinancial debauchery, Gesell participated actively in the opposition to the\ngroup interests which appeared to be responsible for the chaotic state of\n\n!

Since my friend,\nProfessor Clair Wilcox of Swarthmore, who was the leading spirit in the\nmatter, declines to tell the story, I take the liberty of doing so.\n\nWith the sharp division of economic opinion in recent years on so many\nissues of public policy, it is hard today to realize the almost unanimous op-\nposition of economists, in the spring of 1930, to the tariff bill then pending\nin Congress. Economic faculties that within a few years were to be split\nwide open on monetary policy, deficit finance, and the problem of big busi-\nness, were practically at one in their belief that the Hawley-Smoot bill was an\niniquitous piece of legislation. What later developed into a statement backed\nby over 1,250 economists originated in a very modest way out of the desire\nof Wilcox and some of his associates at Swarthmore to voice their protest. At\nthe suggestion of Wilcox, Professor Paul Douglas of the University of Chicago,\nwho was then temporarily at Swarthmore, drafted a statement in March that,\nwith some changes in phraseology, was the one given to the press five weeks\nlater.

And yet the community which possessed this unparalleled\nproductive capacity to improve methods and products did not glory in\nits strength. It was perplexed and baffled. Instead of looking forward\nconfidently to achieving ever rising standards of living, it dreaded the\nfuture.

Few of them have given attention\nto the short-run period; and none of them has studied the probable\neffect of taxes on prices in the market period.' The present article is\nconcerned, therefore, with an analysis of the effect of taxation on the\ndisposition and price of goods already on hand, under conditions of\nboth pure and monopolistic competition. In this analysis, it will be\nshown that taxes which affect the disposition of stock-on-hand also af-\nfect simultaneously the rate of output in the succeeding production\nperiod. In other words, it will be shown that the seller's market period\nplans and short-period plans are synchronized? It is the reality of this\nsynchronization which has dictated the substitution of a sequence analy-\nsis for the Marshallian static analysis in the present study.\n\nIn Part I of this analysis, it is assumed that sellers have on hand a\nhighly perishable product for which there is neither the possibility of\ncarry-over nor of self-use. In Part II, it is assumed that carry-over and\nself-use are possible. The two parts of the study are not, however, of\nco\u00f3rdinate importance.

The definitions\nof pure and monopolistic competition which have been adopted in this article are those\nwhich have been given by Professor Chamberlin in The Theory of Monopolistic Compe-\ntition, 3rd ed., pp. 7-9. The analysis of the effect of taxation on price under monopolistic\ncompetition involves the following additional assumptions: (1) that there is complete\nprice interdependence between sellers, and (2) that the effects of selling costs, the total\nof which is assumed to be constant, are represented in the demand curve for the product\nof each firm. Under these assumptions, any one firm may be regarded as a representative\nmember for the group.\n\n*Tn the present study, it is assumed that a producer's plans do not extend beyond the\nmarket period and the succeeding production period. The length of this succeeding perioc\njs assumed to be typical of the production of a particular commodity, with existing scal\nof plant. It is such a \"succeeding period\" which is called the \"short-run period\" in tht\npresent article.\n"}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Elmer D.
