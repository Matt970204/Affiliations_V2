On the one hand,\nit has sprung from an interest in adequate food for the poorer mem-\nbers of society, in making democracy mean at least enough to eat. On\nthe other, it is an outgrowth of the recent discoveries of the \"newer\nknowledge of nutrition.\"\n\n'The use of the term *movement\" in this connection is carefully con-\nsidered.

What the confines of\nthis movement will be in the next several decades depends very much\nupon the course of world history. In due time, whatever happens, such\ngains as are achieved will spread out over society and the movement as\nsuch will fade out.\n\nThe time and place of initiation of that part of the movement that\nsprang from the newer knowledge of nutrition are the League of Na-\ntions, in the early 1930's. The Health Organization of the League had\nbeen working for some time on nutrition as a factor in health, and the\nInternational Labor Office had approached it from the standpoint of the\nwelfare of labor.

Bruce of Australia came forward at the\n1935 League of Nations Assembly with his proposal for the *marriage of\nhealth and agriculture,\" and the setting up of a *mixed committee,\"\ndrawn from agriculture as well as from labor and authorities on health,\nto consider the possibilities of a program that would relieve agriculture\nby disposing of its excess output at the same time that it would get\nmore food into the mouths of the world's underfed millions.\n\nThe Mixed Committee on Nutrition that followed comprised repre-\nsentatives of the two groups in the League that had been working on\nnutrition and of the International Institute of Agriculture (Rome),\nand a group of students of nutrition and food supply drawn from dif-\nferent countries. Its report, published in 1937, undertook first to state\nmore or less quantitatively the nature and extent of malnutrition in\ndifferent parts of the world.

Positive action to bring about an orderly utilization\nof world supplies will continue to be necessary. Said Mr. Batt:\n\nThere will be greater confusion of demand when the war is over.\n\nAt the present time, we are confronted with only a limited number of purchasers of raw\nmaterials and there is limited shipping capacity to carry what is available. When the war\nends, there will be a scramble by all nations for available supplies in order to restore their\neconomies to a peacetime basis as speedily as possible.\n\nExperience after the first World War has shown that such a scramble can result in\ncomplete demoralization of supply, price, and other factors in a peace-time economy.

The most important relates to the representation on the\ncontrol authority. At present, only the United States and the United King-\ndom are directly represented on the Combined Boards (except that Canada\nhas been given a place on the Combined Production and Resources Board).\nAllotment by the Combined Boards, unless their membership should be ex-\npanded, would not meet Taussig's desire for a broadly international arrange-\nment. His plan contemplated representation of consuming as well as supply-\ning countries on the central board of control and allotment which he pro-\nposed.

This time, previous experience is being cited. The view appears\nto have gained wide acceptance that it was a mistake to abolish the wartime\ncontrols so suddenly after the last war. The result was a scramble for short\nsupplies, which brought sharp increases in prices and led to wasteful at-\ntempts by producers, handlers, and users to hold large inventories in anticipa-\ntion of further price rises. This, of course, further intensified the general short-\nage. The people in war-stricken areas, who had the direst needs but the least\nability to compete in a sellers! market, found it difficult to get the materials\nrequired to re-start their production, Everywhere complaints were heard of the\nshortage of raw materials. It was one of the principal topics of early post-war\nconferences on international economic questions. The first meeting of the\nInternational Labour Organization (November, 1919) and the first meeting\nof the International Chamber of Commerce (June, 1920) debated raw mate-\nrial allotment. The Council of the League of Nations at its tenth session\n(October, 1920) set on foot an inquiry into the difficulties experienced by\nmany countries in securing the imported materials which they needed,\n\nSuddenly, however, the boom ended, and the raw material situation re-\nversed itself, Before the expert engaged by the League had finished his report,\nprices had slumped disastrously. As the report put it:\n\nAccumulated stocks are vainly waiting for orders from purchasers. . . . Under the pres-\nsure of holders of stocks, the richer States have gradually come to abandon, or at least to\nlimit, the policy of restrictions and of export duties. . . . The decrease in prices is causing\nholders of stocks to place them upon the market at a very low price . . . while consumers\nare waiting for still more favorable purchasing conditions. . . .

To avoid\nthis result it appears essential, first, that the large block of enemy tonnage now idle in\nenemy or neutral ports should be brought into use; and secondly, that it should be used\nunder Allied direction and in accordance with a general Allied plan. . . .\n\nThese recommendations had been unanimously adopted. The statement went\non to say that the same considerations would appear to apply to raw materials\nand other commodities generally, and that persons representing the com-\nmodity interests involved appeared to be in full accord.\n\nIn answer to the telegram from Mr. Cotton, Mr. Hoover sent a message on\nNovember 8, 1918, which read in part as follows:\nThis Government will not agree to any programme that even looks like inter-Allied con-\ntrol of our economic resources after peace. After peace over one-half of the whole export\nof food supplies of the world will come from the United States and for the buyers of\nthese supplies to sit in majority in dictation to us as to prices and distribution is wholly\ninconceivable. The same applies to raw materials; Our only hope of securing justice in\ndistribution, proper appreciation abroad of the effort we make to assist foreign nations,\nand proper return for the service that we will perform will revolve around complete\nindependence of commitment to joint action on our part.\"\n\nMr. Hoover in the same telegram suggested a relief commission patterned\nafter the Belgian relief organization. Such a European relief commission\nwould \"above all\" prevent *the extension of the functions and life of Inter-\nAllied Food and Maritime Councils either now or after peace.\" Secretary of\nState Lansing, in transmitting Hoover's message, added that the Department\nof State entirely approved the policy thus set forth.

During this same period, the\nadversely influenced enterprises will be taking some action to maximize profits\nor minimize losses. If they strive to reduce other costs they are contributing\nin some manner to increased efficiency since the enterprise can save very little\nby not using the productive forces which they are paying, and as the enter-\nprise must continue the purchase of some raw materials for labor to use.\n\nLikewise any action the enterprise takes toward increased income will be\nbeneficial as it will depend on the best use, not disuse, of the existing produc-\ntive facilities. In many cases an enterprise striving to get the most revenue\nout of an overexpanded production, without piling up a tremendous amount\nof inventory, will lower prices.

As one personnel manager put it, there is now a double pressure\nfor uniformity in wages: from competitors and from labor itself. Industrial\nunions in particular are interested in maintaining a stable and uniform wage\nstructure; for price cutting based upon wage cutting by members of the\nindustry endangers the union position. Union efforts to secure and maintain\nuniformity of wage levels in an industry tend to give rise either to simultaneous\nadjustments of wage levels by all firms within an industry, acting as a group,\nor to successive increases which give the appearance of a leader-follower\npattern.\n\nEmployers agreed that union contracts requiring payment of wages on a\npar with rates prevailing for work of a similar nature in other firms in the\nindusty hasten the spread of wage increases through an industry, but some\nalso suggested that such pressure may produce a feeling among company\nexecutives that upward adjustments should not be made unless other firms\nin the industry are making them, or the union demands them, and therefore\nmake for fewer, though larger, wage adjustments.\n"], "4": ["COMMUNICATIONS\n", "1943] COMMUNICATIONS 895\n\nwage increases which vary in accordance with *\u00abmerit\"\u2014or other such im-\nmeasurable intangibles\u2014breed petty jealousies with consequent disruption\nof union morale.\n\nOf course, acceptance by industry of this form of wage adjustment does\nnot imply that supplemental increases of the *old fashioned\" type cannot be\nmade from time to time, Indeed, they are made, but the tendency seems to be\nto make fewer of the individual adjustments and to rely more and more upon\nthe general change. Some employers reported that they are giving up\nattempting to reward efficiency, because if they raise the pay of a good man,\nthe union then demands that this increase also be extended to others in the\nshop who may be less efficient, but who are performing the same work.\n\nTwo other factors have contributed to the spread of the general increase.\nFirst, the rise in the cost of living during the period under study naturally\ngave an impetus to this type of adjustment as the only fair means of dealing\nwith a condition affecting all employees alike. Secondly the gradual adoption\nby industry at large of the technique of scientific management with its job\nevaluation plans, time studies, and other intricacies has tended to introduce\na certain rigidity into the wage structure. The general uniform wage increase\nthen becomes the only means of adjusting wage levels without disturbing\nthe wage relationship of one job to another.\n\n2. Closely related to this first trend\u2014in that it, too, is a consequence of\nunion organization\u2014is the predominance of the \"cents per hour\" wage in-\ncrease. Wage increases in mass production industries, beginning with the April,\n1941, increase in the steel industry, have tended to be in terms of cents per\nhour, rather than in percentages. On the whole, investigation suggests that\nmanagement prefers the percentage increase while unions prefer adjustments\nin cents per hour. A number of employers reported that they disliked the\nlatter form of wage change because it raised the lower paid employee more\nthan in proportion to higher paid personnel and therefore further diminished\nthe differential between the skilled and unskilled.\n\nIn the steel industry, union leaders justified this narrowing process on\nthe grounds that the industry had developed an unwarranted spread between\nthe lowest and highest rate. But the steel executives maintained that this range\nwas consistent with the skills involved; that with a machinist's rate double a\nlaborer's rate there was an incentive for the latter to work himself up, but\nthat with the union narrowing this differential, the incentive to advance will\nbe seriously impaired. Other employers, however, considered the cents per\nhour increase more equitable in times of rising costs of living, since it gives\na larger percentage increase in income to those very groups of wage earners\nwho feel most severely the rise in living costs. Industrial unions are staunch\nchampions of this position; since they draw their membership primarily from\nthe ranks of the unskilled and semi-skilled it is natural that they should\nchampion that form of wage increase which does most to improve the eco-\nnomic position of their principal constituency.\n\n3. A third significant wage trend\u2014likewise a by-product, in part, of indus-\ntry's reaction to unionism\u2014is the spread of leader-follower relationships in\nindustrial wage policies. In industries employing the most wage earners\u2014\n", "895\n"], "3": ["try even if this means higher than average earnings in the company having\nthe bonus plan, because it believes that management would not pay the\nbonus unless it paid for itself. Hence, employees in these companies reason\nthat they must be working harder or more efficiently than \"the other fellow\"\nand therefore deserve higher earnings.\n\nAs a consequence, up to the present, incentive plans have not proved a\nsuccessful means of stemming the rise in the base rate. Labor has been\nunwilling to accept incentive earnings as a substitute for increases in base\npay, because it has been confident of its ability to secure the latter. Now, how-\never, the War Labor Board's firm stand against unwarranted increases in\nbase rates, coupled with its authorization of increased earnings based upon\nincentive pay where such pay is in fact accompanied by increased production,\nmay compel a change in labor's attitude. Labor's traditional aversion to\nincentive plans, based upon a fear (often justified) that management would\nreduce base rates once production increased, need not prove a stumbling\nblock today, for labor's bargaining position under present conditions is so\nstrong that few companies could reduce rates even ii they wanted to. Both\nthe need for increased production and the demands of labor for some form\nof increase in remuneration make it likely that incentive wage plans will\nachieve increased popularity during the duration of the war boom.\n\nIn 1941, a substitute for wage rate increases more acceptable to labor than\nincentive pay was overtime pay. While many companies have adopted this\nmeasure, they realize that labor will not easily relinquish its high earnings\nafter the war, and that therefore substitution of overtime pay may be only a\ntemporary expedient. The final reckoning will come after the armistice when\nlabor may well demand increases in base rates to compensate it for the loss\nof overtime pay.\n\nStudy of wage increases in industrial concerns during the latter half of\n1941 revealed the development of several significant trends in wage policies\nwhich are likely to exert an important influence upon our post-war economy.\n\n1. Evident even to the casual observer was the emergence of the general\nuniform wage increase as the dominant form of wage adjustment in both\nlarge and small companies. General wage increases extending in equal amounts\nto all employees have long been common in large concerns, because they lend\nthemselves well to large establishments, create fewer economic grievances, and\ndo not disrupt job valuations. Until recently, however, wage increases in small\ncompanies were typically not of this kind, but rather varied with the indi-\nvidual according to his length of service, efficiency of production, loyalty,\netc. In the last few years, however, smaller companies have also tended to\nadopt the policy of granting blanket increases of a given percentage or cents\nper hour to all employees in the firm.\n\nEmployers, when questioned, admitted that this is bad policy, that it gives\nthe individual worker little satisfaction, and does not conduce to efficiency;\nyet despite the objections against it, this form of wage change is becoming\nthe dominant form in industry. The principal cause for its spread is union\npressure. Unions favor uniform general wage increases because they conform\nto the union program of \"getting something for everybody\" and because\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "894\n", "[DECEMBER\n"], "2": ["COMMUNICATIONS\n", "893\n", "1943] COMMUNICATIONS 893\n\ning large numbers of employees quickly. Inclusion in government contracts of\ncost-plus or flexible wage rate provisions made it possible for them to pay\nhigh wage rates without detriment to profits and thus considerably simplified\ntheir wage problem.? Other companies less favorably situated embarked,\nhowever, upon a \"middle of the road\" policy, granting wage increases with\none eye on labor turnover and the other eye on the future.\n\nConcerns which during this period were able to pursue successfully a wage\npolicy of moderation despite the growing scarcity of labor included companies\nin small communities at some distance from industrial centers; companies\nwith a record of steady employment? which were able to hold employees by\nreminding them of the temporary nature of defense jobs; and companies with\nfriendly employer-employee relations, sickness, health, and other employee\nbenefits. While factual evidence based upon more recent investigation of\nthese same companies is not available, it seems evident that the number of\ncompanies capable of maintaining a wage policy of moderation has suffered\ncontinual diminution. For one thing, war orders are more generally distributed\nthroughout industry today than was true in 1941 and labor has been quick\nto demand its share of the profits accruing from such production. Companies\nstill engaged in nonessential production find that benefits of employer benevo-\nlence\u2014to be reaped at some future date in the event of sickness or old age\n\u2014cannot compare with the jingle of hard cash as a means of retaining the\nloyalty of a working force depleted by the draft and the attraction of high\nwage war industries.\n\nBonus incentive plans have been seized upon by some companies as an\napparently ideal solution to the wage problem. Such plans would seem to\nafford a means of satisfying labor's demands for higher earnings during the\nboom, and at the same time of keeping costs and prices down, since the\nincreased output they elicit pays for the increased disbursements to labor.\nFurthermore, since bonuses automatically disappear when output is curtailed\nand profits decline, such plans would not burden post-war industry with high\nlabor costs.\n\nInvestigation reveals, however, that in 1941 bonus payments were not\nacceptable to labor as a substitute for wage increases. In a number of com-\npanies having bonus plans, unions insisted that regular hourly base rates be\nkept on a par with the rest of the community or with other firms in the indus-\ntry. Employers suggested two reasons for this attitude:\n\n1. Labor wants to raise base rates as high as possible during the boom so\nthat its earnings after the war will continue at a high level, even if some\nreduction in rates is made. Labor is looking ahead and realizes that, while\nbonuses will automatically disappear when production is curtailed, high base\nrates may stick.\n\n2. Labor insists that base rates be on a par with the community or indus-\n\n?^However, a number of employers with large defense contracts, while compelled to\nmake substantial wage incteases to attract and hold personnel, expressed concern regarding\nthe level of wage rates which would remain when the war boom was spent.\n\n*'There is a definite inverse relation between the average length of service of employees\nin a concern and its labor turnover.\n"], "1": ["Wage Policies and Wage Trends in the War Boom!\n\nAn interesting insight into current wage problems is afforded by a review\nof wage policies and wage trends in the latter half of 1941, a period during\nwhich wage increases represented industry's and labor's reaction to the war\nboom, unfettered by any broad government wage policy.\n\nEmployers in 1941 were for the most part aware that the wage increases\nof that year were only the prelude to other wage adjustments to come, so long\nas the war boom persisted. While some employers were content to deal with,\nlabor on an opportunistic basis, many companies\u2014particularly the large\nones\u2014had at this date already attempted to formulate definite, though\nadaptable, wage policies for the duration, Wage policies of companies with\nlarge defense orders were, of course, dictated largely by the need for attract-\n\n\"The writer is indebted to the Social Science Research Council for making possible a\nfield survey which covered 55 companies in 15 industry groups, including such large con-\ncerns as General Motors and U.

Agriculture has placed itself at a disadvantage in\nits dealings with the industrial section of the economy by assuming an addi-\ntional responsibility. Even though agricultural workers have moved into in-\ndustrial production during periods of expansion (when they were needed\nmost on the farm), these same workers have returned to the land when they\nwere discharged by industry during the periods of economic contraction and\ndepression (when they were needed least on the farm).\n\nThat this responsibility in agriculture was and is based on a family rather\nthan a legal relationship does not remove the fact that the responsibility has\ntended to maintain the real income produced and the employment of the\nfactors of production in agriculture when other sections of the economy were\ndeclining. As long as agriculture was the dominant section of the economy\nand thereby provided the major portion of the real income of the economy,\nthis responsibility tended to mitigate the worst results of an industrial con-\ntraction. The disappearance of the frontier and the dominance of industrially\nproduced goods now places the problem squarely on the doorstep of the\nindustrial section of the economy.\n\nIt is true that agriculture has not prospered in recent times and that farm-\ning is a way of life as well as a business enterprise, which gives agriculture a\nstaying power that the industrial enterprise does not have. Nevertheless, the\nfact that the farmer has made a living while he assumed an additional respon-\nsibility under the worst possible circumstances\u2014alone\u2014should indicate that\nenterprises in general could prosper if the responsibility was universally\nadopted to increase the flexibility of the economy and thereby maintain pro-\nduction and employment in the entire economy.\n\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Gordon F.

In Section I, several\nalternatives to subsidies are explored, since they may be preferable to a\nsubsidy program in particular areas. Under certain conditions, a rise\nof prices might be the lesser evil.' Again, large price increases might be\naverted even in the absence of subsidies. The government has used with\ngreat success the techniques of averaging costs and differential pricing.\nIf these techniques are not practical and a rise of prices is to be avoided,\nthe government may then have to resort to subsidies.\n\nThe objectives of subsidies are considered in Section II. One ob-\njective is a reduction in the cost of living or a moderation in its rate\nof increase. Another and related objective is the prevention of a rise\nof prices for all supplies to a level set by marginal costs. By paying to\nproducers or suppliers in the form of a subsidy the excess of marginal\ncosts over average costs, the government can encourage additional out-\nput and yet prevent a rise of marginal costs from being translated into\na corresponding increase in prices for all units.\n\nThe more important categories of subsidy procedures are examined\nin Section III. (1) Government purchase and resale has been used\nwidely in the industrial area; but not sufficiently for the purpose of\nreducing the cost of living. (2) In subsidizing additional costs involved\nin high cost and additional output, the government has, in various\nways, stimulated output. (3) A disguised subsidy is involved in the\nassumption by the government of certain services which private enter-\nprise is unable or unwilling to perform at a reasonable price, and in\nthe sale of these services by the government, under certain conditions,\nbelow costs.\n\n* As the Director of the Office of Export-Import Price Control for over a year and a\nhalf, Mr. Harris has had considerable experience in the operational part of subsidy pro-\ngrams. Many subsidy programs, of which this paper gives the theoretical background,\nwere worked out in his office.

Blair's review' of my Industrial Concentration and Price Inftexibility\n(Washington, American Council on Public Affairs, 1942) merits rebuttal\npartially on the grounds outlined.\n\nThe reviewer has concentrated upon two chapters of the book dealing with\nthe flexibility of prices relative to costs. The first of these, Chapter V, which is\nconcerned with methods, is somewhat tedious, and if the reviewer passed over\nit in haste he can hardly be blamed. Unfortunately, his criticism of the\nresults of the statistical study, Chapter VI, is largely invalidated by what\nwas written in the preceding chapter on methods.\n\nThe object of the investigation contained in these two chapters should\nbe clarified. It was to determine whether previous studies of the relation-\nship between concentration and price inflexibility (in the sense of amplitude\nof price decline during depression) had ignored variables other than concen-\ntration which would account for inflexible prices. The most important of\nthese other variables which suggests itself immediately but which had gen-\nerally been ignored is variation in prime costs.\n\nIf one industry experiences a drop of twenty per cent in its prime cost in a given period\nand another experiences a rise of ten per cent, it would be unreasonable to charge that,\nbecause the average price of the products of the first industry fell twenty per cent and\nthe average price of the products of the second remained the same, the second industry's\n\nprice was inflexible in view of the changes which occurred.

Caught between falling raw material prices and a diminish-\ning volume of exports, many Latin American countries found them-\nselves faced with the virtual impossibility of continuing their debt\nservice. Chile's exports in 1932, for instance, amounted to no more\nthan 500 million pesos, as. against 2,280 million in 1929, while the\nservice of her foreign debt required 160 million pesos for interest and\namortization, and 440 million on account of short-term maturities.'\nThus, in Chile's case there was hardly an alternative to at least tem-\nporary suspension of payments.\n\nCritics of our foreign lending during the 1920's have frequently\nclaimed that overoptimism, if not downright irresponsibility, on the\npart of the underwriters was the major cause of the defaults. Without,\nhowever, attempting to deny that insufficient care was exercised, and\nthat Latin American countries were encouraged to borrow excessively,\none may question whether these factors were decisive.

But this is an argument, not\nfor abandoning the welfare attitude in monetary discussions, but rather for\nbringing the existing ends to the surface and broadening their scope.\n\nAgainst the present proposal it might be argued that welfare economics\nwould become essentially a defense of the status quo since all existent social\npolicies represent in some sense the collective will? Protective tariffs, for\nexample, have been legislated for three generations by democratically elected\nrepresentatives; hence tariffs are a part of our society's ends. But this argu-\nment is defective on two counts. First, a great many economic policies do\nnot in any important sense represent the collective will; silver legislation and\ndegraded flashlight lamps will serve as examples. Second, and vastly more\nimportant, specific policies are usually means\u2014in many cases mistaken ones,\nthe economist may argue\u2014and not ends. The Iowa farmer votes for protection\nbecause he does not know its effects on his economic position, not because\nhe likes high tariff walls 5er se. Of course this is not strictly true, but to deny\nit categorically is to deny a significant r\u00f3le to rational discussion in the forma-\ntion of social policy.\n\nNevertheless it does seem true that the welfare economics here proposed\nhas a conservative bias. In the nature of things the wideness with which any\nend is accepted depends upon the specificity of that end. As compared with\nthe (unknown!) distribution of income in 1939, almost everyone would agree\nthat the desired end is a more equal distribution. But, assigning some conven-\ntional measure of inequality, the acceptance of this end shrinks as the goal\nof equality is approached. Witness the less than unanimous approval of the\n$25,000 ceiling on salaries. Until the distant day when the welfare economist\ncan assign quantitative orders of importance to various (degrees of fulfill-\nment of) ends, therefore, it seems necessary for him to recommend only\ngradual changes of policy in many areas. This formal conclusion could, I\nthink, be defended on substantive grounds as the only approach which is\ncompatible with democratic social processes.\n\nA century ago John Stuart Mill observed: *Political Economy does not of\nitself instruct how to make a nation rich; but whoever would be qualified to\njudge of the means of making a nation rich, must first be a political econo-\nmist.\" His statement implies the still fundamental and unfulfilled task of\nthe economist.\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n", "359\n", "1943]\n"], "4": ["* The Structure of Social Action (New York, 1937), p. 395.

Com-\npare the bizarre approach of the new welfare economics: it would be possible\nto recompense manufacturers for not degrading the quality of their products.\n\nSecond, as evidence of the fact that an applied ethics is already in com-\nmon use in economics one may suggest the case of monetary theory.

Ax Alternative\n\nOne may still argue along somewhat different lines that the economist may\nnevertheless put behind his recommendations of policy what little prestige\nthe Office of Price Administration has left him. The fundamental point of\nthis alternative approach may be developed by a brief examination of the\nthesis implicit in the newer welfare economics: that all ends other than\nmaximization of income are value judgments (or, in some sense, more de-\nbatable value judgments) and accordingly unsuited for scientific purposes.\n\nThe familiar admonition not to argue over differences in tastes leads not\nonly to dull conversations but also to bad sociology. It is one thing to recog-\nnize that we cannot frove, by the usual tests of adequacy of proof, the supe-\nriority of honesty over deceit or the desirability of a more equal income dis-\ntribution. But it is quite another thing to conclude that therefore ends of\ngood policy are beyond the realm of scientific discussion.\n\nFor surely the primary requisite of a working social system is a consensus\non ends. The individual members of the society simply must agree upon the\nmajor ends which that society is to seek. If any large share of the population\nactively disagrees with the society's ends, and in particular if it believes that\nthe system is unfair by that group's criteria, the social system will surely\ndisintegrate, probably with violence.\n\nThis view is almost axiomatic in modern social theory; a society is in fact\ndefined in some such terms as *a group of individuals held together by a\ncommon dominant purpose and functioning as an entity.\"5 It would be easy\n\n*W.

The free trade argument may col-\nlapse if one desires also (the decreasingly academic objective of) military\nself-sufficiency or a prosperous, independent peasantry or continuance of a\nparticular party in power. Maximum income is never the sole end of policy.\n\nSecond, how could we discover who the thieves are, and how much they\ncould steal, and from whom? But similarly, how can we discover\u2014except in\nthe simplest of textbook cases\u2014who is injured by an economic policy and to\nwhat extent? Theory and statistics are too weak to yield really defensible\nestimates of individual gains and losses. Until the principle of recompensation\nbecomes capable of realistic application it must necessarily appear to be little\nmore than an analytical trick,\n\nFinally, will not the marginal propensity to steal rise under such a system?\nBut again, will not an industry have a claim to recompensation for the benefits\nit would have received if it had asked for a tariff or for a higher tariff?\n\nTo the one formal objection, that maximization of income is not the sole\n\"economic\" end of policy, at least one lesser objection of the same type may\nbe added. There is no reason why a change in policy may not lead to a change\nin the indifference curve systems and then even the formal validity of the\ntheorems is irrelevant. For example, if free trade leads to more farmers, who\nhave different utility functions from urban workers, it becomes impossible to\nstate that they are better or worse off than they were, compensated or not.\n\nOne may therefore conclude that the new welfare economics has been rather\npretentious.\n\n\"UT 4.\n"], "2": ["exchange (including production) or distribution. Nothing scientific can be\nsaid about distribution, but in appraising exchange policies we may make use\nof two well-known theorems:\n\n1. The marginal rates of substitution between commodities must be equal\nfor all individuals. If this is not so, an exchange of goods will help one person\nwithout injuring the other?\n\n2.

If this condition is not met it is pos-\nsible to reallocate resources in such a way as to increase outputs of some\ngoods without decreasing outputs of any.?\n\nIf these theorems are applied to the problem of international trade, for\nexample, they show that income (of all countries together) is maximized by\nfree trade. If landlords are injured by a repeal of Corn Laws, they can be\nrecompensed and there will still be an unencumbered increase in income re-\nsulting from the adoption of free trade. Thus, without facing the ethical ques-\ntion of whether landlords' income is more or less important than consumers'\nincome, one can conclude that free trade is desirable.

Consider theft; our\npresent policy toward this means of livelihood probably has adverse effects\non the national income. Prevention of theft and punishment of thieves involve\nsubstantial expenditures for policemen, courts, jails, locks, insurance salesmen,\nand the like.

A similar argument could, I\nthink, be adduced to show that wars should be fought with checkbooks.\n\nThe replies to this reductio are obvious enough. It may not be quite so\nobvious that they are all applicable to the (typical) case of free trade, so the\nanalogy will be pressed.

But the decline in the published figures (i.e., base price plus\nquantity extras) between the same size groups is only 8.2 per cent. In other\nwords, the decline in the published quantity extras comprises only a small\npart of the total decline shown in the monograph. This generalization, as may\nbe noted from the table, is true of all the other products analyzed in the\nmonograph, with the exception of steel plates for which the published quantity\nextras on very small shipments are comparatively high.\n\nFor Dr. Stigler's contention still to be tenable, it would be necessary that\nthe remainder of the decline in the mill net (i.e., that which is not due to the\nsmall decrease in the published quantity extras) be caused by a decline in\npublished quality extras. The assumption, however, that large buyers generally\npurchase steel of lower quality than small buyers simply has no justification\nin fact. Rather, the converse tends to be true. In the monograph, it was pointed\nout that ^. , . quality demands on large orders are frequently very exacting\"\n(p. 23). This represented a considerable understatement. The practice of the\nautomobile industry in demanding, and obtaining cold-rolled sheet and strip\nof extraordinarily exacting quality specifications is a well-known case in point.\n\nThus it does not appear that a decline either in published quantity extras\nor in published quality extras, or in both, could be responsible for more than\na small proportion of the decline shown in the mill net figures.\n\nThis indicates the existence of hidden concessions from extras, and it was\nconcessions of this type which were regarded in the monograph as discrimina-\ntory. But Dr. Stigler argues that these concessions might be justifiable on cost\ngrounds and therefore would not be discriminatory.\n\nThis may or may not be true. However, this argument that hidden conces-\nsions are not discriminatory if they reflect decreases in costs would indicate,\nif such were the case, that the published extras are discriminatory. In addi-\ntion, the argument is rather academic since no cost data by size of ship-\nment are available (or likely to be available because of the tremendous prob-\nlems of statistical compilation involved) and since it appears unlikely that\ndecreases in costs would be equal to the declines in the price figures, as shown\nin the monograph. One reason that the declines in costs would probably be\nless than the declines in prices is the fact that each shipment usually does not\nrepresent a separate rolling, since it is the practice of steel mills to group\ntogether a number of qualitatively similar orders which are then run as one\nrolling.\n\nFinally, in trying to make the point that price discrimination might not\nbe indicated by the data in the monograph, Dr. Stigler overlooks the declines\nshown in the base prices. These declines can only be regarded as discrimina-\ntory, since for a given product the base price is supposed to be the same for\nall buyers, regardless of the quantity or quality of the purchase,\n\nJouw M.

Second, the spend-\nings tax tends to immobilize savings already made. Especially if rates\nare sharply graduated, individuals with substantial savings are likely to\nhesitate to use them for consumption if a large proportion of this spend-\ning is absorbed as tax. Third, both in the higher and lower income\nbrackets income tax rates can become so high as to reduce incentive to\nproduce. A spendings tax avoids the difficulty by substituting a spend-\nings base for an income base so that marginal income tax rates need\nnot become high enough to exert this effect on incentive. Fourth, the\nincome tax is not sufficiently free from inequities to justify further\nimportant increases in rates without refinements in the concepts of\ntaxable income and the taxpayer unit, and in the rate structure, which\nwill require much time and effort to achieve. The enactment of a spend-\nings tax as a supplement to the income tax would make it possible to\nminimize the effect of some of these inequities because at a certain point\nthe tax base would be changed from income to spendings.\n\n\"The first and second of these arguments in favor of the spendings tax\noffer a means of minimizing price inflation, and therefore constitute\nthe primary reason, in the economic circumstances which have prevailed\nup to and through the winter of 1942-43, for urging the adoption of the\nspendings tax.

If a public debt creates no burden on\nsociety because the cost of servicing the debt is offset by an interest-income-\nstream, the same is true of a private debt. In the case of both private and\npublic borrowing the funds may be obtained by the borrower from either of\ntwo sources: from an active saver or custodian of saved funds, such as a\nsavings bank, loan company, or even a commercial bank, or from deposits\ncreated within the commercial banking system.

Perhaps we can't learn enough to manage it, but I, for\none, am not yet prepared to admit that democracy is dead.\n\n'There are two approaches to the national debt which I should like to refer\nto as \"theological.\" One is to deny that there can be any possible burden. I\nsubmit that this is nonsense. The other is to dwell upon the burden, at the\n'expense of the benefits, and to treat the national debt as if it were an evil in\nitself to be avoided at all hazards. Mr. Ratchford, I feel, inclines perhaps too\nmuch to this latter view. The third, and practical, approach is to recognize\nthe difficulties, but to consider them in the light of the benefits, and to treat\nthe debt as being iz itself neither good nor bad, but only an instrument of\npolicy along with many others.\n\nAs I write, the 5 per cent \"forced saving\" victory tax is being debated.\nThis eminently sound method of preventing war inflation would have been\nadopted long ago but for a deeply rooted fear of debt per se. If Mr. Ratch-\nford's article serves, at this juncture, to reinforce uncritical prejudices re-\ngarding debts its effects may be very regrettable. I hope, however, that it will\nmerely serve to put an end to further fine-spun debates about the existence\nof a burden, and to focus our attention upon the practical issues and practical\nalternatives at stake.\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Emerson P.
