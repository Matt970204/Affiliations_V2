Yet as\nlong as we have a sharply progressive personal income tax which fails to\nreach undistributed corporate earnings an important part of currently pro-\nduced income can escape taxation indefinitely. Corporate earnings cannot be\nignored, therefore, without a drastic redefinition of personal income to in-\nclude annual changes in the net worth of individuals, and this would impose\ntoo serious an administrative problem to be lightly contemplated.\n\nThere is a simple way out. It is to tax the entire income of the corporation,\nincluding that paid out as interest on long. and short-term obligations, at\nthe maximum rate applied on personal incomes with full credit to the in-\ndividual for the tax paid by the corporation on his behalf. The individual, of\ncourse, would have to include in his gross income his share of the earnings\nof the corporation before the tax. Assumption of the tax by the corporation\nshould be prohibited.\n\nUnder this arrangement a stockholder would be informed, for example, that\nhis share of the taxable earnings of a given corporation was $100, that,\nsay, $60 had been paid to the United States Treasury, that $20 had been\nplaced to reserves, and that a check for the balance, $20 was enclosed, to-\ngether with a certificate showing the amount of the tax. The certificate should\nbe made fully negotiable and should bear interest. The taxpayer would then\nfigure his taxable income on the basis of $100 received from the corporation,\nfigure his liability and pay the tax in the required installments in the event\nthat he sold the certificate. If he elected to hold the certificate, he could use it\nas an offset or as the basis for a claim for a refund in the event of an over-\npayment.\n\nThis method of taxing a corporation would require some changes in the\npersonal income tax. One would be to abandon the double tax structure made\nup of a normal and surtax in favor of a single schedule of rates applicable\nto net taxable income. The maximum rate should be brought down as rapidly\nas possible to a figure that would not paralyze risk taking. Fifty per cent\nseems to me to be the appropriate maximum applicable on the fraction of\nincome above, say, $500,000. This maximum should remain unchanged over\nextended periods of time, but whenever it was changed the corporation with-\nholding tax should be changed accordingly. To meet the changing require-\nments of government and the changing requirements of the economy in the\ndifferent phases of the business cycle, the beginning and intermediate rates\nshould be varied, as well as certain excise taxes.

But within limits which are set by broad historical circum-\nstances the economist can play a significant r\u00f3le in the world of affairs, and\nthis Lord Keynes has done. The difference between the theorist and politician\nis not, as von Mering contends, that the politician enjoys an innate superiority\nover the theorist, and still less that the theorist is more powerful than the\npolitician, as Keynes contends. The difference is that the politician must\nlive in the real world if he is to survive. The theorist need not live in the\nreal world, but he must do so if his theory is to survive.\n\nDuprEev DirLLARD\n"], "6": ["1944] COMMUNICATIONS 861\n\nfrom a theory by knowing from what the theory started. This is not reasoning\nin a circle. It is merely one way of saying that theory and practice are\ninseparable, and that policy is psychologically prior to theory.\n\n'The logical continuity between Parts II and III of von Mering's article\nappears to rest on an exaggerated distinction between \"theorist\" and *poli-\ntician.\" The theorist is viewed first and most importantly as one who elabo-\nrates those aspects of policy to which his theory leads him. Thus we find\nvon Mering saying *. . . Keynesian theory advocates a policy.\" Though\nKeynes's interest in social reform is mentioned, there is no suggestion in\nvon Mering's analysis that a certain theory is articulated because the prag-\nmatically selective perspective of the theorist leads him in that direction.\nIt is easier to agree with von Mering that the politician has little interest in\ntheory per se. The politician likes and dislikes theories because they are or\nare not congenial to the kind of policies for which he stands. The net out-\ncome is popularity for those theories which are most in keeping with political\ntrends. But the world of policy is prior to the world of theory not only in\nthe sense that theories which are to survive must conform to underlying\npolitical trends, but also in the sense that the thought of \"theorists\" represents\na more sophisticated way of thinking about policy. It is commonplace that\nthe \"practical\" man with his characteristic repugnance for \"theory\" does not\nescape theory, but merely succeeds in fooling himself and perhaps others by\nconcealing his generalizations. In von Mering's context a better distinction\nthan that between \"theorists\" and \"politicians\" would be between *good\"\ntheorists and one tvpe of bad\" theorists, and between articulate and con-\ncealed generalizations.\n\nConcretely, in the case of Keynes we have a theorist who has been as\nvitally concerned with policy as any other living economist. He had plans\nfor revising the Versailles Treaty, for monetary reform in the twenties, for\nrelieving unemployment in 1929, a *plan to save the world\" at the World\nEconomic Conference in 1933, a plan to \"pay for the war\" in 1939, and\nmore recently a plan for international monetary stabilization as a phase of\npost-war reconstruction. A study of Keynes's thought in the years in which\nthese writings were appearing shows clearly that his practical concern has\ndirected his theoretical emphasis. Keynes the man of policy has given vitality\nto Keynes the man of theory. He has had ideas in the sense of Dewey's \"plans\nof action.\" Because he was so vitally interested in policy he worked out his\nnew general theory as an argument for his policy. Thus he drew economic\ntheory back to the path of realistic policy.\n\nIt is true, as Dr. von Mering says, the policy for which Keynes stands\nwas already becoming accepted by statesmen and politicians. Here Keynes's\nposition as an interventionist is analogous to Adam Smith's position as a\nspokesman for laissez-faire. Smith criticized mercantilist theory and policy\nin terms of a policy which was already becoming accepted. Likewise Ricardo\ncriticized the corn laws with a new economic theory which arose from\nincreasingly popular free trade ideas. In spite of bitter criticism and great\nresistance from high academic authorities, Keynes is winning a substantial\ntriumph.

Few economists would\ndissent from the proposition that if economics is to be a science, there must\nbe an appeal to facts in testing hypotheses.!? Unfortunately the kind of theory\narticulated by economists has too frequently remained of a purely formal\nnature, and on this level propositions defy an appeal to facts. If there is to\nbe empirical verification, some kind of operations, i.e., some policy, behavior,\nor plan of action must be involved either explicitly or implicitly. Thought\nis directed by the necessity of action. If we start with theory, we should try\nto discover its operational meaning, i.e., the operations necessary in order to\nput the theory into practice. After discovering the meaning of the theory in\nthese terms, we may proceed to investigate its validity by an appeal to facts.!?\n\nDr. von Mering's article suffers from the lack of a clear-cut distinction\nbetween meaning of theory and workability of program. Part II is actually\n\u00e0 criticism of the workability of Keynes's program rather than a criticism\nof Keynes's theoretical concepts. Keynes's theory has its meaning in terms\nof a program of reform. One should ask what policy is the counterpart of a\ngiven theory. When von Mering points out that policies other than those\nadvocated by Keynes might follow from Keynes's theory, he is indulging in\nanalyses which have no relevance so far as Keyenes's theory is concerned.\nIn brief, I am contending that these general Keynesian concepts have a\nspecific practical meaning, discoverable by the operational approach, and\nunless this is realized and taken specifically into consideration in evaluating\nand criticizing his theory, we are in danger of wandering all over the place\nand probably will succeed only in replacing the criticized theorist's ideas on\npolicy withour our own ideas about what is better policy. This does a theory\nthe injustice of not criticizing it on its own ground. Von Mering is guilty\nof wandering when he points out that fear of changes in the rules of the\ncapitalistic system may increase investors! preference for liquidity, and again\nwhen he says that the governmental intervention suggested by Keynes may\nlower the marginal efficiency of capital, reduce the inducement to invest and\nthus defeat the main purpose, which is to increase total employment. Von\nMering may be correct in these contentions regarding the workability of\nKeynes's program. But that is not the point here. The point is that he raises\nthe wrong question when he asks, *Does the suggested policy follow neces-\nsarily from the theory?\" It seems doubtful that any policy follows necessarily\nfrom any set of abstract theoretical concepts.

In pursuance of this end a powerful monetary authority\nmust be established. Whereas the \"classical\" economists (Professor Pigou,\netc.) explain unemployment in terms of too-high wage rates, Keynes explains\nunemployment in terms of too-high interest rates. But Keynes's practical sense\nIs too strong to lead him to attach sole importance to the interest rate and so\nwe have the parallel stress on the marginal efficiency of capital, as mentioned\nabove.*\n\nThis illustrates, if only inadequately, what is meant by finding the opera-\ntional definitions of theoretical concepts such as the propensity to consume,\nthe marginal efficiency of capital and liquidity-preference. Their meanings\nare found in the modifications, the \"differences\" they make. This represents\nan attempt to apply to economics the pragmatic maxim of Charles Peirce,?\nproposed as a method for \"clarifying ideas, eliminating specious problems,\nand unmasking mystification and obscurantism hiding under the cloak of\napparent profundity.\"? John Dewey and his followers have elaborated\nPeirce's fundamental maxim into a philosophy of scientific method. While\nphilosophers can suggest useful methods of procedure, the task of making\nthe appropriate application to economics remains the task of economists. For\nexample, measurement is less important for the operational approach in\neconomics than in modern physics.'^ The operational concept, which is used\nhere to explain theories as plans of action in the sense that Dewey defines\nideas as plans of action,\" may also be used in a more descriptive sense, e.g.,\nwe may define an institution as what an institution does.\n\n*It might appear that the liquidity-preference theory has meaning in terms of the non-\ncontrollability of interest rates rather than the reverse, as I have contended. Here one must\ndistinguish between the present stage of economic development in which Keynes believes\nthere is still considerable room for stimulating investment by reducing interest rates via\nmonetary policies, and a future stage in which he believes liquidity-preference will set a\nlimit below which no ordinary policy can reduce interest rates further. It is in this future\nstage that Keynes suggests some proposal like stamped money may be the answer to the\nproblem. Cf.

The operational approach has come to play an important r\u00f3le in\nmodern philosophy and natural science, but it has been used hardly at all in a\nself-conscious manner in economics. While no attempt will be made here to\nexplore the full implications of this approach to economic concepts, a few\nsuggestions may serve to indicate how such an approach might be applied to\nKeynes's theory.\n\nKeynes tells us the three main gaps in economic theory have been \"the\nanalysis of the Propensity to Consume, the definition of the Marginal Effi-\nciency of Capital and the theory of the Rate of Interest.\"? Around these\nconcepts center the distinctive aspects of Keynes's theory. The operational\nmeaning of these three independent variables can be discovered easily in\nspecific policies advocated by Keynes. Each points to some aspect or sector of\nthe economy which, in Keynes's view, should be influenced to alleviate the\noutstanding fault of modern economic society, unemployment.\n\nIn Keynes's theory the propensity to consume has its most important\noperational meaning in terms of reducing inequalities in the distribution of\nincome and wealth. A more equal distribution would increase the demand for\nconsumers! goods from a given level of national income and thus induce a\nlarger volume of employment and income. The specific means of achieving\nthis aim is through highly progressive taxation in the form of income taxes and\ndeath duties.\n\n'The chief characteristic of the marginal efficiency of capital is its great\ninstability. It is so unstable that at times it may fall so low that no reduction\nin the rate of interest can induce sufficient investment. To alleviate the con-\nsequences of instability in the marginal efficiency of private capital Keynes\nadvocates government direction of total investment, including a public works\nprogram.* In addition, since the stock market is partly responsible for the\ninstability of the marginal efficiency of capital, Keynes recommends a stock\ntransfer tax to keep speculators out of the stock market so that it may function\nin the interest of enterprise rather than speculation.\n\nThe uniqueness of the Keynesian theory of the rate of interest runs in terms\nof the importance of controlling the rate of interest. Here the novel concept is\nliquidity-preference. The essence of liquidity-preference for the speculative\nmotive is that people prefer to hold their wealth in the form of money because\nthey anticipate or fear that the rate of interest may rise in the future to such\nan extent that the loss in capital value from the higher rate of interest will\nmore than offset the temporary gains in the form of annual yields at the exist-\ning low rate of interest.

M. Keynes's General Theory of Employment. Von Mering's\nprincipal conclusion is that political trends largely determine important new\ndevelopments in economic theory. The adaptation of theory to political trends\nmay take place merely by shifting the emphasis on one or the other of the\nvarious data in the economic system. Without attempting to belittle the\nachievements of Lord Keynes, von Mering attributes the great triumph of the\nGeneral Theory to the fact that it lends scientific support to the important\npolitical trends of the time, whereas the body of doctrine Keynes attacks,\nso-called \"classical\" theory, is often out of line with the necessities of present-\nday economic interventionism. Von Mering expresses surprise that Keynes, in\nreferring to the r\u00f3le of ideas in history, does not mention Pareto's view con-\ncerning the relation between nonlogical sentiments and logical derivations. I\nam surprised that in a discussion of methodology dealing particularly with the\nrelation of theory to practice von Mering does not even mention American\npragmatism. In the following discussion some contributions of pragmatism are\napplied to the problem of the relation of economic theory to policy in the\ncontext in which von Mering discusses it.\n\nWith Dr. von Mering's general conclusion that vital new developments in\neconomic theory arise in close association with problems of economic policy,\nthe writer is in complete agreement. One need only look to the great figures in\nthe histoy of economic thought to find substantial verification of this general\nconclusion. My fundamental criticism of Dr. von Mering's position is that in\nPart III of his article he concludes that policy is prior to theory, whereas he\nanalyzes Keynes's theory in Part II as though theory were prior to policy. The\nrange of consideration is broader in Part III than in Part II, but there is\nnothing in the breadth of consideration which calls for a shift in ground so far\nas the priority of policy is concerned. The following quotations indicate that\nvon Mering assigns priority to Keynes's theory in the sense that he looks on\nKeynes's policy as something which should follow from his theory. In opening\nPart II he poses the question to be answered: \"Does the suggested [ Keynes's]\npolicy follow necessarily from the theory?\" and again, \"The question arises\nwhether, within the framework of the Keynesian theory, the measures just\nmentioned are the only ones to assure full employment\"; and at the close of\nthis section, *. . . the Keynesian theory . . . advocates a policy. . . .\"? I do not\nmean that one cannot start with theory and proceed to an analysis of policy.\nIn fact the following discussion will suggest what seems to be the appropriate\nmanner of doing this. The weakness of von Mering's position lies in the way in\nwhich he relates a particular theory to the theorist's policy. His approach fails\nto consider that paralleling his proposition that politicians prevail over\ntheorists is the no less significant proposition that important new developments\nin economic theory arise specifically from the thought of those who are them-\nselves vitally concerned with problems of contemporary policy. This is not the\nplace to demonstrate the general validity of this latter thesis, but it will be\nshown to apply to Keynes's theory, the particular subject of von Mering's\ninvestigation.\n\n?

Soviet\ntrusts, cartels and combines, as well as the individual enterprises within\n.them, are regulated according to strict principles of cost accounting.\nPrices of commodities are based upon total costs of production, in-\ncluding wages, raw materials, administrative costs, amortization charges\nand interest plus planned profit and the various taxes imposed as\nrevenue for the maintenance of the state.

The mere fact\nthat an increase is justifiable on social or morale grounds does not necessarily\nmitigate the possible inflationary character of this increase. Some increases in\nrates or earnings are desirable and necessary in spite of possible inflationary\neffects. Properly administered incentive plans might be a good example, where\ngreater production is encouraged by giving the worker an opportunity of\nincreasing his earnings as he increases his output\u2014though incentive plans may\nhave inflationary implications where they are used in plants producing tanks\nor guns. In the same sense, the social and morale value of shift differentias,\nvacations, sick leave, and certain other practices is indisputable.\n\nBut to confuse these matters with the questions of inflationary effect is to\nentertain a fallacy, albeit a popular one.\n\nWith respect to Mr. Derber's last paragraph, it should be said that eulogies\nare in order for many aspects of the Board's program\u2014indeed, for its signifi-\ncant contribution in the price control program, which on the whole has been\nnotably successful in inflation control by comparison with our experiences in\nthe last war\u2014but thereby hangs another article.\n"], "2": ["THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "576\n", "576 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW [SEPTEMBER\n\nno attempt has been made to isolate completely fluctuations in wage rates.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics figures on increases in average hourly earnings\ninclude such factors as premium pay for overtime and night work, incentive\nplans, upgradings, inter-industry shifts in the distribution of manpower,\nchanges in the composition of the work force, etc. In my paper I cited a study\nby H. M. Douty in the Monthly Labor Review of November, 1943, in which\nhe attempts to correct the BLS figures for overtime premium pay and shifts in\nmanpower distribution. The corrected figures show an increase in average\nhourly earnings (manufacturing) of 5.2 per cent from October, 1942, to July,\n1943 (the first 9 months of the stabilization program), as compared with a\n7.8 per cent increase during the previous 9-month period. Although these\nfigures include the other factors cited above, Mr. Douty states that they repre-\nSent *an approximation of changes in average basic wage rates.\" Since Mr.\nDouty is employed by the National War Labor Board, it is to be presumed\nthat he is conversant with the \"official\" views on these matters.\n\nMr. Derber's second comment is in reference to my statement of the man-\ndate given to the Board by Congress and the President. Exception is taken\nto use of the phrase \"rare and unusual.\" Let us examine the only bases on\nwhich increases were to be approved under this mandate.\n\nFirst, maladjustments, or the Little Steel formula: When the country as a\nwhole is considered, the great bulk of plants in manufacturing had effected\nincreases of 15 per cent or more prior to the wage stabilization order.\n\nSecond, inequalities or gross inequities: Although this criterion was abused\nto some extent in the early months of the Board, the November 6, 1942, state-\nment of policy issued by the National Board was rather strict in its interpre-\ntation. Under the present bracket policy, the bracket minimum, which is\ngenerally the terminal point for wage increases, is usually set, not at the\nmidpoint or weighted average of rates being paid for a particular job in a\nparticular locality, but 10 per cent below the weighted average, or at the first\nsignificant cluster of going rates. The *stragglers\" are thus eliminated. Hence,\npresumably only these relatively low wage firms, which would represent a\nminority, would be able to secure approval for wage rate increases.\n\n\"Third, substandards of living: The percentage of workers falling into this\ncategory would depend upon the definition of the term. If $3,000 per year\nwere set as the minimum standard wage, the great bulk of Region IV workers\nwould be considered as living at substandard levels. If substandard were de-\nfined in relation to industry and area patterns, a considerably smaller per-\ncentage of workers would fall into the substandard category!\n\nFourth, prosecution of the war: This has been so interpreted as to apply\nonly to those \"rare and unusual\" cases certified to the Board by another war\nagency.\n\nMr. Derber's third point, with respect to the inflationary character of\ncertain socially desirable practices, is in the same category with the usual plea\nof the individual applicant to the Board who contends that his particular pro-\nposal for increases could not possibly be inflationary because it would mean only\n2 cents to a hundred people!

Hence a political frontier lies between production\nand consumption, between sellers and buyers, between the two parties\nto the bargain by which the industry is carried on. As a result there\nis no correspondence between the political control and the thing to be\ncontrolled. Accordingly an attack on the problem can not begin with\nobjectives and pass on to policies and program; it must, in addition,\ndiscover or contrive an agency or agencies of regulation.\n\nIf each producer were a separate business unit, nationality might\nnot be a confusing factor. For, tariffs and customs restrictions apart,\nregulation might be left to the market, where political allegiance is an\nirrelevance. But the very fact that the purchasers are under another\nflag tends to remove the legal barriers\u2014and to weaken the moral\nscruples\u2014which stand in the way of collective action by the producers.\nIt makes it easy for them to respond to the \"felt need\" for association,\nto make secure their business, to stabilize their prices, to fix their terms\nof sale.

In the\nlong run these were well paid for their efforts but, because their number was\nsmall, their entrance into the ranks of business did little more than to fill\nvacancies left by the retirement of old timers.\n\nOutside entrepreneurs are not attracted to the Territory for two reasons:\n(1) many of them are not aware of the profit opportunities there; and (2) few\nof them have an acquaintance with the environmental conditions existing there\nunder which they would have to operate. The fact that Alaskan towns are\nsmall (the largest city has a population of 7,000), widely separated, and not\nconnected by modern highways renders the region unattractive to chain stores.\nAs a result, merchants in the various communities have been able to maintain\nmarkups on a higher level than more competitive conditions would have per-\nmitted.\n"], "5": ["The substance of the above analysis is that while transportation costs,\nwages, rent, and interest costs of retailers in Alaska do demonstrate the neces-\nsity for prices somewhat higher than those in Seattle, they do not demonstate\nthe necessity for prices as high as those actually charged. The implication is\nthat entrepreneural earnings per dollar of investment are Aigker in Alaska than\nin Seattle.\n\nAlaskan merchants are not aware of the fact that their earnings are higher\nthan those of Seattle merchants. For one thing, their concept of normal is\nhigher than the concept held by retailers outside. But more important is the fact\nthat in their thinking they do not differentiate carefully between \"expenses\"\nand \"capital expenditures.\" It is quite common for Alaskan entrepreneurs to\nstart a new enterprise on a very small scale and then to finance expansion by\nthe re-investment of earnings. On the basis of orthodox accounting, the entre-\npreneur makes an enormous rate of profit on his investment each year, but in\nAlaska it is customary to enter the cost of such expansion on the books as a\ncurrent cost of operation.5 As a result of this practice, the books of an enter-\nprise may show small profits year after year while the proprietor actually is\nbecoming wealthier and wealthier. Such accounting procedure is considered\nto be quite proper in Alaska.\n\nThe normality of high rates of profit is probably historic in origin. Most of\nthose emigrating to Alaska in the nineties went there to search for gold and\nmany found it. To such, prices meant nothing so that there was little consumer\nopposition to high prices. On the other hand, the entrepreneurs who entered\nthe Territory during the boom times were, for the most part, attracted there\nby the possibilities of making a \"killing\" in a short time. When the boom\nsubsided many of these merchants closed up shop and returned to the states.\nBy this time permanent inhabitants of the Territory had become accustomed\nto paying high prices. The merchants who remained in business kept prices as\nhigh as the traffic would bear and their efforts were aided by the absence of\nnew entrepreneurs. When cheechakoes\u2014newcomers in the Territory\u2014inquire\nabout the high prices, they are given the stock answer, *High transportation\ncosts.\"\n\n\"This raises the question of why new entrepreneurs did not appear to force\nprices down to a competitive level. The answer is not difficult to find. Most\nof the white inhabitants of the Territory were trappers, miners, or fishermen\nwho knew little about the intricacies of operating a retail establishment. The\nnumber of local entrepreneurs was further decreased by the abnormally large\ncapital investment prerequisite to opening a retail establishment of any size.\nThose who accumulated sufficient wealth from gold prospecting to become\nmerchants chose rather to go \"outside\" to live. A few, with more initiative,\n\n*For example, one small business moved to a new location at a cost of $2,500. This\nexpenditure was for a new store front, installation of equipment, etc., and could quite\nproperly have been charged to operations over a period of several years. However, the\ncharges became a part of the costs of operating for the month in which the change was\nmade. Small businesses are not the only ones that pay off their capital investment in a\nsingle accounting period. C. L. Andrews, in The Story of Alaska, cites the example of the\nCopper River & Northwestern Railway constructed at a cost of $20,000,000. It was paid\nfor out of the profits of the first year's copper mining.\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n", "355\n", "1944]\n"], "4": ["week; a waitress in a restaurant will earn $6.00 a day plus tips. But on the\nwhole wages paid in Alaska are seldom twice the wages paid for the same type\nof work in the Seattle area. Even then, a wage rate twice as high as outside\nwould not necessarily mean twice as much labor costs to the merchant since\nAlaskan labor is very efficient and Alaskan retailers are economical in their use\nof labor. Since establishments are small, much of the labor required is pro-\nvided by the proprietor, aided by members of his family. Then, it must be\nremembered, the base to which the markup applies (landed cost) represents a\nsmaller quantity of goods in Alaska than outside, so that less labor service per\ndollar of goods handled is required. AIl of these factors taken together warrant\nthe conclusion that labor costs in Alaska, while higher than those outside, are\nnot as much higher as the higher markups would warrant.\n\nBesides labor, operatings expenses include rent, light and heat, taxes, and\ninterest on investment. It is difficult to compare rents paid by merchants doing\nbusiness under frontier conditions such as exist in Alaska with rents paid by\nmerchants outside. An Alaskan merchant rents floor space, the location and\nappearance of his premises being of secondary importance to him. Thus the\nfact that a building of modern design would command a larger rental in Alaska\nthan outside is largely academic, since most businesses there do not find it\nnecessary to use buildings comparable in attractiveness to those used by out-\nside merchants, When these factors are considered, there is no reason for\nsupposing that rent per unit of merchandise handled is as high in the Territory\nas it is, for example, in Seattle.\n\nExpenses such as light and heat, while somewhat higher in Alaska, do not\nbulk large and so are not significant to aggregate operating expenses. Taxes in\nthe Territory are lower than those in any of the forty-eight states. This leaves\nonly interest on investment.\n\nBecause Alaskan retailers are located so far from their wholesalers, they\nmust make allowances for delays in shipments. They do this by carrying larger\nstocks of goods. These large stocks result in a greater investment per dollar of\nsales than is normal for retailers in the States. For example, a merchant in\nAnchorage told the writer that he has $3.00 invested for each dollar of goods\nhe sells: one in the goods delivered to the customer, another in goods en route\nnorth to replace the goods sold, and a third accompanying an order south. He\nfelt, therefore, that his gross profit on a dollar of goods sold should be three\ntimes greater than the gross profit of a Seattle merchant in order to earn\ninterest charges on the two dollars! additional investment.\n\nObviously distance from Seattle wholesale markets does increase the invest-\nment of Alaskan merchants per dollar of goods sold, but interest charges at\n8 per cent on an extra two dollars! investment only amounts to 174 cents a\nmonth. Thus, assuming a turnover of four times a year as compared, say, to a\nSeattle merchant's turnover of twelve, an Alaskan merchant would only have\nto increase his markup by 4 per cent of cost to compensate for his added\ninvestment.\"\n\n\"Were it not for the time involved in transportation the turnover period in Alaska\nwould be the same or shorter than it is in Seattle due to the fact that most Alaskan mer-\nchants do not stock style goods and to the fact that markets there are sellers! markets.\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "[JUNE\n", "354\n"], "3": ["Sales\nCost of goods sold\n\nGross Profits\nOperating Expenses\n\nNet Profits\n", "Alaskan\n\n$143,750\n100,000\n\n43,750\n25,000\n\n$ 18,750\n", "Outsider\n\n$117,500\n100,000\n\n17,500\n10,000\n\n$ 7,500\n", "*' The mathematical relationships involved in this statement are made less complicated\n\nwhen stated as a hypothetical example.\nPoule Alncbnm\n", "or less than two a half times the cost of operating a similar business in the\nSeattle area.\nWage rates in Alaska are high.

The expression has taken\nthe form of unaffiliated unions on a local, industrial, and national scale.\nSome of these organizations employ the same devices used by their\naffiliated rivals; others scorn such devices and place their faith in a\ncommunity of interest between employer and employee rather than in\nconflict of purposes. In the traditional sense, some of them are not\ntrade unions at all, but depend upon employer good will to secure\ntheir demands. For the most part, however, they are genuinely inde-\npendent of the employer and depend upon their own power in col-\nlective bargaining. Many of them, probably the largest number, have\nnever tested their strength in a strike.\n\nThe railroad brotherhoods (themselves unaffiliated) and the Ameri-\ncan Federation of Labor long dominated the field of trade union activity\nin the United States, and that dominance obscured the fact that\nAmerican workers actually shared many of the notions held by other\ngroups in the population. The loudest voices heard in legislatures and\nacross collective bargaining tables have been those of the AFL, the\nbrotherhoods and, more recently, the CIO. Those voices expressed the\nsame demands, and the essential heterogeneity of the American working\nclass was overlooked because of the apparent unity within the labor\nmovement. The New Deal has changed all that. Given freedom to\nchoose their organizations, American workers have belatedly shown\nthat there are among their numbers men who want to be represented\nby new organizations not subject to the real or imagined shortcomings\nof the old.\n\nAt present nearly a million workers are organized into unaffiliated\ngroups whose very existence is a tacit criticism of the old-line organiza-\ntions.

The fact that the\nnew theory seems to be opposed to the traditional doctrine in almost\nevery respect makes its great success all the more astonishing. The\npresent writer does not intend to elaborate on the various reasons which\ncan be advanced for the high reputation of the new theory, apart from\nits intrinsic value. But a few points may be mentioned briefly which\npossibly serve as an explanation.\n\nMr. Keynes was a professional economist of great fame before he\nwrote his General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. 'The\ntraditional theory, based mainly on the assumption of private com-\npetition and nonintervention of the government, was unwilling to\ntake the institutional arrangements of the late social liberal era, such\nas powerful, government-protected labor unions, and large-scale gov-\nernment expenditure for the unemployed, as unalterable facts. Conse-\nquently, the neoclassical writers could not give a sufficient explana-\ntion, or rather, they could not indicate a proper remedy, for unem-\nployment to all those who believe that the laws and regulations of\nsocial liberalism cannot be restricted but only extended.\n\nEconomists had done research on the lines of the neoclassical school\nfor many years, apparently pushing forward to the limits in many\nspheres of investigation. Te General Theory became a powerful stimu-\nlus to new inquiries in the far-flung regions of economic studies.\nTheorists with the ability or at least with the inclination to argue by\ndeduction, especially with the aid of mathematical analysis, found\na fertile, almost inexhaustible new field of speculation and \"pure\" rea-\nsoning.
