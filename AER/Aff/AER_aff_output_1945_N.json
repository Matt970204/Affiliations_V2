The result has been a vast increase\nin the amount of currency and bank deposits outstanding, and\nthe consequent creation of a grave menace of inflation.\n\n(2) The level of interest rates has been artificially depressed\nand maintained by Federal Reserve policy and is bound to\nrise substantially before long.

This does not mean that protec-\ntionist arguments were not forthcoming from socialist ranks, but the pro-\nponents of protection were consistently defeated in party councils and lacked\nsupport from the membership at large.!? The free-trade position of the Ger-\nman socialists was so unshakable that even a non-socialist writer called them\nthe *guardians of that Manchesterism once so severely spurned by them.\"!*\n\nSocialist opposition to any form of nationalism appeared most clearly in\nthe consistent socialist propaganda and parliamentary vote against militarism\nand the army and navy budget, and in favor of disarmament. Professor\nHayek quotes August Bebel correctly as remarking in 1892 that \"the Im-\nperial Chancellor can rest assured that German Social Democracy is a sort\nof Preparatory School for militarism.\"!? However, he omits to add that the\nremark was made ironically. In the session of December 13, 1892, the chan-\ncellor in a speech had remarked that army officers were satisfied with the\ndiscipline shown by socialist recruits. Bebel, referring to the discipline in the\nsocialist party, then made the above remark, That it was meant ironically\nand was so understood is proved by the stenographic report which contains\nthe word \"laughter\" after the quoted sentence.'? It would be strange indeed\nif Bebel had meant these words seriously, since in his report to the Social\nDemocratic Party Conference of the same year Paul Singer, the chairman of\nthe conference, reaffirmed the attitude of the socialists to the military pro-\ngram of the government: *Not a man, not a penny for militarism, for the\nruling military system.\"!* This anti-nationalistic attitude of the socialists on\nnumerous other questions\u2014on agricultural policy, anti-monopoly policy, in-\nternational treaties, colonial policy, and others\u2014could be demonstrated by\na mass of similar evidence.\n"], "3": ["1945] COMMUNICATIONS 931\n\nthe statement that \"the purpose of the state is to bring the individual to his\npositive development and progressive growth, in other words, to create the\ntrue foundation of human destiny, i.e., of the culture of which the human race\nis capable; it is the means for the education and development of humanity\nto freedom.\"s\n\nNevertheless, it is significant that in the later history of German socialism\nthe Marxian doctrine of opposition to the state prevailed over Lassalle's aim\nto remake bourgeois Germany into a welfare state. The reason for this is to\nbe found not only in the more compact logical theory of Marxism, but also\nin the fact that the German socialist movement carried forward the rationalist\ndemocratic ideals adapted from the French Revolution. These ideas had\nslowly filtered into Germany until they had provided the impetus for the\nrevolution of 1848. This revolution for a liberal bourgeois democracy was\nhailed by the socialists as their work, and later they always identified their\npolitical aims and ideals with a considerable part of those held by the 1848\nrevolutionaries. Professor Hayek has thus to admit that after 1870 \"the\nnational socialist elements receded for a time into the background.\"? This\nis rather an understatement since the national elements were completely ab-\nsent among the socialists, even among those who, following Eduard Bern-\nstein, had given up the theory of the social revolution. In this period falls\nthe great struggle of the German socialists with the German state. It is im-\npossible here to mention all the incidents between the socialist party and\nthe guardians of the idea of a strong nationalist state\u2014in the Reichstag, in\nthe press, and in scientific literature. It must suffice to mention just a few\nexamples. The socialists voted and agitated consistently against government\nmonopolies: for instance, in 1874-76 against the state ownership of the rail-\nroads and in 1882 against Bismarck's tobacco monopoly. In 1892 there took\nplace in socialist circles a debate on state socialism. (The issue was discussed\nat the party conference of 1892 at Berlin and a resolution condemning state\nsocialism was passed by a unanimous vote, The argument was summarized by\nWilhelm Liebknecht, one of the leading socialist deputies: \"The nearer capi-\n\nin his Ferdinand Lassalle und seine Bedeutung f\u00fcr die deutsche Sozialdemokratie (Jena,\n1911), which is criticized in S.

Economically Fichte was a mercantilist; po-\nlitically he became, under the impact of the Napoleonic wars and the elo-\nquent manifestation of the weakness of a divided Germany, more and more\nof a nationalist, without, however, losing himself in purely chauvinist argu-\nments, Later socialists became acquainted with some of Fichte's works chiefly\nthrough Lassalle who considered him an important political philosopher. It\nwould be wrong, however, to claim that he was regarded by anyone as a\nfather of socialism; certainly his influence was much less than even that of\nHegel. It is true that the socialists noted with satisfaction the occasional anti-\nfeudalistic, anti-clerical, or egalitarian ideas in Fichte, but they did the same\nwith the Greek philosophers, the medieval and humanist utopians, and the\nreligious reformers. It would be almost equally preposterous to regard Plato,\nThomas More, Jan Hus, Thomas Campanella, or Winstanley as fathers of\nGerman socialism.?\n\nThe case of Lassalle and Rodbertus is somewhat different from that of\nFichte. Their doctrines were adopted more fully by the socialists than those\nof Fichte, but only in a very limited sense can they be regarded as fathers\nof national socialism. (It would be especially strange if the national socialists\nso regarded Lassalle, who was of Jewish parentage.) The original national\nsocialist writers were not acquainted with either Lassalle or Rodbertus. Their\nnames do not even appear in the writings of Rudolf Jung, Count E. v. Revent-\nlow, and Gottfried Feder. It is likely that Lassalle and Rodbertus were not\nintroduced in the national socialist literature until 1934 by Sombart in his\nDeutscher Sozialismus. A\u00edter that, occasional references to Rodbertus and\nLassalle appear, but I have been unable to locate a single source which\ntreated their views with genuine understanding.*\n\nLassalle and Rodbertus developed similar political philosophies, both as-\nsigning to the state an economic r\u00f3le. Their views were based on the Hegelian\nRechtsphilosophie, but whereas Marx, who also derived his philosophical\ninspiration from Hegel, *turned the Hegelian philosophy upside down,\"\nLassalle and Rodbertus followed Hegel in maintaining that the state is a\nmoral category (sitiliche Idee) standing above the individual. But whereas\nfor Hegel this moral category was absolute (i.e., objectively fixed) and the\nindividual completely subordinated to the state and its purpose, Lassalle\nand Rodbertus assigned to the state a purpose derived from the individuals\ncomposing it. The purpose of the state according to them is to bring about\nthe greatest freedom of the individual, which it achieves by being a welfare\nstate, a \"sozialer Staat.\"5 This view is most clearly expressed by Lassalle in\n\n*In the latter part of the nineteenth century it became fashionable among German\nsocialists to look for egalitarian ideas among the old philosophers and reformers. The\ntwo outstanding examples of this literature are found in Karl Kautsky, Die Vorl\u00e0ufer\ndes neueren Sozialismus (Stuttgart, 1895), and Georg Adler, Geschichte des Sozialismus\nund Kommunismus von Plato zur Gegenwart (Leipzig, 1899).\n\n* The fullest discussion of Rodbertus and Lassalle in national socialist literature is to\nbe found in Friedrich Schinkel, Preussischer Sozialismus (Breslau, 1934), which shows\nlittle understanding of the economic or political theories of either of the two men.\n\n\"The chief exponent of Lassalle's \"state\" or \"national\" socialism was Berhard Harms\n"], "1": ["I\n\nIn Chapter XII of his recent book, T'e Road to Ser\u00eddom, Professor\nHayek undertakes to show that the political philosophy of German national\nsocialism has its roots in the teachings and doctrines of German socialists.\nProfessor Hayek claims that \"the support which brought these [national\nsocialist] ideas to power, came precisely from the socialist camp,\" that, at\nleast in Germany, *the connection between nationalism and socialism was\nclose from the beginning,\" and that *it was largely with the assistance of\nold socialists that the beginning which produced national socialism rose\nduring this period.\"? This paper will examine the correctness of these state-\nments in view of the political and economic ideology of German socialism.\n\nProfessor Hayek bases his argument on two types of evidence. First, he\nreminds us that pre-1914 German socialism counted among its forbears the\nsame men\u2014-Fichte, Rodbertus, and Lassalle\u2014who are at present recognized\nas the intellectual fathers of national socialism, Second, he quotes several\nauthors whose ideas he claims were formed by their study of Marxian writ-\nings and who expressed strongly nationalistic views. These two facts he con-\nsiders sufficient evidence to convict the German socialist movement of ad-\nherence to extreme nationalism, to a glorification of state power at the ex-\npense of the individual, and to an ideology diametrically opposed to that of\ntraditional liberalism.\n\nA proper analysis of the economic and political ideology of any group con-\nsists in tracing the historical influences operative on the representative ex-\nponents of the group and in fully discussing their views. With the exception\nof Bebel, none of the men referred to by Professor Hayek can be regarded\nas having held leading positions among socialist writers or politicians. The\nappeal to Fichte, Lassalle, and Rodbertus is also deceptive. The fact that\nthese men are regarded as intellectual forbears of socialism and of national\nsocialism does not mean much by itself unless a thorough analysis is made\nof why they have attained this position and which parts of their theories\nhave been taken over. How misleading the simple appeal to spiritual father-\nhood can be is shown by reference to contemporary America, where we find\nsuch diverse groups as the Republicans and the Communists appealing to\nLincoln as their political ancestor; where we find monopolists calling on\nJefferson to protect their \"freedom of enterprise\" from the trust-busters who\nclaim to act on principles of that same Thomas Jefferson.\n\nBefore we can clearly understand the influence of Fichte, Lassalle, and\nRodbertus on both the socialists and national socialists, we must investigate\nbriefly the part of their doctrines that has been adopted by each group.\nFichte started as an admirer of the French Revolution and in his younger\nyears published political tracts abusing the feudalistic and absolutist trends\n\n!

Most of us do not want jobs so much as we want\nthe kind of employment that is compatible with our tastes and our abilities;\nand, more important than either, we require some measure of security of\nincome and the maximum possible opportunity for the independent satisfac-\ntion of our preferences, the exercise of our respective skills and the develop-\nment of our faculties. Full employment, then, is not a simple economic objec-\ntive; it is a complex way of life within which conflicting ends must be com-\npromised to provide the greatest benefits at the lowest feasible cost.\n\nThe full employment goal, as the kind of society in which one wishes to live,\nwill vary from one country to another depending on its cultural and economic\nstandards of living, the heritage of its past and its hopes for the future, By\nneglecting this fundamental fact, the Conference implicitly applied a foreign\nand, in my judgment, a false set of values to its problem. As a nation's stand-\nard of living rises, and ours is the highest in the world, individual oppor-\ntunity and self-determination become increasingly important. The freedom of\nthe individual, political and economic, is an essential ingredient of the full\nemployment goal. Direct state control is a positive, albeit in some cases a\nnecessary, evil.\n\nThe real problem in this country, then, is what is the highest level of\nproductive employment, economic security and standards of living that can\nbe achieved and maintained without direct state controls.

The wartime control agency can and does rely heavily on a general\nfreezing of prices at some arbitrary date. The maintenance of profit margins\non particular products as cost elements change is not vital when the product\nis no longer produced or the firm is already subject to excess profits taxes\nbecause of its earnings from war business. As long as money income and\naccumulated savings in liquid form available for consumption expenditures\ngrossly exceed production possibilities, some measure of price control may\nbe required if inflation is to be held in check. Even after the transition from\nwar to peace, it is conceivable that the attempt to maintain a satisfactory\nlevel of employment will so lower the threshold of inflation that selective\ngovernment control over prices will have to be retained.\n\nBut the object of the Conference is not primarily inflation control.

Selective use\nof direct state controls may prove indispensable. Conceivably, some form\nof collectivism may eventually be considered the lesser evil.

The Control of Prices\n\nWhere imperfect competition or monopolistic factors exist, the Conference\nbelieves that neither competition nor market forces can be expected to bring\nabout desirable adjustments, Both business and the trade unions must, there-\nfore, be governed by public codes of conduct and their actions submitted *'to\nthe scrutiny of impartial authorities representing the public interest\" (p. 14).\nThis control is suggested for wages and prices as well as decisions with respect\nto conditions of employment, the demarcation of trades or the volume of pro-\nduction. But only price control is discussed extensively.\n\nMaximum price control is apparently expected to be practically universal.\nBased on mandatory uniform cost accounting, maximum prices would be set\non standardized goods to allow to producer and distributor no more than a\nreasonable profit under efficient operation. (High-cost producers, it is sug-\ngested, should be forced out of the market by price control.) The area of\nstandard goods, and therefore of standard price regulations, should be ex-\n\ntaxation.

The vastness of the statistical task of compilation and analysis\nof relative costs hardly requires emphasis, (The statistical task itself would\nprobably go a long way toward solving the unemployment problem for mem-\nbers of the profession!) But the usefulness of the job is also dubious. The\nimportance of added investment in a particular plant is not determinable\nfrom a direct comparison of added cost and the value of added product. (The\nauthors incidentally neglect the need of a measure of benefits with which to\ninterpret the significance of their measure of costs.) Technological and market\nchanges may require added investment to secure the existing investment\nagainst loss or to activate it into full use. The benefits from added investment\nmay be so intangible as to preclude direct evaluation. To derive compara-\nbility of relative costs and benefits over a broad segment of the economy,\nespecially where joint and common costs are prominent and multiple benefits\nare involved, is practically an insuperable task.* Final decisions would be made\nbut it is doubtful that comparative utilities or comparative costs would have\nmuch to do with them.\n\nThese comments do not challenge the ability of the state effectively to\nguarantee *full employment\" if it is prepared to invest directly in sufficient\nquantities? and over a wide enough area.

For Beveridge would not maintain adequate\noutlays by tax reductions which would increase disposable incomes in the hands of\nconsumers to be expended by them in conformity with their own judgments of relative\nurgency.

It would place in the\ngovernment bureaucracy the power of predetermining what new ideas would\nand what would not be permitted to be developed. On the eve of potentially\nrevolutionary developments in plastics, synthetics, the light metal alloys,\ntransport, and electronics, to mention but a few, such concentration of\neconomic power could be stifling. New ideas seldom spring fully developed\nfrom the minds of their originators, and public servants are notoriously con-\nservative.\n\nIt might be objected that the development of an over-all system of priorities\nsupported by relative cost analysis would avoid most of the dangers I fear.\nBut the concept of an over-all system of priorities in peacetime to control all\nreal investment is either naive or authoritarian. Neither *over-all priority\"\nnor its alter ego \"social utility\" can be given concrete, objective content as a\nguide to public action.* In time of war, a system of priorities is a necessary\nevil. It is also a fairly rational method of control because the bulk of the\npreferences granted are determined by the overriding needs of war (direct and\nindirect). In the residual civilian area, discretion is reduced to a comparison\nof minimum essentials. Even in wartime, however, the operation of such a\nSystem is halting, cumbersome and charged with inescapable discriminations.\nBut as soon as materials, facilities and manpower available exceed minimum\nessential civilian needs, the basis for rational judgment at the margin dis-\nappears.

As in the Murray bill now before the U. S.

This proposal raises problems of its own, but they are not our im-\nmediate concern.\n\n*' This concept of \"social priority\" or \"social utility\" is also prominent in Beveridge,\nagain with no explanation of the criteria that could be employed to give it concrete\nmeaning as a principle of selection. Smithies takes no exception to the use of the term.\nIndeed, he goes Beveridge one better by proposing that the arbitrary element in Bev-\neridge's *double-budget principle\" might be avoided by choosing between increasing public\nexpenditures or reducing taxes on the basis of comparative social utilities. At the desired\nlevel of total outlays, \"the 'marginal social utility! of taxation should be equal to the\n*marginal social disutility' of taxation\" (of. cit., p. 359).\n\nThe concept of relative social utility is not without meaning as a philosophy of\ngovernment action. Within limits, it even provides practical guidance. Alternative\nproposals for public expenditure can be appraised roughly in terms of their relative\nsocial value. In terms of the incidence of the tax structure, a presumption may even\nbe established that projects so chosen are worth more than the incremental loss to\nthe taxpayers as long as aggregate government expenditures are small. But this conviction\nis dissipated as the volume of public expenditures increases relative to,national income\nand it vanishes entirely when the principle is raised to the status of a rational marginal\ncalculus. It is just such a calculus which is here under consideration. As a precept of\nadministrative action, social priority or social utility merely obfuscates understanding\nof the issues raised by centralization of economic decisions.\n"], "4": ["Comment\n\nIn the absence of a state guarantee of the maintenance of \"full employ-\nment\" without regard to social cost, detailed control of real investment is an\nunnecessarily burdensome and restrictive method of assuring desirable high\nlevels of productive employment.\n\nLet us first look at the implications of this method of control, The planned\ncontrol of all public and private investment (in terms of actual capital\ngoods, not merely financial quantities), if it could be achieved, would require\nin effect the predetermination by government fiat of the kinds and quantities\n", "632 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW [SEPTEMBER\n\nindustries of *key importance in the maintenance of general investment ac-\ntivity\" as well as to those which are important because of *'their basic charac-\nter and the dependence on them of a wide range of other industries and of\nbasic services vital to the consuming public\" (p. 44).

But in the absence of any consideration of the compo-\nsition of the unemployed, of the nature of the costs of reducing the level of\nunemployment, or of the significance of the phrase \"the nearest possible\napproach,\" the objective can hardly be appraised.\n\nA clear definition of the full employment goal is crucial for understanding\nand for intelligent decision of the issues raised. There can be no quarrel\nwith the conclusion that *the government in running its own affairs, cannot\nignore the effects of its actions on the capitalistic system.\"? In this sense, if\nno other, the government must accept responsibility for the formulation and\ncarrying out of a full employment program. If the policy goal is to induce\nhigh employment levels without inflation, prevent major fluctuations in em-\nployment and assure economic security through comprehensive unemploy-\nment insurance and social security, this responsibility of the state can\nprobably be discharged within the framework of its traditional peacetime\npowers without substantive modification of the free enterprise system. But if\nthe goal is a guarantee of jobs (as opposed to income security) for all those\n\n? A. Smithies, 4r. Econ.

It is not a set of conclu-\nsions derived from any inductive analysis, to which the reader is exposed, of\neconomic forces underlying business fluctuations and unemployment. Nor is it\na deduction from stated premises or principles with which the reader might\nagree or disagree. It recommends a program which lodges in public authority\nthe final control of basic economic decisions, such as the direction and location\nof real investment, the use of corporate surplus above a reasonable return\nto shareholders, the determination of wages and prices, etc. But, at the same\ntime, it pays lip service to the importance of flexibility and efficiency in pro-\nduction and to the vital need for vigorous private enterprise and co\u00f3peration\nbetween management, labor, and the state.\n\nAt the risk of misrepresenting the real position of the Conference, I\nhave focused attention on the controls which are recommended rather than\non observations with respect to the desired operation of the economy which\nmay or may not be consistent with those controls. And I have directed my\ncomments primarily to the implications of, and the necessity for, those con-\ntrols rather than to the structure of administrative agencies through which it\nis proposed that they be exercised. Finally, because of the breadth of the\nsubject and the limitations of space, I have concentrated on the central\nideas of the Statement even though this procedure magnifies the scope of\napparent disagreement.\n"], "1": ["There is a growing trend of thought, especially prominent in Great Britain,\nthat economic salvation after the war must be sought in state control. The\nmain current of this opinion flows from many springs: the failure of free\nenterprise to maintain a reasonable level of employment between the two wars;\nthe debacle of the thirties; the rending of the illusion that competition and\nself-interest will secure a desirable adjustment of supply to demand and an\neffective tendency toward full employment; the recognition of pervasive\nmarket imperfections and wastes (call them wastes of competition or mo-\nnopoly as you will); and a complete system of war-born direct controls\nwhich public inertia, fear of the future, the vested interests of those in control\nand conviction as to the benefits of a planned economy now conspire to project\ninto the post-war. These, and similar influences, have produced in Great\nBritain Employment Policy and Organization of Industry after the War (the\nprimary subject of this paper), the Government White Paper on Employment\nPolicy, the Economics of Full Employment prepared by members of the\nInstitute of Statistics at Oxford, and the more imposing Report on Full Em-\nployment in a Free Society by W. H. Beveridge.' While these documents differ\nin the detail of their recommendations, and even more in quality of analysis\nand adequacy of presentation, they reflect a similar spirit and a similar con-\nviction,\n\nEmployment Policy and Organization of Industry after the War is essen-\ntially a policy statement, a compilation of ideas and. suggestions for \"a\nnew advance . . . in the control and organization of our national resources,\"\nto use Mr. G.

My\ngeneral suggestion is that the operational approach, which has proved so\nuseful in other fields, may be useful in this connection in economics. Dr. von\nMering tolerates the operational method in natural science, but he apparently\nrejects its use in economics, and objects violently to my particular application\nof it in the latter field. The operational approach means that concepts are to\nbe stated in terms of \"operations,\" which in economics means in terms of\nalterable behavior, or plans of action. My particular suggestion is to use\nthe operational method of inquiry to suggest hypotheses for relating distinc-\ntive theoretical concepts in a body of theory like that of Keynes's to concrete\nproposals by the same theorist in the field of policy. I have contended and am\nwilling to defend in detail the proposition that the meaning of Keynes's theory\nas a whole and of his special concepts like liquidity-preference, marginal pro-\npensity to consume, and marginal efficiency of capital is to be found in rela-\ntion to Keynes's program of reform. This is the essence of my suggestion that\npolicy may be viewed as the operational meaning of theory. Dr. von Mering\nmay legitimately question the usefulness of this approach, but it obviously\nhas nothing to do with any desire to rule society, to vindicate particular\npolicies, or to play tricks on unsuspecting people. It is, like Peirce's pragmatic\nmaxim, a suggestion for the clarification of ideas, which in turn is prerequisite\nto scientific evaluation of economic theory and policy.\n\nI have criticized Dr. von Mering for failing to make a clear-cut distinction\nbetween meaning of theory and workability of program. Not until the meaning\nof a theory has been established in terms of alterable behavior (plan of action)\nare we in a position to raise the further question of the validity of the system\nof thought. Since any body of doctrine contains within it special practical and\nethical presuppositions, its concepts and propositions cannot legitimately be\ncriticized in terms of the concept and propositions of another system of theory,\nwhich has different practical and ethical presuppositions. Having previously\ndiscovered the meaning of the concepts, we are in a position to raise the\nfurther question of the workability of the course of action with which that\ntheory is associated, i.e., for which it is an argument. Whether or not the pro-\ngram can realize the practical and ethical aims in terms of which it is projected\nis to a large extent a matter of historical circumstances, such as the prevailing\nstate of the industrial arts.\n\nOne of the great faults of economics is that what passes for scientific criti-\ncism is hardly more than polemical dogmatism in which one set of practical\nand ethical values is used as the basis for criticizing another set of practical\nand ethical values. Instead of lowering the quality of discussion among\neconomists, as Dr. von Mering alleges, the adoption of the above suggestions\nwould, I believe, provide the best possible means for elevating the quality of\ndiscussion and criticism in the field of theoretical economics.\n\nDuprrv DirLLARD*\n"], "1": ["?

This is certainly not the place to discuss bank earnings,\nalthough it can be shown that comparatively they are not excessive. The\npoint to be emphasized is that it seems quite obvious that the structure of\ninterest rates should be fixed, if it is to be subjected to regulation, after\nconsidering factors other than bank earnings. If the economy demands a\nlower structure of interest rates, a more conclusive argument surely could\nhave been advanced by Mr. Samuelson and his barber.\n\nMr. Samuelson also asserts that this could have been a one per cent war\nrather than a 2 per cent one. He dismisses the statement that interest rates\nmight have an effect upon private consumption and investment, although he\nconcedes that \"they may have had some minor effect upon the form in\nwhich wealth is held.\"* He does not choose to explore this possibility further,\nalthough it is deserving of additional analysis. It must not be forgotten\nthat the banks are not for the most part permitted to subscribe to securities\nin war loans and are not even permitted to purchase certain types of securities\navailable to other investors in the open market. They have been restricted\nto short-term, low interest bearing securities. One of the reasons that banks\nhave been able to purchase these securities is that corporate and other\ninvestors have preferred to hold deposits. If corporations and others pur-\nchased securities, then the banking system would have had less funds to\ninvest. This fact is very seldom realized by those who discuss the question.\nLike Mr. Samuelson, I do not wish to go into this subject because it is\nextremely complicated but it may be suggested that the interest rates offered\nto corporate and other investors are insufficient to induce them to part with\nliquid funds. To induce these investors to invest liquid funds, i.e., to change\nthe form in which wealth is held, might have required higher rates of interest\nthan those paid on securities held by banks. In discussing the interest rate\nat which this war is being financed it is well to consider this fact. This\nagain emphasizes the fact that the fixing of a given structure of interest\nrates can only be undertaken after considering a great many factors.\n\nThere are a great many aspects to this problem which Mr. Samuelson has\nnot discussed and I have not raised them here. My only objective has been\nto point out that, if a lower structure of interest rates is desirable, a much\nstronger argument than the fact that the banking system would not be hurt\nby a rise in the structure of interest rates should be cited. The determination\nof a structure of interest rates in wartime should only be undertaken after\nconsidering needs of the economy, the investment responses of savers to\nvarious interest rates, the relative costs incurred by the government, and\nthe inflationary or deflationary results of various methods of financing.\nFinally, it has been pointed out that the banking system is following con-\nsciously a portfolio policy which will result in as little loss as possible in\nthe event that the structure of interest rates might rise.\n\nGxzongcE W. COLEMAN*\n"], "2": ["672 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW [SEPTEMBER\n\nback within three years. This conclusion follows from the unrealistic interest\nrate structure assumed by Samuelson and after making a slight error in\ncomputing the ratios of new to old capital values. (While the academician\nwill find such an error trifling, to the average banker it might mean the\ndifference between a profit and loss on the bond transaction.) What is some-\nwhat surprising is that Mr. Samuelson should have taken so much pains to\nmake a calculation of this type when even the lowliest bank clerk could have\ntold him, even if his barber could not, that banks are endeavoring to main-\ntain a short position in order to minimize the loss which a rise in interest\nrates with a longer position would produce.\n\nMr. Samuelson used in his calculations the United States Treasury report\non the ownership-distribution of U. S. government securities as of February\n29, 1944. Thus it will be noted that his figures are on a \"due or first\nbecoming callable\" basis. With a rise in interest rates it is extremely unlikely\nthat any securities will be called in order to refund them into securities bearing\na higher coupon. Consequently, such calculations should be made on a\n\"maturity\" basis. However, using his figures, it might be well to note that a\n3.29 per cent decline in the value of U. S. government securities would have\nimpaired at that date about 25 per cent of the total capital invested in banks.\n\nIt should be pointed out that the banking system would recover these\nlosses over a period of time, the length depending upon the maturity\ndistribution. During that period, it would be \"frozen in\" to a given maturity\npattern. Mr. Samuelson seems to feel, however, that earnings of the banking\nsystem upon the existing portfolio would increase. He states that \"immediately\nafter interest rates have risen and capital values have scaled down, all parts\nof the portfolio, old as well as new, began to earn the higher rates.\"* He\nargues that this is true because the earnings will be made up not only of\nthe coupon return but of the amortization of the discount, and this will mean\nnew higher earnings. From the point of view of the banking system, however,\nthese \"new higher earnings\" will be purely nominal. In *writing down\"\ncapital values, losses will be established and the amortization of discount\nwill merely recover these losses.\n\nIn another place, he suggests that the bonds can be carried at cost. (He\nprobably means amortized cost.) If this is done, then it should be obvious\nthat the return will remain the same. The \"new higher earnings\" will not\nmaterialize until re-investment takes place. But it should be emphasized\nthat the re-investment will not be possible until the securities mature. A rise\nin interest rates is not, therefore, going to be the immediate bonanza for\nbanks which Mr. Samuelson seems to envisage.\n\nMr. Samuelson states further that if his argument is \"rightly interpreted,\nit will be seen that mine is an argument against interest rate increases, not\nin favor of them.\"5 'The logic of arguing for a lower rate of interest on the\nground that an increase would not hurt the banking system is diff\u00fccult to\nunderstand, but apparently it follows from his argument, already commented\n\n*!Am, Econ.

The Objectives of Foreign Exchange Policy\n\nPolicy concerning foreign exchange rates has to be subordinated to\nthe general objectives of our international economic policy. These have\nbeen clearly stated in official declarations and one of them is to make\nthe currency of different countries again freely interchangeable.\n\nApplied to our particular problem, this implies that we want an\nexchange rate which equates demand and supply in a free market, that\nis, a market in which everybody is allowed to buy and to sell curren-\ncies of all countries. This is, of course, the ultimate ideal, which cannot\nbe realized at once. All experts agree that in most countries more or\nless stringent controls of the foreign exchange market will have to be\nmaintained for some time after the war. The scope, stringency and\nduration of these controls will be discussed later and will partly depend\non the rates which are chosen. But certain features of a free market\ncan and should be introduced right from the beginning: The ex-\nchange rate of a currency should be uniform, non-discriminatory. That\nis to say, the same rate should be applicable to all types of transactions\nand to all individuals, to commodity trade as well as to services, capi-\ntal and interest payments. Applied to more than two countries, this\nimplies that the rates should be consistent, that is to say, cross rates\nshould be equal to direct rates. Another postulate is that rates should\nbe as stable as possible.\n\nAnother partially conflicting objective of foreign exchange policy\nwould be to influence the terms of trade. The realization of this objec-\ntive would usually imply an overvaluation of the currency, because\nthere is a strong presumption that the setting of a high level of a coun-\ntry's currency (or an appreciation) tends to improve the terms of trade\nand a low level (or depreciation) tends to deteriorate them.\n\nSo long as exchange control is maintained this objective can be\nattained to some extent, although the abstention from discriminating\npolicies, which is implied by the postulate of uniformity and consistency\nof exchange rates, imposes severe restrictions on any attempt at doctor-\ning the terms of trade. If exchange controls are altogether removed it\nwill be found that for most countries there is very little or no leeway\n\n* The author is professor of economics at Harvard University.\n"}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Gottfried Haberler"], "stable_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1811443"}, "1811444": {"affiliations": {"found": "This paper examines our wartime wage stabilization program and\nconsiders the advisability of extending it throughout the period of tran-\nsition from war to civilian production.

Introduction\n\nIn his Report on Full Employment in a Free Society, Sir William\nBeveridge has been untrammeled by official reticence in stating what\nhe considers to be the implications of a full employment policy. He con-\ntends that, to deserve the name, a full employment policy must mean\nthat the central government accepts responsibility for the level of\nemployment: *Full employment cannot be won and held without a\ngreat extension of the responsibilities and powers of the State exer-\ncised through organs of the central Government. No power less than\nthat of the State can ensure adequate total outlay at all times, or can\ncontrol, in the general interest, the location of industry and the use of\nland. To ask for full employment while objecting to these extensions\nof State activity is to will the end and refuse the means. It is like shout-\ning for victory in total war while rejecting compulsory service and\nrationing\" (p. 36). He reinforces his argument by demonstrating that\nfull employment has not been maintained for extended periods in the\npast, and arguing there is no theoretical reason to believe that it will\nbe maintained in the future if the State does not accept this responsi-\nbility.?\n\nSir William goes further in his definition of the fullness of full\nemployment than is usual amongst economists. In rejecting definitions\nwhich permit the number of unfilled vacancies to be less than the num-\nber of unemployed, he states: *Full employment in this Report means\nmore than that in two ways. It means having always more vacant jobs\nthan unemployed men, not slightly fewer jobs.

If the initial deficiency\nin over-all expenditures is large, we have seen that the balanced budget ap-\nproach will require exorbitantly high levels of expenditures and taxation, both\nof which will tend to depress private investment. If, as a result, private\ninvestment expenditures are depressed, budget figures even higher than those\nshown in Table II are needed. If the unfavorable reaction of private investors\nis violent, tax-financed additions to expenditures when carried beyond some\npoint may well lower rather than increase the over-all level of income.\n\nAll this points to the conclusion that a substantial deficit will be needed\nunless we succeed by non-fiscal means to narrow down the initial deficiency in\nthe over-all expenditure level to much below the illustrative figure of 30 billion\ndollars used in the preceding discussion. If a large deficiency remains to be\nfilled through fiscal measures, after other policy approaches have been ex-\nhausted, it will be neither desirable nor feasible to make expenditures suffi-\nciently large to balance the budget at full employment. Instead, a thoroughly\nworth-while expenditure budget should be provided including expended social\nsecurity and adequate developmental programs stimulating to private invest-\nment, but excluding made-work projects.??

This is allowed for in our formulation of the problem\nwhere the deduction from QT will be positive.

If\nfiscal policy can be successful in assuring a high and stable level of income,\nthis very assurance will undoubtedly contribute to a higher level of private\ninvestment. Also, private investment may be stimulated directly through de-\nvelopmental programs such as power development, urban redevelopment and\nso forth. Well-selected reductions in tax rates may give further incentives to\nprivate investment. On the other hand, higher tax rates, public expenditures\nwhich compete with private enterprise and psychological repercussions of an\nincreased budget or of a rising debt may work in the opposite direction.\n\nIu\n\nThe interrelationship between the contribution of the budget to over-all\nincome and the major variables of budget policy may now be illustrated with\nreference to hypothetical post-war magnitudes. The quantitative results, of\ncourse, are illustrative relationships, not forecasts or policy data. Like the\nequation of change, our formula presents questions rather than answers,\nbut it may serve as a \"table of contents\" for some functional relationships\ninvolved.\n\nFor purposes of these illustrations the familiar concept of gross national\nproduct may be used as the over-all measure of income, even though theo-\nretically the net product would be the better concept. The gross national\nproduct for the year 1950 is widely estimated at about 200 billion dollars under\nconditions of full employment. Now suppose that the outlook at the close of\n1949 indicates a prospective gross national product of 170 or 180 billions\nonly, both estimates being based on the assumption that the federal budget\nis balanced at a level of 10 billions.

In other words, with respect to the term\n\u00ab (E, 4- E,) it is assumed that no additional taxes are paid by the recipients\nof the additional government payments. The fact that additional taxes are\npaid by this group and that the net increase in their expenditures falls short\nof \u00ab (E, -- E;) is allowed for in deducting QT, where T covers all additional\ntax yield.\n\nChanges in tax yield are here considered the primary planning factor, the\nnecessary changes in tax rates being determined by the changes in yield and\nincome. The opposite approach could be taken but would be less useful? As\na matter of fiscal planning, yield adjustments are the primary objective and\nchanges in tax rates the means to accomplish them. In planning rate adjust-\nments to bring about the desired change in yield, secondary changes in yield\ndue to changes in the level of income and hence in the tax base must not be\nneglected. As a matter of legislation, action is taken in terms of rate adjust-\nment but the final purpose is adjustment of tax yields.\n\nThe change in yield, or T, may be positive or negative, depending on whether\nthe yield provided for in the adjusted budget falls above or below the initial-\nly assumed level. T' is equal to zero if the yield level is unchanged. It should\nbe noted that 2-T refers to increments or decrements in tax yield only, so that\nBT does not allow for changes in private expenditures brought about by chang-\ning the sources from which the initially assumed amount of tax yield is\ndrawn, as, for instance, by changing from excise to income taxes.'?\n\nThe multiplier k is here applied to initial changes in private expenditures\non consumption or investment. It is based on the marginal propensity to con-\nsume of the community at large, not on a or f which reflect the consumption\nhabits of certain groups only. Usually, & is based on the community's mar-\nginal propensity to consume out of income before tax and thus allows for\nleakages from additional tax payments, in this paper it is based on consump-\ntion out of income after tax. Since the multiplier is based on the community's\nmarginal propensity to consume out of income after tax, & will remain con-\nstant when tax rates fall and fall when tax rates rise. This avoids considerable\ndifficulties which can only be mentioned here. If, for instance, expenditures\nare increased to sustain a higher level of income and the tax rate is held\nconstant, the initial increase in expenditures must be sufficiently high to allow\n\n? An alternative approach would be to define a as the propensity to consume out of\nincome before tax and T as such addition to tax yield as results from an autonomous\nincrease in tax rates only, excluding such additional yield as results from an increase in\n\nthe tax base. The net result, in terms of the addition to total income, would be the same\nfor both approaches.\n\n?' The lower the initially assumed yield level, the less serious is this defect. At the cost\nof some complication it may be remedied by adding another term to expression (1).\n\nThe difficulty might be avoided by redefining G to be the deficiency in income on the as-\nsumption of a zero (rather than a balanced minimum) budget. This would have the\nadvantage of making T' identical with the over-all yield level, so that changes in the f\nfor the total tax yield would be accounted for. But this would be more than offset by the\ndisadvantages of this approach, in particular (a) it would pose the altogether unrealistic\nproblem of having to estimate G for the assumption of zero public expenditures and (b)\nit would exclude the analysis of budget adjustments involving a reduction in tax yield.\n"], "4": ["To ONT ULP\n\nexpression (1) reduces to:\nG E; --a (E; -- E, \u00a3\u2014 T) ET\n7 1\u20142a (1\u2014 t)\nFor a discussion of the relationship between multiplier and tax rate, see Paul A.

They greatly depend upon the kind of policy by which\nadjustments in the expenditure or yield levels are brought about. The \u00ab\napplicable to transfer expenditures may exceed or fall short of the a for real\nexpenditures. Thus, if the additional expenditures are relief payments, \u00ab may\nbe close to one; if they are for debt redemption, \u00ab may be close to zero. If\nthe expenditures qualify for inclusion in E, it is likely that \u00ab will fall some-\nwhere in between these extremes. Similarly, if the change in tax yield is in\nsales tax yield, 8 may be close to one; if the estate tax yield is involved, 8\nmay be close to zero. The 9 applicable to the corporation tax depends upon\nits incidence. To the extent that the tax is reflected in higher prices or lower\nwazes, & will be rclatively high; to the extent that the tax is reflected in\nreduced dividends, & will be less, and where the tax is reflected in the reten-\ntion of less earnings, 8 will be equal to zero. By defining the revenue item as\n-cOT, the implicit assumption is made that the Q applicable to borrowing is\nequal to zero. This assumption is not entirely realistic, even for the case of\ndepression borrowing, but is made to simplify the problem.\n\nThe cAange in tax yield, or 2- T, includes all changes in yield, whether due\nto changes in the tax base (brought about by increased consumption, invest-\nment and public expenditures) or to changes in tax rates. When government\nexpenditures (E, 4- E,) increase and the tax rate remains unchanged, T' will\nbe positive since a part of the additional income received from the government\nwill be returned to the Treasury in taxes.

If\nthere is a lag in the public disbursement of the additional tax yield or in\nthe respending of the additional income received by the project workers, the\ndirect contribution of the real public expenditure may be offset in part or\nfully by reduced private expenditures, measured in the second term of ex-\npression (1). If such lags apply, this result may be avoided if the initial public\noutlay is financed out of credit or taxes drawn from idle balances. For pur-\nposes of present analysis, we assume that no lag exists.*\n\nThe increase im private consumption expenditures, resulting from adjust-\nments in public expenditures and taxes is the second leverage factor.

The initial\nincrease in expenditures by those receiving additional government payments\nis defined as (E, -- E,), ie., the marginal propensity to consume (\u00ab) of\nthose receiving the additional payments, times the total increase in public\nexpenditures, including transfer as well as real expenditures. The initial de-\ncrease (increase) in expenditures of taxpayers is defined as \u2014-QT, i.e., the\nmarginal propensity to consume (8) of those who meet an increased (de-\ncreased) tax bill, times the ckange in tax yield, 3- T.\n\nIt is a major point of this analysis that E,, the initial public expenditure\non current produced goods and services, is singled out as the first term, while\nthe multiplicand to which & is applied is defined to include the initial increase\nin frivate expenditures only.5 This permits us to differentiate between the\nmarginal propensity to consume of income recipients in the economy at large,\nwhich underlies &, and the marginal propensity to consume of those who\nreceive additional income from the government (a), or of those who meet\na changed tax bill (8).5 This is of considerable advantage. During a depres-\nsion period, for instance, fiscal planning calls for taxes which are drawn from\ntaxpayers whose marginal propensity to consume is low relative to that of\nincome recipients as a whole, and for expenditures going to recipients whose\npropensity to consume is high relative to that of the community as a whole.\nThe opposite tends to hold during a period of inflation.

For half a century thereafter, the intelligent reading public looked\nforward to the position taken by Cassel on the important economic and social\nissues of the day. His career as a teacher extended from his appointment as\nprofessor in economic and financial science at the University of Stockholm\nto emeritus status in 1933. His career as a consultant began in 1904 with an\nappointment (held until 1917) as adviser to the Department of Finance.\nThereafter he was a member of the bank commission in 1917, a member of\nthe economic council, 1920-21, and an adviser to the railroad council, 1924-26.\n\nDuring the First World War, Cassel was asked by the government of Ger-\nmany to help solve some of the country's pressing economic problems; in 1922\nhe advised in the establishment of the Russian State Bank; and in 1928, he\ntestified before our House of Representatives Currency and Banking Com-\nmittee as to means for stabilizing the purchasing power of the dollar. He\nwas the Swedish delegate to International Chamber of Commerce meetings\nduring the twenties at London, Rome, Brussels, Stockholm, and Amsterdam;\nand he participated in the World Economic Conferences of Genoa (1922)\nand London (1933).\n\nCassel enjoyed as wide recognition and honor as ever has been accorded\nan economist during his lifetime. His books were translated into many for-\neign languages. He held honorary degrees from a number of universities,\nand occupied honorary lectureships at Oxford, London, Geneva, Columbia,\nand Chicago. He was an honorary member of the American Economic Asso-\nciation and a member (1914), gold medallist (1922), and president (1926)\nof the Royal Swedish Academy. Commenting upon his death, a Stockholm\nnewspaper wrote that he was a whole academy in himself.\n\nCassel was essentially a liberal in economic philosophy in his belief in the\nefficiency and benefit of a competitive price economy. This liberalism is appar-\nent in the books already cited and, more particularly, in Recent Monopolistic\nTendencies in Industry and Trade (1927) and Socialism and Progress (1928).\nCassel frequently warned against the outcome of authoritarian tendencies in\neconomic policy: \"The arbitrariness, the mistakes, and the inevitable contra-\ndictions of such a policy will, as daily experience shows, only strengthen the\ndemand for a more rational coordination of the different measures and, there-\nfore, for unified leadership. For this reason Planned Economy will always tend\nto develop into Dictatorship.\" Tributes written by Cassel's outstanding stu-\ndents, Professor Bertil Ohlin| now Swedish Minister of Commerce, and\nSenator Gunnar Myrdal, pointed to Cassel's faith in rationalism, in progress,\n\nand in the final victory of common sense.\nTTA oC LE. TG\n"], "2": ["OBITUARIES 509\n\nMonetary System. (1931), and The Downfall of the Gold Standard (1936).\nMonetary analysis and policy in the inter-war years were strongly influenced\nby these writings and by Cassel's participation in the numerous international\nconferences of that period.\n\n'The idea of \"purchasing power parity\" as the equilibrium value of foreign\nexchanges was not Cassel's discovery, but its popularization was undoubtedly\nhis accomplishment, Originally the concept was introduced by Cassel in the\nso-called absolute form: the international exchange ratio of two currencies\nwill tend to settle at the ratio of the absolute height of their price levels.\nBecause the costs of transportation of goods or obstacles to trade, such as\ntariffs and quotas, might operate unequally as between two countries, the\nabsolute form was rather quickly supplanted by the relative form: the equili-\nbrium rate of exchange would move, relatively to its position in a base year\nwhen equilibrium in the balances of payments could be assumed, in the same\nratio as the relation of changes in the price levels. Purchasing power parity,\neven in this formulation, has to be corrected for changes in relative trade\nobstacles, in international demand, in relative costs, and for protracted capital\nmovements.\n\nDespite these limitations, and especially if Cassel's wholesale price index\nis supplanted by one more appropriate to international equilibrium, the device\nmay be useful in forecasting the future level of a given exchange if it is free\nto move. Cassel utilized the idea, known in this context as the \"inflation\ntheory,\" to refute the official apology propagated by Germany that the com-\nplete depreciation of the mark in 1923 was explained by a mere scarcity of\ngoods and by an un\u00edfavorable balance of trade. He also based upon the parity\ndoctrine his adverse judgment against attempts to restore badly depreciated\ncurrencies to their old values.\n\nDuring the twenties Cassel predicted a world shortage of gold. This was\npartly derived from his explanation of secular price movements in the century\nfrom 1810 to 1910 in terms of the deviation of the stock of monetary gold\nfrom a. computed normal increase of 2.79 per cent per annum which would\nparallel the secular increase of physical output. There are grounds for skep-\nticism concerning this analysis, as for example the effects of changing from\na silver or a bimetallic to the gold standard in the chief trading nations during\nthe century. But the devices recommended by Cassel for alleviating a gold\nShortage by monetary changes have meanwhile come into practical acceptance.\n\nIn the field of business cycle theory, Cassel has been less influential than\nWicksell. Common to both was the doctrine that cycles consist primarily of\nalternations of an excess of investment over saving and the reverse. The only\ncategoric difference lay in Cassel's contention that the \"natural\" or \"real\"\nrate of interest would tend to conform to the market rate, whereas Wicksell\nheld the reverse. Curiously enough for the proponent of such a doctrine,\nCassel was completely out of sympathy with the recent doctrine of Keynes\nand Hansen.\n\nAn adequate appreciation of the significance of Cassel leads beyond the\nrealm of scientific literature to his extensive popular writing, his wide partici-\n"], "1": ["On January 15, 1945, Gustav Cassel died, the dean of Swedish economists\nand one of the most renowned economists throughout the world in the present\ngeneration. Cassel's international repute rested upon his extensive writing\nthrough the greater part of his seventy-eight years of life, his active partici-\npation in public affairs both at home and abroad, and his influence as a teacher\nand publicist.\n\nCassel's contributions to the literature of modern economics are found\nprincipally in the four fields of value theory, monetary problems, the analysis\nof business cycles, and the critique of socialism. His first notable publication\nwas made in the field of value and distribution theory in TZe Nature and\nNecessity of Interest (1903). He was chiefly concerned in this work to dem-\nonstrate a separate productivity inhering in capital, explicable on the grounds\nof scarcity of supply without recourse to psychological determinants; but the\ntreatise illuminated the theory of capital in many ways. The services of capital\nwould be scarce and valuable even in a socialist state: the problem of why\ninterest exists should not be confused with the ethical issues raised by the\npossibility of living through owning. Students of capital theory will recall also\nCassel's suggestion of what we now call a backward rising\" capital supply\ncurve, and his idea that interest rates (expressed as the number of years\npurchase) may have some connection with average life expectancy.\n\nHis systematic works in value theory include Outlines of an. Elementary\nTheory of Prices (1899), Fundamental Thoughts in Economics (1925), and\nA Theory of Social Economy, first published in German in 1918, but not\navailable in English until 1924. Translated into several languages, the Social\nEconomy came quickly to be a standard treatise and a widely used textbook\nin universities throughout the world. It departed from the neoclassical tradi-\ntion in rejecting what the author regarded as unprofitable speculations as to\nthe subjective attitudes of suppliers of economic services. Though this ap-\nproach would be favored by the behaviorist psychology, Cassel's substitution\nof a mere principle of scarcity for the idea of subjective value underlying the\nphenomenon of price has not found general acceptance, witness the current\npopularity of the indifference analysis.

The proposition that\n\"the thought of theorists represents a more sophisticated way of thinking\nabout policy\" means in less sophisticated words that theory and theoretical\nconcepts have to be used as tools for the vindication and carrying out of a\ncertain policy. I do not believe that Keynes himself would accept this inter-\npretation of his theory, and I am even doubtful whether American pragmatists,\nto whom Dillard refers, would agree to it.* It is one thing to regard ideas\nas plans of action in the field of natural science. It is another thing to apply\nthis consideration to the field of social science, as Dr. Dillard suggests. In\nthe former sphere the concept may well have some advantages, although\nthere are, even in that field, serious drawbacks. To use Bertrand Russell's\nwords: When what passes for knowledge is considered to be no more than a\nmomentary halting place in a process of inquiry which has no goal outside\nitself, inquiry can no longer provide intellectual joys, but becomes merely a\nmeans to better dinners and more rapid locomotion.* However, this drawback\nis nothing compared to the catastrophic results which would follow from the\ngeneral adoption of Dr. Dillard's view in the economic field. The conception\nof ideas as plans of action in physics and chemistry is based on the wish to\nforetell future events and thus to dominate the material world. The ultimate\ngoal of ideas used as plans of action in the economic sphere in conformity\nwith Dillard's proposition could be no other than to rule society. Ideas would\nbecome mere tricks, and theory would be degraded to propaganda. Because\nI do not treat the Keynesian concepts as having \"specific pragmatical mean-\ning, discoverable by the operational approach,\" Dr. Dillard declares me\n\"guilty\" of \"wandering all over the place.\" Well, I prefer to go on wandering\nto accepting his notion of economic theory.

The main point is that notions of wZat skould be direct\u2014often un-\nnoticed by the theorist\u2014the conception of wZat is, or rather what is sup-\nposed to be. In order to prove that the Keynesian theory is a case in point\nI tried to show that the economic policy Keynes suggests as a consequence\nof his theory actually does not follow as a logical corollary from his theo-\nretical reasoning. In this connection Dr. Dillard expresses his \"fundamental\ncriticism\" of my position on the ground that in Part III of my article I\nconclude \"that policy is prior to theory,\" whereas I analyze *Keynes's theory\nin Part II as though theory were prior to policy.\" But is there really a con-\ntradiction? I am inclined to believe that a fairly careful reader could not\ndiscover any. In Part II I show that the policy suggested by Keynes does\nnot necessarily follow from his theory, as the reader would expect; and in\nPart III I conclude that policy and/or social philosophy may well determine\nthe structure of theory. Now Dillard takes issue with my question: *Does\nthe suggested policy [of Keynes] follow necessarily from the [Keynesian]\ntheory?\" and he calls this question *wrong.\" But why is the question wrong?\nIf a writer says, explicitly or implicitly, that if and only if ? (for example,\nmore equal distribution of income by heavy taxation of the wealthy), then\nq (full employment), and if I can prove that there may be q without ?, I am\nentitled to say that the explicit or implicit statement \"if and only if 5, then\nq\" is not true; and no pragmatist who regards logic as something more than\na political instrument will deny that.\n\nWhen I wrote my article I expected objections on the ground that I had\ndone Keynes an injustice by stating that somehow political purposes entered\nhis apparently \"objective\" theorizing.

In suggesting an investigation of \"policy as the operational meaning\nof theory,\" he rightly points out that the operational approach has come to\nplay an important r\u00f3le in modern philosophy and natural science, and he\nadvances the undoubtedly original idea of applying that approach to eco-\nnomics. Fortunately we are not left in the dark about the way Dillard\nwants to apply the operational approach to economics, in particular to the\nKeynesian theory. *\"The operational concept\" is to be used \"to explain theories\nas plans of action in the sense that [John] Dewey defines ideas as plans of\naction.\" Dr. Dillard contends that the general Keynesian concepts have a spe-\ncific practical meaning, and he misses in my analysis the suggestion that a cer-\ntain theory is articulated because the pragmatically selective perspective of the\ntheorist leads him in that direction. . . .

Attention has, for the most part, centered upon those particu-\nlar laws and regulations that have acted as trade barriers; little has been said\nabout those that have lessened factor mobility, particularly that of capital.\nSavings, before actual investment in capital goods, are highly mobile. As a\nresult, lower taxes, gifts of land for factory locations, anti-labor policies, etc.,\nare practices adopted by areas attempting to attract capital saved elsewhere.\nConversely, there have been legislative efforts in states that normally export\ncapital to hinder its emigration. The most important of these have had to do\nwith savings accumulated through mutual savings banks; in some states these\nlaws have been generalized to include investments made by trust companies\nand certain other financial institutions under state jurisdiction. Unlike state\ntrade barriers, which are a comparatively recent phenomenon, these impedi-\nments upon capital mobility are old and well established. Although they were\nof more consequence relative to the size and wealth of the United States forty\nyears ago than they are now, they still cause distortions in the geographical\nlocation of the investment of savings accumulated through savings banks.\n\nIn most of the seventeen states in which mutual savings banks are located,\nthe legislatures have prescribed the operating procedures which they are to\nfollow in considerable detail, including two types of investment restrictions.\nThe first is designed to protect the depositor from loss. Those falling under\nthis classification not only limit the fields of investment to those that the\nlegislators considered to be least speculative at the time of enactment but also\ninclude detailed credit tests which must be met by borrowers in the approved\nfields before the securities they have issued are legally approved for savings\nbank investment.
