The model of the union as a monopolistic seller of labor motivated\nby the desire to maximize some measurable end, commonly the total\nwage bill, is a deeply misleading one.

(Washington: The\nBrookings Institution. 1947. Pp. ix, 269. $3.50.)\n\nIn March, 1944, the Steel Workers (CIO) introduced a new and\nbreath-taking feature in labor demands. It asked that all the wage\nearners of the industry (some 519,000) be given a guarantee of full-time\nweekly wages (with an increase of seventeen cents an hour, as well) for\nthe period of the contract then under negotiation. Almost at once\nseveral other large CIO unions followed suit. Before this time, con-\ncerns here and there had experimented with wage guarantees. Prac-\ntically none of these plans had covered all the workers on the com-\npanies' payrolls or guaranteed a full annual wage. The unions' proposals\nfor industry-wide guarantees thus involved a magnitude of the first\norder and substituted for the cautious pre-thought and voluntary\naction of the individual employer the pressures and unpredictable\nfactors of industry-wide collective bargaining.\n\n\"This most discussed issue in labor relations came before the National\nWar Labor Board that summer. The request for an annual wage guar-\nantee as there presented had been modified to include only employees\nwith at least three months! service. The Board, in the fall of 1944, de-\nclined to grant the demand of the steel workers and unanimously recom-\nmended, instead, further investigation of the subject. A letter of\nDecember 1, 1944, from Chairman William H. Davis to President\nRoosevelt puts the recommendation in these words: *That the whole\nquestion of guaranteed wage plans, and the possibility of their future\ndevelopment in American industries as an aid in the stabilization of\nemployment and the regularization of production, should now be com-\nprehensively studied on a national scale.\"\n\n* The author, formerly professor of industrial relations in the Amos Tuck School of Business\n\nAdministration, Dartmouth College, died suddenly on October 16, 1947.

On the one hand, invest-\nment adds to the capital stock and enlarges productive capacity. On the\nother hand, investment is a component of the national income, strategic\nvia the multiplier, and a generator of current employment. These two\naspects of investment have usually been treated separately, since the\none is a long-run matter, the other an immediate fiscal problem. Domar\ncombines the two aspects; and he derives the concept of the \"required\nrate of investment (or income) growth\" for full employment.\n\nIn his first formulation of this analysis, Domar indicated a policy\nconclusion regarding the effect on private investment of a government\nguarantee of national income growth. Briefly his conclusion was that if\nprivate business can be made to expect national income to grow at the\n\"required rate,\" there will be a tendency for private investment to re-\nspond to this expectation in such aggregate volume as to effectuate that\nrate, justifying expectations and leaving to government only the role of\ncreating appropriate expectations.?\n\n\"This conclusion is very similar to one reached by Mr. R. F. Harrod in\nan article entitled An Essay in Dynamic Theory.\"* Mr. Harrod, in that\narticle, inquired what rate of income growth would tend to maintain\nitself, and arrived at the same rate of growth as Domar's *'required\nrate.\" While Harrod's rate of growth does not necessarily entail full em-\nployment of labor but only full utilization of plant capacity, it could\nentail full employment if the latter obtained at the starting point. This\nis the case which is identified with Domar's required rate of growth.\n\nThe present paper will concern itself with the equilibrium aspect of\nthe growth rate, that is, the tendency for the appropriate rate of growth\n\n* The author is a teaching fellow in economics at Harvard University.\n\n1'*Capital Expansion, Rate of Growth, and Employment,\" Econometrica, Vol. 14, No. 2\n(April, 1946), pp. 137-47; Expansion and Employment,\" Am.

                    "The purpose of the present analysis is to present in brief compass the\ncharacter of exchange control with especial reference to the question as\nto what forms are and are not compatible with a multilateral convention\ndesigned to expand international trade, render it more free and particu-\nlarly to eliminate discrimination. It is not proposed to attempt a com-\nplete description of the economic effects of various types of exchange\ncontrol, for in general these can be inferred from a sufficiently lucid\nexposition of character and aims. Exchange control is understood gen-\nerally to include any or all of the instruments dealt with below; con-\nsequently more precise definition is unnecessary, and indeed\u2014in view\nof the varieties of meaning both in popular and technical discussions\u2014\nprobably impossible. But to aid in marking off the field in advance, it\nmay be said that exchange control is not generally taken to include the\nfollowing: tariffs, quotas, prohibitions and embargoes, subsidies, state\ntrading and commercial agreements and treaties. It impinges upon these\nat points but does not include them.\n\nIn order to set the whole subject in perspective, we begin with two\nlists, one giving the main instruments and the other the main purposes\nof exchange control. The discussion follows the first outline, with con-\ntinuous cross reference to the second. An international convention un-\ndoubtedly aims to eliminate the use of exchange control for certain pur-\nposes; but most objective rules and conventions will have to be made on\nthe basis of practices or instruments rather than intent.\n",

Therefore\nthey strive (1) to keep inventories adequate for deliveries, (2) to increase\nthem quickly if prices show inclinations to rise, and (3) to bring them down\nclose to minimum if prices appear to weaken.\n\nThus manufacturers, most of whom believe (rightly or wrongly) that\ntheir least cost point is at or very near their capacity output,\" determine\ntheir scale of operations on the basis of the volume of average wholesale\npurchases, minor variations in such purchases being absorbed by changes\nin the stock of finished goods carried by manufacturers. Any tendency of\ninventories to rise above normal is viewed with alarm and may become the\nbasis for a curtailment in production schedules. By contrast, difficulty of\nmaintaining inventories above the minimum may lead to an increase in\nproduction. Knowing the sequence of events, a softening of prices at the\nretail level sometimes causes a manufacturer to curtail production without\nwaiting for the decreased demand to affect his inventories. The motive in\nsuch an event is to prevent or forestall an inventory problem rather than to\ncorrect it after it has arisen. Marginal costs are not considered in making\nthese decisions.\n\nWholesalers act on the same principle, striving to keep inventories ade-\nquate to make deliveries, but avoiding excessive inventories except when\nthey wish to speculate on rising prices. The method by which retailers\ngovern their scale of operations has been described. If any of the three be-\ncomes alarmed at a tendency of his inventory to mount, he adjusts his price\nvoluntarily to reduce his inventory and so avoid a forced inventory loss of\ngreater proportions later. The effect of this price reduction is passed forward\nor back along the pipeline in accordance with the principles just outlined.\n\nThe suggestions of a critic of this paper that marginal analysis is the only\ntheory consistent with the fact that output of individual plants fluctuates\nwith moderate price fluctuations in competitive industry is none-sense. It is\ntrue that if one assumes the validity of the marginal theory, a decline in\nprices should lead to a curtailment of output.

Some Implications\n\nThe analysis just made, if correct, raises serious questions concerning the\nvalue of marginal theory as an explanation of how entrepreneurs determine\nthe most profitable scale of output for their enterprises. Theorists of the\nmarginal school complain loudly at their critics! \"lack of proof\" that busi-\nness men solve their problems without resort, consciously or unconsciously,\nto the marginal-type analysis. Their position implies that their graphic\ndemonstrations have proved the practicability of their theories so that the\nburden of proving them inadequate rests upon their opponents. Their\nattitude is summed up in the following question: *\u00abIf entrepreneurs do not\ndetermine the scale of output on the basis of marginal cost concepts, then\nhow do they do it?\"', the implication being that until an alternative theory\nappears the marginal doctrine stands unshaken. The question is a fair one\nbut it does not follow that absence of an adequate explanation froves the\ncorrectness of an existing explanation. Fortunately, however, there is no\nSecret as to how business men actually determine a scale of output for their\nenterprises.\n\nThe pipeline that conveys goods from producer to consumer has reservoirs\nat various points. These reservoirs are the inventories carried by manufac-\nturers, wholesalers and retailers.

The effect of such advance\nplanning is to shift the optimum relationship in each case further to the\nright and by so doing to greatly shorten or eliminate entirely the stage of\ndiminishing average returns that results when some of the factors reach\ntheir optimum ahead of others.\n\nBut when production is carried on in poorly designed buildings or on\nlocations provided by nature, attention cannot be paid to all of the various\nrelationships involved. Under such circumstances an attempt to increase the\nscale of operations is apt to cause a less than ideal relationship to exist\nquite early among several of the factors involved. The result is that opera-\ntions move quickly into the stage of diminishing average returns.\n",

The addition of an eleventh\nman would either improve or detract from this near-perfect situation. Now\nit is possible that the addition of an eleventh man might improve all three\nof the relationships described above; or it might better two and worsen\none, or it might worsen two and better one, or it might worsen all three.\n\nIn the simple illustration of the paragraph above a unit of input was\ndivided into three sub-factors; (1) relation of men and machines to floor\nspace, (2) relation of men and machines to movement of material, and\n(3) the division of the complete job into subtasks. In an actual case, of\ncourse, what passes as a \"unit of input\" would involve many more than\nthree such relationships. When production is carried on in a large plant with\nvery few men, the addition of one, two, or a few more men probably im-\nproves all of the relationships and so increases output more than propor-\ntionate to the increase in labor applied. But if additional men are continu-\nally added, a time eventually comes when the individual relationships pass\ntheir optimums and begin to exert an influence in the opposite direction.\nAs long as only a few of the relationships work adversely, the result is in-\ncreased output at a decreased rate, 7.e., diminishing average returns. But\nwhen all or a majority of the relationships pass their optimum simultane-\nously, production shifts from a stage of increasing average returns directly\ninto a stage of decreasing total returns without passing through a stage of\ndiminishing average returns.\n\nThis last observation raises two questions: (1) what decides the optimum\npoint for a given relationship and (2) how reasonable is it to expect that the\noptimum of several relationships will coincide? The answer to the first\nquestion is simple. The optimum of a given force is reached when the re-\nlationship of the number of input units applied is adjusted perfectly to the\nforce under consideration. To illustrate, as far as machine location is con-\ncerned, output per variable factor will tend to be greatest when the number\nof men employed is best adjusted to the number of machines that can be\neconomically housed in a plant. This last depends upon the design of the\nbuilding. As far as movement of materials is concerned, output per variable\nfactor will tend to be greatest when the number of men employed is best\nadjusted to the carrying capacity of the conveyor system used. A similar\nrelationship exists between the number of men employed and any other\nfactors which might need to be considered.\n\nIt remains to be ascertained whether or not it is reasonable to expect the\noptimum relationship of men to machines to coincide with the optimum\nrelationship of men to material-flow and to other factors. The answer is\n*tyes,\" if the fixed factor was designed by engineers and \"no,\" if it was sup-\nplied by nature. When production is carried on in quarters designed for the\npurpose, those in control take into consideration a// the relationships in-\nvolved and strive by careful planning to prevent any one of them from\ndecreasing efficiency until operations are close to plant capacity.

Obviously the\nlast unit of output can have only one cost. The truth of the matter is that\nthe MC curve does not rise vertically at the point of capacity output: it\nENDS there. A vertical marginal cost curve exists only on graphs and in\nthe realm of imagination.\n\nThus it would appear that theorists are left with a choice of wo assump-\ntions. They may assume, if !/ey wish, that the efficiency of the variable fac-\ntor is normally greatest long before capacity production is reached, in\nwhich case by their assumptions they will insure the conclusions of their\nanalysis. With equal justification they may assume, what most business\nmen believe to be a fact, that the efficiency of the variable factor is custom-\narily greatest at or near the point of capacity output, in which event\nbusiness men do not determine their scale of operations by reference to\nmarginal cost and revenues at all: they simply produce all that they can\nsell. It is important to discover which of the two assumptions comes nearer\nto coinciding with conditions existing in the world of reality.\n\nIIL Factors Responsible For Output\n\nStatistically speaking, curves of the type shown on Figures 2 and 3 are\ngraphical representations of a mathematical relationship believed to exist\nbetween two variables: input and output. Two implications are involved in\neach such graph. The first is that two, and only two, variables need to be\nconsidered. The second is that changes in input (the independent variable)\nare the causes of changes in output (the dependent variable). Actually a\n\"*unit of input\" is not a single factor exerting a unified force for increased\noutput but is, instead, a combination of forces. The change in output that\nresults from the application of an additional unit of input is a summation\nof the net effect of the component forces included in a unit of input. Some of\nthese forces tend towards increased output and some have an opposite\ntendency. For purposes of analysis, therefore, it is desirable to reduce the\nclassical **unit of input\" to the separate forces that compose it.\n\nThe concept being developed here is made clearer by an illustration. As-\nsume an enterprise with plant and equipment of fixed quantity to be operat-\ning with a labor force of ten men. The manager of such a plant will have\nanalyzed his production problems with great care. He will have arranged\nhis machinery and equipment so as to get the greatest possible uilization of\navailable space. 'The arrangement he will choose for a labor force of ten men\nwill not be the same arrangement as he would choose for a labor force of\neleven men. Presumably he will have worked out some scheme for conveying\nraw materials with the least possible delay to the point where production is\nto occur. This conveyance scheme would work with greater or lesser\nefficiency if the labor should be increased from ten to eleven men. Also he\nmay have found it convenient to subdivide the major task into subtasks and\nto assign the subtasks to separate \"departments.\" Thus five men may be\nassigned to department A, three to department B, and two to department C,\n",

The classification of consumer expenditures used in the survey\ntabulations yielded figures which understated housing expenditures and\ntotal expenditures, and overstated savings at the middle- and upper-income\nlevels of the range covered.\n\nThe survey tabulation figures on housing expenditures exclude principal\npayments on mortgages on owned homes. The mortgage principal payments\nare thus left in the residual of income after expenditures which forms net\nsavings. Since the major part of total mortgage principal payments on\nowner-occupied homes covered in each of the surveys is made by families\nwhose income is at levels above $2,500, the survey tabulation figures on\nhousing expenditures in the upper-income brackets are less than the actual\nmoney outlay on housing.' Conversely, the savings shown for the upper-\nincome intervals are increased in like amount by the mortgage principal\npayments. As a result, the slope of the family housing expenditures line in\n\n!

Currency questions were\nhandled with a view to influencing the position of a given country in\nworld trade.

Research on the determinants of union\nwage policies is currently in progress at a number of universities, but\nthere is danger that a similar misconception will defeat the purpose of\nthese efforts. Analysis of institutional policy must begin with an under-\nstanding of the institution itself.\n\nSympathetic authors often conceive of the union as a primitive, un-\ndifferentiated protest group governed by town-meeting democracy: the\nunion becomes synonymous with its members. Hostile critics tend to\nportray it as a dictatorship governed by an official bureaucracy: the\nunion here becomes synonymous with its leaders. Economic theorists\nare prone to regard it as a monopolistic seller of labor governed by a\nmaximization principle; the union thus becomes analogous to a business\nfirm marketing a commodity.\n\nNone of these images is sufficiently accurate to provide a suitable\nbasis for an analysis of trade union policy. To be sure, any theoretical\nmodel must abstract from \"'the richness and complexity of behavior\"?\nAbstraction becomes falsification, however, when it so oversimplifies\nhuman behavior as to leave it unrecognizable and unexplained.\n\nThe nature of the union as a representative political agency should be\n\n* This article has been condensed from a chapter from a monograph, now in preparation,\nentitled Trade Union Wage Policy.\n\nThe author is a member of the staff of the School of Business Administration and Institute\nof Industrial Relations, University of California, Berkeley.\n\n1 J.

If they are not the final taxpayers, they act\nas a conduit for the money paid by other groups on its way to the Treas-\nury. The determination of what people or groups contribute the money\nwhich becomes the Treasury's tax revenue is the problem of tax inci-\ndence.!\n\nTaxes may, in addition, affect production, resource allocation, and the\ncomposition of products made available in the economy. Import taxes\nmay reduce (or increase) the volume of imports or alter the composition\nof imports. Domestically, the production of exports may be curtailed\nbecause of import taxes and the output of products for domestic sale\nmay be increased, and if the economy is not capable of sufficient ad-\njustment, import duties may lead to unemployment of resources. In\naddition to real effects, import taxes may alter the absolute level of the\nnational money income and change its distribution among various\nmembers of the community. In the present discussion, we shall endeavor\nto point out some of these effects. Our major concern here, however, is\nthe shifting and burden of import duties.\n\nActual schedules of import duties consist of a variety of rates ranging\nfrom zero to prohibitively high rates. In the United States, some items\nare taxed on an ad valorem basis, the tax base being the estimated pre-\nentry value of the item imported. Other items, such as vegetables and\nfish, are taxed at specific rates. For purposes of simplicity in analysis,\nwe shall deal in this paper primarily with uniform ad valorem rates on\n\n* The author is assistant professor of economics at the University of California.\n\n1 The terms \"burden\" and \"incidence\" are used interchangeably in this paper.

Although monetary manage-\nment entails some operations in the credit market, at least as between com-\nmercial banks and the central bank, the central bank need not become a\nparticipant in business dealings throughout the economy. Its dealings with\nmember banks can be largely impersonal and can be confined to a brief list\nof assets acceptable to the central bank. This view of the proper role of\nmonetary management requires the use of a few simple credit control de-\nvices of the quantitative type. Selective credit controls have no necessary\npart in such a scheme of things.\n\nThis view is obviously not in harmony with the current policies of the\nFederal Reserve authorities. It is not particularly helpful in pointing the\nway to an escape from the present muddle. However, if it is correct, an ap-\npreciation of it might have prevented the present situation from arising.\nFinally, it suggests that serious attention be given to resolving the problem\nof bank ownership of variable value government securities with the intent\nof developing a situation wherein traditional quantitative control devices\nmay again be utilized.??\n\nThe situation in the United States is now one in which the central bank\ncannot prevent member banks from obtaining additional reserves to sup-\nport deposits generated by new lending. The way to more reserves is open\nbecause of the commitment made to support the prices of government se-\ncurities. Thus if banks desire to expand, they cannot be restrained by central\nbank action. Selective credit control exercises a slight restraining force\nthrough reducing the demands of potential borrowers for funds, but is not an\nadequate substitute for control via the reserve position of member banks.\n\nEpwanp C.

This must have\ntended to divert funds from alternative uses. Margin control has prob-\nably discouraged purchasing of securities. Consumer credit control has\nprobably discouraged the buying of consumers goods, or at least the bidding\nfor them by certain potential buyers. The flow of funds through the credit\nmarket has unquestionably been modified in some degree.\n\nTo the extent that modification of outlays resulted from the rationing\nfactor represented in selective credit controls, this must have meant a\nsomewhat different set of relative price relationships than would otherwise\nhave existed. For example, during 1946 security prices and consumer goods\nprices were presumably lower than they otherwise would have been. If they\nwere not, then the Federal Reserve authorities did a great deal of work and\nendured much abuse to no purpose.\n\nThe appropriateness of inducing relative price movements by the indirect\nworkings of a system of selective credit controls needs a more adequate de-\nfense than has yet been advanced in any analysis that has come to the at-\ntention of the present writer. The malfunctioning of the economy is not\nlikely to be greatly reduced by this indirect method of influencing price\nrelationships. Selective credit control is at best a very inefficient means of\ncontrolling money outlays, for unless it is carried to the point of prohibiting\nentirely the use of borrowed funds the effect will be only to reduce somewhat\nthe volume of outlay with borrowed funds. Even if absolute prohibition is\nthe decided policy, expenditure from current income and from cash bal-\nances may still be excessive by the criteria of the controllers.\n\nThere are unquestionably occasions on which the machinery of the credit\nmarket functions badly with the result that large amounts of loanable funds\nflow into certain uses which would be better served by smaller amounts.\nThis is an inescapable result of having a free-market money economy in\nwhich borrowing and lending is permitted. Comprehensive credit rationing,\nif wisely administered, could unquestionably remedy that cause of economic\ninstability. There is, however, no reason to regard that sort of activity as\nmonetary management. Until the free-market economy has been demon-\nstrated to be unworkable it would seem to be advisable to hold to a minimum\nof governmental rationing of funds in the credit market. If that is one day\nfound to be required, the machinery for accomplishing it should not be\ncombined with the machinery for regulating the volume of the means of\npayment. Money creation and money lending are now combined because of\nthe accident of historical evolution. A rationalization of the financial ap-\nparatus of society should involve the separation of the functions.\n\nExtensive use of the powers of monetary management in their narrower\nsense of regulating the volume of the means of payment is not inconsistent\n",

                    "During the war years the Reserve authorities took the position that se-\nlective credit control had a significant function in preventing inflation.!\nThe importance attached to such devices is modified by recent emphasis\nupon controlling the volume of the means of payment.!? Selective credit con-\ntrols are, however, to be continued in use.\n\nTurning to the question of the effects of applying selective credit controls\non the economy, one finds in this type of regulatory device certain implica-\ntions of broad significance. Selective credit controls operate to some degree\nto restrict the total volume of credit transactions. Certain prospective bor-\nrowers are granted less funds than they would like to obtain. Others are\ndenied funds entirely. Unless large loopholes in the regulations exist, alter-\nnative sources of borrowing are not available. This may result in less de-\nposit expansion and hence serve to hold down the rate of monetary expan-\nsion. It may also oblige noncommercial bank lenders to build up their cash\npositions above the desired level, assuming that alternative outlets for in-\nvestment do not exist.\n\nAs a means of controlling bank deposit expansion, selective credit control\nseems to be a cumbersome method. Commercial banks do not have a mo-\nnopoly of any type of lending and therefore other lenders, as well as banks,\nmust be brought within the scope of the controls if banks are to be regulated.\nThis is clearly apparent in the case of consumer credit control which en-\ncompasses a very large number of business establishments. The area of\nmargin control is less extensive, but is still large in terms of the number of\npersons obliged to conform to administrative orders. As monetary control\ndevices, selective credit controls have many obvious drawbacks. They cer-\ntainly cannot accomplish control of the supply of money with the same\ndegree of exactness as the relatively simple reserves-reserve ratio apparatus.\nEqually effective control over the money supply would entail so large a\ndegree of regulatory activity as to raise seriously the question of the desir-\nability of nationalizing the lending function throughout the economy. Ob-\nviously this degree of intervention is unthinkable under present conditions.\nSo long as the area of selective controls is confined to a few types of loans,\nit is unlikely that banks will be restricted in expanding their total earning\nassets. Only if selective controls became general over all areas could there\nbe a general depressing effect on bank lending.\n\nOn the other hand, if monetary management is conceived of as encom-\npassing not only control of the aggregate number of dollars, but also the\noutlays of balance holders, selective credit control can obviously exert\nsome directive force over the type and amount of money outlay, for as was\nnoted earlier, borrowed funds are used in part by spenders. The Reserve\nauthorities have prevented funds from getting into the hands of persons who\nwould have spent them for purposes which have not been regarded as ap-\n",

After 1929, for exam-\nple, bank deposits contracted in part for this reason.!5\n\nAs to consumer credit control, the same two considerations apply. A\nboom in consumer goods purchases may induce booms in other sectors of the\neconomy. Also, since consumers borrow in part directly from banks and in\npart from other lenders, who in turn borrow from banks, a boom in con-\nsumer goods purchases may lodge volatile assets in the banks.\n\nThe volatile assets argument has meaning only if it is assumed that\nbanks obtain more reserves and expand deposits on the upswing and reduce\nreserves and contract deposits on the downswing. If they simply absorb and\nthen disgorge these volatile assets without an overall expansion and con-\ntraction of the money supply, there is little to be concerned about. The con-\ntagion of booms argument is not of great force either, unless it can be shown\nthat economic fluctuations are basically psychological phenomena. In any\nevent, the central bank has strayed somewhat from its purpose when it\nbecomes concerned with such matters. If it is careful to see that these booms\nare not fed with monetary fuel manufactured by itself, it has discharged\nits full responsibility. This view is not tbat of the Reserve Board, which\nseems to subscribe to the position that the central bank should control the\navailability of funds to certain classes of borrowers in order to prevent cer-\ntain types of outlays from becoming \"'excessive.\" The Reserve Board may,\ntherefore, be said to be motivated, in part, by the third consideration dis-\ncussed above. Credit policy is thus interpreted to mean regulation of lending\nitself and not merely regulation of lending in order to accomplish monetary\nmanagement.!6\n\nSelective credit control has taken on new importance in the changed en-\nvironment of the monetary world resulting from the absorption of large\namounts of government securities by the commercial banks and the central\nbank. Control of the reserve position of member banks by the use of open\nmarket operations, the discount rate, and the variable reserve ratio cannot\nbe undertaken if the Reserve authorities are also committed to a policy of\nsupporting the level and pattern of rates on government securities. This\npolicy, embarked on early in the war, has continued down to the present\ntime, and no indication has yet been given that its early abandonment is\ncontemplated.\n\nM Cf.

During the decade of the\n1920's, the Reserve authorities emphasized that funds should be used for\n\"productive\" purposes. The stock market boom severely tested this ration-\ning plan. Only partial success was achieved in keeping funds from flowing\nthrough the securities trading channel of the credit market.!!\n\nLegislative changes in the early 1930's strengthened the powers of the\nReserve authorities respecting the use of credit in stock market speculation.\nMember banks were made subject to severe penalties for undue use of\nfunds in speculation. In short, the Reserve authorities were placed in posi-\ntion to undertake genuinely effective rationing, even to the point of denying\naccommodation to recalcitrant member banks. In connection with the crea-\ntion in 1934 of public control machinery for the securities markets, the Re-\nserve Board was empowered to set margin requirements, so that brokers\nand brokers! customers may now even be rationed out of the credit market\nentirely, as they were during the greater part of 1946. Except for this\nperiod the rationing power has been used merely to limit the amount that\nmight be borrowed by a broker or a broker's customer to a stated percent-\nage of a given asset.?\n\nAlthough the Reserve authorities have long used the eligible paper con-\ncept and moral suasion to control the use of member bank funds, and thus\nto ration funds in the credit market, one should observe that under margin\ncontrol they have been authorized to ration the funds of lenders who, unlike\nmember banks, do not have access to borrowing at the Federal Reserve\nbanks. Although brokers secure their borrowed funds mainly from banks,\nthe way having been closed to *'loans for others,\" the point that the central\nbank is engaged in a rationing action not directly related to monetary man-\nagement should not be overlooked.\n\nAn extension of this principle is embodied in consumer credit control.\nProspective buyers of consumers' goods are restricted as to the amount of\nfunds that they may borrow and as to the period of availability of the funds.\nAgain, this is a rationing action not directly related to monetary manage-\nment.*\n\nTwo possible interpretations may be made of granting power to the cen-\ntral bank to ration funds of lenders who do not have direct access to the\ncentral bank. One is that lenders will, unless checked, make available too\nlarge a block of funds. The other is that, by controlling all lenders, commer\ncial banks will be brought under control with the result that the volume ot\navailable funds will not be swollen by bank credit expansion.\n\nAs to stock market credit, there seems to be general agreement that the\nbehavior of the prices of securities should not be a responsibility of the cen- '\ntral bank.

Maintenance of the solvency of banks\nof deposit is an inescapable requirement. Early abandonment of this\nregulatory activity should certainly not be urged. Restricting banks to\nreal bills type of assets has no sound theoretical basis, but a full repudiation\nof banking school doctrines has not yet been achieved. The final strand of\nthe argument that lenders should be constrained from making certain types\nof loans at certain times has not yet reached full theoretical development.\nIt is that aspect of the matter which will be explored here.\n\nSelective credit controls cannot accomplish much in the direction of con-\ntrolling the extent to which banks utilize their reserves. If only a few of the\nlarge number of outlets for bank funds are regulated, banks will expand in\nother directions. If stock market and consumer credit loans are restricted,\nother types of loans as well as investments will be available. The usefulness\nof selective credit controls must be found mainly in other aspects of their\nimpact on economic processes.\n\nAllocation of productive services in the economy is accomplished by\nmoney outlays, the funds for which are derived in part in the credit market.\nInstitutions which make loans therefore occupy a strategic position. Their\nallocations of funds are in part determined by price (money rates), but there\nis a substantial degree of market imperfection in credit transactions. Large\nelements of capital rationing characterize the credit market. Borrowers ob-\ntain funds by negotiating with lenders who grant or deny accommodation\non many considerations in addition to price.\" Commercial banks' lending\nactivities are characterized by rationing practices. Central banks also em-\nploy similar devices, in large part because they are operated by bankers who\napply customary business norms and practices. The central bank must at\ntimes apply effective means of stopping the drain of funds imposed upon it,\nand rationing is unquestionably an effective means. The Bank of England\nfrequently has resorted to rationing, popularly known as \"'the turn of the\nscrew.\" Rationing is a necessary part of the apparatus of controlling the\nmoney supply since control of lending is the means to that end.\n\nThe Federal Reserve authorities have made extensive use of rationing\ntechniques. The Federal Reserve System began operations in a climate of\nopinion which involved substantial adherence to theories of the banking\nSchool. Note issue and rediscounting were tied together for the purpose of\nproviding elasticity, the underlying source of which was to be self-liquidat-\ning trade paper. Paper eligible for rediscount was carefully defined with the\nresult that bank funds were rationed to the commercial loan sector of the\ncredit market. Moreover, the Reserve banks in dealing with member banks\nundertook to distinguish between paper that was \"'eligible\" and that which\nwas ''acceptable.\" Although World War I brought a significant modifica-\ntion of the meaning of eligible paper by allowing paper based on govern-\nment securities to be treated on equal terms with trade paper, the effect was\nmerely to widen the sector into which funds might flow.

There are many aspects in which this control\nmechanism works without great precision, but these must be passed over in\nthe interests of brevity.\n\nThe fact that the central bank is a lender must not be permitted to ob-\nscure the important truth that this activity is incidental to the main pur-\npose of the central bank. By lending more or less it can exert a powerful\ninfluence on the money supply. There are other variables, however, such as\ngold movements and currency movements, which must also be managed or\noffset. Similarly, commercial banks are lenders, and their lending activities\nalso are incidental to the basic purpose of achieving appropriate changes in\nthe money supply. In many respects it is unfortunate that the monetary\napparatus is combined with the capital funds supplying apparatus, but that\nmust not allow confusion to arise as to which is of basic importance. The\nmatter is further complicated by the practice of having the central bank ad-\nminister a substantial body of administrative law. This function has little\nto do with central banking in its essential purpose. Were control of the\nbusiness transactions of banks the significant matter, an agency similar to\nthe banking department of our state governments would suffice. It is not\nthat bank supervision is not of importance in keeping banks solvent and\nseeing that they are efficiently operated; the point is that such matters are\non another plane entirely.\n\nDespite general acceptance of the views set forth above, one finds that a\ngreat deal of attention has been given to the types of loans that central\nbanks and commercial banks may appropriately make. In part this is ex-\nplained by the many business failures that have occurred among institu-\ntions financed in large part by depositor type liabilities. The necessity of\nconfining the assets of such institutions to a type whose value is reasonably\nstable has been recognized with the result that an elaborate apparatus of\npublic control has been created to assure the solvency of banks of deposit.\nIn part, also, concern with bank assets is explainable in terms of the rather\ngeneral public acceptance of the real bills doctrine, the weaknesses of which\nhave now been sufficiently exposed so that no serious thought need be given\nto this set of rules for conducting bank operations.? Finally, concern with\nbank assets is explainable in terms of a view that economic activity may be\ncontrolled by bringing under control the rate of money outlay. Since out-\nlays are made in part with borrowed funds, and since banks are lenders,\ncontrol of the lending activities of banks will allow outlays to be regu-\nlated. These three explanatory factors seem to account for the tendency\n\ncustomer loan transactions or through purchase and sale of open market instruments, such as\ngovernment securities. Although the discussion here runs in terms of lending, the generalargu-\nment applies to purchase and sale of investment securities.\n\n?

                    "The machinery of central banking has been created, perhaps in part un-\nintentionally, in order to make the volume of the means of payment a man-\nageable variable. Liabilities of banks, either :n the form of bank notes or\ndeposits transferable by check, have become the predominant form of\nmoney in the modern economy. In the absence of a central bank the volume\nof such liabilities may behave in an awkward fashion. The national bank-\ning system demonstrated in repeated panics that a rigid supply of money\nresults in serious difficulties. Some means must be at hand for releasing cash\ninto the economy on occasion. Only in that way can a general movement\nfrom other assets into cash be permitted. Usually a moderate release of cash\nwill serve to satisfy the demand, but under some circumstances very large\namounts are needed. Obviously any holder of free funds could perform this\nfunction.5 But a wider view of central banking than the mere prevention of\npanics has come to be accepted. Varying the volume of the means of pay-\nment is a powerful device for controlling the level of economic activity.\nAlthough there is not general agreement as to the proper occasions or the\nproper criteria for increasing and decreasing the aggregate money supply,\nalmost every one agrees that discretionary management of money should\nbe practiced.*\n\nControl of the aggregate of deposits is possible because commercial bank-\ning institutions are obliged to maintain specified reserves, usually in the\nform of deposits with the central bank, in proportion to deposit liabilities.\nThe Federal Reserve authorities have a number of means of varying the\ntotal amount of reserve balances held by commercial banks and may also\nvary reserve ratios within a specified range. This relatively simple apparatus\npermits substantial if not complete and precise management of the volume\nof dollars in aggregate cash balances. Implementation of monetary control\nentails creating means by which the aggregate deposit liabilities of member\nbanks may be altered. This aspect of the matter brings one face to face with\nthe dual character of banks which operate both as capital suppliers and\nmoney creators. At least as early as Ricardo, this dualism was clearly recog-\nnized.\" Monetary control, therefore, must be implemented through operat-\ning on the lending activities of both the central bank and the commercial\nbanks. If the money supply is to be expanded there must be more lending\nat both levels, and if there is to be contraction, there must be less lending.*\n\n5 Cf. C. O. Hardy, Credit Policies of the Federal Reserve System (Washington, The Brookings\nInstitution, 1932), pp. 30-31. To the extent that idle funds exist in the economy the position of\nthecentral bank is weakened, particularly if balance holders tend to release cash when the cen-\ntral bank is applying a restraining influence or vice versa. Autonomous velocity changes are un-\nquestionably troublesome, for as monetary theory recognizes, money outlays may change\nwithout a change in cash balances.\n\n5 The gold standard case is no exception. Even under it the central bank is supposed to pro-\nvide by management much of the automatic character of this system.\n\n? Ricardo in 1834 gave a very clear statement of the dualism in his \"Plan for the Establish-\nment of a National Bank.\" For a recent appraisal of the significance of this dualism, see L.

One's position as to whether or not consumer credit control and other\nselective credit controls should be exercised by the Federal Reserve authori-\nties depends on what purpose one sees in the existence of the Federal\nReserve System. There can be no doubt that the twelve Federal Reserve\nbanks and the co-ordinating machinery represented by the Board of Gover-\nnors and the Open Market Committee constitute a central bank. Certain\naspects of Treasury activity also have a central banking character and are\nmore or less imperfectly co-ordinated with Federal Reserve operations. It\ngoes without saying that better co-ordination must be somehow accom-\nplished if the potential of monetary management is to be realized. One\nmust begin by examining the raison d'\u00e9tre of central banking.\n\n1 The war emergency powers are contained in Executive Order No. 8843 (Aug. 9, 1941).\nThe Board's position respecting statutory authority has been explained by Chairman Eccles\nas motivated by a desire to see the power to regulate consumer credit extended and vested ina\npublic body. He himself has expressed a disinclination to \"taking on this additional load.\"\nFederal Reserve Bulletin, Vol. XX XII (1946), p. 1234. For the Board's statement, see Thirty.\nsecond Annual Report of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (1945), pp. 24-25,\n\n? See Thirtieth Annual Report of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (1943),\np.22.\n\n3 See L. W. Mints, A History of Banking Theory (Chicago, Univ. of Chicago Press, 1945),\npp. 258-59.\n\n! An excellent review of the controversy will be found in the Mints study. Hence no attempt\nis made here to review the position of the disputants.\n",

                    "Methods of Visual Presentation and the Teaching of Economics\n\nThe present re-examination of the undergraduate economics curriculum\noffers a unique opportunity for an appraisal of the role which visual aids\nmay play in the presentation and analysis of economic problems at the\nelementary level. The general argument in favor of making use of visual aids\nin the process of learning will be readily agreed upon. It was succinctly ex-\npressed by John Dryden more than 300 years ago. In his Essay of Dramatic\nPoesy Dryden spoke of our eyes as **our strongest witnesses.\" By co-ordinat-\ning the written or spoken word with diagrams and picture symbols we are\nappealing to two senses instead of one. Because our visual memory is our\nbest aid in retaining perceptions and impressions an appeal to our eyes is\nfrequently more effective than the spoken word. More than this, by mak-\ning it possible to use our eyes in the process of learning, the grasping of\ndifficult problems is facilitated. In fact, what appears to be a complex re-\nlationship, if orally explained, may become simple by an appeal to the eye.\nOn the other hand, *'it is unnecessary to say in words, what we are able to\nmake clear by pictures.\" AII this is especially true for the beginning student\nin any given field of knowledge.\n\nThus far, most attempts of using methods of visual presentation in eco-\nnomic analysis have been confined to essentially static problems.

The fact that this plan made the private\nbanks retailers, rather than manufacturers of credit, did not deter him from\nurging the plan with all his ardor.\n\nNor did he neglect scientific interests in his later years. The thinker was\nnot swallowed alive by the propagandist. He refined and revised his interest\ntheories, developed new methods for measuring the marginal utility of\nmoney and interested himself in the theory of income taxation. Having re-\nceived virtually every honor which the scientific world could confer, he died\nthis April shortly after celebrating his eightieth birthday.\n\nIn Irving Fisher, the much criticized New England tradition displayed\nitself at its best.

The task of stabilizing our economy and the relations\nbetween nations was, of course, too great for even his ability and energies,\nbut one cannot but be inspired by his gallant ventures.

He car-\nried on a vigorous campaign to put this reform into effect and founded and\nlargely financed the Stable Money Association to promote its adoption.\n\nHis analysis of price changes led him into the theory of index numbers in\norder better to measure and control such changes, and in 1922 he published\nhis exhaustive book on that subject. In this, he advocated as an \"ideal\" in-\ndex a geometric average of the Paasche and Lespeyres formulae.\n\nIn the meantime Fisher's reformistic activities had found a full flowering.\nBeginning with the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, he labored to improve\nthe health of the public. He helped to induce President Theodore Roosevelt\nto set up the Committee on National Vitality and was largely responsible\nfor its pathbreaking report. He was one of the founders of the Life Exten-\nsion Institute and with its director, E. L. Fisk, wrote a book on hygiene en-\ntitled How to Live. A confirmed opponent of alcohol, on moralistic as well as\nhygienic grounds, he was active in getting the Prohibitory Amendment\nadopted and during the 'twenties was one of its most ardent defenders. His\nzeal in this direction was not always balanced by the scientific precision\nwhich he observed in other matters and his two little books, Prohibition at\nIts Worst and Prohibition Still at Its Worst did not exhibit his talents at their\nbest. Fisher regarded tobacco to be only one degree less evil than alcohol and\ncarried on a series of skirmishes against it which, had they met with encour-\nagement, he might well have turned into a major crusade.

Believing firmly in the League of Nations, he stumped the country re-\npeatedly in its behalf and as president of the American Association for\nLabor Legislation worked for better factory legislation and for the extension\nof social insurance.\n\nIn the'twenties, Fisher, like so many others, becamesomewhat carried away\nby the rise of production and by the stock market boom. Already wealthy,\nboth by family possession and by his invention of a visible filing index and\nthe successful conduct of the business based upon it, he made large addi-\ntional amounts by speculation. All this caused him to become one of the\nmost optimistic exponents of the doctrine that we were in a new economic\nera and he was, consequently, very slow in reconciling himself to the reality\nof the Great Depression which began in October, 1929.\n\nBut once aware of what was going on, he was indefatigable in urging mon-\netary reforms which he thought would restore prosperity. He advocated the\nuse of stamp scrip, somewhat after the fashion of Gesell, in order to speed\nup the circulation of money and to prevent hoarding and, with Professor\nWarren, helped to persuade Franklin D. Roosevelt to devaluate the gold\ncontent of the dollar in 1933 as a means of raising the internal price level.\n\nIn his early work, Fisher had slighted the role of bank credit, making this\nlargely depend on the stock of money. His attempts at stabilization were,\ntherefore, directed at the money rather than the credit terms of the equa-\ntion of exchange. When, however, in the early 30'sa group at the University\nof Chicago, under the leadership of the late Henry C. Simons, developed a\nplan for a 100 per cent reserve system in which the amount of bank credit\n",

Born in 1867 of an old\nNew England family, Fisher graduated from Yale in 1888 and then contin-\nued his graduate study at that institution. His early interests were in the\nfield of mathematics and physics and he was one of the cherished students\nof the justly celebrated Willard Gibbs. From 1890 to 1895 he was a member\nof the Yale mathematics faculty and later brought out texts in geometry and\ncalculus. In 1892 he published, as his doctor's thesis, the extraordinarily\nbriliant Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices,\nwhich despite the passage of more than half a century is still as clear and\nprofound an exposition of utility analysis as is anywhere extant.\n\nTransferring his professional attentions to economics, he stimulated his\ncousin Nathaniel Bacon to translate Cournot and prepared a bibliography\nof mathematical economics for this edition. But his life was threatened by\na severe attack of tuberculosis and for three years he struggled for his health\nin Colorado and California. This was in a sense the emotional turning point\nof his career. Prior to this time he had seemed to some of his students cold\nand aloof in manner and somewhat lacking in warm human sympathy. But\nthe facing of death gave to him, as to so many others, greater appreciation\nof the value of human personality and upon his return he flung himself into\nan almost unparallelled combination of acute professional investigation\njoined to an energetic and devoted activity for the public welfare. In quick\nsuccession he published remarkable books on A ffreciation and Interest, The\nNature of Capital and Income and his masterly Rate of Interest. In all of\nthese he combined a mathematical precision of thought and exposition with\na keen analysis of utility theory.\n\nFisher then turned his attention to the general increase in the price level\nwhich had been going on since 1896 and further developed the quantity\ntheory of money as an explanation for this change.

                    "Rigid exchange rates were believed productive of unemployment rather\nthan of confidence; the opinion has prevailed in Britain that her difficulties\nin the early 'thirties were largely explainable by adherence to a high rate for\nthe pound sterling when she returned to gold in 1925. Certain politically\nimportant sections of British opinion adopted an even more uncompromis-\ning view: exchange control was believed to offer more scope than a buffer of\nforeign exchange resources would be able to do in achieving the freedom of\ndomestic economic action indispensable to assure full employment. Like all\ncountries unable to acquire scarce currencies in adequate amounts, Britain\nplaces her faith in the hope that stable exchange rates will follow from a\nhigh level of trade and employment.5\n\nAn extreme view on the unimportance of stable exchanges as the basis for\nfull employment has been adopted by Australia, the most outspoken oppo-\nnent of the American position at Bretton Woods. Fearing a recurrence of\nthe situation of the \"thirties, when the depression in industrial countries had\na magnified effect on the economies of nations producing raw materials,\nAustralia wants to know how the former intend to maintain a high level of\nincomes. If employment and incomes abroad are prevented from collapsing,\nraw material producers and agricultural countries will not worry about ex-\nchange rates. If not, any assistance the Fund could give would be inade-\nquate. Another country relying mainly on domestic employment policies is\nSweden. According to recent statements she wishes to continue her prewar\npolicy of price stabilization. A committee of experts appointed by the Riks-\nbank in May, 1943, concluded that employment should be stabilized by\nadhering to the price program that had served so well in the past; there\ncould be no unconditional pegging of exchange rates because of the difficulty\nof reconciling this action with the basic objectives of domestic monetary\npolicy. Through especially close economic relations with the **Nordic bloc\"\nthe effects of insulation would be minimized and, as occasion offered, the\nSwedish economy would be linked more closely with the world economy.\n\nFinally, in the opinion of economists in some nations the major cause of\nunemployment throughout the world in the interwar period was the impact\nof the American depression and economic policies. Irrespective of the justice\nof this view, its acceptance denotes a reluctance to be closely joined with\nAmerica's economic fortunes. It is a problem for some countries to decide\nwhether to rely on the consumers! market in the United States, or to turn\ntheir attention to European and other markets.\n\n5 An important school of thought in the United States emphasizes the role that must be\nplayed by high levels of employment in bringing about exchange stability. Thus Alvin Hansen,\nin America's Role in the World Economy (New York, Norton, 1945), points out that imports are\ngenerally regarded as desirable only where there is full employment. One infers that with full\nemployment, payments balance, and there is no pressure on exchanges. It should be noted that\nthere is no reason to believe that stable exchanges must result from full employment.\n\n5 Tn the opinion of the Australian delegation the purposes of the Fund, which provide cri-\nteria for its management, place too little emphasis on the promotion and maintenance of high\nlevels of employment, and too much emphasis on the promotion of exchange stability and on\nshortening the duration and lessening the degree of disequilibrium in international balances of\npayments.\" Statement by the delegation of Australia concerning Article I of the Articles of\nAgreement of the International Monetary Fund.\n",

Indeed, full employment has become\nthe primary economic objective in a majority of the industrial countries\ntoday. It is this fact that makes the differing conceptions of the best way to\nachieve full employment an important obstacle to international monetary\ncooperation.\n\nThe employment philosophy of the United States is of major importance\nboth because of her predominant position in the international economy and\nin the management of the Fund, and because in the past she has not been\nvery successful in maintaining full employment. Although the original\nTreasury plan placed the emphasis entirely on stability of exchange rates\nand of international trade, the American experts became more and more\nimpressed with the part that the Fund might be able to play in stimulating\nemployment. Considerable publicity was given by Treasury and State De-\npartment spokesmen to Paragraph II of the Purposes of the Fund, which\nemphasizes the role of stable exchange rates in achieving a high rate of\nemployment through high levels of international trade.* It was set forth\nthat, freed from doubts concerning their ability to maintain the parities of\ntheir currencies, and sure of adequate supplies of scarce currencies to tide\nthem over any period of industrial readjustment, countries would be willing\nto accept imports from nations able to send goods abroad after a long con-\nflict. Thus production and employment in the United States, for example,\nwould immediately rise, incomes would remain high, and a portion would\nbe spent on imports from abroad. The fact that American industry would\nbenefit first would not hurt the export industries of other countries, since\nthroughout the world in general large imports of raw materials, machinery,\nand equipment would be needed before industries were ready to export.\n\nThe optimism of the American experts was unfortunately not shared by\nthe representatives of most other nations. Reports from London at the time\nof the Bretton Woods conference indicated that in the opinion of the\nBritish government, any international commitment must be subordinated\nto certain domestic objectives, namely, (1) stable employment, (2) control\nover the internal price level, and (3) an assured position for the United\nKingdom in the sterling bloc. In other words, Britain would insist on re-\ntaining control over the volume of employment and real income at home.\n\n5 Article I (ii) : \"To facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade, and\nto contribute thereby to the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and\nreal income and to the development of the productive resources of all members as primary ob-\njectives of economic policy.\"\n",

Although the problem is fundamentally one of foreign exchange, the\ndesire for austerity is carried so far that at times one might suppose that\nit is being practiced for its own sake. For example, Britain dislikes to accept\nFrench \"luxury\" goods in payment of surplus British exports to France.\nYet Britain has a surplus of francs; and it comes down to an exchange mat-\nter after all, since the British would like, if possible, to convert these francs\ninto currencies usable for the purchase of raw materials and equipment.\nThe alternative (unacceptable to the French) would be the repurchase of\nthese francs with exports of investment goods needed by France for her own\nrehabilitation. The adverse effect on international monetary cooperation of\nthis attitude is obvious. Some countries may be relatively well endowed\nwith the resources best used for the production of non-essentials; if a dis-\nability is placed on imports of this type, these countries are likely to find it\ndifficult or impossible to make the correction of maladjustments for which\nthe Fund is intended to give time and financial resources.\n\nAnother illustration of lack of confidence in the accomplishments of in-\nternational monetary stabilization is the widespread desire for close financial\nand economic relations with particular countries or trading areas. The meth-\nods used by the Russians to create a trading bloc in eastern Europe are\nopposed to the objectives of the Fund. The system of bilateral financial and\ntrade agreements sponsored by Britain throughout western Europe, might\nprove incompatible with a general accord. Other European countries are\nbuilding up similar frameworks, for example, France and the Scandinavian\ncountries. \"These agreements do indeed contain the provision that later ad-\nherence to an international fund is not prejudiced; but the pacts themselves\nprovide for what is in effect a network of bilateral exchange clearing, a\ndevice that throttled international trade during the 'thirties; and in any\ncase, they put the emphasis on exclusive economic blocs. It follows that\nadherence to the Fund would imply that all countries refrain from imposing\nconditions on the disposition of any balances of exchange accruing to them.\nBut the resources of the Fund alone could not be counted upon to remove\nthe desire of countries with unfavorable trade balances to try to insist upon\nexchange clearing. To accomplish this, properly rationed and adequate loans\nwould have to be made from other sources. The enormous dollar exchange\nresources contemplated under the Keynes plan would, indeed, have made\nall countries more willing to sacrifice the immediate benefits of bilateral\nclearing than did the plan ultimately adopted. The American negotiators\nknew, however, that the Keynes plan was politically out of the question in\nthe United States; on the other hand, perhaps something like the same\neffect could be achieved by an extensive system of United States long-term\nloans. Gradually commitments are being made that in the aggregate promise\nto compare ultimately with the volume of dollars provided for under the\nInternational Clearing Union proposal of Lord Keynes.

To the former some of the features of inter-\nnational monetary cooperation as defined in the Articles of Agreement of\nthe Fund do not look attractive. Their position as industrial nations is\nshaky. Not only must they struggle to retain their recently acquired posi-\ntion as exporters of manufactured goods, but they expect to be threatened\neven in their home markets as rehabilitation of Western Europe proceeds.\nThey may be counted upon to fight to retain their position, and in doing so\nare virtually certain to employ some trade practices quite inconsistent with\nthe spirit of the Fund.\n\nA more unfortunate, but rather understandable, aspect of the economic\nnationalism of the newly industrialized countries is the dislike (expressed\nparticularly in Latin America) at being called upon to lend domestic cur-\nrencies through the Fund to their western European competitors. It seems\nfoolish to them to hasten the day when competition from abroad becomes\nmore acute; lending to devastated countries through the Fund would\nshorten the time when the latter would be producing solely for home mar-\nkets. Presumably this is a form of the infant industries argument: since\nthese countries hold the view that the war merely hastened an inevitable\nindustrialization, they draw the conclusion that Europeans cannot expect\nto recover their former share in Latin American markets, and by implication\nthey appear to minimize the importance to themselves of the European\nmarket for their raw materials. Furthermore, they apparently doubt\nEurope's ability to supply them with the heavy machinery and new types\nof industrial products that they will need. Otherwise, they could hardly view\nwith apprehension the revival of Europe's industry. Latin American na-\ntions have shown a disposition to cooperate with the Fund despite this\nobjection. That they do so is attributable in part to an appreciation of other\nadvantages derivable from international monetary cooperation, and in part\nto the probability that in one way or another the United States will assist\nin the rehabilitation of European industry. In other words, the cost, in\nterms of good will, of non-cooperation with the Fund would be excessive.*\n\nThe hesitancy of newly industrialized countries to accept all the objec-\ntives of international monetary cooperation is matched by a similar hesi-\ntancy on the part of the countries, particularly in Europe, whose industry\nhas been worn out or destroyed during the war. Imports of raw materials\n\n* The point of view outlined above has, of course, been urged by opponents of the Fund in\nthe United States. Why, it is asked, provide dollar resources through the Fund and the bank to\npotential competitors who will thereby be enabled earlier to compete with us abroad, and even\nin our home markets? It is difficult to imagine a more defeatist point of view. The United States\nhas ended the wat with nearly every conceivable export advantage. The furnishing of dollars\nthrough long-term loans and through the Fund augments the demand for our goods. Our only\nproblem is to maintain our great lead in industrial efficiency, and it is evident that for years to\ncome the real difficulty will be to find enough competitive goods from abroad to maintain pur-\nchasing power for our own exports. It should be noted that the above refers to industry as a\nwhole; it is not concerned with export dif\u00fcculties facing particular industries, for example,\ncotton.\n"

On the\nother hand, toward the end of the war, when the Bretton Woods plan was\nbroached, many nations were sharply faced with the problem of maintaining\ninternal currency values; stability of exchange rates was, for the time being,\na derivative and secondary matter. It was understood that if currencies were\nstabilized after the war, the likelihood of obtaining large imports of the raw\nmaterials and other goods needed to ward off inflation would be greater.\nOn the other hand, this seemed like a very indirect, and relatively ineffec-\ntive, way of solving the problem of stimulating home production and re-\nlieving domestic inflation. Countries were prone to place more reliance on\ndomestic policies, particularly since some of the most pressing financial diffi-\nculties seemed to have been occasioned by the international economic co-\noperation enforced by the war. All this meant that despite adherence to a\nstabilization proposal, preoccupation with domestic concerns might lead to\nthe fundamental disequilibrium\" that must be accepted by the Fund asa\nvalid reason for allowing a change in the par value of a nation's currency.\n\nAlthough the great majority of nations have acceded to the objectives of\nthe Fund, there is an understandable reluctance to allow control over ex-\nchange rates to pass to an international body. No country would permit\nanother single country to determine the external value of its currency.\nWould it be much more acceptable, in the present state of international re-\nlations, to allow an international executive body to do so? The answer de-\npends on how general is the belief in the disinterestedness of the executive\ndirectors of the Fund. Although the choices of personnel have been such as\nto inspire much confidence in the excellence of the management, of neces-\nsity they have had to reflect concentrations of national and regional power.\nConsequently, the less powerful the nation, the greater is the act of faith to\nbe performed. That this fact was clearly recognized at Bretton Woods is\nevidenced by the struggle between the Latin American and western Euro-\npean nations with respect to the allocation of executive directorships. Each\nbloc perceived that if the other was able to swing the vote of the directorship\non a proposed change in exchange rates, the result might be unfavorable to\nits own position in world trade: each expected to compete in the same mar-\nkets. Again, it is inevitable that smaller nations should fear the power of the\nlarger members of the Fund. Although the actions of the Fund will always\nbe carried out in the light of publicity, decisions will have to be made on\nexchange rate changes, and these decisions are bound to be less favorable\nto some nations than to others. With skillful and disinterested management,\nof course, the possible doubts of smaller nation can be removed.\n\nThe desire for independence with respect to exchange rates is particularly\n",

Considered simply by itself\nas a statement from the President of the United States on the national\neconomy in a critical year, it is a report that merits serious attention; but\nto the eye of a professional economist it appears much more than an isolated\npresidential message. It marks the beginning of a great experiment, the\nsuccess or failure of which might have profound consequences for the\neconomic and possibly even for the political structure of the United States\nand of other nations. Depending for its success on enlightened public con-\nsideration of major economic problems of the nation, the experiment is a\nventure in economic education on a grand scale, and it presupposes a con-\ntinuing distillation of critical knowledge and judgment on economic affairs\nwhich could significantly affect the development of economic science.\n\nAs an initial step in an economic experiment, this Report of the President\nmust be viewed against the background of the Great Depression of the\n1930's and the revolution in economic and political thinking which it en-\ngendered. Forcing action by national governments to remove or to soften\nits destructive effects, the depression brought wide acceptance of the\nview that governments of politically and economically advanced countries\nmust assume an ultimate responsibility for effective operation of the\nnational economy. They must see to it, in the common phrase, that con-\ntinuing '*'full employment\" is somehow provided.? There was left open as a\n\n1! Government Printing Office, Washington, 1947.\n\n? Thereis probably no short statement that could win even majority approval as accurately\nexpressing the responsibility of government; the Congress used over 100 words in the Employ-\nment Act of 1946 to state the obligation which it recognized. My own impression is that the\n'general view\" in countries of the western world now attributes to government a potential\nresponsibility greater than the declaration of policy of the Employment Act clearly expresses.\nAs L interpret the congressional hearings and debate, Congress undertook in the act to place\nelsewhere much of the responsibility which it knew must devolve on the federal government\nif not successfully carried by others.\n",

                    "382 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n\nNow the extent to which business men are in a state of \"alert\" and to\nwhich they are willing to make and to rely upon \"independent\" calculations\nis not a question which can be decided v\u00eda \"theorizing\" or even by feasible\nempirical research. However, at least some observers have not believed\nbusiness behavior to correspond very closely to the **marginal\" description,\nand deduction provides at least some evidence in support of such an ob-\nservation. In an economy where common costs are prevalent and joint costs\nnot infrequent,? where variables are numerous and mostly of complicated\nand uncertain nature, and where price decisions are only one type of worry,\nit would certainly be understandable if most business men usually decided\nto abide by accepted prices and/or rules until they were clearly proved\nwrong.\n\nMarginalism (broadly interpreted) as an explanation of price-rule changes\n(and of price movements in those cases where there are no ascertainable\nprice rules) is probably less subject to criticism than marginalism as an ex-\nplanation of the infrequency of change. Even in this respect, however, it\nprobably provides no more than a substantial part of the answer. Business\nmen, for the most part, do not appear to be either as avaricious or as dy-\nnamic or as logical as marginal theory portrays them; probably most of\nthem are too little money-loving, or too lazy, or too irrational seriously\nto attempt the prescribed marginal calculations. And while marginal\ntheory contains, no doubt, /his degree of truth: few business men would\nmake price or other changes if they did not expect greater profits (or smaller\nlosses) to ensue, the more restricted conclusion that the new prices are\nselected because they are expected to equate marginal revenue and marginal\ncost does not necessarily follow.?*\n\n\"The history of cartels probably has some relevance to this question of the\ndegree of validity of marginal analysis. Apparently most cartels have been\nformed to prevent or to minimize /osses;?5 and while profit maximization and\n\ndriver of an automobile has fewer distracting worries; the highway variables are more obvious\nand not nearly so numerous or complicated; frequent highway decisions made and results\nproved probably have led to greater confidence in \"independent\" decisions; and finally, either\ntheautomobile driver does not have an established rule-of-thumb upon which he thinks he can\nrely\u2014or, if he does rely upon such a rule without making a complicated \"snap\" calculation, he\nis not reasoning like a marginalist.\n\n2? For a discussion of the limitations of cost data, see the summarized report of an OPA study\nin M. L. Black, Jr. and Harold B. Eversole, *Cost Accounting in Price Determination,\" Jour.\nof Accountancy, November, 1946; also, Conference on Price Research, Cost Behavior and Price\nPolicy, pp. 282-87. In addition to pointing out the limitation of cost-accounting data, Professor\nBlack and Eversole argue that **OPA experience in thousands of cases clearly shows that proper\ncosting cannot be done by *rule-of-thumb' approximations or by intuition\" (o. cit., p. 371).\n\"This conclusion, of course, is as damaging to a hal\u00ed-way rigorous average-cost theory of pricing\nas to a half-way meaningful marginal theory.\n\n33 Again the lack of cost data, mentioned in footnote 22, may be emphasized. If business\nmen generally wished seriously to attempt the prescribed marginal calculations, it appears\nthat they would be more anxious to have more nearly adequate cost information.\n\n?* A comment made in footnote 13 also applies here. If business men do not consciously ra-\ntionalize, do they unconsciously follow marginal analysis very closely?\n\n?5 Economists who prefer to talk in average-cost terms express the same belief when they\nsay that cartels have usually been formed because price fell, or threatened to fall, below aver-\nage cost.\n",

If marginal theory is to\nbe an adequate, or almost adequate, theory of change, it must account not\nonly for the movements in prices, but also for the Jack of movement at other\ntimes; and, more importantly, it must explain why the price movements\nwhich do take place can frequently be at least immediately accounted for by\nreference to certain rules of thumb, such as *'full cost.\" Finally, when pricing\nrules are abandoned, marginal theory must explain not only the fact but also\nthe extent of alteration.\n\nA brief portrayal of the marginal theory's business man may serve to\nindicate some of the reasons for doubting the theory's adequacy. If business\nmen prevailingly think along marginal lines, they must be in a continuous\nstate of \"alert,\" ready to change prices and/or pricing rules whenever their\nsensitive intuitions (rightly or wrongly) detect a change in demand or sup-\nply conditions (for the relevant time period, whether short or long). Mar-\nginal theory (broadly interpreted) does not postulate continuous change in\nprices, and still less does it postulate continuous departures from established\npricing rules, since \"short-run\" developments may not be expected to alter\nsupply and demand \"curves\" for a relevant longer time period; but margin-\nalism does postulate continuous readiness to change. It is not logically\ncompatible with either an easy-going or complacent attitude out of which a\nbusiness man must be shocked into alertness, or a state of mind so engrossed\nwith non-pricing matters that the business man usually has neither the\nability nor the willingness seriously to consider price or policy changes.\nEspecially, marginal theory is not consistent with that sort of conservatism\nwhich results in clinging to an established practice until events clearly show\nit to be unwise, or, in other words, with that type of cautiousness which\nleads a man to believe that his independent\" calculations probably would\nbe wrong even if he made them and that it is safer to stick by the siaius\nquo or the \"rules.\"?\n\n?? Tnattention to states-of-being appears to be partly responsible for Professor Machlup's\nsuggestion that cartel and oligopolistic use of a \"full cost\" pricing policy can be adequately ex-\nplained in terms of the relationship of average cost to long-run elasticity of demand (ibid.,\npp. 542-44). If a price equal to full cost\" is already quoted, cartel members and oligopolists\nmay well fear, for elasticity-of-demand reasons, to depart from it. Elasticity-of-demand con-\nsiderations do not, however, adequately explain why a price equal to \"full cost\" was selected\nin the first place. Analysis of both cartel and oligopolistic selection of prices leads to the con-\nclusion that only rarely would a \"full cost\" price maximize profits.\n\n7! Professor Machlup argues that the cost and revenue figures of marginal theory are merely\n\"subjective\" guesses and hunches. Concerning the \"subjectivity\" of these estimates, there is\nno dispute. However, if business men believe that their guesses are foorly informed, they will\nbe inclined to play safe and not make changes as long as all goes well.\n\nIn describing a business man's reasoning, Professor Machlup refers to the analogy of an\nautoist who makes a snap judgment to pass, or not to pass, a truck. But the analogy is not an\napt one. There is a greater penalty for the autoist's lack of alertness; usually, at least, the\n",

A perhaps more\nformidable obstacle consists of the business men's statements; the dis-\nclaimers of marginal thinking must be proved to be very largely wrong.\nProbably the most formidable obstacle of all to the seekers of empirical\nevidence of the validity of marginalism, however, is the fact that, quite\napart from business men's statements, marginal theory does not seem to be\neven a nearly adequate explanation of business behavior. Some of the\nreasons for this conclusion are set forth in Section IV of this paper.\n\nProfessor Machlup, in the course of his attack on the antimarginalists,\nfinds some positive support for the validity of marginalism in the move-\nments of price-full cost margins. Evidence of the incompleteness or un-\ntenability of the average-cost thesis can be found, he says, in the fact that\nsuch margins vary among different firms at the same time, for the same firm\nat different times, and among different products of the same firms.\n\nThis, however, is very limited evidence, since about all that it definitely\nindicates is that a simple average-cost theory of pricing is incomplete. 'The\nevidence does not indicate whether firms attempt to maximize profits or are\ncontent with some less ambitious goal such as \"fair\" or \"satisfactory\"\nprofits.

As the\nabove paragraph states, the evidence does not in any way prove that maximum profit rather\nthan \"fair profit\" (over a period of time) is a firm's goal. Therefore, all that is necessary to fit\nthe evidence into an \"average-cost\" explanation is to define average cost as \"total expenses of\nthe firm during the relevant time period, divided by total output\" (with no distinction made\nbetween different types of output), and price as \"*total revenue of the firm during the relevant\ntime period, divided by total output\" (again with no distinction among different types of out-\nput). Employment of the definitions and the derived principle would not be a very instructive\nway of saying that the firm in question was trying to make a \"fair\" profit over a given time\nperiod, however. This wordplay has been introduced merely to illustrate again the conclusions\nthat can follow from expanded definitions.

Moreover, the approach of the\nempiricists whom he criticized invited, in a way, the adoption of a burden-\nof-proof attitude.'? It is only fair to point out, however, that in a court of\nlaw or a formal debating society the judge or the rules committee would\nnever allow the controversy to take the form in which it has so far been\npresented. For, if business men say that they think in average-cost terms,\nthen, if the burden of proof rests upon anyone at all (and it should not in\neconomic discussion), it rests on the marginalists who do not believe the\nbusiness man, rather than on the economic iconoclasts who (with modifica-\ntions of varying importance) take him at his word. Any economist is logi-\ncally free to be sceptical of the accuracy and/or honesty of the business\nmen's claim; but the fact that conventional economic analysis has been\nbuilt upon the rock of marginalism is not sufficient for more than an opening\nscepticism.^ Empirical evidence must be offered, if the Rules of Order are\nto be obeyed. And, as Professor Machlup points out in his criticism of the\nantimarginal empiricists,5 the evidence must not be subject to interpreta-\ntion in alternative ways. In this case, the evidence must be logically con-\nsistent only with marginal theory.\n\nNow there is no intent to argue here that considerable evidence of margi-\nnal thinking (especially in the broader sense of that term) cannot be found.\nCost Behavior and Price Policy, for instance, refers to numerous examples.!5\nBut securing a sufficiently great body of empirical evidence to establish a\nstrong empirical case for the general validity of marginal theory would\nprobably be an impossible undertaking.\n\nOne obstacle here, of course, would be merely the general difficulty of\nsecuring \"clinching\" empirical evidence of any type; that is, even when\n\n7 [.e,, both Professor Lester's article and the Oxford economists\" paper imply an attitude of\n\"testing\" marginaltheory, rather than two or more alternative theories. (Richard A. Lester, of.\ncit., and R. L. Hall and C. J. Hitch, o5 cit.)\n\n13 Professor Machlup believes that usually they do not consciously rationalize (o5. cit.,\np. 541). This leads to the \"psychological\" question of whether, if business men believe that their\n\"real\" as well as their immediate pricing policy is average-cost-plus-a-percentage, it is likely\nthat their decisions will be exactly, or almost exactly, the same as those which they would make\nif they were fully aware of their motives. Economists attempting to answer such a question, of\ncourse, are *aymen,\" not technicians.\n\nIt might also be added that economists are *Jaymen\" when they tackle the problem of\nrationalization in any form. There is the possibility, for instance, that, for numerous business\nmen, Professor Machlup has described in reverse the rationalization process. As philosophers\nhavelong emphasized, thereis a subtle process through which means tend to become ends. Per-\nhaps, in this sense, business conservatives believe that \"full cost\"' is a profitable pricing policy\nbecause they proclaim allegiance to it, rather than proclaim allegiance to it because they believe\nit a profitable policy.\n\n1 A burden-of-proof defense of marginalism is similar to the position taken by business-cycle\ntheorists who insist that cyclical analysis must begin by explaining why the economy defarted\nfrom a state of equilibrium. Both attitudes rest upon the assumption that a logically constructed\ntheory has an empirical validity because of its sheer logic.\n\n15 Machlup, of. cit., p. 537 ff.\n\n1* Conference on Price Research, Cost Behavior and Price Policy, pp. 267-88.\n",

This statement is 20! a tautology, however, unless the phrase\n\"attempt to equate marginal cost and marginal revenue\" is by definition\nmade synonomous with \"attempt to maximize profit.\" Instead, it is er-\nroneous. There is no logical necessity that a business man make even the\nroughest of calculations concerning (broadly defined) marginal revenue and\nmarginal cost before believing that a certain policy (say, percentage mark-\nup) will yield the greatest profit. Indeed, frequently there is no economic\nnecessity that he reason marginally if he is to succeed. Ability to make use of\nmarginal analysis is neither an invariable requirement nor an invariable\npromise of business success\u2014as economic professors should be the first to\nemphasize.\n\nWhether business men usually do, in some imperfectly quantitative way,\nreason marginally (in the broad sense of that term) if they wish to maximize\nprofits, is, of course, another question. Economic analysis is not aided by\nthe assumption that they must.\n",

This arises from\nthe facts that part of the marginal revenue (broadly defined) from good-\nwill sales consists of profits on future sales and that the marginal revenue\nfrom a later sale is not diminished by the allocation of its profit portion to a\nmarginal revenue of the past. Some truly impressive discrepancies between\nthe two totals can be demonstrated. Assume a firm with a hard-boiled\npurchasing agent who will for all time transfer his trade from any supplying\nfirm which refuses to accept any order placed with it. Then each time that\nthe supplying firm accepts an order from this purchasing agent, the margi-\nnal revenue derived from the sale equals the sales price plus the profits from\nall future sales.

Psychologically,\ntherefore, it is probably sounder not to include such calculations in the\nmarginal-cost and marginal-revenue figures, however logically they can be\nfitted in. Moreover, omission of such consideration from marginal cost and\nmarginal revenue would eliminate an unnecessary pedagogical headache.\nAfter learning about the \"curves,\" students may be able to *unlearn\" them\nand acquire the broader concepts of marginal cost and marginal revenue;\nbut almost certainly they will not have the intellectual curiosity or the\nability to go back and make such changes as are required in the demand\n"

                    "cost.? Professor Machlup apparently defines marginal revenue as ''any ad-\nditional income expected to result either directly or indirectly from the ac-\ntion in question,\" and marginal cost as \"any additional outgo expected to\nresult either directly or indirectly from the action.\"^\n\nNow there is no question of the logical permissibility of Professor Mach-\nlup's definitions. Not only is there present the usual freedom of definitional\nchoice, but also there is a decided kinship between an additional income\naccruing in manner A and another additional income accruing in manner B,\nand between an avoidable expense occurring in manner X and another\navoidable expense occurring in manner Y.\n\nNevertheless, the narrower marginal definitions are probably methodo-\nlogically more helpful. Professor Machlup himself has indicated the chief\nweakness of his own broader definitions in his criticism of the expansion of\nmarginal theory to include non-pecuniary gains. '^There are,\" he says, **eco-\nnomic theorists who would include considerations of this sort among the\ndata for the marginal calculus of the firm. . . . It seems to me to be meth-\nodologically sounder if we do not reduce the non-pecuniary satisfactions and\ndissatisfactions . .. to money terms and try to make them part of the\nprofit-maximization scheme of the firm. If whatever a business man does is\nexplained by the principle of profit-maximization . . . the analysis acquires\nthe character of a system of definitions and tautologies, and loses much of\nits value as an explanation of reality.\"5\n\nThis is precisely the leading criticism of the expanded definitions of\nmarginal revenue and marginal cost. If marginal revenue is defined to in-\nclude every possible consideration concerning rises and falls in gross income,\nand if marginal cost is defined to include every possible consideration con-\ncerning avoidable costs, the statement that a business man trying to maxi-\nmize profits will attempt to equate marginal revenue and marginal cost is\nmerely a *\"highbrow\" and awkward way of saying that he will consider\neverything that may increase his income and everything that may increase\nhis outgo and then try to strike the best balance. The marginal phraseology\nadds nothing to our understanding. It merely places a language barrier\nbetween the economist and the layman and introduces an element of con-\nfusion by giving unwary analysts the impression that there are only two\nrelevant variables instead of, say, 202, and by con\u00edfronting students with\nawkward-sounding terms which are first learned and then \"*unlearned\" in\ntheir narrower sense.\n\nOther reasons, in addition to tautology and basic confusion, for preferring\nthe narrower definitions include:\n\n(a) There is considerable value in a concept which can be pointed out as\n\n3?

The wage comparisons are further broken\ndown to cover groups within manufacturing industry as well as others in\nnon-manufacturing.

The figures, they observe,\n*do not apply exactly to any individual industry,\" and \"the profit and wage\npicture must be considered separately in each wage negotiation.\"\n\nThe wage comparisons are intended mainly to justify a general increase\nwhich the authors believe to be proved fossible at December, 1946 prices.\nTo make the justification, they choose as a base period for wages January,\n1945, when average gross hourly and average weekly earnings of production\nworkers in manufacturing had attained their all-time highs.

These\narguments do not apply in a situation of actual or impending mass unem-\nployment and under-utilization of resources, which is the only normal peace-\ntime situation in which deficit financing is likely to be extensively used.\n\nProfessor Poindexter, for example, finds a justification of government\ninterest payments to the banking system in \"the cumulative real cost of\nvesting in the government command over present as against future goods.\nIn other words, the costs of bank credit creation are essentially the same as\nthose borne by the individual saver-lender.'\"?

Because of\ncurrent wage adjustment and inflation problems, analysis of the 1939\u201446\nperiod is of importance. The present paper briefly presents the results of an\ninvestigation into the prices of manufactured products during those years.\n\nThe manufactured or \"finished\" goods index contained, for 1939, a total\nof 611 separate commodity quotations. We have compared the individual\nprices of these items in 1939 (monthly average for the year) with the prices\nof the identical items in August, 1946.? That month, the latest for which\ndata are available at the time of present writing,? was the first full month\nfollowing the general removal of government price controls.\n\nOf the 611 commodities listed in 1939, a total of 367 are represented\n\"tem-for-item\" in 1946; comparable quotations on the other 244 products\nare not to be had for exactly the same items in the same markets. Those\n244 commodities were, therefore, eliminated in the present study; substitute\nitems, which the B.L.S. legitimately includes in its broader, weighted aver-\nage, were not considered comparable for our more specific purposes.\n\nThus circumscribed, what does analysis of the 367 items show? The range\nof price changes is from a decline of 10 per cent to an increase of 443 per\ncent. Three hundred and thirty-eight goods increased in price, 11 declined,\nand 18 showed no change.

Figures published in the November, 1946 issue of the Bulletin, p. 1239, reveal that during\nthe first six months of 1946 member bank net profits (after all taxes) were 13.2 per cent of in-\nvested capital despite an increase in total capital accounts.\n\n5 Of the total of $90,613,000,000 of United States government obligations held by the com-\nmercial banks as of the end of 1945, all but $15,071,000,000 were acquired during the period\n1939-45 (Federal Reserve Bulletin, June, 1946, p. 632).\n\n\" This assumes that depositors do not act en masse, that there is no alteration of conditions\nwhich would prompt a mass withdrawal of deposits, that there is no element of panic in such\ndeposit withdrawals, and that there will be, therefore, a compensating effect in the operations\nof large numbers of depositors.\n",

It is true, therefore, as Professor Poin-\ndexter maintains (p. 313) that there are costs of bank credit creation, but\nthe fundamental difference of which he fails to take cognizance is that the\ncosts of bank credit creation are social costs borne by the community and\nin these respects involve no conscious or determinate cost to particular\nindividuals or to the banks which created the credit. It is for precisely this\nreason that Professor Whittlesey* and others question whether the extraor-\ndinary earnings of commercial banks* are now justified in view of the fact\nthat they stem from the vast and unprecedented war-deficit financing par-\nticipated in by the banks.*\n\nIt may happen that in the process of transferring ownership of demand\ndeposits certain owners will find from time to time tbat they are able to\n\"save\" a part of these deposits, but it is erroneous to conclude, as does\nProfessor Poindexter, that these deposits, or even that element which can\nbe regarded as savings, must be \"lent\" to the commercial banks if the banks\nin turn are to be able to lend to the government and other borrowers.\n\nThe conversion of the \"saved portion\" of demand deposits into any of the\nvarious forms which savings may take (other than currency or bank-held\nassets) has no direct effect on the total deposits of commercial banks.

Contraction of these deposits, on the other hand, comes about as a\nconsequence of the calling or maturing of loans and discounts, the sale or\nredemption of bank-held bonds, or the conversion of deposits into currency,\nor their use to buy assets from the banks.\n\nRecognizing these fundamental relationsbips, it should be obvious that\nwhen a commercial bank creates a new deposit in favor of a borrower, this\ndeposit does not represent the savings of the borrower. Nor does the ex-\npenditure of such deposits bring about any such metamorphosis. If it be\nassumed that the deposits thus created are spent for goods, it follows that\nthe seller of the goods now holds assets in the form of demand deposits\nrather than inventory. The acquisition of demand deposits is no evidence\nper se that the savings of the owners have expanded by an equal amount, or\nindeed by any fraction thereof. In the above example it may very well have\nbeen true that the goods were sold at a loss, so that the owner's equity in his\nenterprise (one real evidence of savings) actually diminished.\n\nThe further utilization of these deposits by their subsequent owners does\nnot alter the validity of these conclusions, nor is their validity impaired by\nthe fact that the demand deposits may have been created as a consequence\nof the expansion of a bank's investments rather than its loans and dis-\ncounts.*\n\nAny correct appraisal of the credit-creating activities of commercial banks\nshould be premised upon the recognition that only a part of demand de-\nposits represent *'savings\" and that the great bulk of these deposits simply\nreflect the fact that the owners prefer, or find it necessary for one reason or\n\n?

It is\nhis fear that public resistance to the necessary taxes would be greatly aug-\nmented \"were it understood that the government does not have to pay\ninterest on, or (perchance) even the principal of its debts.\"* In evaluating\nthis argument we must remember that taxes used to make payments of\ninterest on principal on the national debt will have considerably less anti-\ninflationary effect than taxes going into a retained budget surplus, and that\nconsequently the piling up of an interest-bearing debt will increase the total\namount of taxes it would be necessary to collect before tax collections began\nto have an appreciable anti-inflationary effect.

This is an important point, but the presentation is somewhat\nconfusing. The following comments are intended to clarify the problems\nrather than to challenge this major conclusion.\n\nThe analysis assumes constant total money income and full employment\nin each country, an increase in all import duties at the same time, and\nflexible exchange rates which adjust automatically so as to preserve an\nexact balance of payments without flows of gold or credit.

Economic theory may refer to the logical relationships between eco-\nnomic magnitudes, or to both the logical relationships and their empirical\ncontent. It is a formal property of a maximum profit position that the\nmarginal cost of a productive service equal its marginal value product, and\nit is an empirical property that the marginal physical product curve have\na negative slope. There is some ambiguity concerning the object of Lester's\nattack, but it seems a fair inference that to him the empirical content of\nprice theory is seriously deficient, while the logical structure is usually, but\nby no means always, valid.

We know several cases in the theory of\nimperfect competition in which selling prices remain unchanged in spite of\nchanges in demand. Perhaps Professor Lester thinks of the case of tacitly\nfixed prices under oligopoly in which the sales curve breaks off at the vol-\nume of sales expected at the given price. (Since under the oligopolistic con-\nditions price reductions are regarded as impractical, there is no practical\npossibility of expanding sales.)

This is nothing new to the marginalist. Does\nProfessor Lester wish to regard it as the \"'general theory\" of employment in\nthe firm? To me it is a special case.??\n\nOther points brought up by Professor Lester refer to the cost of changing\nthe size of the work force.

But Professor Lester\nrepeatedly refers to cases\" in which increased wage rates need not result\nin reduced employment and may result or did result in increased employ-\nment.

If it is to mean that the volume of output\nproduced by the firm is usually not influenced by the shape of the cost curve,\nit is clearly incorrect, or producers would in good times produce far above\n\"capacity\" and might in slack times curtail output even more than they do.\nIf it is to mean that there are situations in which a change in the level of\nthe cost curve need not result in a change in output, it is a correct statement;\nindeed such situations, far from being inconsistent with marginal analysis,\ncan be most conveniently described by it.

There are two\nways of reducing this excess, either by increasing investment or by increas-\ning current expenditures so that current savings are reduced. This paper is\nan attempt to make use of available data in order to examine one of the\nmeans often suggested for increasing consumers! expenditures\u2014the re-\ndistribution of current income.\n\nSince the resulting estimates of the increase in consumer expenditures\nresulting from income redistribution are small, the conclusion is drawn that\nif the present data are correct, too much emphasis should not be placed on\nincome redistribution for the solution of the savings-investment problem.\n\n1 This study was begun under the direction of Everett E.

(1) The **marginalists\" contend\nthat substitution of labor for capital often requires a reversion to \"'anti-\nquated\" techniques operated by laborers with obsolete skills. References?\n(2) The \"*marginalists\" usually overlook or deny that a fall in the wage of\none type of labor may lead to an increase in the demand for other kinds of\nlabor whose wage rates have not fallen. References? (3) A fall in the wage\nrate of a given type of labor does not lead to additional employment of this\ntype of labor. Evidence?\n\n4. Even if large logical or empirical errors had been committed by lead-\ning modern economists, Lester could not refute price theory merely by dem-\nonstrating these errors. A theory can be refuted only in its strongest ver-\nsion, and it would be a necessary part of Lester's task to show that correc-\ntion of these blunders would lead to logical inconsistency or empirical con-\ntradiction or deprive the theory of its ability to forecast economic events.\nBut first the blundersin the existing theory should be demonstrated: Lester's\nreformulations have not been so happy as to make this first step redundant.\n\n5. Lester apparently believes that the findings of his empirical studies\nmust be accepted quickly and completely, presumably because they are\n\"facts.\" Unfortunately, the details of his studies are not reported in suffi-\ncient detail to assess their validity or, indeed, even to understand their\nmeaning. Consider an example.\n\nAs a rule, average variable cost falls when output rises, until capacity is\nreached. How were the entrepreneurs who filled in the questionnaire instruc-\nted to segregate variable costs? How was capacity defined? How were the\ndiverse products of a firm to be added to secure an index of output? What\nwere the characteristics of the firms that responded (in comparison with the\nindustries at large): was their scale of operations growing; were they equally\nsubject to competitive pressures; etc.?\n\n6. Some of the findings in Lester's studies are impossible, and some are\nwholly in keeping with the \"marginal\" theory; yet both types are held up\nas refutations of the theory. An example of the impossible is the finding that\nwhen 6 metal-working firms increased output from 70 to 80 per cent of\ncapacity\u2014a 14.3 per cent increase of output\u2014the average decline of aver-\nage variable costs was 15.9 per cent. Hence on average the total cost fell by\n4.9 per cent when output rose 14.3 per cent. We shall not accept this result\neven if Lester obtains it from 6,000 metal-working firms. An example of the\nexpected is that a rise in wages may lead to increased selling efforts. It is\nsaid that \"such actions can, however, hardly be described as employing\nworkers according to the marginal principle,\" 5 and yet it is surely part and\n\n* *Shortcomings of Marginal Analysis for Wage-Employment Problems,\" Am.

In the less frequent case, then, Lester finds the logical structure of\nprice theory defective. Every theorist would welcome demonstrations of\nspecific errors found in the works of leading modern economists. But, in-\nstead, Lester has a penchant for attributing to anonymous ''marginalists\"\ntheories that I have never before encountered in economic literature. I may\nquote an example from his Economics of Labor since this passage is still\nrecommended in his recent writing. One of the nine assumptions underlying\nthe marginal productivity theory, we are told, is\n\n(6) That the employer in an imperfect market will always reduce his price\nto increase his sales, whenever such action may add to his short-run\nprofits. Employers following a price policy based on long-run considerations\nmay not wish to sacrifice future profits in order to maximize present profits,\nespecially when price reductions might antagonize customers or lead to a\nprice war. It is not clear from the theory what production and employment\npolicies an employer is assumed to pursue when there is a difference be-\ntween the policy that would maximize profits in the short run and one that\nwould maximize profits in the long run?\n\nWill Lester please give us the specific reference to just one leading economist\nwho has made this stupid assumption?\n\n3. More often Lester finds fault with the theorists! empirical assumptions.\nEveryone will agree with him that economists have more often made errors\n\u2014of omission as well as commission\u2014in observation than in logical analysis,\nand that incalculable amounts of good empirical work are still needed. But\nour empirical errors have not been so crude as those with which we are\ncharged.\n\nWe may turn again to the Economics of Labor for examples of fictitious\u2014\nand anonymous\u2014empirical errors. Here are three more of Lester's nine as-\nsumptions of the marginal productivity theory:\n\n(7) That the market for labor is a perfect market, so that the employer\nwill not affect the wage rate no matter how much labor he himself hires.\n\n(8) That no element of monopoly has entered into the determination\nof the prices for the other factors of production.\n\n(9) That the employers! demand curves for labor correspond to the mar-\nginal-productivity curves of their workers and that the total demand curve\nfor all labor is the sum of all employers' individual marginal-productivity\ncurves.\n\nA theory that assumes 7 or 8is of restricted applicability. The ninth assump-\ntion is probably meaningless\u2014what can the demand curve for physicists J-\ncharwomen be?\u2014and if meaningful, then internally inconsistent because\nthe firms! demand curves are not independent. Fortunately, these assump-\ntions are also strangers to the marginal productivity theory.\n\nOr consider a more recent example: *\"Those who argue for wage reduc-\n\n? R. A.

Economic theory may refer to the logical relationships between eco-\nnomic magnitudes, or to both the logical relationships and their empirical\ncontent. It is a formal property of a maximum profit position that the\nmarginal cost of a productive service equal its marginal value product, and\nit is an empirical property that the marginal physical product curve have\na negative slope. There is some ambiguity concerning the object of Lester's\nattack, but it seems a fair inference that to him the empirical content of\nprice theory is seriously deficient, while the logical structure is usually, but\nby no means always, valid.

If Professor Lester grants all this,\nwhat is left of his case against marginal productivity theory?) Professor\nLester is mistaken in thinking that to take account of such matters is\n\"troublesome to a marginalist.\" No trouble at all. The cost of changing the\nwork force is one of the causes\u2014besides the smaller elasticity of the short-\nrun sales curve and the difficulties of certain types of technical substitution\n\u2014why marginal productivity curves are less elastic in the short run than\nin the long run.

The act\nhas been criticized on the ground that it imposes no obligations upon the\nunion in the interests of its employee-members, whom it is supposed to\nrepresent. Several recent decisions of the National Labor Relations Board\nand of the courts raise the questions whether, in fact, the act cannot be so\nconstrued as to place such obligations, and, if the answer is in the affirma-\ntive, what the extent of those obligations may be.\n\nThe source of any possible compulsions upon the union is to be found in\nSection 9(a), which states that **Representatives designated or selected for\nthe purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of employees in a unit\nappropriate for such purposes, shall be the exclusive representatives of all\nthe employees. . . . \" Until recently the emphasis in this section had been\nlaid upon the word \"'exclusive,\" in an elaboration and defense of the doc-\ntrine of majority representation, both with respect to negotiations for the\ncontract and grievance proceedings. It now appears that considerable weight\nis being accorded the phrase \"representatives of all the employees,\" and\nthat this additional emphasis carries implications perhaps hitherto unfore-\nseen.\n\nIn Hughes Tool Co. v. NLRB, (1945) 147 F. (2d) 69, at 74, the Fifth\nCircuit Court thus took pains to point out that When the Steelworkers\nunion accepted certification as the bargaining representative for the group,\nit accepted a trust. It became bound to represent equally and in good faith\nthe interests of the whole group. It ought not to discriminate in the execu-\ntion of its duties between its own members and employees who belong to\nanother union or to no union. The handling of grievances, as has been\npointed out, is part of the business it has assumed, and must be done with\nimpartiality.\"\n\nIf it thus becomes established that in accepting Board certification as\nexclusive representative for the employees in a unit a union becomes subject\nto the burdens of a trusteeship, it is altogether conceivable that failure to\ndischarge such trusteeship obligations may become grounds for revocation\nof certification.\n\nConsider Matter of Monsieur Henri Wines, 44 NLRB 1310.

Chairmanship of the sessions was alternated between Leon Hend-\nerson, Research Institute of America; Robert Nathan, Robert Nathan As-\nsociates; George W. Taylor, University of Pennsylvania; Isador Lubin,\nAmerican Statistical Association; and Thomas Blaisdell, Department of\nState. Arrangements were in charge of an Executive Committee, with mem-\nbership drawn from labor, management and Government.\n\nHiram Davis of the Wharton School, in discussing general problems of\nconcepts and measurements, was the first of several speakers to advocate the\nuse of several output-input ratios for the measurement of productivity,\nrather than the use of the output-labor input ratio exclusively. Measures of\nat least all other important input factors should be similarly developed, as\nunits of raw material, electric energy, and investment. Although produc-\ntivity, if considered as \"productive efficiency,\" might ideally be measured in\nterms of total output in relation to total input, the translation of diverse\ninput factors into \u00e0 common measure is sufficiently unsatisfactory as to\nlead Dr. Davis to favor a series of ratios relating output to each important\ninput item.\n\nThe measurement of output over a period of time encounters problems\nof change in the quality and character of products. Should value or price,\nman-hours used, or potential service be used as weights in preparing the\noutput measure? It was suggested that *'value added\" weights may be ap-\npropriate, although these may introduce new distortions through inclusion\nof profits. Manufacturing cost weights may prove more desirable.

It is accused of permitting errors to appear\nin its publications and of focusing too much attention on historical subjects\nto the detriment of work on current problems of Soviet economics. The\nPresidium also charges that the Institute does not publish significant theo-\nretical works which indicate the \"advantages\" and \"consistency\" of the\n\n1 Igvestiya, October 25, 1946, p. 2.\n",

                    "that if labor and management could agree as to methods and measures to\nbe employed in a given industry for collective bargaining, BLS then might\nbe able to construct useful tools for this purpose.\n\nOne of the interesting overtones at the Conference was the use of pro-\nductivity measures in collective bargaining. Labor unions are groping for\nsatisfactory measures to enable them to claim a share in productivity in-\ncreases, after being rebuffed by the limitations of existing measures. Re-\nsearch in varying concepts and measures might well be repaid many times\nif it could result in decreasing labor-management friction. Present measures\nare largely based on the National Research Project which emphasized the\nlabor displacement facet of the problem. In these more optimistic times,\ninterest is directed, in the words of Solomon Barkin of the Textile Workers\nUnion, more to \"productivity in the sense of the creation of new wealth ...\nfor distribution.\"\n\nIt may be considered surprising that agreement on principles was as con-\nsiderable as was the case in view of the widely divergent interests repre-\nsented. As summarized by Samuel H. Thompson of the Department of\nCommerce, there were three main areas of general agreement. These in-\ncluded (1) the general agreement of all interests that increased productivity\nis necessary leads to the necessity of providing techniques whereby pro-\nductivity may be measured; (2) there is the need for many different meth-\nods of measurement, including different types of input-output ratios, to\nanalyze adequately the factors that make for production; and (3) ultimate\nresponsibility for the improvement in productivity cannot be assigned gen-\nerally to any single productive factor.\n\nA digest of the proceedings is being prepared by the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics and will be available to interested parties. The Executive Com-\nmittee announced at the final session that continuing work would be\nplanned, although the Committee was not then prepared to announce its\ncharacter.\n\nt2 5| - AT *\n",
