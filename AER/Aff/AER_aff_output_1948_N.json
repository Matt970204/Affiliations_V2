This followed the example of the German steel cartel\nfounded in the \"70's. Thus began the so-called \"natural evolution\" of\nthe basing point practice in the United States.\n\nIn the next twenty years this practice was extended to all branches\nof the steel industry and to the cement industry which was already\nconnected with steel by various bonds of ownership. Then the practice\nwas gradually extended to the sale of many standardized heavy basic\nproducts, including most building materials, and became the chief\ninstrument by which American cartels have exercised a control over\nprices.\n\nFor forty years this pricing practice largely escaped notice, and,\nwhen it was glimpsed, its real nature was misrepresented by the in-\ndustries and misunderstood by the public, the courts, the Congress,\nand the executive agencies. This was notably so in the dissolution suit\nagainst the United States Steel Corporation which ended in 1920 with\nthe vindication of the Corporation, and also in the Cement Manu-\nfacturers' Protective Association case concluded in confusion and\nfailure in 1925.\n\nMeantime, however, the practice had been dragged out into the\nopen and its real nature partially disclosed by the complaint against\nthe U.

Inflation is, however, a complex,\ndynamic problem which can be attacked successfully only by a well-\ncoordinated program. It will take all the skill at our command to\nachieve economic stability.

It is, on the contrary,\nthose who own resources, both human and non-human, in the export industries\nand those who own resources competitive with resources located in export\nindustries. These people bear the tax in the form of a reduction in their money\nincomes in a fashion analogous to a partial proportional income tax (with\nno exemptions) collected at the source. They must sacrifice money income\nequal to the yield of the tax to the Treasury (p. 790).\n\nThis unequivocal statement (the stresses are the author's) contradicts\ncertain apparently universally accepted ideas, and deserves careful\nexamination.\n\nProfessor Rolph does not deny that import duties may result in (a)\na shift in terms of trade to the advantage of the country levying the\ntax (P) and to the disadvantage of the exporting country (E), and/or\n(b) lower income for foreign exporters, and/or (c) a higher domestic\nprice of imported products.

These changes,\nhe states, are only incidental effects, secondary consequences of the\nlevy, and do not represent its incidence.

The following, taken from the\nGeneral Theory, is especially suggestive: *It may turn out that the pro-\npensity to consume will be so easily strengthened by the effects of a falling\nrate of interest, that full employment can be reached with a rate of ac-\ncumulation little greater than at present. In this event a scheme for the\nhigher taxation of large incomes and inheritances might be open to the ob-\njection that it would lead to full employment with a rate of accumulation\nwhich was reduced considerably below the current level. / must not be sup-\nposed to demy the possibility or even the probability of this outcome\"\n(italics supplied).\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "896\n"], "4": ["the second policy will actually give more consumers goods depends on one's\nestimate of the effectiveness of government investment.\n\nA similar problem is raised by the problem of profits. We want to en-\ncourage people to invest in order that the standard of living can be in-\ncreased. In war, again, there is little problem. If special obsolescence rates\nare permitted, the net profit rate (after taxes) can be kept very low (unless\nwe want to allow higher profits to produce more saving). Intra-marginal\nrents are a problem, but they can be handled by price control plus sub-\nsidies to the marginal firms. The stimulus of patriotism is perhaps adequate.\n\nBut again, in peacetime the case is different. Risks today are exceedingly\nhigh. The steel industry, for example, is afraid (and with some Prima. facie\nreason) of the consequences to itself of *back log\" saturation. Is a rate of\nreturn of ten or twelve per cent under such circumstances (and with tremen-\ndous marginal construction costs) adequate to induce the great increase in\noutput we desperately need? If we encourage an uncritical ethical jealousy\nof profit, can we blame the private economy for not functioning??\n\nFinally there is the interest rate. We want to encourage people to save as\nmuch as possible. Certainly low interest rates do not help there. We also\nwant to encourage investment. We have just said that risky new investment\nis severely hampered by present policies. Even so, there is an attempt to invest\nmore than our present relatively limited rate of voluntary saving. Supposing\nthat we do all we can to discourage consumption, the probabilities are that\nthe secular need for current new investment would still be greater than the\nsaving flow. Only if we deliberately attempt to discourage investment in-\ncentives would the case be different. Up to now our discouragement of new\ninvestment has not affected the rate of planned investment quite that much.\n\nUnder such circumstances, as Colin Clarke points out in his Economics of\n1960, capital scarcity confronts us with two main approaches toward stabili-\nzation. We can (a) ration capital \u2014i.e., plan the flow of net new investment,\nor (b) raise the interest rate. The third (and more likely) possibility is of\ncourse to permit continuing inflation.\n\nThere is one point which must still be treated. Some will say that we have\nno guarantee that the more well-to-do will save if taxes on the upper-income\nbrackets are reduced. The case of the unfortunate family mentioned in\nFortune who were barely \"getting along\" on $25,000 a year is frequently\nbrought up to me.\n\nFor myself I confess to a certain skepticism as to how typical a case this\nis, but let that pass. Professor Slichter has furnished the answer. Let us give\ntax exemptions on saved income. It is not necessary at present to distinguish\nbetween saving and hoarding, for even hoards help to reduce the pressure on\nprices.\n\n?In view of the number of sweeping statements now made regarding \"huge\" profits,\nit may be worthwhile to offer some figures drawn from the Economic Report of the Presi-\ndent for January 1948. In 1929, profits before taxes were 96 of gross national product, 1196\nof national income. In 1947 they were 1246 and 1396. This shows some relative gain. But\nin 1929 profits after taxes were 896 of gross national product or 976 of national income.\nToday they are 776 and 896. Thus the net relative profit share has actually declined,\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n", "895\n"], "3": ["very poor on the necessities of life. The additional taxation must therefore\nfall, for the most part, on tte ordinary citizen\" (italics supplied).\n\nIn other words if we want to prevent inflation, and still more, if we want\nto prevent inflation and get investment, we must reverse all our ideas of\ntaxation, so painfully built up during the last twelve years, and tax con-\nsumption! This means a notably less progressive tax structure.\n\nII\n\nThe writer finds that it is possible, though with intense difficulty, to get\nmany modern economists this far in the argument. Our ideas of the *economy\nof abundance\" die hard, but for the honest social scientist the facts are\noverwhelming. There is, however, a far more serious problem to be faced.\n\nIf we are going back to war, or semi-war, there will be little problem con-\ncerning investment. Most of it will be handled by the government, and\nwhen not handled directly, it will be done under close government control.\nBut what of a rise in civilian goods? Who will manage that?\n\n*Postwar planning\" now (and so soon again!) may seem a little remote.\nYet even if the present peace should be a delusion, clarity of reasoning and\nindeed of policy, requires us to look forward to a possible day in which, war\nbeing over a while anyhow, we find ourselves once more flooded with money,\nand again resuming the real task of raising the living standards of the world.\nWhat tax policy shall we use then?\n\nCan there be any doubt as to the policy to which the functional logic of\nthe Keynesian system leads? Have we not spent twelve years proving that\nwe must soak the rich because they \"save too much\"? And do we not now\nwant saving? I have said that it is possible to get some intellectuals to admit\nthe need for taxing consumption\u2014which is tantamount to saying taxing the\nless well-to-do. But when one speaks of lowering taxes on the upper-income\nbrackets in order to get more saving and more investment, then, indeed,\ncontroversy begins. The clearest and most honest statement of the problem\nthat I have heard was made by a young economist who said that he would\n*rather have inflation than do anything to allow income distribution to move\ntoward its former (more unequal) pattern.\" In other words, what was to him\na moral standard was more important than the economic one.\n\nLet us, however, think a bit. For the man who is an avowed socialist,\nthere is no problem. Govermment will tax consumption, and government\ninvestment in plant for the production of consumers! goods will raise (it is\nsaid) the standard of living. The fact that such a policy will create an ever-\ngrowing field of government industry beside the \"private\" one is no objection.\nIndeed it is an advantage. My questions are aimed more at those who claim\nto \"believe\" in \"capitalism,\" and who profess to wish to help the condition\nof the poor, but who refuse to allow inequality of income and private capital\naccumulation on the ground that it is \"unethical.\" Their policy can only\nmean one of two things (a) the poor will not get the increased living stand-\nards they wish\u2014or get them very slowly, or (b) the economy will gradually\nbe socialized. If any one can point out an escape from this dilemma, under the\ncircumstances postulated, I shall be happy to hear it.

The latter can be managed, officially anyhow, largely\nby controls, but the former is more complicated. If we merely take preventing\ninflation (price rise?) as our sole criterion then one can agree with Dr. Harris\nand Mr. Lerner that investment has been running \"far too high.\" But if\nraising the standard of living, or rearmament, is to be our prime goal, then\nwe are well justified in asking how, if investment is not to run high, the\nbasic problem is ever to be met?

All I am trying to say is that depression may (sometimes) come because the pro-\npensity to consume is too high and/or the interest rate too low so that the capital projects\nundertaken cannot be completed for lack of adequate real saving. Alternatively, even when\nmonetary demand is very high, cost-price relationships may be such as not to furnish\nadequate incentive.

Actually, what Mr. Boulding\ndefined in the above quotation is the concept of net national investment,\nand it should occasion no surprise to learn that a stationary society had no\nnet national investment.\n\nContrary to the belief expressed in the quotation, there is a logical reason to\nsubtract depreciation on plant and machinery only from gross national\nproduct in order to obtain net national product. The currently used definition\nof net national product flows directly from the notion of a gross national\nproduct. In order to obtain it, one subtracts depreciation on capital equip-\nment from gross national product because part of the existing equipment is\nused up in the process of production. Hence, it is subtracted out to avoid\ndouble counting, ;.e., counting once the consumer goods produced, and then\nagain counting the capital equipment used up in producing the consumer\ngoods. Depreciation on consumer durables is not subtracted out because con-\nsumer durables are treated, as a matter of convenience in computing the\nstatistic, as being consumed in the same period in which they are produced,\ni.e. they are already net. Consumer non-durables are not subtracted out, of\ncourse, because they are one of the elements we desire to measure. If gross\nnational product is meaningful, by the same token net national product is\nalso meaningful.\n\nIn the note below, Mr. Boulding maintains his objection to the net national\nproduct on the grounds that some depreciation of capital is a function of time\nbut not of the quantity produced. Here, he believes that time-depreciation\nshould not be subtracted out to arrive at net national product. However,\ngranting that some depreciation is independent of the quantity of goods\nproduced but is dependent on a time interval, Mr. Boulding should agree to\nsubtracting the time-depreciation which occurred over the period in which\nnational product was being measured.\n\nI therefore believe that Mr. Boulding's attempt to define a most significant\nconcept of net national product as \"excess of gross product over its 'fixed\ncost'\u2014i.e., over the consumption which would take place at zero output\"\nis not meaningful because it neglects the fact that the national product is\nmeasured over a time interval during which time-depreciation occurs. Mr.\nBoulding's second concept of national surplus as *the excess of the gross\nproduct over that consumption which is necessarily involved in its produc-\ntion\" is not helpful because the terms in the definition are not defined. This\nlatter concept would be measurable, and hence meaningful, only if we could\nfirst decide what plane of living would be necessary for the purpose of\nproduction.\n\nThe usually cited deficiency in the net national product figure as pub-\nlished by the Department of Commerce is the lack of good statistics on\ndepreciation. I do not, however, detect a conceptual error in arriving at this\nfigure once gross national product is given, and I have tried to show that the\ntwo suggestions made by Mr. Boulding were not conceptual improvements.\n\nMownzor Bunk*\n\n* The author is an instructor in economics at American University.\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "898\n"], "1": ["Mr. Boulding's Criticism of the Net National Product Concept\n\nIn the March 1948 issue of this Review, Mr. Boulding wrote that the\nconcept of the net national product leads to absurdities and should be\navoided by those expounding a theory of employment. His argument, as it\noriginally appeared, was based on a misunderstanding of the currently used\nconcept of net national product. He wrote (pp. 101-102):\n\n\"The *net\" national product is usually defined as the gross product less *'de-\npreciation\"\u2014depreciation being usually confined to plant and machinery.

To remedy my\nneglect, he catalogs three possible definitions of capacity and then very\ncharitably assumes that I probably had in mind the most sensible of the\nthree. On this assumption he proceeds to demolish my theory. Unfortunately,\nhowever, his inventory omits a fourth definition which is the only one that\nis entirely acceptable.\n\nCapacity must be distinguished from maximum output. Mr. Haines's de-\nfinition fails to do this. Maximum output is a concept having two dimensions,\ntime and a rate of production. Capacity is only one of the numerous possible\nrates of production\u2014it happens to be the maximum rate. Capacity, by itself,\nis a timeless concept. Thus it would be appropriate to say that a plant was\nproducing at capacity at a given moment even though its output for that day\nmight well be less than its output for the preceding day.\"\n\nIt is difficult to deal with a timeless-rate of production, yet if capacity is\nstated as the maximum output for a period of time (such as a day, a week,\nor a month), variations in ordinary time periods lend vagueness to the con-\ncept. An eight-hour day is not the same as a ten-hour day; no week has\nexactly the same number of working days in it as every other week, and so\non. But all such obstacles are circumvented when the rate of production is\nplaced on an hourly basis for (after the warming-up hour) one hour is\nidentical with every other hour. Thus capacity should be defined as the\nmaximum hourly output possible under normal circumstances. So defined,\nbeyond-capacity output becomes impossible.\n\nAn average variable cost curve indicates the unit cost of producing goods\nat all scales of operation from the minimum rate practical to the maximum\nrate possible. The actual scale of operation shifts from one point on this\ncurve to another by adding or subtracting input units. The curve assumes\nthe cost of the input factors to remain constant. The sAape of an average\ncost curve is determined by the efficiency of each added (or subtracted) input\nunit. The shape is not affected by the time element. The altitude of an\naverage cost curve is determined by the cost of the input factor and is affected\nby the time element. When a plant is operated the customary number of\nhours each day, it will pay the market rate of wages. If it operates ten hours\ninstead of eight, it may have to pay time-and-a-half for the extra two hours.\nThis is the equivalent of a ten per cent rise in the hourly rate of pay and will\ncause the average cost curve to shift to a higher level without altering its\n\n\"This would be true, for example, if the output for Saturday (a four-hour day) was\ncompared to the output for Friday (an eight-hour day) when the plant was operating\nat capacity-rate on Saturday and at 65 per cent of capacity-rate on Friday.\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "902\n"], "3": ["compare the additional cost of producing one more product with the addi-\ntional revenue to be obtained from its sale.

However,\nwhen continuous curves are assumed, both rules lead to an identical solution.\n\nMr. Bishop disagrees with my statement that the MC curve ends at\nabsolute capacity. As pointed out above, when continuous curves are used,\nmarginal cost is identical with the additional cost of one more product. If\nproduction is at absolute capacity, one more product is impossible. There\ncan be no \"cost\" of an impossible product. Mr. Bishop suggests that the\nmarginal curve be drawn vertical at absolute capacity for \"purely heuristic\"\nreasons. Webster's dictionary defines \"heuristic\" as pertaining to methods\nof demonstration that are persuasive rather than compellingly logical.*\n\nMr. Bishop also feels that my statement that cost reaches its minimum\n*at or near capacity\" is a devastating admission for if it is once admitted\nthat a variable unit cost reaches its minimum short of capacity and then\nrises, marginal cost exceeds variable unit cost over the range where the latter\nis rising and profit maximization by the conventional intersection of MR\nand MC is possible. But he goes on in the next paragraph to admit that if\nthe variable unit cost at capacity only slightly exceeds the least cost point,\nthe conventional intersection of MC and MR occurs only by virtue of the\nfact that the MC curve rises vertically at capacity to infinity. In other words,\nhe believes that in such cases entrepreneurs choose to operate at capacity be-\ncause the cost of a non-producible product (one beyond capacity) is in-\nfinitely higher than the revenue that would be obtained from the sale of\nsuch a non-existent product.

Mathematically an \"infinitely small change in output\" could indi-\ncate a change of a fraction of a product whereas practical considerations\nwould oppose having an \"infinitely small change in output\" refer to any\nquantity less than one product. Thus when a continuous curve is assumed,\nmarginal cost is the cost of one product even though it also happens to be a\nmathematical measure of the slope of the total cost curve.? This raises the\nquestion of which of the two definitions offers the more useful tool for\nanalysis.

From\nwhich it follows logically that *when production is carried on in quarters\ndesigned for the purpose, those in control will take into consideration all of\nthe relationships involved and strive by careful planning to prevent any one of\nthe component forces from decreasing efficiency until operations are close to\ncapacity.\"\n\nMr. Bishop and Mr. Haines do not find fault with this thesis but they\nare alarmed at its implications for marginal analysis. For example, if modern\nengineers can make the least cost point fall at capacity output, then marginal\ncost curves will lie below average cost curves at all points of operation short\nof capacity. As a consequence, marginal cost curves will no longer intersect\nmarginal revenue curves (1) when average revenue curves are horizontal\nor (2) when average revenue curves are high and almost horizontal. Under\neither of these conditions, business managers would simply produce as much\ngoods as the current market would absorb without reference to marginal\ncost and marginal revenue. The case for marginal analysis would still be\nsaved, however, if it could be proved that marginal cost curves rise verti-\ncally at capacity or that beyond-capacity production is possible.

It is quite true that the net national product\nconcept is an attempt to avoid \"double counting\" in the computation of\nnational income. Just as we should not count both the wheat and the flour\nmade from it in the national product, so it is argued we should not count\nboth the consumption of the flour mill and the flour. Where production\nconsists of asset transformation, clearly the \"net\" output consists of as-\nsets produced less their \"cost\" in the sense of assets used up in making\nthem.\n\nThere is, however, still some difficulty in the *net national product\"\nconcept. Depreciation may be in large part a \"fixed cost.\" That is to say, the\nflour mill may depreciate whether it is used or not: in that way it differs\nfrom the wheat, which still remains as an asset whether it happens to be\nmade into flour or not. That is to say, there is some consumption which is\na \"variable cost\"\u2014or \"user cost,\" to use Keynes' term\u2014which would not\nhave taken place had there not been production, and some which is a \"fixed\ncost,\" which would take place whether there was production or not. It is\nclear that the fixed cost (depreciation) is not a ''cost of production\" but\nmerely a *cost of existence.\" It is the gross product, therefore, which is the\nbest measure of output. This can be seen clearly if we reflect that at a zero\nlevel of employment, the gross product will be zero but the net product will\nbe negative. Assuming constant efficiency of labor, gross product will rise\nproportionately with employment: net product will not. In this sense the\nmost significant concept of net product is the excess of gross product over\nits *fixed cost\"\u2014i.e., over the consumption which would take place at zero\noutput. Another significant concept might be described as the \"national\nsurplus\"\u2014i\u00ed.e., the excess of the gross product over that consumption which\nis necessarily involved in its production. The proportion of its resources\nwhich a nation could devote to a total war effort, for instance, would be\na measure of the ^national surplus.\" This, however, is very far from the\n*net national product\" of the Department of Commerce.\n\nK.

Conclusion\n\nI shall try to summarize the major propositions which I have stressed in\nthe course of criticizing Eiteman's paper (and I designate by Roman numerals\nin parentheses the section of my paper where each of these propositions is\ndiscussed):\n\n1. The rigorous definition of a marginal magnitude\u2014and the only defini-\ntion which relates to unique outputs, rather than to intervals of output\nchange\u2014is a derivative or slope: marginal cost (revenue) is the slope of\nthe total-cost (-revenue) curve, plotted against output (II).\n\n2. When there is a discontinuity in the slope (a sharp break or a termina-\ntion) of a total curve, this implies a (finite or infinite) discontinuity in the\nmarginal curve\u2014and hence an indeterminacy of the marginal magnitude (II).\n\n?' This conclusion may be demonstrated. Let output \u2014 x; total cost \u2014 C; and total fixed\ncost \u2014 F. Variable unit cost is some function of output, f(x) ; and its slope is f'(x).\nThen CF xf(x);\n\ndC\nand marginal cost is de \u2014 f(x) 4- xf'(x).\nX\n\nWhen variable unit cost it at its minimum, f'(x) \u2014 0; and marginal cost equals variable\nunit cost. Beyond that point, the slope of the \"rounded\" variable-unit-cost curve increases\ncontinuously from zero to infinity. Then, as\n\ndc\nf'(x) 2 o\u00bb, \u2014 \u2014 o.\ndx\n", "zinal cost is\n", "Furthermore, even if variable unit cost at absolute capacity is only very\nslightly above its minimum value near capacity, marginal cost may well be\nindefinitely high\u2014or literally *infinite\"\u2014at the capacity output. The reason\nfor this is that marginal cost, equal to the slope of the total-cost curve, is\nalso related to the slope of the variable-unit-cost curve. Then, if the slope of\nthat curve approaches infinity at absolute capacity, so will marginal cost.?!\n\nThis result is implied even by an almost imperceptible **rounding\" of the\nunit-cost curves in the neighborhood of capacity, provided only that the\nrounding is complete and does not leave any vestige of the \"sharp corners\" at\nv and \u00a3. For example, suppose that variable unit cost describes a rising quarter-\ncircle between its minimum and its end-point at absolute capacity. The radius\nof this circle may be indefinitely small, with the minimum of variable unit\ncost as close to capacity as anyone likes; but marginal cost will still be\ninfinite at capacity, despite the fact that all the other cost magnitudes are\nfinite.\n\nUnder such conditions, a profit maximum will always imply that MR \u2014\nMC. Of course, no one insists on a scrupulously precise maximizing of profit\nin an uncertain world; so the cost accountant and his employer will be fully\npardoned if they speak of producing a *capacity output\" whenever marginal\ncost, as in this case, is rapidly rising. My main point, however, is that when\nEiteman allowed for a possible rounding of the unit-cost curves \"near\"\ncapacity, he should have realized that the u-shaped cost curves, in principle,\ncome back into their own.\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "616\n"], "9": ["As before, however, it is still significant and essential that MR 7\u00bb MC for\nlower outputs and that MR \u00ab MC for higher ones. Furthermore, if the en-\ntrepreneur conceives the demand for his product to exhibit an oligopolistic\nkink at a certain price and output, marginal revenue will be indeterminate\nover the range of its sudden drop. Then, if profit should prove to be maximized\nat the output where this discontinuity occurs, we shall once again have nothing\nbut the marginal inequalities to assure us of the profit maximum.\n\nV. Minimum Unit Costs \"Near\" Capacity\n\nSo far I have taken Eiteman's hypothesis about the shape of the typical\nmanufacturing firm's costs at face value. I have done so, not because these\ncost curves strike me as plausible, but because I have been primarily con-\ncerned to show that his adverse reflections on marginalism are ill conceived\neven if his view of typical cost patterns should be accepted in its most rigid\nform.!* Nor shall I attempt to detail my misgivings about the empirical as-\npects of Eiteman's paper,!? but I should like to comment on the implications\nof relaxing his cost hypothesis in one particular.\n\nMy comment concerns the appropriateness of the assumption that the\nminimum points of the unit-cost curves occur at absolute capacity. Eiteman\nhimself wavers on this question; for more than once (e.g., p. 914) he speaks\nof unit costs reaching their minimum *'at or near\" capacity.? On the other\nhand, Eiteman does not seem to realize that this is a devastating admission\nwith respect to his own misgivings about the marginal analysis of equilibrium\n\"near\" capacity.\n\nThe point is that if variable unit cost reaches its minimum short of capacity\nand then rises, marginal cost exceeds variable unit cost over the range where\nthe latter is rising. Hence, under either pure or impure competition, a profit\nmaximum anywhere in this range implies a conventional intersection of MR\nand MC.\n\n?* Having thus essayed to defend marginal analysis against Eiteman's criticisms, I do not\nmean to imply that I consider that theory invulnerable to attack, Rather, my own opinion\nis that it is decidedly open to valid and damaging criticism, but not on the narrow grounds\ncited by Eiteman and Lester.\n\n? For a detailed criticism of Eiteman's empirical argument I defer to Professor Haines\u2014\nwhose paper, also published in this issue, I have been privileged to read in a preliminary\nversion. Similarly, I have not attempted to discuss another topic treated by Haines, namely\nthe \"inventory\" aspect of Eiteman's own theory of output determination.\n\n?'This concession seems entirely appropriate to me; for even if a key piece of equip-\nment\u2014such as a machine or a melting furnace\u2014is most economically used under condi-\ntions of continuous, round-the-clock operation, there is still likely to be leeway for increas-\ning its output if the firm is willing to incur higher-than-normal expenses\u2014\u00edor example,\nby taking all possible precautions to minimize the intervals when almost any piece of\nequipment is unavoidably idle, whether for overhauling or repair.\n\nConsider also the revealing comment of one of the business men questioned by Lester.\nBy way of explaining why his variable unit costs were not a minimum at (undefined)\ncapacity, the man said (Shortcomings of Marginal Analysis . . . , p. 68): \"Theoretical\n10096 is likely to produce too many strains.\" On the several occasions when I have\nasked a plant manager or a cost accountant similar questions, I have invariably received\nthis kind of answer\u2014as soon as I made clear that I was not asking about \"rated capacity\"\nor some other such conventional index which can be exceeded in practice.\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n", "615\n"], "8": ["petition, because it is the very definition of that abstraction that each pro-\nducer can sell unlimited amounts at a going market price.!9\n\nTurning to assumptions of impure competition, we shall find that Eite-\nman's cost curves are realistically consistent with the profit-maximizing pro-\nduction of azy output.\n\nActually, Eiteman makes an anomalously incorrect concession to this con-\nclusion; for, in the statement quoted above, he implies that MR may equal\nMC if \"demand is extremely inelastic\" (p. 913). Quite the contrary, if de-\nmand for the output of a firm should be inelastic throughout, marginal revenue\nis uniformly negative. Then, under any cost conditions whatever (excluding\nonly negative marginal costs), profit would steadily increase as output is\ncurtailed toward zero. This is so because marginal revenue would lie uni-\nformly below marginal cost. The profit-maximizing output, being positive but\nindefinitely small, cannot be otherwise specified; yet this is the one case which\nEiteman considers marginal analysis able to handle! It is also a totally un-\nrealistic case.\n\nOn the other hand, when demand is relatively elastic\u2014but not too elastic\u2014\nit is obviously possible for average revenue to lie above variable unit cost at\nthe same output where marginal revenue is intersecting marginal cost from\nabove. Then we have a perfectly conventional, textbook instance of a profit-\nmaximizing output where MR \u2014 MC.'*\n\nby a drastic, temporary reduction of output, to be followed by an adjustment of output to\nwhat can be sold at the going price? Such behavior would seem to be most directly in\naccord with Eiteman's prior pronouncement on output determination; but in any case he\nhas side-stepped the real problem, which is a matter of explaining when\u2014and how much\u2014\nthe producer will reduce price rather than output, when faced with an adverse shift of\ndemand.\n\nMarginal theory explains, rightly or wrongly, that the entrepreneur tries to set his price\nso that, when he sells all he can at that price, he will have maximized his profit. Thus\nEiteman's statement about output determination does not conflict with marginal theory;\nhe merely leaves out the explanation of price, without which no theory of output can be\ncomplete.\n\n? Lest anyone think that Lester's statement quoted in my footnote 13 was meant to refer\nto pure competition because of his reference to unbranded products, I shall also quote\nfrom his immediately subsequent sentence, which shows that his theory of output determina-\ntion is very like Eiteman's\u2014and similarly rules out pure competition. Says Lester (*Mar-\nginalism, Minimum Wages, and Labor Markets,\" pp. 138-39) : *. . . the volume of output\nand employment in the individual firm generally varies simply and directly with the volume\nof present and prospective demand for products of the plant.\"\n\nT The excess of price or average revenue (AR) over MR is related to the (negative)\nelasticity of demand, E, by various well-known formulas\u2014cf. Joan Robinson, Te Eco-\nnomics of Imperfect Competition (London, 1936), p. 36:\n\nAR\n\nFor example, where E \u2014 \u20142, AR is twice MR ; and when E \u2014 \u2014 4/3, AR is four times MR.\nThus, when MR \u2014 MC at any output in my diagram, price will exceed variable unit cost\nprovided demand is not too elastic (.e., provided the value of E is not too far below \u20141,\nalgebraically).\n", "TIE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "614\n"], "7": ["Eiteman is correct, of course, in supposing that his cost hypothesis rules\nout any equilibrium output between zero and full capacity under conditions\nof pure competition; for the supply function of a purely competitive firm\nwith costs as diagrammed will coincide with the vertical axis for prices below\nv (where it is impossible to cover even variable unit cost at any positive out-\nput), and will coincide with the vertical line of full capacity for prices\nabove v.*\n\n1f this absence of any possible equilibrium between zero output and capacity\nunder pure competition is to constitute a reflection on marginal analysis,\nEiteman must show us a purely competitive firm, having the specified cost\npattern, which deliberately sets its output at some positive level short of\ncapacity. It should be recalled that he asserts his cost hypothesis only for\nmanufacturing. That may well dispose of the matter; for it is to be doubted\nwhether any manufacturing firm sells its product under conditions which\nconform strictly to those of pure competition. On the other hand, if there\nwere a purely competitive manufacturer with Eiteman's cost schedules, under\nwhat conceivable circumstances would he decide to produce some positive but\nless-than-capacity output? Certainly Eiteman has cited none.\n\nActually, Eiteman's own discussion implies that he is thinking only of\nfirms operating under conditions other than purely competitive. His own\ntheory of output determination is that business men (p. 914) \"simply pro-\nduce all that they can sell.?'5 I take it that this remark rules out pure com-\n\nrevenue productivity! and *marginal factor cost! over the long or short run.\"\n\nSince this statement appears in Lester's rejoinder to his critics, it seems that Machlup's\nefforts to lay the ghost of this fallacy were not entirely successful\u2014Aat least as far as Lester\nand Eiteman were concerned\u2014cf. Fritz Machlup, *Rejoinder to an Antimarginalist,\" Am.\nEcon. Rev., Vol. XXXVII, No. 1 (Mar., 1947), pp. 149-50.\n\n? With price equal to v, there is a two-point indeterminacy of output: it is a matter of\nindifference to the firm to produce either zero output or capacity output. Losses equal total\nfixed cost either way.\n\nNotice that, with price between 7 and v, there is a local profit maximum at some posi-\ntive output short of capacity, where price \u2014 MR \u2014 MC and where MC cuts MR from\nbelow; but the zero output is preferred because the loss there (equal to total fixed cost) is\nless than the loss at any positive output. Of course, the zero output also qualifies as a\nlocal profit maximum, because MR\u00ab MC for any small positive output.\n\n\"The case of price equal to (m is interesting as a curiosity. The horizontal marginal-revenue\nline is then tangent to the marginal-cost curve; and profit is neither a minimum nor a\nmaximum, but merely stationary, at the tangency output. Both above and below this\noutput, MR\u00abC MC; so profit is bigger at lower outputs and smaller at higher outputs, even\nthough it is stationary where MR \u2014 MC.\n\n\"'The preceding context of this remark is that \"business men do not determine their\nscale of operations by reference to marginal cost and revenues at all: they simply produce\nall that they can sell.\" This statement is hardly a satisfactory alternative to the marginalist\ntheory of output determination, even under the conditions of impure competition to which\nit obviously refers. Indeed, taken by itself it is no theory at all. What can be sold depends\non price. Hence Eiteman's pronouncement has no explanatory content whatever, except in\nconjunction with a theory of price determination.\n\nYet nowhere does Eiteman explain how prices are set, even where he elaborates on his\ntheory of output (pp. 916-18). His only allusion to a price decision by the producer is the\nstatement (p. 917) that if he *becomes alarmed at a tendency of his inventory to mount,\nhe adjusts his price voluntarily to reduce his inventory and so avoid a forced inventory\nloss of greater proportions later.\" But why not leave price alone, and reduce inventory\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n", "613\n"], "6": ["IV. Marginal Analysis and. Declining Costs\n\nEiteman believes that, if costs exhibit the pattern he stipulates, it is (p.\n913) \"physically impossible for an enterprise to determine a scale of opera-\ntions by equating marginal cost and marginal revenues unless demand is\nextremely inelastic.\" This statement is partly based on his misconceptions\nabout the marginal analysis of a profit maximum at capacity, as already dis-\ncussed; but it is also based on the alleged difficulty of explaining, by means\nof the marginal criteria, the determination of a profit-maximizing output short\nof capacity.!?\n\n?' My colleague, Paul Samuelson, tells me that his practice is to explain to his students\nthat it is *as if\" marginal cost continued vertically upward from such a point as v. On\nthe other hand, the average and total cost curves\u2014which are not \"slope\" concepts\u2014\nshould not be so drawn, since they are defined as the cost minima at various outputs.\n\n\" Professor Machlup's brief discussion of discontinuities in marginal curves implies sub-\nstantial agreement with my interpretation, except that he wavers as to whether or not a\ndiscontinuity implies indeterminacy of the marginal magnitude\u2014Fritz Machlup, Marginal\nAnalysis and Empirical Research,\" Am. Econ. Rev., Vol. XXXVI, No. 4, Pt. 1 (Sept.,\n1946), p. 533. On the one hand, Machlup talks about the \"vertical portion\" of the marginal\ncurve\u2014which does imply indeterminacy; but in the same paragraph he also implies that\nthe marginal value is uniquely equal to its lower limit.\n\n? Professor Lester shares Eiteman's view that declining costs pose peculiar difficulties\nfor the marginalist explanation of less-than-capacity outputs. The most concise statement\nby Lester on this point appears in his *Marginalism, Minimum Wages, and Labor Markets,\"\nAm. Econ. Rev., Vol. XXXVII, No. 1 (Mar., 1947), pp. 135-48. With respect to declining\nvariable unit costs, he says (p. 138): *If business men think that their unit variable costs\n(to say nothing of their overhead costs per unit) change in that fashion, I submit that it\nis extremely difficult to explain both the wide variations of output that occur in the scale\nof plant operations and the size of the average deviation from 100 per cent plant capacity\nthat occurs over say a decade (especially in plants producing articles not carrying the\nproducer's brand names) on the assumption that business men adjust their rate of opera-\ntions according to the principle of maximizing money profits by equating *marginal net\n", "him that marginal cost *ends there\" in the sense in which the average and\ntotal curves do. Rather MC ends there in indeterminacy; unlike the other\ntypes of cost, it does not have a unique point of termination. Hence there is a\npossible justification for drawing the proposed vertical branch of MC indefinite-\nly upward, to emphasize that this indeterminacy has a lower limit at v and no\nupper limit. In addition, there is the pragmatic and purely heuristic justifica-\ntion that this does indeed produce the reassuring intersection which Eiteman,\nrather perversely, wishes to avoid.\"\n\nActually, however, there is no need to insist on this essentially trivial matter\nof draftsmanship. Whether or not we choose to draw vertical marginal-cost\ncurves, the fact remains that MC is indeterminate at any capacity output like\nthat in the diagram. Also, as long as we remember that the heart of the\nprofit-maximizing analysis concerns the Znequalities of MR and MC at lesser\nand greater outputs, there is no need to worry about whether a unique MR\nis equal or unequal to an indeterminate MC at the output we seek. Certainly\nno one need be at a loss for an answer to the question of finding the profit-\nmaximizing output in the instances under discussion; and that, after all, is\nthe sum and substance of marginal analysis.'?\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "612\n"], "5": ["? Only the second of the two inequalities is needed for a profit maximum at zero output,\nbecause of the irrelevance of negative outputs. Strictly speaking, marginal cost is in-\ndeterminate at zero output because the \"left-hand\" derivative of total cost does not exist;\nbut, since the right-hand derivative is the only relevant one, it is perhaps pardonable to\ndefine marginal cost at zero output simply in terms of the one relevant, right-hand\nderivative.\n\nOn the other hand, it is neither necessary nor convenient to invoke a boundary condition\nto explain a local profit maximum at absolute capacity. Here MR is indeed less than MC for\nhigher outputs, by virtue of the customary mathematical convention already mentioned\u2014\nthat MC is indefinitely large, or infinite, for outputs that cannot be produced at any finite\nextra cost.\n\n?] dare say that this apparent anomaly\u2014which is only another instance of cost and\nrevenue discontinuities\u2014is familiar to every teacher of elementary economics who, after\nfirst defining the marginal concepts as discrete additions to cost and revenue, has then\ntried to explain that profit is a maximum when MR and MC are equal. This potential\npedagogical embarrassment\u2014a minor one, to be sure\u2014is mentioned primarily to reinforce\nthe suggestion that the strategic pair of marginal inequalities has more fundamental signifi-\ncance than the customarily emphasized marginal equalit v.\n", "III. TAe General Condition for a Profit Maximum\n\nSince MR \u2014 MC is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a\nprofit maximum, what is the general rule for a (local) profit maximum in\nterms of the marginal criteria? It is this: profit is maximized at a certain\n(non-zero) output when MR 7\u00bb MC at immediately lower outputs and when\nMR \u00ab MC at immediately higher outputs. \"These inequalities, which are\nnecessary anyway as an assurance that we have a profit maximum, are the\nheart of the matter; and when the two inequalities hold, we know that we\nhave at least a local profit maximum, regardless of the possible indeterminacy\nof the marginal quantities at the output in question.\n\n1t is an additional virtue of what I have called the general rule that it also\nholds strictly\u2014as the equality of MR and MC does not\u2014when the marginal\nmagnitudes are defined as discrete increments. Then, if MR 7 MC for *one\nless unit of output\" and if MR \u00ab MC for \"one more unit of output,\" the\nunique profit-maximizing output has been found\u2014at least in terms of alterna-\ntive integers of output. But, if MR \u2014 MC between x and x -- 1 units, profit\nis the same at these two output levels; and the choice between them becomes\n2 matter of indifference.^ It should be appreciated, of course, that when\nMR - MC over a range of outputs, a true indeterminacy of output exists over\nthis range\u2014whether the **marginals\" are defined as discrete quantities or as\ncontinuous variables.\n\nA final question remains as to the propriety of drawing marginal cost as a\nvertical line upward from point v, when the average and total cost curves end\nabruptly at an absolute-capacity output.

Here\nmarginal cost has a lower limit at the Eiteman value, v, but it has no finite\nupper limit.

This in itself implies an inconsistency with his own\nchoice of an essentially discrete and discontinuous definition of marginal\ncost. More fundamentally, if we are to define MR and MC so that their\nequality can ever imply an exact output where profit is maximized, there is\nno alternative but to make use of the calculus. Marginal cost is the slope of\nthe total cost curve; it is the first derivative of total cost with respect to out-\nput; it is the rate at which total cost changes for indefinitely small changes\nof output in either direction\u2014and similarly, of course, for marginal revenue.\nThe extra cost represented by the *last unit of output\"\u2014or by *'one more\nunit of output\"\u2014is thus no more than a discrete approximation of exact mar-\nginal cost. Furthermore, this discrete approximation does not refer to\nmarginal cost a\u00a3 a unique output, but rather to the change in total cost be-\ntween two adjacent outputs.*\n\nIn order for a marginal quantity to be determinate, the slope of the total\nfunction to which it relates must be the same for indefinitely small changes\nof output in either direction; or, in other words, both the \"left-hand\" and the\n\"right-hand\" derivatives of the total function must have the same value at\nthe specified output. Otherwise, if the slope of the total curve changes discon-\ntinuously at a certain output, the slope or marginal value is not determinate\nat that output. The discontinuity is said to be a \"finite\" one if the unequal\nleft- and right-hand derivatives are both finite. Otherwise, as in the case of\n\n*Eiteman also says (p. 913, n.) that \"the marginal cost curve . . . for mathematical\nreasons will coincide with average costs at an output of one product.\" Unless he means\nto refer here to average variable cost, this statement is doubly mischievous; for it implies\nthat fixed cost is attributable to producing the first unit. Actually, true fixed cost is incurred\neven at zero output.\n\n* Tt should not be thought, however, that it is inappropriate to assume output and money\nmagnitudes to be continuous variables, even when the product is physically indivisible.\nActually, *output\" in a cost-revenue diagram is really a rate of output per unit of time.\nThus, if a small firm produces one piano every two weeks, its rate of output per week\nis half a piano.\n\n*I am not suggesting that we must all start using the rigorous definitions in our ele-\nmentary classes; but even for elementary pedagogy one practical suggestion is in order.\nIn tables of cost and revenue data, where the marginal magnitudes are given the discrete\ndefinitions, the marginal figures should be placed between the rows of the other figures to\nemphasize the contrast that the marginal values, unlike the total and average ones, refer\nto differences between successive levels of output rather than to unique /evels of output.\n\n* Marginal cost may be subject to finite discontinuities, for example, because of the pay-\nment of overtime premiums, or because of the need to use equipment of inferior efficiency\nin order to exceed a certain output.\n\nA similar indeterminacy of marginal revenue occurs whenever there is a sharp break in\nthe slope of the demand curve\u2014and hence in the slope of the total-revenue function.\nExamples include the demand for the firm's product in several types of imperfectly com-\npetitive situations, notably the one involving the \"kinked\" oligopolistic demand curve\u2014cf.\nR.

The Limited Significance of the Marginal Equality\n\nOne of Eiteman's criticisms of marginalism is that, if marginal revenue\nintersects the vertical line of full capacity above point v in the diagram,\nmarginal revenue does not equal\u2014but exceeds\u2014marginal cost at the profit-\nmaximizing capacity output. Hence, he complains, marginal analysis falls\ndown in this case because there is no intersection of MR and MC. The pen-\nchant of many economists for continuing marginal cost as a vertical line\nupwards from point v he dismisses (pp. 913-14) as *an attempt to save face\nby a play on words.\"\n\nWhile Eiteman's interpretation may seem a quibble\u2014if only because he is\nnot attacking the substance of marginalism\u2014he has indeed raised a point\nwhich, as a matter of exposition, does cause difficulty for the literal-minded\nwho consider the criterion of MR \u2014 MC as somehow of importance for its\nown sake. Actually, of course, the famed marginal equality is never more\nthan an implication of a profit maximum; but, what is more to the point, the\nmaximizing of profit does imply an equality of MR and MC only under cer-\ntain favorable conditions, when both the marginal magnitudes are continuous\nfunctions in the vicinity of their intersection. In other words, MR \u2014 MC\nis not a necessary condition for a profit maximum.*\n\nWhen either of the marginal magnitudes is subject to a discontinuity, it is\nindeterminate at the output where this discontinuity occurs. Such is the case\nwith marginal cost at capacity output in the diagram. Then, if MR lies above\npoint v, it is not uniquely equal to the indeterminate MC. This is not to say,\nhowever\u2014as Eiteman would have it\u2014that MR unambiguously exceeds MC.\nIf anything, marginal cost is simultaneously greater than, equal to, and less\nthan marginal revenue.\n\nThe root of Eiteman's difficulty is that he uses a definition of marginal cost\nwhich is out of place in a discussion which presumes to be rigorous. To him,\nmarginal cost is the cost of \"the last unit.\" Hence, he holds that marginal\n\nFor the rest, Eiteman's misgivings about marginal analysis concern two separable ele-\nments, both of which are incorporated in my diagram: (a) the \"sharp corners\" at v and t,\nmade by the junctions of the unit-cost curves with the vertical capacity line; and (b) the\nuniformly negative slope of variable unit cost at all outputs short of capacity.\n\nThe theoretical questions he has raised would also be involved to some extent under\nsomewhat weaker assumptions\u2014-e.g., declining total unit cost, with no such restriction on\nvariable unit cost. I mention this possibility mainly with reference to the cost hypothesis\nembodied in the cost accountant's usual *breakeven chart.\" Such charts ordinarily imply\nconstant marginal cost, at least over the accustomed ranges of output; and they imply\neither constant or declining variable unit cost, depending on whether or not marginal cost\nhas a falling phase over the range of very low outputs.\n\nWith either Eiteman's costs or those of the cost accountants, it is a separate question\nwhether there are \"sharp corners\" at absolute capacity. I discuss this matter last of all, in\nSection V.\n\n* Nor is it, of course, a sufficient condition\u2014since the equality of MR and MC may also\nindicate a profit minimum, or a stationary value which is neither a maximum nor a\nminimum. Further, if more than one local profit maximum exists, we must still find the\nmaximum maximorum\u2014if any\u2014simply by comparing the profits implied by the various\nlocal maxima.\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n", "609\n"], "2": ["t\no\no\no\n\nt\n\nv\n09, OUTPUT 1007;\n\nis assumed to approach zero as the curve approaches the point v.

In reply to Lester's questionnaire, the executives of 33 firms reported that their\nvariable unit costs decline as their operations increase from 70 per cent to 100 per cent of\ncapacity, while only 3 firms reported rising variable unit costs anywhere in this range. On\nthe other hand, Lester did not raise the question of the behavior of costs at and beyond\ncapacity; and, indeed, he did not stop to define the concept of \"capacity.\"\n\nAs Stigler has already indicated, some of Lester's respondents rather overdid their enthusi-\nasm for declining costs; for their answers implied zegative marginal costs, i.e., declining\ntotal costs\u2014G. J. Stigler, Professor Lester and the Marginalists,\" Am. Econ. Rev., Vol.\nXXXVII, No. 1 (Mar., 1947), p. 156. Stigler, however, did not indicate how pervasive was\nthis anomalous result. It is implied by no less than ten of the twenty averages given in the\nupper third of Lester's Table II (p. 69). For example, there is a 12.5 per cent change of\noutput between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of capacity\u2014with the upper figure used as\nthe base. This means that if variable unit cost is 12.5 per cent lower at 80 per cent than\nat 70 per cent of capacity, the arc elasticity of the variable-unit-cost curve is unity; and\ntotal cost is the same at the two levels of output. Actually, *6 metal-working firms\"\nsaid they had an average decline of 15.9 per cent in variable unit cost between these output\nlevels, and the similar figure for \"6 others\" was 13.9 per cent. Similarly, when output\nincreases from 95 per cent to 100 per cent of capacity, the maximum credible decline of\nunit variable cost is 5 per cent; but \"7 cotton-clothing firms\" showed a 5.6 per cent\ndecline, 14 furniture firms\" a 6.4 per cent decline, and the average decline for all 33 firms\nwas 5.5 per cent.\n\n?* While I think I have faithfully represented Eiteman's assumptions about typical costs,\nit should not be thought that all the theoretical questions with which we are both concerned\nnecessarily depend on precisely this cost pattern.

Either one must consider\nthese relevant coefficients\u2014and thereby possibly reach conclusions different\nfrom Professor Frisch's, or else he must plead a lack of data, and thereby\nadmit the limited operational significance of his analysis and the impossibility\nof making economically meaningful forecasts. An answer to this dilemma is\nnot apparent in Professor Frisch's paper.\n\nOne can establish certain *import-export coefficients\" from the existing\nstructure of any one matrix. These may take the form of a ratio of country\nA's exports to country B to the total exports of country A, or a ratio of the\nimports by country A from country B to the total exports of country A. The\nprimary problem, however, is to forecast changes in these coefficients. To do\nthis one must know not only the numerical values of the previously men-\ntioned variables, but also their general interdependence and dynamical rela-\ntionships. For, since \"coupling\" is a common feature in the international\neconomy, it is not possible to allow one sector of the system to vary and\nstill keep the other sectors constant without making contradictory assump-\ntions. In many cases a country may not be important to the whole world\neconomy, but the converse situation is rare. Under conditions of multilateral-\nism, it may be quite generally true that country A imports a considerable\nshare of country B's exports, but that A exports its major share elsewhere\nthan to B. Then we must consider the influence of A on B and the influence\nof the other countries on A.\n\nNaturally, as in most economic problems, one cannot consider all the vari-\nables. Yet the operational significance of the trade matrix depends upon the\npossibility of isolating and considering at least the most important and rele-\nvant variables. If these cannot be isolated and measured exactly, then it is\ninadmissible to advocate policy upon the basis of an analysis which presup-\nposes such definite measurement.\n\nFurthermore, it should be recognized that the skewness of the matrix may\nbe symptomatic of different kinds of disequilibria. The disequilibrium may be\nof a cyclical or non-cyclical character and, under the latter, either a price\ndisequilibrium or a structural disequilibrium.? Even though the payment effect\nmay be present in all these cases, it is apparent that discriminatory import\nrestrictions would not be the best type of policy in each case. To contend that\nnon-proportional import restrictions should be adopted whenever a skewness\nappears, is to deny the validity of arguments which stress internal recovery\nprograms for cyclical disequilibrium, devaluation for price disequilibrium,\nand certain internal measures for structural disequilibrium.\n\nIt may also be noted that the existence of a skewness in the matrix does\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n", "625\n"], "1": ["The Trade Matrix: A Further Comment on Professor Frisch's Paper\n\nProfessor Frisch's discussion of the trade matrix has neglected, and Dr.\nPolak's comment thereupon* has not sufficiently isolated, some significant im-\nplications which impair the trustworthiness of the matrix as a basis for policy\ndecisions by the International Monetary Fund and International Trade Or-\nganization.

The Inflation in France: A Summary of Its Causes and Significance\n\nAt the time this article is being written, more than three and a half\nyears have elapsed since the liberation of Paris from the grip of the\nGermans. Over this period, France has been engaged in a desperate\nstruggle to revive her economy, which four years of enemy occupa-\ntion had sapped of its strength. While considerable progress has been\nmade in many sectors, the disappointing fact remains that over-all pro-\nduction has scarcely reached the 1938 level, which in itself was a de-\npressed year, consumption is far below prewar standards, and the\nreconstruction and modernization of the economy are only in their\ninitial stages.\n\nWhy has not economic recovery been more rapid in France? To this\nquestion there is no simple answer: a complex group of factors has\ncontributed to the slow pace of development. The problems have been\ndifficult: starting anew with a greatly weakened economy to meet the\ntasks not only of mere survival but of reconstruction and rehabilitation,\nthe French were confronted with raw material shortages (especially\ncoal), labor shortages, obsolescent equipment, exhausted land, insuffi-\ncient foreign exchange resources, and political instability. These prob-\nlems were inherited from the war and occupation, and in some cases\nwere part and parcel of a general world situation; the solution obvi-\nously would take time and would depend not only upon national efforts\nbut also upon world developments.\n\nOne of the primary factors which has been responsible for the\nabsence of a greater rate of economic recovery in France is the\nmonetary instability which has plagued the country since its liberation.\nAt the time Paris was delivered from the Germans (August, 1944),\ngeneral wholesale prices were about 2.7 times the average of 1938, and\nretail prices in Paris were 2.95 times the average of 1938. By the end\nof the year 1947, the level of prices, both wholesale and retail, had in-\ncreased to approximately four and a half times the level prevailing in\nAugust, 1944.

The Impact of the War on the Economy of Brazil\n\nLike every economy in the world, that of Brazil after 1939 was\ndominated by the forces of war. International trade has long played a\nmajor part in Brazil's economic life. Attention will be paid first, there-\nfore, to this segment of her economy.

In this way, the classical economists suc-\nceeded in integrating their theory of the value of money with their gen-\neral theory of value.

Now the commission orders a price decrease to P,,\nand the company has a larger deficit than beforehand. Next, the price is raised\nto P5; and price control goes around and around until the price is equated to\nAC at E.\n\nThis case resembles the price-output relations under the *cobweb theorem,\"\nbut the conditions naturally are different. The situation is not one of pure\ncompetition, regulatory anticipations of sales rather than actual production\nplans are based on past prices, production of public utility service is not man-\naged by fixed \"periods\" as in the case of agricultural commodities, and the\nprice of public utility service is controlled by average (reasonable) costs in-\nstead of an \"available\" supply.? Yet the past-sales rule, the assumption\n(which is stated in the first part of this section) of a persisting regulatory\nequation of average cost and price, and an intersection of the demand and\naverage cost curves where the latter is increasing can create a condition, as\nshown in Figure 4, that is not wholly unlike the price-supply relationships\nin the cobweb case. And the cobweb analysis gives guidance on an expected\nprice movement away from or toward the E point of Figure 4.!* A case of\ndivergent price fluctuation, based on an increasing instead of a U-shaped cost\ncurve, occurs when the cost curve is more elastic than the demand curve. And\na case of a convergent price fluctuation occurs when, as in Figure 4, the\nupward-sloping cost curve is less elastic than the demand curve. Such direct\nconvergence toward E is disturbed in Figure 4 because a U-shaped cost curve\nexists\u2014because prices may be equated alternately to increasing and decreasing\nsections of the cost curve. An equation of P and AC is certain within the\nincreasing-cost limits of Figure 4, and is possible (even assured if enough\nattempts are made) within the full range of cost behavior.\n\nEven though the analysis of this section is not based on actual demand\nand cost data, it still shows some likely consequences of the past-sales rule.\nStep-by-step movement toward AR \u2014 AC, the primary point of Figures 1\nand 2, seems quite demonstrable in general as long as the demand is not\nperfectly inelastic and the average costs are not constant. A gradual move-\nment toward reasonable earnings doubtless starts farther down than P, of\nFigure 1; such an initial price and such an extraordinary amount of excessive\nearnings are used to give a clear view of the movement. Perhaps the case of\na deficient return, which is illustrated in Figure 2, is not considered common\nbecause the traditional regulatory emphasis is on excessive returns. Yet in-\ncreases in raw material prices, wages, and construction costs may make de-\nficient earnings a more frequent experience in public utility industries. At any\nrate the reasoning about an upward price adjustment, controlled by the old-\nsales assumption, is no more than a reversal of the case for a downward ad-\njustment.

Unfortunately the AR curve is not only below the AC\ncurve at OQ;, but also the cost curve does not show that the firm has enough\nplant capacity to produce this quantity. Indeed, the absolute limit of plant\ncapacity, which is probably well beyond the point where the firm wishes to\noperate, seems to be about OQ;. Thus, by disregarding demand elasticity the\nregulators put the company in a position where either more plant must be\nbuilt, stand-by plant brought into use, service rationed, or prices increased.!?\nThis case suggests that the rule can have some uneconomic effects on the use\nof public utility resources.\n\nA disparity between consumer demand and plant capacity may occur for\nsome but not all buyer classes. It can be related to price structures, and be\na matter of differences in demand elasticities. The commission reduces the\nprices in all service classifications, including those for which close substitutes\nare available. And if the prices of the near substitutes do not change at all,\nthen the commission and company encounter sharp increases in sales. This\nhappens when the established price relation between substitutes is broken,\nbuyers notice the price difference, and a shift to the low-priced service begins.\nSuch a change is significant where the cross-elasticity of demand is high. For\nexample, a considerable reduction of industrial gas rates, making gas as\ncheap or even cheaper than coal for many kinds of heating, is certain to reveal\na considerable cross elasticity of demand. And there are other similar situations,\nsuch as the choice between gas and electricity for water heating, between the\nlong-lines service of the Bell System and Western Union service, and between\ngas, coal, and fuel oil for space heating.\n\nLet us suppose that, as in many cases, the rates are reduced in all service\nclassifications by the same percentage. For some classes, the ones with in-\nelastic or only slightly elastic demand, the consumption increases moderately ;\nbut the other types of service, having high rates of substitution (immediate\nor eventual) with other commodities, can expand a great deal. Expecting\neither a small increase or no increase at all in sales as a price decrease is\nordered, the commission starts an extraordinary change that can press on or\nbeyond the sensible limits of plant capacity.'* On the other hand, a general in-\ncrease in prices is followed by a significant reduction in sales to the buyers who\nhave an elastic demand. Such responses to price changes are most likely to\noccur, of course, when the prices of substitutes do not change in proportion to\npublic utility rates. Prices of fuel and coal do not vary directly with gas\nprices; in fact, prices of oil and coal increased during the past decade while\nthe space-heating and industrial prices for gas remained quite stable. Nor\ndo gas and electric prices, or telegraph and telephone rates move closely\n\n? And neglect of probable demand increases, which is not discussed directly in this\npaper, can have similar effects,\n\n^ Because the buyer response to such price decreases can be spread over a few years\nor even a decade when sizable investments must be made in consumption equipment such\nas furnaces and industrial machinery, the commission, having changes in membership and\nlacking understanding of much economic behavior, does not realize that the large sales and\nthe shortage of plant capacity are traceable to its pricing policy.

Putting\nthe problem in this simple manner, a commission needs to do no more than\nchoose a base period for the revenue calculations. As Table I shows, the\nregulators choose a variety of base-revenue periods.

See Table I 19 (bid.),\nunder \"Peacetime Concept.\" The comparison of plant and equipment, as of Jan. 1, with\noutput for the subsequent year is not too inexact.\n\n*'These indices are in the form of reciprocals of those of the type Mr. Carter uses.\nIt seems hardly proper to state the variations in a magnitude in the form of an index\nwhich varies inversely with the magnitude.\n\n* Estimates of capital consumption are based on quantities of capital, not on quantities\nof output. Therefore, the true using-up of capital may have far exceeded estimated capital\nconsumption. Moreover, replacements and additions can no longer be made at the old\ncosts on which these estimates of capital consumption were based.\n\n* The author is chairman of the National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc.\n", "1929-1939\nabout 1196\nabout 346\nabout 396\n", "He also gives us estimates, for all three years, of the flow of goods to con-\nsumers as well as of net national product, which is the usual basis for meas-\nuring economic growth.? Here are the results in billions of dollars, at 1929\nprices, with the derived indices.*\n\n1939\n1. Plant and Equipment 98.495 115.458 118.452\n2. Consumers' Goods 50.2 76.4 85.1\n3.

Index of Utilization 1 J 1d 1\n(4 over 1) 1.69 | 1.33 1.31\n\nIt appears that the index of utilization improved markedly from 1919 to\n1929, but also that it improved slightly from 1929 to 1939. That certainly\ndoes not indicate under-utilization in 1939. If anything, it indicates the oppo-\nsite. But the striking fact that these estimates bring out is the marked slowing\ndown in the second period (percentages in round figures).\n\n1919-1929 1929-1939\nIncrease in flow of goods to consumers about 5046 about 1196\nIncrease in net national product about 5096 about 346\nIncrease in plant and equipment about 2096 about 346\n\nThese figures seem to be in accord with the truism that, in our economy,\neconomic growth depends on business capital formation. They also indicate\nthat, for the whole prewar decade, things were not going well with us, chiefly,\nat least, because of the lack of adequate net business capital formation. It does\nnothing but harm to blink these facts, or to explain them in a way that does\nnot withstand analysis and that only serves to distract attention from the real\ntrouble. It seems likely that really careful estimates would show that, from\n1936 to 1945, there was a higher rate of utilization than in any period since\nfixed capital became so important in our economy. In fact, the rate was prob-\nably so high as to constitute a serious threat for the future unless net business\n\ncapital formation is resumed on a large scale.*\n(OC Derenr n Novre*\n", "492\n", "Iquipment\n' Goods\n\ntilization\n\nnal Product\n\ntilization\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "396\n"], "2": ["modern economy is dependent, by and large, upon capital formation is an\neconomic truism which I take for granted and which, I think, one ignores\nonly at his peril.\n\n2. I do not state that the cessation of business capital formation *prob-\nably resulted from a cessation of saving.\" Instead, I first suggest it as a possi-\nble cause to be explored and then proceed to demonstrate, in section 2 (p. 25),\nthat there was no cessation nor even a radical diminution in individual savings;\nI also show that more than half of the great business dissaving in these eight\nyears, 1931 to 1938, appears to have been made up in the three years, 1939\nto 1941.\n\n3. I do not argue that \"there must be money saving in order that there be\nreal saving.\" Instead, my argument is exclusively in \"real\" terms (see my\nnote 10). Mr. Carter says, *Real saving is identical with net capital forma-\ntion.\" In the aggregate, yes; at the several levels, no. (This is clearly shown\nby my Table VI.) The whole point is that the source and channeling of real\nsavings changed, so that there was no net business real capital formation for\nthe whole period.\n\nPossibly these misunderstandings were not general. But I do not want Mr.\nCarter's remarks on *under-utilization\" to pass uncontested, as I have\nthe impression that this little \"alibi\" is a currently popular one in many\nquarters.\n\nThat there was a period during the early 'thirties when there was under-\nutilization of all resources, capital and labor alike, no one doubts. But Mr.\nCarter's own figures show that, by 1936, his rate of utilization of capital had\nreturned to the level which he states was normal from 1923 to 1929, and that,\nby the early 1940's, it had become higher than ever before. How does he\nreconcile these figures with the supposition that there was under-utilization,\nif he is considering the period I considered\u2014that is, 1930 to 1943 or even\n1945?\n\nHowever, Mr. Carter's figures are not really to the point. The thesis of\nunder-utilization, in connection with the flow of goods to consumers or even\nthe net national product, can only be conceived to apply to the real capital\nused in producing such product. That confines it to business real capital.\nMoreover, the concept is only applicable to business real capital in the form\nof plant (improvements) and equipment. Professor Kuznet gives us estimates\nof these items for 1919 and 1939, and a fair basis for a guess as to 1929.!\n\n\"The figure for business plant and equipment as of Jan. 1, 1919, is the sum of lines\n1, 2, 3, 4a and 18 in Table IV 7, National Product since 1869, Simon Kuznets (New York,\nNat. Bur. of Econ. Research, 1946), The estimate for Jan. 1, 1939, is the sum of these\nitems plus additions for the years 1919 to 1938, inclusive, shown in lines 1, 2, 3 and 14\nof Tables IV, 89 (ibid.). The guess as to the same items for Jan. 1, 1929 is made as follows:\nThe increase in aggregate improvements and equipment which occurred from Jan. 1, 1919\nto Jan. 1, 1939 is shown by deducting line 10, col. 5, from line 12, col. 5 in Table IV 11.\nThe increase from Jan. 1, 1919 to Jan. 1, 1929, derived by deducting line 10, col. 5 from\nline 11, col. 5, same table, is about 85 per cent of this amount, Applying this percentage\nto the difference between 98.495 and 118.452, the foregoing items of business improvements\nand equipment only, gives 115.458 for Jan. 1, 1929. This may understate the 1929 figures.\nIf so, the index of utilization was then lower than 1/1.51 or 1/1.33, and the increase in\nthe index from 1929 to 1939 was greater than shown below.\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n", "395\n"], "1": ["The first part of Mr. Carter's comment, in the December, 1947 number of\nthis Review, on my article, ^The Prospect for Economic Growth,\" which\nappeared in the March, 1947 number, indicates certain misunderstandings of\nwhat I said.\n\n1.
