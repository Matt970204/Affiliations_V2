F.o.b. mill prices. The delivered price at any point equals the\nprice at the production center at which the purchase is made plus\nthe actual transportation charge to the point of delivery.\n\nb. Freight equalization. The delivered price at any point equals\nthe lowest sum of factory price plus transportation charges from any\nproduction center, even though the purchase is made at another\nproduction center.\n\nc.

Smithies, who falls in neither group, concluded that the basing point\nprice system did not in general maximize profits and, indeed, that it was comprehensible\nonly under special assumptions whose relevance to the basing point industries was not\ndemonstrated and is not obvious.

A study of these\nwritings offers the American economist the unique pleasure of seeing himself\nand his environment in a peculiar mirror, thouch the images, to put it mildly, may\noften cause surprise; it also gives him valuable information both for the under-\nstanding of the Soviet Union and for the understanding of himself.\n\n\"The article translated here appeared in the Tuly-August (No. 4) 1947 issue of the\nSoviet journal Planned Economy (Planovoye Khozyaystvo), which is published\nbi-monthly by the State Planning Commission (Gosplan). It was selected for trans-\nlation because of its interest: in a rather short space, the author covers some of\nthe most important ideas discussed in Western economic literature in the works of\nSchumpeter, Hansen, Keynes, Ezekiel and others. The interpretation of these\nideas by a Soviet economist is most instructive. But I hope the reader will avoid\nthe error so often made by Soviet economists in regard to our own literature, that\nis, of treating this article as \u00a3Ae official pronouncement on the subjects covered.\nThough the range of economic opinion in the Soviet Union is much more narrow\nthan in the United States, differences as witnessed by sharp debates (such as the\nVarga discussion) do exist.

In his interpretation\nof economic facts and ideas, the Soviet economist is not supposed to treat his ma-\nterial with impartiality and objectivity; the latter word has acquired an invective\nmeaning in the Soviet Union.

Indeed it would be as impossible\nto establish a monetary and fiscal system completely devoid of \"rules\" as to\nprovide ironclad guarantees against any future discretionary action. I feel\nrather that some discretionary action will be required, particularly in view of\nprice rigidities and volatile expectations. Friedman, in his rejoinder, considers\nthe central feature of his proposal to be the fact that *it dispenses as much as\npossible with discretionary action and relies almost (my italics) solely on\nautomatic reactions.\" Thus both of us apparently believe that discretionary\naction will have a significant r\u00f3le to play, in spite of the virtues of a logical\nfiscal and monetary system. .\n\nThe supplementary discretionary policies called for by the failure of the\neconomy automatically to right itself are several. Friedman himself (pp.\n253-54) describes deflationary conditions which monetary inflation would\ncorrect, while the contribution which may be expected from a discretionary\ngovernment investment program has been the subject of extensive literature\nover the last decade and a half. It is possible that Friedman and I would dis-\nagree on what particular action would be appropriate to given circumstances\nbut his suggestion in the rejoinder, *that to be successful the authority must\ntake action largely counter to that being taken by the rest of the community,\"\nleads me to believe that even on this we would not be far apart.\n\nFriedman and I agree that price rigidities and lags complicate counter\ncycle policies, but disagree with respect to their significance. I hold that\nwhenever price rigidities defeat automatic adjustments, whether these adjust-\nments be those resulting from Friedman's proposal or those that are now\ninherent in the system, discretionary action can provide some contribution to\nfuller employment.

But it should\nbe an informed choice, a choice by an electorate that understands the alterna-\ntives, and is not misled by rosy delusions that we can get \"plenty,\" now,\nmerely by redistribution.\n\nOnly one technical point needs mentioning. Dr. Ackley seems to feel that\nunder azy circumstances raising the market rate of interest will \"reduce\ninvestment.\" This is a widespread misconception of Keynesian theory. In-\nflationary \"forced saving\" is, of course, one way\u2014possibly the characteristi-\ncally socialist way (vide Russia)\u2014of getting capital formation. But I assume\nwe are agreed that this method is bad. Accordingly, we desire only invest-\nment without inflation. Now ex ante investment in excess of ex ante saving\nwil tend to produce inflation. Raising the rate to an equilibrium figure,\nunder such circumstances, will not reduce the amount of realized noninfla-\ntionary investment. It will only cut off the margin of attempted investment\n\"causing\" the inflation! If we want more investment, without more inflation,\nthen we want to increase the rate of ex ante saving\u2014which is the point I\nstarted off with. The appropriate interest rate then would be the one rationing\nthe increased flow without inflation.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to remind my readers that my communica-\ntion referred to the secular problem. Dr. Ackley quotes my \"Future of\nKeynesian Economics.\"* I stand by that article in full. If serious depression\nbegins, deficit finance and public works should, in my opinion, be integral\nparts of an effective program. This, however, does not a\u00edfect secular policy.\nIf private saving-investment would be needed again soon (and they will\nbe if we adopt intelligent policy), we would be very foolish to liquidate the\ninducement to save for the sake of a short-run crisis.\n\nDavr\u00bb McConp WnicHT\n", "966\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "1": ["Inflation and Equality: Rejoinder\n\nProfessor Ackley impliedly concedes the basic factual assumption of my\npaper: the marginal propensity to save of the well-to-do is greater than that\nof the lower-income groups. He also (end of his sixth paragraph) spells out\ncorrectly my fundamental contention and concedes its logical validity. I did\nmean that the flow of net private investment ought to be (secularly) higher,\nand I do feel that the present aggregate net private (secular) inducement\nto invest, still more particularly that for risk-taking new ventures, under our\npresent tax-wage-price control outlook, is only adequate where the (propor-\ntional) secular level of consumption is very high\u2014too high.\n\nBlaming the inflation on \"excessive investment\" alone seems to me true,\neven formally, only as tautology. The real stimulus can come from the\nconsumption side. We might put the matter as follows: the people have\nbecome accustomed to demanding a certain rate of increase of real income.\nPrice control and restriction of investment might, for a time, halt inflationary\nprice rise. But real income might not be rising sufficiently. Therefore, there\nmight be demands for \"fourth-Cround\" money wages increases, etc., which\ncould start the inflation going again. Sometimes eliminating all saving-invest-\nment might not suffice to meet the demand for present consumption.\n\nSince Dr. Ackley concedes my basic point, the real question becomes, as\nhe says, one of values.! For brevity's sake I must discuss his main point only.\nDo not Dr. Ackley's doubts as to whether there is a \"welfare case\" for a\nhigher rate of investment imply a sort of \"iron law of consumer satisfaction\"?\nOf course he does not commit himself to such a position, but would not the\nlogic lead to some such statement as \"all income levels are about equally\nsatisfying (or unsatisfying). Progress is a delusion.\"\n\nNow, if the public agreed, there would be no more to be said. But I believe\nin (1) democracy and (2) our duty as economists to help the people toward\nan informed choice. I say to the lower-income groups, *Vou want a rapidly\nrising standard of living. To get it more capital is needed, to get more\ncapital we need more investment. Some moderation in your demands for\nequality today will give you more goods tomorrow\u2014without inflation\"?\n\nIt is important to realize that Dr. Ackley does z0\u00a3 dispute the correctness\nof this argument under the circumstances assumed. What seems tentatively\nsuggested is some such reply as this: No, no, people of America, you will\nbe just as unhappy no matter what your national income is. Equal distribu-\ntion will give us enough' goods. Forget about growth.\"\n\nI see nothing mysterious about the way to settle this argument\u2014demo-\ncratically.

Perhaps it\nmight be best to say I argue for a balance of equalities, none of which can be wholly\nrealized.\n\n?

On the aggregate level saving, defined as\nthe difference between personal income and consumer expenditures,\nwas usually expressed by one magnitude, either in billion dollars or in\nper cents of income. It was assumed that the most important variable\ndetermining both the amounts saved and the proportions of income\nsaved is the given income level. Numerous investigations confirmed\nthat years of high personal income were characterized by high saving\nand years of low income by low saving, occasionally even by net dis-\nsaving. According to the most recent estimates of the Commerce De-\npartment, consumer expenditures exceeded disposable personal income\nonly during the deepest depression, namely in 1932, 1933, and 1934.\n\nSimilar considerations were applied when the analysis was made on\nthe level of individual families. The results of expenditure surveys were\npresented in one continuum. Amounts saved were ranked from the\nlargest saver to the smallest saver, then to the \"zero saver\" (whose\nexpenditures equalled his income), then to the smallest dissaver, and\nfinally to the largest dissaver. It was sometimes assumed that the large\nsavers were, on the whole, the high-income people, and the dissavers,\nthe low-income people.

It was not until the depression of the 1930's continued to the point\nwhere the inability of private business or private charity to cope with\nthe situation was generally recognized that government became a major\n\n*' The author is assistant professor of economics in the department of economics and\nsocial institutions at Princeton University.\n\n!

With this\ndebt amounting to more than $250 billion and comprising about 60\nper cent of all outstanding debt in the country, the foremost objective\nof our monetary policy has come to be *the maintenance of an orderly\nmarket in government securities\" and the prevention, or at least a\nlimitation, of the rise of yields on these securities, especially on the\nlong-term issues. Though the rise of this new objective has been the\nsubject of widespread discussion, the writer believes that its full im-\nplications are not generally appreciated. The purpose of this article,\ntherefore, is to trace the rise of this policy objective and to raise some\nquestions concerning its consequences.\n\nThe Evolution of the Policy before Pearl Harbor\n\nPrior to 1937 Federal Reserve purchases and sales of government\nsecurities were primarily for the purpose of influencing the volume of\nmember bank reserves and of member bank borrowings at the Reserve\nBanks. These were, of course, designed to affect interest rates, includ-\ning yields on governments, but the effects were expected to result mainly\nfrom changes in the ability and willingness of banks to lend and pur-\nchase securities. But in 1937, apparently for the first time as a major\npolicy objective, the Federal Reserve bought long-term governments\nfor the purpose of limiting their price decline. After reaching high\nlevels in late 1936, the prices of long-term governments and high-grade\ncorporate bonds began to fall early in 1937. This decline did not extend\nto Treasury bills and notes. The Reserve System thereupon initiated\nwhat it called its \"flexible portfolio policy,\" purchasing more than\n$200 million of the longer-term bonds and reducing its holdings of the\nshorter-term notes and bills by about $150 millions. The decline of\ngovernment bond prices was stopped and reversed.'

The glucose cases\ndealt with the first issue and explicitly reserved the second. The cement\ncase was argued mainly on the second issue.\n\nIn the issue of the non-base mill, the writer has reservations as to the\nlegal reasoning used to deal with it in the glucose cases, but agrees\nwith the probable economic result, assuming that reasonable latitude\nis afforded for differences between different mill or base prices, and\nfor competitive freight absorption. As to freight absorption, he dissents\n(as will appear) from the legal reasoning on which Mr. Justice Black\nchose to rest his interpretation of the Robinson-Patman Act in the\ncement case, and sees objections to the resulting situation. These in-\nclude not only serious uncertainty as to what the law requires, but\ninherent dif\u00fcculty of clarifying it in a way that would avoid dangers\nof unduly rigid interpretation and enforcement, bringing unforeseen\nconsequences, and likely to entail costs out of proportion to probable\nbenefits. Objections apply also to law-making power exercised by the\nFederal Trade Commission, without proper accountability for the\nrisky legal and economic doctrines it is free to employ.\n\n* The author's past connections with the basing point question (now all terminated)\ninclude participation in the NRA study of iron and steel basing point pricing. Subse-\nquently, he was engaged with Professor A. R. Burns to make an impartial report on the\npricing system in cement, final completion of which was forestalled by the Federal\nTrade Commission's complaint against the cement industry, after which he consulted\n\nwith counsel for the Cement Institute. He is aware of no present obstacles to his speak-\ning with complete freedom, as an unattached individual.\n\n'The reader should note that I speak of \"phantom freight\" only with reference to\nthat charged by a non-base mill at points that are nearer to it, freightwise, than they\nare to the base that governs the delivered price. \"Freight absorption,\" as here used,\nrefers to a base mill, reaching out to sell in areas where the delivered price is governed\nby another base; and the first mill must accept a mill net less than its own base\nprice in order to sell there. So used, the terms have unambiguous meaning. As some-\ntimes used, the distinction becomes clouded, because base prices at different bases may\nor may not be equal, and a non-base mill may or may not be regarded as the limiting\ncase of a base mill with a base price so high as to be inoperative.\n"}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["J.

How much Keynes con-\ntributed in his last major book depends on whether one stresses the impulse\ntoward new ideas and new lines of investigation, or, on the other hand, what\nhe actually Zeld in the General Theory. Thus Professor Hansen says:\n\"Keynes, however, contributed greatly to the theory of the rate of interest.\nAs a result of his analysis we now place less emphasis than formerly on the\nrate of interest as a means of increasing the volume of investment\" (p. 138).\nIn other words, although Keynes put interest at the very center of his theory,\nhe \"contributed greatly\" because we now recognize the limited efficacy of\ninterest rates.
