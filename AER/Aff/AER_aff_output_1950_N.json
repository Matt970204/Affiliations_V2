The suggestion was incidental to their effective presenta-\ntion of the case for larger imports. But, in itself, it raises questions\u2014eco-\nnomic, ethical, political, and administrative\u2014that merit critical examination.\n\nAs a matter of economics, the proposal has much to commend it. If assur-\nance of compensation for possible losses would serve, in fact, to quiet opposi-\ntion to economic reform, it should justify itself by facilitating adaptation to\nchanges in the conditions of supply and demand, improving the allocation of\nresources, and raising planes of living. The cost of such a program should\nbe far less than that of protecting investors and workers by freezing the pat-\ntern of production and checking the shift of resources into occupations where\nthey could be more effectively employed.\n\nThe principle of compensating those who may incidentally be harmed by\naction taken in the general interest appeals, likewise, to the sense of justice.\nBut it should be noted that this principle has rarely been applied in practice.\nVarious payments have been made to veterans on the ground that time spent\nin military service has impaired their relative position in civilian life. But\nthis would appear to be the only case that is analogous. The government did\nnot compensate the slave owners when it abolished slavery or the owners of\nbreweries and distilleries when it imposed prohibition.

The textile industry\nmigrates from New England to the south; coal loses its market to fuel oil,\nand ice to the mechanical refrigerator; railroads lose business to trucks,\nnatural fibers to synthetics, lumber to metals, and metals to plastics; real in-\ncome is shifted, in wholesale quantities, between debtors and creditors when-\never the general level of prices rises or falls. In none of these cases is com-\npensation offered or proposed.\n\nCompared with the adjustments that are continually being necessitated\nby public policy and by economic change, those that would be involved in any\nlikely reduction of the American tariff should be relatively insignificant. It\nmay be asked, therefore, why this one case of adjustment should be singled\nout for preferred treatment, particularly since it has never been suggested\nthat consumers of imported goods or producers of goods for export should be\nindemnified when the tariff is raised.\n", "This content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Wed, 19 Jan 2022 06:49:25 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Clair Wilcox"], "stable_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1801887"}, "1801888": {"affiliations": {"found": "experts' plan would provide similarly for the regular flow of investment\ncapital from the surplus to the deficit countries, channeled in this case\nthrough the existing International Bank for Reconstruction and Develop-\nment.

Whether wage rates would be in fixed proportion\nto other prices throughout the process, or might vary in relation to other\nprices with variation in the level of employment, is a question which was\nomitted in my paper and which would, of course, have to be considered in a\nfuller treatment.\n\nMr. Klein raises several questions about the origin of my unemployment\nfunction; the crucial one is the question of how the height of the savings\nfunction may depend on the absolute price level.

Although he has injected a large enough anticipation\neffect to make the functions unstable in the neighborhood of the north-east\nintersection, he has started off the process from a situation in which there\nis initially a large /evel effect; alternatively, we may say that he has given\nthe large anticipation effect a relatively small initial rate of price decline\nto work on. As long as he pivots his U line about the point of intersection,\nthe flatter he makes the line the farther to the left of zero does it intersect\nthe horizontal axis. Dividing the initial rate of price decline by the slope of\nthe U function gives us the effect of anticipation, and by his construction he\nhas made this value less than the distance from X; to the value of U(P1,0).\nHe has thus rigged the curves and starting points so that the expansionary\neffect of the low price level outweighs the depressing effect obtained by com-\npounding a large anticipation coefficient with a relatively small initial rate\nof price decline. If he begins to the right of the intersection he describes, he\nis on the opposite side of an unstable intersection and U rises (outward, to\nthe right) instead. Thus his result is only one of those things that may happen\nwhen initial values are far away from a stable intersection, or when there is\n\n*Don Patinkin, *Price Flexibility and Full Employment,\" 4m.

It is not necessarily contrary to\nthe public interest to oppose a scheme (however well intended) on the\ngrounds that it is unworkable.\n\nNor does the public record substantiate Professor Bach's second example,\nwith respect to postwar \"Board proposals to tighten up sharply on interest\nrates.\" The Board's 1945 Annual Report stated explicitly that The Board\ndoes not favor a higher level of interest rates than the Government is now\npaying. If we follow Professor Bach in taking the views of President\nSproul of the New York Bank as representative of the Reserve Bank presi-\ndents, and use the views of Chairman Eccles to represent those of the Board,\nthen the positions seem to be just the reverse of those described by Professor\nBach. As late as October 24, 1946, Chairman Eccles was opposing *an in-\ncrease in interest rates at this time,\"? while on December 6, 1946, Mr. Sproul\nbroke a long silence to make his first controversial public address of the\npostwar period, declaring that **. . . we should look forward to restoring some\nflexibility to the interest rate structure.\" Furthermore, at the peak of the\npostwar inflation, on August 3, 1948, Governor Eccles was still stating that\na rise in the short-term rate was minor in so far as its monetary effect was\nconcerned.' On the same day, however, President Sproul asserted that an\nincrease in short rates would be desirable because, by narrowing the spread\nbetween short- and long-term rates, it would induce the banks to stay in\nshort-term government securities and would introduce and maintain a\nsalutary element of doubt and uncertainty as to the future course of rates.*\nIt appears, therefore, that, contrary to Professor Bach's statement, 0 one\nproposed to raise rates siarply, and that the idea of pursuing an effective\npolicy of restraint involving moderate increases in short rates originated with\nReserve Bank presidents, and was originally advocated by them (notably by\nPresident Sproul) in the face of outright Board opposition.?\n\nProfessor Bach's third \"example\" relates to the postwar special reserve\n\n'!

The Board\nmembers, on the other hand, are further removed from the private banking\ncommunity and are apt to evaluate higher the possible \"public\" advantage\n(for instance, checking inflation) even at the cost of reducing private bank\nearnings or disrupting normal money market procedures (pp. 1176-77).\n\nIn support of his argument, Professor Bach adduces three instances when\nReserve Bank presidents lost sight of the public interest because of a\n*natural\" concern over the local impact of the measures under consideration:\n\n. at various points during the war when the possibility of raising reserve\nrequirements was considered; following the war when Board proposals to\ntighten up sharply on interest rates were under discussion; and when the\nBoard recently proposed that additional special statutory reserve requirements\n.. . be imposed on member banks to check loan expansion . . .

There are, moreover, no\napparent reasons why primary reserve requirements should have been in-\ncreased during that period. Perhaps Professor Bach meant to suggest some-\nthing different, such as an impounding of bank-held government securities\ninto a new type of \"reserve\" with the object of limiting the banks' earnings\non their government portfolios.

The Dollar Shortage\n\nThe dollar shortage is a poor term for the universal disequilibrium\nin the international balances of payments. It suggests that the dis-\nequilibrium could be remedied through increased purchases by the\nUnited States without any, cr any substantial, action by foreign coun-\ntries.\n\nBut no matter how one feels about the particular appellation, the\nfact remains that at present incomes and exchange rates, and with\npresent tastes and technologies, the demand by foreigners for U.S.\ndollars exceeds the supply. Current discussions of this *'excess\" seem\nto imply two interpretations: it may be that foreign countries, particu-\nlarly those who have suffered greatly from the war, wish to reach their\nprewar standard of living. Or it may be that foreign countries wish\n(subconsciously or consciously) to maintain about the same ratio in\ntheir standard of living to that of the United States as existed before\nthe war. The first goal has probably been achieved, with the major\nexceptions of Germany and Italy, in the nations of Northern and West-\nern Europe. The second seems implicit in much of the discussion which\nstresses the enormous increase in the productivity of the American\neconomy compared to European achievements.\n\nThese two \"definitions\" of the dollar shortage may sound cynical,\nbut they are not meant as such. They may account for the persistence\nwith which European nations attempt to live and invest beyond their\nmeans\u2014for this is what the dollar shortage amounts to\u2014as well as the\nsympathy with which their desire to do so has met in the United States.'\n\n* The author, associate professor of economics at the University of Michigan, expresses\nthanks for suggestions from Professors R. A. Musgrave and P. A. Samuelson, who read an\nearlier draft of this paper.\n\n!

The task of the transitional years 1946-51 must be conceived, not\nas that of restoring Europe to what it was in 1929, but as that of accomplishing in six\nyears all the progress and change appropriate to the long interval of twenty-two years.\"\nR.

According to the Ricardian view, which later became the\naccepted view among the great majority of English economists, relative\nprices within a single country are determined largely by costs of pro-\nduction. Capital and labor being mobile, there is a tendency for the\nreturns to the factors of production to be the same in all segments of\nthe economy, and this means that when the demand for various com-\nmodities is altered, the supply of each product is adjusted to the state\nof demand, with only moderate changes in relative prices. In short,\ncost of production governs relative prices while demand governs the\nallocation of labor and capital in the production of different commodi-\nties. With respect to trade between countries, Ricardo argued that his\nsimple cost-of-production theory of relative prices was not applicable.\nSince labor and capital do not move freely from one country to another,\nthere is no necessary tendency for the profits on capital to be the same\nin all countries. In other words, substantial differences can exist between\nwages and profits in one country and wages and profits elsewhere with-\nout bringing about a migration of labor and capital between countries.\nFor this reason it is not meaningful, according to Ricardo, to say that\nrelative prices in international trade are governed, as in domestic trade,\nby relative costs of production.\"\n\nAlthough Ricardo was aware that a cost-of-production theory was\ninadequate to explain prices in international trade, he was always\nsomewhat vague as to how international prices or the terms of trade\n\n* The author is professor of economics at the University of Chicago.\n* Everyman's ed., p. 81.\n* David Ricardo, of. cit., pp. 82-83.\n"}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Lloyd A.

It made a rapid and yet thorough survey of the facts and\nopinions on the subject and an extremely intelligent appraisal of them, and\noffered clear-cut, unambiguous recommendations. This report may be con-\nsidered as a public judgment rendered on the controversy between the fiscal\nand the monetary authorities.

The Senate members were Paul H. Douglas\n(D., IIl.) chairman, distinguished economist and former president of the Amer-\nican Economic Association, and Ralph E.

The sentence reads: *We recommend not only that ap-\npropriate, vigorous, and coordinated monetary, credit, and fiscal policies be\nemployed to promote the purposes of the Employment Act, but also that such\npolicies constitute the Government's primary and principal method of pro-\nmoting those purposes.\" \"This sentence indicates that the Committee believes\nthat the government's part in moderating the business cycle should be princi-\npally through its influence on national income and the volume of money rather\nthan through the use of direct controls over prices, wages, materials, and\nother phases of economic life. The Committee favors the more impersonal\nand democratic approach through the money flow over more dictatorial ap-\nproaches through direct intervention in the economic behavior of individuals.\n\nMore specifically, the Committee takes the stand on fiscal policy that it\nshould contribute to economic stability and should not be dominated by\nfaith in the curative effects of an annually balanced budget.

The output (in the Marx-\nian sense) of the producer and consumer goods industries is divided into\ncapital consumption, wages and surplus value, and equality between the\ndemand for and supply of consumer and producer goods, respectively, is either\ntaken for granted or made the condition of static equilibrium. AIl this may\nhave been a great achievement ninety years ago, but hardly so today.\n\nAs soon as this apparatus is applied to the theory of value and profit, so\nbasic in Marxian doctrine, difficulties appear. Surplus value remains a flow,\nbut constant and variable capital are transformed into stocks. This implies\nnot only that the production period is equal to the period of the turnover\nof these stocks, but that the rates of turnover of constant and of variable\ncapital are identical as well, i.e., that fixed capital does not exist. As Tsuru\nputs it in Dr. Sweezy's own book, Marx's reproduction scheme implies *. . . for\none thing, that no fixed capital exists; and, for another, that what is not\nconsumed is immediately invested; and thirdly, that capitalists in the first\nbranch [producer goods] do not invest in the second branch [consumer goods]\nand vice versa.\" Marx's attempt to solve the turnover problem (see, for in-\nstance, Capital, Vol. III, Chap. 4) was hardly satisfactory, but Sweezy did\nnot even try (pp. 67-68). The assumed absence of fixed capital in a capitalist\nSociety is rather queer; it may or may not be analytically harmless.

Far from being the w/timo ratio of this line of\nanalysis, the Marxian scheme still constitutes one of the few propositions con-\ncerning which there seems to exist a tolerable agreement among the majority\nof business cycle theorists.*\n\nOf course, Domar is entitled to his opinion, but economists should be\naware that in comparing the Marxian reproduction schemes to a stone ax he is\nexpressing a view which seems to be both original and private.\n\nPavr M.

I have in mind the famous\nMarxian schemes of capital reproduction.?\n", "Domar is simply wrong about the stocks and flows. No stocks enter into\nthe Marxian reproduction schemes; all the items are flows. Of course, it is\nsometimes assumed that stocks on hand at the beginning of a production\nperiod are exactly used up and replenished during the period, so that there\nis a numerical equivalence between stocks and flows. But such an assumption\nis in no way necessary and has nothing to do with the logic of the schemes.\nIt is true that each item in the schemes has a multiple meaning: variable\ncapital is at once capitalists' payrolls, workers incomes and a part of the\noutput of Department II (producing consumer goods); constant capital is\ncapitalists' outlay on materials and equipment, part of capitalists' gross re-\nceipts, and the total output of Department I (producing means of produc-\ntion). But in each case, we are dealing with flows; no logical monstrosities\nare involved.\n\nQuite apart from Domar's misunderstanding of the Marxian reproduction\nschemes, the above-quoted statement struck me as surprising, to say the\nleast. I thought that non-Marxian economists were pretty well agreed that,\nregardless of their opinion of the Marxian system as a whole, the reproduc-\ntion schemes at any rate are extremely useful theoretical instruments. Thus\nthe late Professor Schumpeter wrote of Marx's contributions that improved\nour theory of the structure of physical capital\" and added, \"The schemata\nwhich he devised in that field, though not irreproachable, have again proved\nserviceable in recent work that looks quite Marxian in places.\"?

Professor Evsey Domar makes\nthe following statement:\n\nAs an analytical tool, Varga still uses Marx's celebrated division of total out-\nput into categories I (producer goods) and II (consumer goods). This\ninstrument, in which variable capital (a stock) equals payrolls (a flow), and\nconstant capital (a stock) is supposed to represent both depreciation and gross\ninvestment (both flows), is a logical monstrosity, to put it mildly. At best it\ncan be applied to only the simplest problems, which can be solved just as well\nwithout it. Still, if. Varga, like other Marxists, insists on using this stone ax,\nit is his business . . . (p. 140).\n", "405\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"]}}, "content_type": "Comment", "authors": ["Paul M.

However, the coefficient of pene-\ntration is presented as the coefficient of the ability of firm j to penetrate the\nmarket of firm i (and vice versa since asymmetry is shunned), so it would\nseem more realistic to treat the coefficient of penetration in these circum-\nstances as finite (and small).\n\nWith respect to pure monopoly, this category *.. . may be defined as the\nmarket structure of an industry in which competition is totally absent. Firm\nj is a pure monopolist if the cross-elasticity of demand for its product . . .\nbecomes zero\" (p. 892, italics supplied). If competition is \"totally absent,\"\nthen there will be zo opportunity to match supply units with shifting demand\nunits. While we may write the coefficient of penetration equal to zero (as Pa-\npandreou does), it seems better to treat it as nonexistent. When we conceive a\none firm industry, the coefficient of insulation becomes the reciprocal of the\ncoefficient of penetration, and if the latter is zero, the former is, of course,\ninfinite. That is, the ability of the pure monopolist to resist penetration into\nhis market is infinitely great. This we must grant, but it is infinitely great be-\ncause \u00a3/ere is no one to possess the ability to penetrate. It is more congruous\nto the concept \"social science\" to view the coefficient of insulation as nonexist-\nent rather than infinity.\n\n2. Some supplementary material may round out the exposition. The cross-\nelasticity of demand can be stated in terms of the price-quantity relationships\nbetween two firms, or between a firm and the balance of the industry. Papan-\ndreou chooses the former for the five limiting cases, and this is given in\ncolumn 2 of Table I. The cross-elasticity of demand with reference to a firm\nand the balance of the industry is given in column 3. There is another measure\nnot mentioned in the paper (this is not stated in criticism), namely, the elas-\nticity of substitution which compares a relative change in the ratio of products\nheld to a relative change in the marginal rate of substitution, being infinite\nwhen the products in question are perfect substitutes, finite if substitution is\nimperfect, and zero if no substitution is feasible. This is shown in column 4.\nFinally, in columns 5 and 6 we have the new coefficients of penetration and\ninsulation; the only significant change that appears from the original is that\nthe coefficient of penetration for atomistic heteropoly is presented as finite\nrather than zero.\n\nIn Table I an attempt has been made to increase the significance of the\nterm \"finite\" by indicating the ordinal relationships. The exception is E,\nwhere no flat statement is possible, although we may hazard the guess that the\ncoefficient is more likely to be larger in the case of atomistic heteropoly as\ncompared to circular heteropoly.?\n\n* Columns 2 and 5 show the relationship between two firms; columns 3 and 6 show the\nrelationship between a firm and all the other firms of the industry. It would be possible\nto add two more columns: one to show the penetration relationship between a firm and\nall other firms of the industry, the other to show the insulation relationship when \u00f3ne\nfirm lowers its price. No matter how difficult it might be to discover the general expres-\n\nsion for these two additional columns, we could still give the answer of zero or finite or\ninfinite, which is all that is necessary for Table I.\n", "409\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "2": ["*R.

Introduction\n\nMany criteria have been developed for testing general fiscal policies\nas well as particular expenditure and tax programs.' One important\nanalytic question that always intrudes itself into such discussions is\nthe deflationary effect of a particular tax structure as compared with\nits alternatives. Many taxes have been reappraised in the light of the\nmodern theory of income determination, but there remain certain gaps\nin the analysis of consumption taxes.* At least partly, they result from\nthe failure to take fully into account the effects on consumer spending\nof the higher price level induced by the tax. This paper attempts to\nremedy these defects in the present analysis.\n\n'The accepted doctrine is that a given volume of revenue raised by\nconsumption taxes will reduce the level of aggregate real consumer\nexpenditures more than will an equal revenue raised through income\ntaxes.\n\nUnderlying this view are four simplifying propositions. (1) The con-\nsumption tax is fully shifted in higher prices to consumers, whereas\nthe burden of the income tax remains on the income recipient.

But this still left the point,\nwhich my testimony treated of fully, that both economic and social considera-\ntions during 1948 required the expansion of certain types of resource use,\nand therefore made the restriction of other types even more imperative, through\na rounded and comprehensive program. Professor Ellis might quite legitimately\nhave disagreed with the particular reapportionment of resource use in accord\nwith economic or social priority which I proposed in 1948, or argued that the\nmethods which I advocated to bring it about were impractical or undesirable.\nBut this would provide no justification for a criticism which distorted my mean-\ning when it was so easily ascertainable.\n\n4. Further, my testimony with respect to housing was fully understandable\nonly in the framework of my general discussion of the economic situation per-\ntaining in August 1948. My argument was that the inflationary situation was\ndangerous because it was creating relationships within the pattern of produc-\ntion, prices and incomes which could not be sustained and which conse-\nquently threatened a substantial downturn in employment and production.\nConcentrating upon this problem of relationships, I concluded that stabilization\nat high levels could not be accomplished solely or safely through the traditional\nmeasures for curtailing the money supply, restricting credit, lifting taxes, or\nseeking to reduce the general rate or pressure of fundamental economic activity.\nI pointed out that these measures needed to be complemented by more dis-\ncriminating efforts to promote more workable relationships. This in turn re-\nquired, for example, that some incomes be maintained or even advanced, while\nothers were reduced; that some production be increased, while other produc-\ntion was restrained; that some programs of overwhelming importance to\ndomestic welfare or international security be maintained or even expanded,\nwhile other programs competing for the same resources be correspondingly\ncontracted, etc. I also went to great lengths to distinguish between short-range\nand long-range needs, while stressing that some proposals were of such vital\nlong-range significance that they should not be delayed even though they com-\nplicated the immediate situation. (See particularly pages 311, 339, 348-\n350 of my testimony.) There may be many economists who would disagree in\nsome respects with my not entirely traditional analysis of the 1948 type of\ninflation and how to deal with it. But there are too many eminent economists\nwho do agree basically with my analysis (some past presidents of the As-\nsociation wrote approvingly of it) for a few words of it to be torn out of context\nand then the whole of my economics\" dismissed as *befuddlement or dissimu-\nlation.\" Name calling and nothing more is not enough.\n\n5. Professor Ellis' assimilation of the foregoing views to the idea that in-\ncreased taxation of corporate profits in August 1948 would have been inflation-\nary is indeed befuddlement. My testimony, in fact, argued for very Itig/ taxes in\n1948 on the ground that they would be entirely consistent with a high enough\nlevel of business investment and would serve as a damper upon inflation.\nSubsidies or tax preferences to speed up the production of a critically needed\ncommodity in short supply might be justified even in a generally inflationary\nsituation, and in fact were resorted to during the war, when accompanied by\n", "172\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "2": ["trast between what he calls the \"honesty\" of the Council's (or President's)\nreport and the \"dissimulation\" of my testimony. However, the specific hous-\ning policy recommendations in my testimony, namely, that the long-range\nhousing program should have been enacted promptly in 1948 despite the then\ncurrent inflation, was precisely the same housing policy which the :wAole Coun-\ncil and the President repeatedly embodied in reports during the same infla-\ntionary period. (See reports issued in January 1948, July 1948, and January\n1949.) Presumably, therefore, Professor Ellis objects not to the 5olicy conclu-\nsions which I reached in my testimony, but rather to the line of analysis and.\nreasoning which I used to support these conclusions. For if his basic disagree-\nment was with the policy advanced by the whole Council and the President,\nthen his singling out of me for invidious criticism could rest only on personal\nbias.\n\n3. Turning now to this issue, Professor Ellis' criticism of my line of analysis\nand reasoning is based upon twenty-odd words which he quotes utterly out of\nthe context of my testimony. I said in part the following:\n\nThe point has been made that the Taft-Ellender-Wagner housing bill is incon-\nsistent with an anti-inflation program because it would add to demand.\n\nThis point is not well founded. If there is a shortage of housing, and if this is\ncontributing to excessive housing costs in the same way that a shortage of food\nwould contribute to excessive food casts, then the production of more housing\nis anti-inflationary in the same sense that the production of more food would\nbe anti-inflationary. It may well be that, for a time, we cannot divert much more\nlabor aid materials to the total production of housing in view of other competing\nnational needs. But let us make sure that they are competing national needs, and\nnot competing mon-essentials. And even then, there would still remain the\nquestion of the composition of the housing that is being produced. It would\nstill be sound and desirable to produce relatively more low-rent housing for\nveterans and others of modest means, and relatively less high-priced housing\nfor families who can get along very nicely for a while with what they already\nhave. The Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill is designed basically for this purpose, al-\nthough this is not true of the \"title VI\" provisions contained in the bill. Thus,\nunder present circumstances, talk about damping down the demand for housing\nis undiscriminating and mistaken until one breaks the demand down into various\ntypes. Some types of housing should be expanded, other types should be con-\ntracted. (p. 348. Italics supplied.)\n\nCertainly, the foregoing quotation leaves no room for Professor Ellis' state-\nment that I did not recognize, or did not honestly reveal, that when resources\nwere being strained by inflation we could not allocate more of our resources\nto one purpose without subtracting more from another. I said just this, not\nonly generally, but also with specific reference to housing, as is indicated by the\nlast sentence of the quotation. I am prepared to admit that the foregoing\nquotation in its compact form, while sufficient to show how misleading was\nProfessor Ellis! selection of one sentence from it, did not embrace all of the\nqualifications which anyone could obtain from hearing or reading my testi-\nmony in its entirety.

Honesty of this sort is apt to be better\nlong-run policy than Keyserling's testimony, which can scarcely escape the\ncharge of either befuddlement or disssimulation, to the effect that the produc-\ntion of more housing is anti-inflationary in the same sense that the production\nof more food would be anti-inflationary.\" This casuistry is easily recognized as\nthe same argument as that by which the National Association of Manufacturers\nsought to prove that increased taxation of corporate profits would be inflationary:\ninvestment in plant would be reduced, production would be smaller, prices would\nbe higher. It is gratifying that the economics of Mr. Keyserling does not find its\nway into the 1949 Report. (Italics mine. Professor Ellis refers to my testimony\nof August 4, 1948 at pages 308-360 of the printed hearings of the Senate Com-\nmittee on Banking and Currency entitled *Control of Inflation,\" 80th Congress,\n2nd session.)1\n\nThere are several points about Professor Ellis! statement which call for com-\nment.\n\n1. Professor Ellis! appraisal uses the term \"report\" interchangeably to refer\nto the January 1949 Economic Report of the President and the January 1949\nAnnual Economic Review by the Council of Economic Advisers. Thus it is\nnot always clear as to which of the two documents he is talking about, although\nit is sometimes made clear by page references. In any event, I signed one\nof these documents along with my two colleagues on the Council and joined with\nthem in \"assisting and advising\" the President in the preparation of the other\nunder the terms of the Employment Act of 1946. Therefore, I cannot fairly be\ndisassociated from the report the honesty\" of which Professor Ellis so highly\napproves. I wholly subscribe to the passages which he picks out for special\ncommendation; and if they did not represent a job of *teamwork,\" I might even\nask Professor Ellis how he can know that I did not actually draft or initiate\n(as well as subscribe to) the parts which he most applauds. I submit that is a\n\"heads I win, tails you lose\" attitude for Professor Ellis to pick out portions\nof reports I signed or helped prepare which he likes and say that they are no\u00a3\nmy \"economics,\" but to pick out portions of testimony I have given which he\ndislikes and say that they are my \"economics.\" Further, conscientious study of\nmy testimony would reveal its basic accord with the reports which Professor\nEllis praises.\n\n2. Professor Ellis selects the subject of housing to support his alleged con-\n\n* A striking illustration of Professor Ellis' careless treatment of my views is that he\ndoes not even cite what testimony he is talking about (I also testified in February, 1949),\nand therefore the reader of his article could not refer to my testimony and judge whether\nit was correctly portrayed.\n", "170\n", "'THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"]}}, "content_type": "Reply", "authors": ["Leon H.
