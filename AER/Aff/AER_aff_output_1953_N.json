Fellner maintains, in both his Tables I and II, that upward\ncross-elasticities must be zero between any two firms in atomistic competition\n(pure or differentiated) ; and he holds, similarly, that positive upward cross-\nelasticities necessarily imply oligopolistic interdependence. It is my view that\ncross-elasticities (upward and downward) may be positive, and indeed very\nlarge, without implying oligopoly. Specifically, cross-elasticities will be high\nbetween any two members of a large-number group when the products of the\nrival firms are sufficiently near the homogeneity pole. Fellner's conclusion\n(usually without the upward-downward distinction) has been the instinctively\nplausible one to many people.* Hence it is all the more important to emphasize\nthe grounds for my different view. I do so by means of a numerical example.\n\nImagine 1,000,001 suppliers of physically comparable but very, very slightly\ndifferentiated products. Assume that the firms are all charging equal prices and\nselling equal quantities. Assume, furthermore, that if the ith firm's price is\nraised very slightly (with all other prices constant), all but a negligible frac-\ntion of the business lost by that firm is transferred, in equal amounts, to the\n1,000,000 other firms in the group. This means that the change in g; will be\n(approximately) 1,000,000 times the opposite change in any other group\nmember's g;\u2014in both absolute and percentage terms. For example, if 5; is\nincreased so that g; declines by 1 per cent, each q; will increase by (approxi-\nmately) .000,001 per cent. This is the negligible impact of one atomistically\ncompetitive firm on its fellows. I propose to show that it does not necessarily\nimply a \"zero\" or negligibly \"small\" cross-elasticity.\n\nSuppose, now, that the ith firm's own elasticity E;; (up or down) is\n\u20141,000,000,000. To reduce g; by 1 per cent, 5; need be raised by only\nabout .000,000,001 per cent. Hence the cross-elasticity Ej; is approximately\n1,000, since the .000,001 per cent increase of g; is 1,000 times the initiating\npercentage increase of 5;.\n\nNow I beg the reader who sits in judgment to contemplate: (1) this very\nlarge number of firms; (2) this enormous own elasticity, implying a remark-\nably close approach to product homogeneity; and (3) this very high cross-\nelasticity! Is this situation oligopolistic or not?

But, since his definition\nof isolation is completely different from Triffin's, I cannot agree that my criticism of the\n\"use of price cross-elasticity as a test for oligopoly is equally applicable to Triffin's use of\nit as a criterion for isolation. . . .\" My criticism would be so applicable only with respect to\n\"isolation\" as Chamberlin defines it.\n\n? According to Chamberlin, *the now prevalent terminology\" implies that any non-\noligopolistic seller *would be a 'pure' monopolist\"\u2014 since such a seller is isolated as truly\nas the traditional monopolist\" (p. 912). It seems peculiar, to say the least, for Chamber-\nlin to attribute this view to his opponents\u2014since it is he who would blur the distinction\n(which the rest of us seek to maintain) between the traditional monopolist and the\nnonoligopolistic species of monopolistic competitor.\n\n? Chamberlin's discussion is on pp. 914-15; my own is of. cit., pp. 790-92.\n\n?'The *own\" concept is a \"diagonal\" term, and the \"cross\" concept is an *off-diagonal\"\nterm, in the matrix of either the derivatives or the elasticities, respectively.\n\nNor is there any notable significance in the otherwise perfectly correct fact that a\nchange of f, represents a movement along a demand of the abbreviated form, q; \u2014 f(5i),\nwhile a change of 5, may shift that same q; \u2014 f(5:).

The one such contrast in his Table I, I have\nargued above, is the result of faulty logic.

Although at one point Chamberlin might now seem to be minimizing his former \"faith\nin cross-elasticity\" (p. 910), there is no question that he did use that concept to distin-\nguish (in his own terminology) \"isolated selling\" and *nonisolated selling.\"\n\n?** [ assume from the context of the Talloires paper that this refers only to Price cross-\nelasticities.\n\nP'Trif\u00fcn, Monofpolistic Competition and General Equilibrium Theory (Cambridge,\nMass., 1940), pp. 104-5 and 134.\n", "elasticities are exactly equal; and the arc elasticities based on sufficiently small\nprice changes are approximately equal.!?\n\nNaturally I am gratified that Professor Chamberlin now agrees with me\nthat the cross-elasticities Ej; and E; are not, by themselves, a reliable indica-\ntion of the presence or absence of oligopoly. It was because he had proposed\nthese cross-elasticities as his test for oligopoly that I characterized his classi-\nfication as *unsuccessful.\"!* I regret, however, that I have left him with only\na negative conviction of the complexity\" and \"treachery\" of cross-elasticities\n*as a measure of anything\" (p. 911); for\u2014when products are differentiated,\nhowever slightly\u2014the ratios of cross-elasticities and own elasticities do seem\nto provide the oligopoly test for which he has been unsuccessfully searching.\nAs for my having adopted E;; as my own preferred criterion of product homo-\ngeneity-heterogeneity, I am happy to acknowledge that I did indeed follow\nChamberlin in this.\n\nIn his Talloires paper, as Chamberlin now says, he criticized \"Robert\nTriffin's classification of the problems of monopoly and competition in terms\nof cross-elasticities alone\" (p. 910).!4^* He also feels that I exaggerated the\ncontrast between Triffin's views and his own; and, by way of illustrating\nthis, he says that I \"ignore altogether Triffin's very substantial use of price\ncross-elasticity . . . in testing for oligopoly\" (p. 912). It is my view, on the\ncontrary, that Triffin relied principally on the quantity cross-elasticity e;; in\ntesting for oligopoly. His only use of the price cross-elasticity Ei; for that\npurpose, it seems to me, was in conjunction with e;;\u2014in his \"circular test.\"!*\nHence I also feel that Chamberlin's critique of Triffin's schema\u2014by concen-\ntrating solely on Ei;, to the neglect of e;j;\u2014was seriously incomplete. I say\nthis only to emphasize that Chamberlin's objections to the contrasts that I\nfound between Triffin's discussion and his own do indeed reflect fundamental\ndifferences between us in our understandings of Tri\u00edfin.\n\nSeveral matters discussed by Chamberlin seem to be mainly if not entirely\nverbal. He wishes **to bring into a single category the two concepts of an 'iso-\nlated monopolist? and of a single seller in the \"large-numbers-differentiated-\nproduct' case\"\u2014 because *'these two concepts come to the same thing\"\n(p. 911).

That would\nincrease each of the q;'s of the 1,000,000 other firms in the group by about\n.000,1 per cent; so the cross-elasticities would still be on the order of 1,000.\nHence, to reduce the cross-elasticities even to 1, Fellner would have to specify\na price increase about 1,000 times larger than necessary to remove the price-\nraiser from the market; and to reduce the cross-elasticities to .001, he would\nhave to specify a price increase about 1,000,000 times larger than necessary.\n\nAlthough Fellner does not indicate just how arbitrary his *ad Aoc selected\nfinite price changes\" are, they are \"ad Aoc selected\" simply to make the\nupward cross-elasticities sufficiently small for his own taste\u2014when he wants\nthem to reveal atomistic competition.

Such a distinction would be needed only if the firm were\nto operate at a point where there is a *kink\" or discontinuity of slope in its\ndemand curve.?! Such a \"kink\" in a consistently other-prices-constant demand\ncurve results, for example, when some buyers regard the products of two or\nmore firms as homogeneous, while others regard them as differentiated?\nBecause this phenomenon implies that the demand slope is first negative and\nthen changes abruptly to zero at a critical point, no firm will actually operate\nat that point. Rather, some firms will compete for the homogeneous-product\nbusiness, and thus be somewhere on their demands' horizontal stretches,\nwhile others may be content to exploit their demands! downward-sloping por-\ntions.

Fellner, on the other hand, implies a denial that the latter\nlimiting process is a continuous one. Defending a position taken earlier by Chamberlin,\nhe maintains that \"while cross-elasticity may be infinite in the undifferentiated large group,\nit falls to zero with the least differentiation\" (p. 902, n. 4). It falls to zero, say Fellner,\nbecause \"in the event of the least differentiation the sales-increment of the price-reducing\nfirm can be made smaller than azy finite magnitude provided that the price reduction\nbecomes small enough.\" This remarkable argument implies that every finite derivative and\nelasticity is zero. My opening numerical example provides my own positive demonstration\nof nonzero and high cross-elasticities in the \"large group . . . with the least differentiation.\"\n\n?*In the second paragraph of n. 4, p. 902, Fellner implies agreement with this view; but\nhe fails to recognize that it undermines his central thesis as to the uniquely zero upward\ncross-elasticity in pure competition.\n\nAlthough Chamberlin now seems to be with me for the most part on these questions,\nour agreement is still not complete. His limiting process (1) on p. 915 implies that there\nis a limiting value of the expression given there when \"the number of sellers and *own'\nelasticities\" are \"infinite.\" This is the same meaningless concept for which I am criticizing\nFellner.\n", "A fundamental logical trouble that has a\u00edflicted cross-elasticity pronounce-\nments from the very beginning is that two kinds of limit are involved: (1) if\nown elasticities are constant and finite (because the product is not strictly\nhomogeneous), a steady increase in the number of firms in the group does\nimply a steady decrease of cross-elasticities toward zero as a limit (never\nactually reached) ; and (2) if the number of firms is constant, an approach to\nproduct homogeneity implies a steady increase in cross-elasticities toward\ninfinity as a limit. Fellner's mistake, as I see it, is in supposing that the\nnumber-of-firms limit (which cannot be reached) must be dominant over the\nproduct-homogeneity limit (which can). If bot of these limiting processes are\noperating simultaneously, no one can say iz general how the cross-elasticities\nwill behave. But cross-elasticities may assuredly be either high or low no\nmatter how many firms there are in the group. It all depends on the number\nof firms relative to the degree of product homogeneity (as reflected specifically\nin the own elasticities).\n\nIn the context of Table II, Fellner relaxes his requirement that there must\nbe an \"infinite number\" of firms for atomistic competition; but now he insists\nthat cross-elasticities must be based on *'ad /oc selected finite price changes.\"\nHe also specifies the treatment of *subjectively unnoticed ('negligible') quan-\ntities as zeros.\" When products are homogeneous (absolutely or practically)\nand firms are many as in my opening example, a negligible increase of 5i\nhas a negligible effect on g;. Hence the upward cross-elasticity would be\n\"negligible\" over \"negligible,\" which at least suggests\u2014if it means anything at\nall\u2014the indeterminate form of zero over zero. More fundamentally, as long as\nFellner refuses to measure \"neglibles,\" he has no grounds for asserting any-\nthing whatever about their ratios to one another.\n\nFellner would say, however, that his upward \"incremental\" (or arc) cross-\nelasticities are uniquely zero in my numerical example. Clearly, this is not\njust a matter of \"point\" versus \"arc\" elasticities; for my own example was\nstated in terms of a finite price increase, and the \"incremental\" cross-elasti-\ncities turned out to be very high. Fellner gets his result of a *zero\" cross-\n", "920\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "4": ["There is a world of difference between such microscopic, passive reactions\nand oligopolistic interdependence. The typical oligopolistic reaction to a price\ncut is not just passive, but retaliatory. That is, it is designed to discourage such\nprice cutting in the first place, even at the immediate cost of the retaliator's\nhurting himself even as he seeks to discipline the aggressor. Oligopolistic col-\nlusion, explicit or tacit, accordingly implies a reluctance to make certain\naggressive moves solely because of an expected or feared reaction from one or\nmore rivals. Hence an oligopolistic *equilibrium\" typically implies that the\nfirms are at positions significantly different from those that would be implied\nif the firms were to make their business decisions on an assumption of negligible\nreactions from rivals.\n\nThe likelihood that collusion will be attempted\u2014and if attempted, success-\nful\u2014depends not only on the mere perceptibility of the effects of one firm's\nactions on another, but on the magnitude of those effects and the character\nand magnitude of the reactions. Least of all can the likelihood of oligopolistic\nbehavior be prejudged simply on grounds that the analyst chooses to use\npoint elasticities (or arc elasticities that are based on very small finite price\nchanges). I confess I am somewhat surprised to have to rebut a view that the\nprinciples of Competition Among the Few are now automatically applicable\nto \"competition among the few million\" simply because the author used point\nelasticities.\n\nI also have misgivings about Fellner's use of the concept of an \"infinite\nnumber\" of firms. Some limits can be reached (e.g., an absolutely homogene-\nous product). Others cannot (e.g., an \"infinite number\" of firms). \"Infinity,\"\nin this context, is not a number\" but simply an implication that there is no\nfinite limit. In Fellner's Table I, point cross-elasticities (upward and down-\nward) are infinite when identical products are supplied by any finite number\nof firms. But he also believes that, with an \"infinite number\" of firms, the\nupward cross-elasticities will be uniquely zero. Now if this is to mean anything\nat all, it must mean that the upward cross-elasticities apfroach zero as the\nnumber of firms grows indefinitely large. But this they do not do, on the\ntestimony of Fellner's own Table I. With strictly- homogeneous products, the\nleap from infinite to zero cross-elasticity takes place only in a never-never\nland of *infinite numbers\" of firms. Hence it is not consistent with the basic\nprinciples of taking a limit.\"\n\nProvided that there is a very large number of producers of a homogeneous product, I\nalso think that either the Cournot model or the Bertrand model is quite acceptable (again\ncf. Fellner's n. 12). These two models then give approximately the same results, They give\nsignificantly different results, and are both unacceptable, only when the number of firms is\nsmall. In other words, neither Cournot nor Bertrand had a satisfactory theory of oligopoly;\nbut they both did have satisfactory theories of competition.\n\n\"In the foregoing paragraph I have willingly repressed my own misgivings about the\ndeterminacy of cross-elasticities when there are three or more suppliers of absolutely\nhomogeneous products (of. cit., pp. 793-94). I am willing to follow the convention that\nFellner seems to accept\u2014namely, that any change in q, will affect oppositely, to at least\nsome extent, every other q; in the group. Then the cross-elasticities within the homo-\ngeneous-product group are all infinite no matter what the number of firms\u2014just as the\ncross-elasticities approach infinity when product homogeneity is merely approached, for\nany given number of firms.\n", "919\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["* Alternatively, when groups are not well-defined, symmetrical, and isolated, I use the\nconcept of a \"numbers equivalent\"\u2014as a substitute for dubiously meaningful, actual\nnumbers, Then \u2014E,;,/E;j, \u2014 n, \u2014 1 implies that the effect of a change of 5; on q, is as if\nthe two firms were members of an ideally symmetrical, isolated group of \u00bb firms.\n\nFellner thinks that my choice of *numbers equivalent\" as a name for this concept *may\nnot be fortunate\" (p. 909). My reason for that choice is that the analogy to the number\nof firms in a well-defined, symmetrical group is intuitively meaningful. On the other hand,\nbecause a *numbers equivalent\" is applicable *even when there is no distinct grouping of\nfirms\" (^Elasticities, Cross-Elasticities, and Market Relationships,\" Am. Econ. Rev., Dec.\n1952, XLII, 789 and 798-99), the concept is in no way dependent on the \"industry concept\"\n(cf. Chamberlin, pp. 913-14).\n\n* Naturally, the demand relevant for a firm's price-output decision is not, in general, a\nceteris paribus demand; but it is an essential condition of atomistic competition (pure or\ndifferentiated) that the other-prices-constant demand be a very close approximation of the\nrelevant demand. For example, if all the members of a purely competitive group have fixed\nsupplies, the relevant demand facing the ;th firm has an elasticity equal to z times the\nindustry-demand elasticity, where z; is the ratio of industry quantity to the ith firm's\nquantity (cf. op. cit., p. 795, esp. n. 26). With variable supplies (upward-sloping marginal\nCosts), the relevant elasticity is even higher; for a given increase of q., lowering price very\nslightly, will then reduce all the q;'s microscopically, and so cause price to fall even less\nthan in the case of fixed supplies (05. cit., p. 797, n. 28).\n\nAlthough \"negligible\" and \"imperceptible\" are often used loosely as synonyms, I feel\nthat it is neither necessary nor desirable to make atomistic behavior depend on the myopia\nor the \"limited sensitivity\" of the firms, as Fellner would have it (p. 904, esp. n. 12). In\nmy view, the mere \"awareness\" of very small effects is not likely to give rise to oligopolistic\nbehavior; and it is this presumption as to behavior, it seems to me, that is the proper focus\nof market classification.\n", "smallest effect on itself of another firm's action, its reaction will necessarily be\nSuch as to establish oligopolistic interdependence).\n\nOligopolistic and atomistic beAavior are distinguished according to the\npresence or absence of effective collusion. We merely try to predict the\noutcome of that \"behavior\" test by means of such \"structure\" tests as the\nnumber of firms.* If \"numbers\" are sufficiently large, we infer (empirically)\nthat any relevant change of business decision by firm ; will have, at most, a\n\"negligible\" impact on j; and we then conclude (empirically) that j's reaction,\nif any, will also be negligible.\" It is not necessary that either the initial effect\nor the reaction be literally *imperceptible,\" but only that the interfirm re-\npercussions be negligible even if perceived.\n\nFor example, a purely competitive firm will typically affect price ever so\nslightly if it changes its output substantially; but the situation will still be\npurely competitive, for all practical purposes, if the demand schedule relevant\nfor the firm's output decision differs only negligibly from the strictly hori-\nzontal. This does not require that the change of that firm's output will have\nliterally no effect on the outputs of the other firms, but only that the reactions\nof those other firms must not be such as to destroy the approximate hori-\nzontality of the relevant demand facing the one firm.* The main point is this:\nif the negligible impact of any one firm on its fellows gives rise to only micro-\nScopic, \"passive\" reactions, there can be no significant degree of oligopolistic\ninterdependence. The equilibrium position of each firm will then differ only\nnegligibly from what it would be if the effects of one firm on another were\nregarded as wholly imperceptible.*\n", "918\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "2": ["?Naturally, cross-elasticities are not zecessarily high in atomistic competition.

But I cannot accept Fellner's contention (pp. 905-06) that\nthe \"valid content\" of my article is limited to a context of \"finite price changes.\"\n", "elasticities necessarily imply oligopoly.

Fellner does not\nobject to either of these practices separately; but he regards their combination\nas somehow invalid.\n\nAs to my use of \"point\" rather than \"arc\" concepts, this was also the prac-\ntice of all my predecessors, including Fellner; for we all used partial derivatives\nin our elasticity and cross-elasticity notation. Point elasticities are convenient\nbecause of their lack of ambiguity. Specifically, they characterize a firm's\nsituation with respect to even the smallest conceivable price-quantity change;\nand they also reflect, approximately, the implications of small, finite changes.?\nThe underlying conception of smoothly continuous demand functions is, of\ncourse, an \"idealization\"\u2014but again one that is familiar, convenient, and often\n(though not always) a defensible approximation of discrete reality. My basic\ndisagreement with Fellner concerns his view that there is some tying clause\nin the theorist's contract that necessarily links this idealization with another\nquite different one\u2014namely, an insistence that atomistic competition cannot\nexist with anything short of an \"infinite number\" of firms.\n\nIn the context of Table I, Fellner uses point cross-elasticities but refuses to\nclassify a situation as atomistically competitive unless there is an \"infinite\nnumber\" of rival firms. He would thus classify my numerical example, above,\nas an instance of \"differentiated oligopoly.\" As long as Fellner remains within\nthe context of his Table I, a million suppliers of perfect or near-perfect substi-\ntute products are just a million oligopolists. I regard such situations as consti-\ntuting either pure or near-pure competition.\n\nTo Fellner, the mere use of point elasticities and cross-elasticities by the\nanalyst implies an assumption of \"infinite sensitivity\" on the part of the firms,\nwhich in turn would imply (in his view) that any finite-number group is neces-\nsarily oligopolistic. Several methodological questions of some subtlety are in-\nvolved here; but the main point, it seems to me, is that Fellner here confuses\nthe mere use of a convenient analytical tool (point elasticities) with an un-\njustifiably stringent empirical assumption.

Fellner maintains, in both his Tables I and II, that upward\ncross-elasticities must be zero between any two firms in atomistic competition\n(pure or differentiated) ; and he holds, similarly, that positive upward cross-\nelasticities necessarily imply oligopolistic interdependence. It is my view that\ncross-elasticities (upward and downward) may be positive, and indeed very\nlarge, without implying oligopoly. Specifically, cross-elasticities will be high\nbetween any two members of a large-number group when the products of the\nrival firms are sufficiently near the homogeneity pole. Fellner's conclusion\n(usually without the upward-downward distinction) has been the instinctively\nplausible one to many people.* Hence it is all the more important to emphasize\nthe grounds for my different view. I do so by means of a numerical example.\n\nImagine 1,000,001 suppliers of physically comparable but very, very slightly\ndifferentiated products. Assume that the firms are all charging equal prices and\nselling equal quantities. Assume, furthermore, that if the ith firm's price is\nraised very slightly (with all other prices constant), all but a negligible frac-\ntion of the business lost by that firm is transferred, in equal amounts, to the\n1,000,000 other firms in the group. This means that the change in g; will be\n(approximately) 1,000,000 times the opposite change in any other group\nmember's g;\u2014in both absolute and percentage terms. For example, if 5; is\nincreased so that g; declines by 1 per cent, each q; will increase by (approxi-\nmately) .000,001 per cent. This is the negligible impact of one atomistically\ncompetitive firm on its fellows. I propose to show that it does not necessarily\nimply a \"zero\" or negligibly \"small\" cross-elasticity.\n\nSuppose, now, that the ith firm's own elasticity E;; (up or down) is\n\u20141,000,000,000. To reduce g; by 1 per cent, 5; need be raised by only\nabout .000,000,001 per cent.

(2) Given this behavior for receipts, any change in the life of the asset,\neither by rotating the receipts curve around its intercept with the vertical axis\nor by shifting that curve, will not materially influence the form of the deprecia-\ntion curve. (3) If the rate of discount is low, the depreciation curve will fall\ncontinuously at an increasing rate, as shown in Figure 1. However, if the rate\nis high, the depreciation curve will first rise and then fall, with all but the last\nfew years close to the value for straight-line allocation.

The\nstraight-line depreciation is $2.13, and the economic life depreciation rises and\nfalls in the interval between $2.00 and $2.50 during the first nineteen years\nand then falls to zero.\n\nIn conclusion, if economic life is a valid measure of depreciation and if the\nassumptions of the third case are, in fact, a reasonable basis for predicting the\nbehavior of an asset's receipts, then straight-line allocation is superior to pro-\nductive capacity as a measure of depreciation. However, if the fall in an asset's\nreceipts parallels the fall in its productive capacity, the superiority of straight-\nline allocation does not hold as the values of the parameters become relatively\nlarge.\n\nFinally, there has been considerable dissatisfaction on the part of many\nbusinessmen, economists, and accountants with the two principal accounting\nconventions\u2014historical cost and straight-line allocation.

It can be seen that economic\nlife depreciation first rises and then falls, but for the most part it remains\nclose to straight-line allocation. As before, the agreement between these two\nmeasures of depreciation varies inversely with the life of the asset and with\nits rate of discount, but here it also varies inversely with another parameter\u2014\nthe shape of the receipts curve. As this curve approaches a straight line the\nagreement between economic life depreciation and straight-line allocation in-\ncreases. Conversely, as these three parameters are increased, the difference\nbetween productive capacity and economic life depreciation is reduced. How-\never, here the parameters must have considerably larger and less realistic\nvalues than in the first case for productive capacity to be superior to straight-\nline allocation.\n\nThe assumption of the two previous cases that expected receipts vary with\nproductive capacity is in all probability not realistic. It is much more likely\nthat the productive capacity of an asset expires little, if at all, over the period\nin which its receipts fall to zero.

In Table I straight-\nline depreciation is a closer approximation of economic life than productive\ncapacity. However, economic life moves between straight-line depreciation and\nproductive capacity with the variation in the asset's life and in its rate of dis-\ncount. Hence, as either or both of these parameters are increased, economic\nlife moves closer to productive capacity.\n\nIt may be noted that some accounting texts, when discussing alternative\nmathematical rules for the allocation of cost, mention an annuity method,\nwhich in reality is our economic life method. However, in illustrating the\nmethod they assume, as with an annuity, that receipts are constant over time,\nand the inevitable consequence is a depreciation charge which increases over\ntime.

The latter is widely\nused solely because it is simple and objective; the accounting profession ra-\ntionalizes the practice with the view that depreciation is *. . . a process of\nallocation, not of valuation.\" Similarly, there is no a ?riori reason why the\nmaintenance of productive capacity should result in the correct determination\nof income. Therefore, comparison of the two methods requires the establish-\nment of a standard of comparison, a third method that is theoretically valid.\n\nSuch a criterion is to be found in neoclassical theory, where an asset's in-\ncome is defined as the periodic payment in perpetuity that has a present value\nequal to the present value of the asset's expected future receipts.\" Since\ndepreciation is simply the difference between receipts and income, it follows\nthat a definition of depreciation is implicit in the above. This definition can be\nstated directly as the present value of the future receipts at the start of the\nperiod less the present value of the future receipts at the end of the period with\nthe period's actual receipts excluded from the latter quantity. Or, restated in\nthe language of accountancy, the cost (of depreciable assets) incurred in\nrealizing a period's revenue is the expiration in present value of the assets\nexpected future receipts. If this measure of depreciation, termed here the\n*economic life method,\" is accepted as valid, straight-line allocation and\nexpiration of productive capacity may be compared for accuracy by determin-\ning how closely each approximates economic life depreciation. Such a com-\nparison is made below through three illustrative cases, each of which assumes\na different path for an asset's receipts over its life.\n\nBefore going into these cases, two points should be noted: (1) The cost\nbasis of valuation is a fundamental postulate of accounting, and this postulate\nwill not be violated. Specifically, although the expected receipts at time of\npurchase will be used to determine that portion of an asset's cost to be charged\nas depreciation in each year of its life changes in expected receipts over the\nasset's life will not modify its cost or the depreciation charge.

Else-\nwhere I have suggested what might result from following such a procedure.*\n\nOne question remains: would the prices and outputs set by reasoning from\nprinciples that businessmen employ coincide with those that would result\nfrom an application of conventional theory?

Unfortunately this is not all that marginal\nanalysis implies, for the theory suggests also a technique for maximizing\nprofits. It would be foolhardy to deny that businessmen desire maximum\nprofits. My argument is that the techniques they employ do not work towards\nthis goal even when their actual cost curve is U-shaped. Given a U-shaped\ncost curve and a relatively elastic average revenue curve, the most profitable\npoint of operation is admittedly that scale of operations where marginal costs\nequals marginal revenue. However, in the world of reality, businessmen are\nnot given \"cost and revenue curves,\" and if they believe that their least\ncost point is at capacity when it is not, then the equilibrium point towards\nwhich they bend their productive efforts is capacity and not the point of\nequilibrium of conventional theory.\n\n'Thirdly, one critic admits that businessmen are not guided by considera-\ntions of marginal revenue and costs but he contends that the theory, when\nproperly understood, explains business behavior nevertheless. In those cases\nin which the \"guiding principles\" of businessmen happen to lead to the same\nresult as conventional theory suggests, the explanation offered by conventional\ntheory does not conflict with facts. However, in those cases in which the\n\"guiding principles\" of businessmen lead to a different result than conven-\ntional theory, the theory does not jibe with reality nor explain managerial\nbehavior.\n\nFurthermore, it must be remembered that theory is used to predict be-\nhavior as well as to explain it. For example, the question of the probable\neffect of a state income tax was raised recently in Michigan. The corporations\nsaid, \"We will pass the tax on to the consumer in the form of higher prices\";\na well-known economist said, *an income tax cannot be shifted.\"* Without\nentering into the merits of his argument, it will be recalled that the pro-\nposition that an income tax cannot be shifted rests upon an assumption that\nthe sales price set by a manufacturer for his product is on the demand curve\n(it is the maximum price that could be charged for that quantity of the\nproduct). In theory no businessman would sell for less; in practice they do.\nIt is dangerous to attempt to predict what businessmen will do by reasoning\nfrom theories that are based upon what businessmen do not do.*\n\nIn conclusion, the objective of an economist is not to draw pretty pictures\n\n?A person wlio \"does not understand\" is obviously anyone who happens to comment\non the discrepancy between theory and the facts of life.\n\n*'fhe president of one of America's largest corporations is convinced that his firm has\nalways shifted the income tax to its customers.\n\n* Marginalists seem to obtain a great deal of comfort from the fact that businessmen\noccasionally engage in marginal type thinking. For example, a firm manufacturing 9,500,000\nproducts might weigh the cost of sufficient advertising to sell another 500,000 products\nagainst the profit to be obtained from the additional sales, before deciding upon the ad-\nvertising expenditure.

For private institutions, the \"subsidies\" per year\namount to about $120 and for public institutions about $260, or an average of\nalmost $200. These sums are large in relation to educational costs (one-third\nof educational costs for private institutions, two-thirds for public), but much\nless relative to the $1,000 to $2,000 total cost in private IHL and a minimum of\n$1,000 for in-students at state IHL, plus in each instance the income foregone.\nCosts for nonresidents are less.!

Most of\nthese take note of the very low ratio of capital accounts to assets or deposit\nliabilities.? In the samples which have come to my attention this is universally\nregarded as an unfavorable development from the standpoint of the longer-\nterm interests of the bankers, their customers and patrons. The authors point\nwith alarm to the fact that inadequate bank capital creates a condition inimi-\ncal to the maintenance of depositor confidence, to the ability of the banks to\nabsorb losses and still maintain their solvency\u2014and lastly, that inadequate\nbank capital curtails the ability of the banks to supply their business customers\nwith needed credit.\n\nIt is with this last \"function\" of bank capital that issue is here taken.\nJudged by the many variants of statements concerning the relationships of\nbank capital to the lending ability of the banks, the belief is apparently widely\nheld that the capital accounts constitute a source of loan-funds; that com-\nmercial banks loan out the savings of the banks' owners.\n\nSuch statements are common and are to be expected in the trade journals,\nbut when they appear in the more scholarly publications, or are authored by\nprofessional economists, they should not be allowed to go unchallenged. Four\nsuch statements have been selected for examination here.?\n\nIntroduction to Economics (New York, McGraw-Hill, 1930), Ch. 1x.

The terms capital and capital accounts are used synonymously. As so used they include\nthe aggregate of capital stock, surplus, undivided profits and all net worth reserves.\n\n? Bank capital as a percentage of total liabilities has declined, with minor reversals of the\ntrend, for the past seventy-five years; from a percentage of approximately 35 in 1875 to\nabout 7 as of the present time. The series is characterized by a number of sharp declines\nin the capital ratios with connected plateaus of relative stability. In the 1880's, for example\nthe level was about 30 per cent as compared with about 20 per cent during the 1900-1910\nperiod, and about 12 per cent in the 1920's. In the course of World War II, the ratio fell\ndecisively below the 10 per cent level, traditionally regarded as a minimum for safety.\nSince the end of the war the capital ratios have tended upward, largely due to an expan-\nsion of bank capital accounts. This in turn is almost entirely attributable to retention of\nearnings.\n\n* The Increased Dependence of Business on the Commercial Banks, Bull.

Davidson, in an article\non \"Valutaproblemets teoretiska inneb\u00f3rd\" (Theoretical Implications of Problems Relating\nto the Value of Money), Ekon. Tids., 1920, xxii, 83 ff. It referred to the progressive acquisi-\ntion of wealth by the debtor class or enterpreneurs from creditors and rentiers that occurs\nin an inflationary period as a result of the decline in purchasing power of money.

Because\nthese preconditions were not even approximately realized during his lifetime,\nWicksell found it necessary to agitate for political reforms to make them pos-\nsible, and to support progressive income and property taxes. Although the\nlatter were not a perfect answer to his quest for justice in taxation, they tended\nat least to remove the worst injustices perpetrated under the tax systems of\nhis day. Those systems relied almost exclusively on indirect taxes enacted by\nparliamentarian majorities representing mainly the propertied classes because,\nuntil the close of World War I, the franchise was generally denied to the prop-\nertyless.\n\nWicksell's advocacy of the *confiscation principle\" of taxation to obtain the\ndesired revision of the distribution of wealth, was mainly intended (a) to elimi-\nnate all forms of rent from the category of private income and (b) to make\nrestitution for and prevent the recurrence of the \"capitalistic bolshevism\"^\nthat affects the distribution of wealth when the value of money is undergoing\nsubstantial change, especially during periods of inflation.\n\nTo the extent possible, Wicksell wanted to eliminate rent from private in-\ncome by taxation, because income of this type can presumably be taken from\nindividuals by the state without impairing their production incentives and\nwithout reducing the output of goods and services. Then the state in turn\nought to use the corresponding revenues for a secondary distribution of social\nreal income to all citizens in the form of an increasing variety and quantity\nof useful public or social services, especially in the fields of education and\npublic health, for expansion of these services would provide greater equality\nof opportunity for all citizens, and they would also contribute both directly and\nindirectly to an increase in general productivity.\n\nIn order to reinforce the foregoing long-run aim by appropriate short-run\naction, Wicksell held that the pervasive changes in the distribution of wealth\nwhich are a byproduct of significant changes in the value of money should, so\nfar as possible, be prevented.

If output, measured in revenue ton miles, changes, one would\nexpect an alert management to be able to change its costs in the same direc-\ntion, although, of course, not necessarily proportionately. Thus if traffic de-\nclines, management, at least within the limits imposed by the indivisibility of\nthe productive unit, the aircraft, should succeed in making some cost reduc-\ntions; and likewise, above the minimum size, one would expect management to\nhave to increase its costs somewhat when traffic rises. On heavily travelled\nroutes the qualification of indivisibility may become unimportant.\n\nA leading trade paper, American Aviation, publishes monthly data on air\nline traffic and expenses, taken from reports of the carriers filed currently with\nthe Civil Aeronautics Board. During the period of relative price stability be-\ntween January 1947 and the outbreak of the Korean War, carriers! cost figures\ncan be used without the clear-cut necessity of a deflator, so that simple corre-\nlations of total operating expenses, in unadjusted dollars, and total revenue\nton miles can be made for individual carriers. As just indicated, one would\nexpect the well-managed carrier to show a positive relation between changes\nin revenue traffic and changes in total cost. For the period for which I have\nscrutinized the data, January 1947 to May 1950, twenty-nine observations or\ntwenty-eight intermonthly periods, tightly managed and profitable Eastern\nhad such a positive relation 20 times, and negative only 8. United had 17\npositive relations and 11 negative. TWA, least profitable of the large carriers,\nhad a positive only 13 times, and negative 15 times. Thus it was more often\nthan not the experience for TWA, at least during those 29 months, to spend\nmore when traffic declined and to cut expenditures when traffic rose. I think it\ncan be said that differences of this magnitude in managements' responses to\nchanged conditions may well be sufficient to account for the differences in\nprofitability, at least as between the particular carriers mentioned. That dif-\nference in profitability had been substantial.\n\nKoontz then suggests that load factor is the most important factor in finan-\ncial self-sufficiency, and that high load factors may be obtained by serving\nmajor markets.'* This may be another way of saying the aircraft in conven-\ntional use are too large for the market they serve at the existing price level.\nBut let us examine a moment the first proposition: that high load factors mean\nprofitability. Koontz' Table V, showing, for 1949 and 1950 for each trunk\ncarrier, actual load factor and net operating income adjusted by his method,\nthat is, by charging passenger fares to the mail load, is the basis for his asser-\ntion that improved load factors are the solution. He points out that most lines\ncould have operated profitably, even after mail pay adjustment, if they had\nhad the load factor of American, United, or TWA, about 58 per cent in 1949\nand a few points higher in 1950. But he ignores his figures which indicate that\nEastern operated profitably on a 46 per cent load factor in 1949; and 53 per\ncent in 1950. For 1949, the lines with higher load factors than Eastern's, but\nnevertheless with losses after mail pay adjustment, represent nine of the twelve\nother trunk carriers, though in 1950 only two were clearly inconsistent with\nhis position. Thus, while load factors must be an important factor in profit-\n\n\" Review, pp. 117-22; Journal, pp. 144-45.\n", "371\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["been in the black; in 1950 half the lines would have been in the black. Koontz,\nhowever, regards 1949 as more normal than 1950,* even though most economic\ntime series show a dip for the earlier year. It is this evidence of poor financial\nperformance\u2014that is, what would have been poor financial performance if\npassenger fares had been paid for the carriage of mail\u2014that leads Koontz to\nsearch out its causes (other than his own assumptions) and make his policy\nrecommendations.\n\nThere follows a section in which Koontz demonstrates that there are not\nsubstantial differences in the average cost per available ton mile of the sixteen\ncarriers.? Available ton miles represent total transport capacity, some of which\nwill be utilized, and some left to perish through underutilization. Presumably,\nhowever, air line management is producing revenue transportation rather than\npotential transportation, so that a more relevant calculation might have been\naverage cost per revenue ton mile. But because the average cost per available\nton mile does not show great variations between carriers, Koontz concludes\nthat economies of scale are absent, although he points out later that it is\nvariations in the load factor!? which essentially account for the less favorable\nearnings in the commercial market of the smaller carriers.!* This implies that\nperhaps a smaller proportion of seats are occupied on the smaller lines, which\nstill further implies that possibly the unit is too large. I submit that the match-\ning of the size of the productive unit, in this case the plane, to the size of the\nmarket, is one of the problems generally comprehended among those of econo-\nmies of scale. It is also true, and the industry has shown considerable concern\nthereon, that no small modern aircraft, suitable to lightly trafficked routes, are\navailable from American manufacturers. Smaller air lines thus are largely\nforced to employ units larger than can be filled by their traffic. But no amount\nof corporate merger will solve the technical problem of providing small, fast,\nand cheap aircraft for thinly trafficked routes.\n\nKoontz then turns to variations in the effectiveness of management as a\npossible explanation for the variations of profits between carriers. He explains\nthe profitability of Eastern and American as resulting, in part, from the offer-\ning of a high volume of frequently scheduled service.'? If the profits of these\ntwo carriers are due to the size of their output, this hardly seems consistent\nwith his statement on the preceding page: When only the nine largest carriers\nare considered, evidence of any economies of scale virtually disappears.\"!*\n\nKoontz indicates that although there are wide differences in managerial\neffectiveness, such differences are insufficient to explain the differences in\nprofitability. While that may sometimes be true, there may be other cases in\nwhich differences in managerial ability are important. For example, a simple\ntest of managerial ability would seem to be its response to changes in the\n\n* Review, p. 108.\n\n? Review, pp. 108-14; Jouraal, pp. 133-40.\n\n?

The passenger\nservice is sold in a mass market, in which, although there is often but one\nseller of the air line service, there is a broad group of buyers who choose air\nservice as only one of several competing means of transport. In such a market,\nconventional pricing concepts are applicable. Mail, however, is transported\nunder conditions approaching those of bilateral monopoly, with a single buyer\nof the service, the Post Office, and often a single seller, the air line serving the\npair of cities involved. Nor is there even any relation between the postage\nrates which Congress establishes for the Post Office to charge the users of the\nair mail service and the rates which the Civil Aeronautics Board establishes\nfor the Post Office to pay for the carriage of its mail. The price elasticity of\ndemand for the carriage of air mail may well be zero. It is hard for me to see\nwhy passenger rates, an average of coach and first-class fares in continually\nvariable proportions, even assuming that existing passenger fares represent\noptimum pricing in the various passenger markets being served, should some-\nhow represent a norm for mail rates, which would appear to be a completely\ndifferent market. In a bilateral monopoly situation, such as the relation be-\ntween the Post Office and the air lines, there will be no market price in the\nusual sense, and price will be determined by bargaining.

In justification of this it is argued\nthat, though this procedure gives *about an equally good\" fit for the prewar\nperiod it gives a better fit for the three postwar years for which data are\navailable.\n\nThis argument, however, is open to the following criticism. Both the con-\nsumption equations, the one using and the other ignoring the price term,\nunderestimate the actual data for the postwar years; this is only as it should\nbe, for during this period the data were influenced by a special factor, the\npent-up war demand. In order to derive the true relationship, one would have\nto subtract this factor from the actual data, and since we do not know how\nlarge this factor is, we cannot say that the equation coming closer to the actual\ndata (in a linear way only, for there are points of inflexion in neither the\ndata nor the estimating equations for these years) gives a better indication of\nthe true relationship. This consideration is enhanced by the fact that a small\ndifference in the estimation of the pent-up demand would destroy the signifi-\ncance of the price term, for the differences between the equation using the\nprice term and the equation ignoring it are 1/10, 1/8 and 1/3 (for 1946, 1947\nand 1948 respectively) of the pent-up demand as measured by the difference\nbetween the actual data and the better fitting of the two equations. Thus the\nonly evidence to show that the equation using the price term is superior is that\nof 1948, when the pent-up demand must have been of less importance than in\nthe two preceding years. To argue from the evidence of one year is obviously\nmost tenuous. \u00c0 similar consideration throws grave doubt upon the estimated\nvalue of the price parameter, the calculated value of the price elasticity and\nalso on the introduction of a price term in the investment equation.\n\n'THoMAs Mavzn*\n* The author is an economic analyst in the office of the chief economist, Bureau of\n\nMines.

For the three years 1946-1948\nthe discrepancies run to 4.9596, 5.8896 and 2.6896, respectively, all positive\n(as opposed to prewar when plus and minus discrepancies almost matched\neach other, 5 for 6).\n\nThe estimated investment figures were completely off the mark. The authors\nsuggest that \"the failure of the postwar investment expenditures to come up\nto the levels estimated from the prewar investment function may perhaps be\nexplained partially by the feeling of uncertainty which existed in the minds of\nthe entrepreneurs as regards the possible course of the developments of the\nAmerican economy\" (p. 574). The hypothesis that the depressing effect of\n*uncertainty\" on investment was \"greater\" during three years of uninter-\nrupted high level prosperity (with a backlog of investment demand due to\nwartime disinvestment in many lines) than during the most depressed decade\nin U.S. history seems, at best, novel.\n", "thinking of the unsuccessful search for the stipulated I \u2014 f (dV/dt) relation-\nship in time series data.

It provides no evidence one way or the other as to any delayed effect\ndY/dt (or dC/dt) might have on I.\n\nAt any rate, any function attempting to describe investment which does not\nassign a r\u00f3le to expectations (directly, or via lags, rates of change, etc., in-\ndirectly) and which is not grounded on a micro-economic hypothesis is justi-\nfied only if one accepts the *Baconian approach\" to scientific inquiry or if\none enjoys running correlations.\n", "143\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "4": ["III. The Investment Function\n\nThe stated rationale of the Liu-Chang investment function (I \u2014 dY -- eF\n-F i, where d, e, and i are parameters) is that income is a measure of the\n\"evel of economic activities which generate demands for capital goods,\" while\ncorporate profits after taxes \"indicate the magnitude of the incentive for\nactually making the investment at a given level of demand\" (p. 568).\n\nNote that F\u2014corporate profits after taxes\u2014is considered exogenous. This\nin itself makes prediction on the basis of the function impossible, in that\ncurrent corporate profits are obviously related to the level of current income.\nMore important (given the authors' limited aims), a high degree of colline-\narity between Y and F renders the two parameters *e\" and \"d\" virtually\nmeaningless.\n\nIt is difficult to find justification for this sort of an investment function. The\nfact that no lags are intrinsic to annual data does not make the function any\nmore useful: no meaningful hypothesis as to the behavior of the individual\ninvestor is being tested.\n\nThe dismissal of the \"so-called 'acceleration principle! \" for lack of any\nevidence (p. 568), seems somewhat rash. Presumably Liu and Chang were\n\n*T am fully cognizant of the difficulties these distinctions involve, but they are not ot\nessence in the present argument.\n\n?' This was first impressed on the writer by Professor M. F. Millikan in his graduate\nnational income course.\n", "psychological motivation or the institutional and cultural framework\"? (and\nthere is little sense in formulating less \"fundamental\" relationships), the\nsuperiority of the last approach is manifest.?\n\nThe line of argument followed by Liu and Chang seems to have great\naffinity for the first approach. There is a good fit between C and Y, hence we\nhave \u00a3he (?) consumption function. Their defense against criticism on this\ncount is based on calculations indicating that disposable income is a good\nlinear function of gross national product and that: \"projections from the\nrelation between the two during the prewar decade yield figures for postwar\n*disposable income! extremely close to the actual figures\" (p. 570).\n\nIf the \"institutional\" relationship between Y4 and Y has not changed as\nbetween prewar and postwar, it no doubt follows that an apparent re-establish-\nment of the prewar (derived) relationship between C and Y is good evidence\nthat the behavioristic relationship between C and Y, is the same as before the\nwar. It is important to note, however, that the usefulness of the Liu-Chang\nstudy is severely limited, a fact not sufficiently emphasized by their own\narticle. Their so-called consumption function cannot be used either for pre-\ndiction or for testing hypotheses of consumer behavior. It is not invariant with\nrespect to changes in the Y vs. Y, relationship, hence variations in tax struc-\nture, transfers, corporate savings, etc., will invalidate it.\n\nThe only positive justification the authors provide for the use of VY is that\nit simplifies the system. If Y, is a linear function of V, it is difficult to see the\nnature of the simplification. On the other hand, the advantages of using Ya\nare substantial.\n", "142\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "3": ["9 Eoo MM.\n\nIl. The Consumption Function\n\nThe function used by Liu and Chang is of the form C \u2014 aY 4 bP t c,\nwhere a, b, and c are parameters.\n\nThe authors indicate awareness of several possible ways of refining their\nfunction, but do not consider any of these of substantial importance. As\nregards lags, they state that despite the improvement in correlation that intro-\nduction of an additional independent variable necessarily effects, their experi-\nments with lags resulted in only \"superficial\" improvements (not to mention\nthe lower significance of the correlation) and that at any rate it is doubtful if\nany significant lags are inherent in annual data.\n\nThese points are well taken; nevertheless, their justification for using unde-\nflated figures would have been more compelling had they used quarterly data\nand then tried lags. Had implicit expectational elements? been thus brought in\non the right-hand side, their function would have been more readily reconcil-\nable with the assumption of dynamic **money sophistication.\"\n\nIn the use of Y as a determinant of C one can also quarrel with Liu and\nChang. Unlike the use of lags, the use of Y instead of Y, is not just a simpli-\nfication. The function, as it stands, does not provide us with a testable hy-\npothesis of behavior.\n\nThere are three possible methods of approach to \"the\" consumption func-\ntion:\n\n1. The *Baconian\" inductive-statistical approach: i.e., running correlations\nbetween aggregate magnitudes with no attempt at a theoretical foundation,\nlooking for higher and higher correlation coefficients;\n\n2. Setting up hypotheses as to behavior (invariant with respect to a class\nof structures\"), then testing against relevant aggregates;\n\n3.

But where the two periods under consideration differ in P as much as do the\npostwar and prewar, we must be wary of such approximations.\n\n\"It could be argued that implicit in the exclusive use of current magnitudes is a pre-\nsumption that the elasticity of expectations is unity; that in fact people expect the\nparameters relevant to their decisions not to change.

Their first argument, that a function based on *money illusion\" better\nconforms to theory than one which relates real consumption to real income, is\nambiguous. What are the \"theoretical grounds\" on which we should expect\nthe absolute price level to play a part in consumption decisions? The authors\ndo not specify. If narrowly defined, the use of the term *money illusion\" would\nindicate that they are suggesting \"irrationality\"? on the part of consumers.\nYet, since the implication that a hypothesis of systematic \"irrationality\" is\nsubject to \u00a3eoretical proof is patently unacceptable, it is more likely that Liu\nand Chang are thinking in terms of \"rationality\" in a dynamic world. Either\ninelastic price expectations or '\"Pigou effects\" could induce \"rational\" be-\nhavior which would appear (to an observer with a static frame of reference)\nlike money-illusion \"irrationality.\"*\n\nBy accepting the importance of such dynamic effects, however, the authors\nundermine the logical foundations of their own function. If current prices and\nincomes are the sole variables relevant to consumption decisions, then the\nform of the consumption function cannot be governed by tacit consideration\nof other variables (expectations, nonequity assets, etc.).* If prices and in-\ncomes are really the only things that belong on the right-hand side, then it\nfollows that only \"irrational\" behavior can validate an undeflated function.\nNo empirical evidence is cited in favor of such \"irrationality\" and I, for one,\nam loath to give up the assumption of \"*rationality\" for a model based on\nsystematic \"irrationality.\"\n\nThe authors! second argument, that the indices available for deflation are\nof tenuous applicability, though correct in itself, is irrelevant. The technical\nfaults of currently used deflating procedures provide excellent reason for\ncautious interpretation of so-called \"real\" figures: they do not validate unde-\nflated figures.\n\nSuffice it to conclude:* (1) that most prewar studies suggest that deflated\n\n*'[rrational\" is a poor word for the intended concept but its analogous place in the\nvocabulary of price theory and the lack of an obvious substitute perhaps justify its use.\nNote, however, that it must be very narrowly defined as implying nonmaximizing behavior\nin terms of a specified frame of reference.

It seems reasonable to suppose that the optimum rate of population\ngrowth would be higher during the earlier part of this period when the ratio\nof population to land and other resources was extremely low and the total\npopulation was well below an optimum. Further, the inflow of foreign capital\nduring the first part of this period would raise the optimum rate of growth for\nthat period. It is also possible that the rate of population growth during part\nof this period may have exceeded the optimum by a substantial margin.\n\nMore recently, the population of the United States has probably approached\nan optimum and may well have passed it. Accordingly it seems probable that\nthe optimum rate of growth is now substantially lower than it was during the\nearlier part of the period, say before 1900. Some economists, in particular\nthose of the secular stagnation school, are inclined to believe that the rate of\ngrowth in recent decades has been below the rate necessary to maintain a high\nlevel of employment. However, the occurrence of two world wars and a great\ndepression makes the period since 1910 difficult to interpret and a more de-\ntailed study will be needed to determine whether the optimum rate of growth\nhas declined more or less than the actual rate of growth in recent decades. In\nfact, the whole problem of the relation of population growth to the demand for\ncapital merits more detailed attention than it has yet received.\n\nIn view of the recent emphasis that has been placed on the amazing popu-\nlation upsurge\" in the United States it may be useful to note by way of con-\nclusion that although the absolute growth in the population of the United\nStates during the decade ending in 1950 was the largest on record, the per-\ncentage rate of growth for this decade was slightly smaller than that of the\ndecade ending in 1930.\n\n(C anpow\u00ab551 Dappbrn*k\n", "139\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"]}}, "content_type": "Comment", "authors": ["Francis M.

Ta-Chung\nand Ching-Gwan Chang argue that the price level should be introduced into\nthe consumption and investment equations. In justification of this it is argued\nthat, though this procedure gives *about an equally good\" fit for the prewar\nperiod it gives a better fit for the three postwar years for which data are\navailable.\n\nThis argument, however, is open to the following criticism. Both the con-\nsumption equations, the one using and the other ignoring the price term,\nunderestimate the actual data for the postwar years; this is only as it should\nbe, for during this period the data were influenced by a special factor, the\npent-up war demand. In order to derive the true relationship, one would have\nto subtract this factor from the actual data, and since we do not know how\nlarge this factor is, we cannot say that the equation coming closer to the actual\ndata (in a linear way only, for there are points of inflexion in neither the\ndata nor the estimating equations for these years) gives a better indication of\nthe true relationship. This consideration is enhanced by the fact that a small\ndifference in the estimation of the pent-up demand would destroy the signifi-\ncance of the price term, for the differences between the equation using the\nprice term and the equation ignoring it are 1/10, 1/8 and 1/3 (for 1946, 1947\nand 1948 respectively) of the pent-up demand as measured by the difference\nbetween the actual data and the better fitting of the two equations. Thus the\nonly evidence to show that the equation using the price term is superior is that\nof 1948, when the pent-up demand must have been of less importance than in\nthe two preceding years. To argue from the evidence of one year is obviously\nmost tenuous. \u00c0 similar consideration throws grave doubt upon the estimated\nvalue of the price parameter, the calculated value of the price elasticity and\nalso on the introduction of a price term in the investment equation.\n\n'THoMAs Mavzn*\n* The author is an economic analyst in the office of the chief economist, Bureau of\n\nMines.
