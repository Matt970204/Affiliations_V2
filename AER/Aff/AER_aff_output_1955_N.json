First, long-term technological substitution has reduced the rail\nshares of total intercity passenger-miles and ton-miles from 90 per cent or\nmore to only about 6 and 50 per cent respectively. Regulation has not slack-\nened the decline in the role of the railroads. Secondly, projected large-scale\ninvestment of public funds in interstate highways, inland waterways and the\nSt. Lawrence Seaway has further increased the railroads' feeling of insecurity\nunder regulation of competition. Thirdly, except for less aid to trunk airlines,\nlittle progress has been made in adjusting user fees on a sound economic basis\nor in establishing such fees for use of public airway and waterway facilities.\nFourthly, the railroads have become greatly discontented with postwar rate\nregulation.

These are the puzzle kind of problem, not the\npolicy kind dealt with in the first part of the course. Most of the students'\ntime outside of class should be devoted to working problems. The instructor\nshould not proceed on the assumption that he must get through the entire\ntext or cover a certain fixed amount of material; he should proceed as rapidly\nor slowly as the student body at his institution can acquire a reasonable mas-\ntery of the tools.\n\nThere are a number of problem-workbooks on the market, but they have\nserious defects. They are separate volumes from the textbook and therefore\nare not sufficiently integrated with the text itself. What is worse, they com-\nmonly do half the work for the student; that is, instead of merely stating the\nproblem, they set it up for him, so that he does only the final steps. This is all\nright as long as we are aiming only at a reading knowledge; but if we want to\ndevelop some skill in the student, we must do as the mathematicians do. (In-\ncidentally, this is the reason why economics workbooks now are and must be\nseparate volumes from the text: to set up the problem\u2014e.g., to give numerical\nvalues for ten or twelve points on a supply curve\u2014takes a lot of space. If the\nproblems were merely stated as in a mathematics text, it would be feasible to\ncombine text and problem-book.) The text should develop the methodology of\neconomic theory with great care; and the instructor should pay a great deal\nof attention to it. This is the great weakness in economic training: under-\ngraduate majors don't understand what theory is all about; some graduate\nstudents don't either; and occasionally we have the spectacle of a well-known,\nrespected professor of economics making elementary mistakes in print.

They also lack a sense\nof direction\u2014an awareness of the ultimate goal\u2014which would be a big help\nto the learning process. Vanderbilt during the past six years has used in its\nSophomore course an approach which solves this problem at the expense of\nsacrificing the one great merit attainable with the more usual procedure. A\npolicy problem, such as monopoly, is introduced with a statement of the issue.\nNext, tools of formal theory are brought in on grounds that they are needed\nfor a proper understanding of the problem. Finally the tools are used to\nilluminate the problem. Then the course proceeds to the next issue. This\nmethod has been successful. Students are no longer bothered by the seeming\nunreality of theory. But because tools are mixed up with policy issues, few stu-\ndents acquire any skill in actively using the tools; few get beyond the read-\ning-knowledge stage. What is needed is a course (or a section of a course)\nwhich has for its primary purpose training in theoretical skills.\n\nTherefore, the course described in the previous section should be used as the\nfirst half or two-thirds of the introductory course, with the second part con-\nfined to theory. The section on theory should be taught like a mathematics\n", "930\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "11": ["asked him why he kept coming, he admitted that he often felt he should be\nboning up for his Ph.D. preliminary examinations, but he was convinced\nthat he learned more by spending the hour in class than he could by any other\nuse of his time.

What is the explanation? A large\npart of the explanation must be this: the basic ideas, which we can state so\nsimply in sophomore courses that we usually hurry on to more difficult\nmatters, have wide and far-reaching implications. They therefore provide\nmuch more material for valuable teaching than we have heretofore realized.\nIf mature and advanced students profit from this kind of course, it is because\nthey can see so many of the implications.\n\nIV. Content of the Course\u2014Second Part\n\nThe most difficult problem in teaching the introductory course is how to\nhandle value and distribution theory. On the one hand, most teachers are\nagreed that they want to include a heavy dose of theory; on the other hand,\nthe results achieved are unsatisfactory. No doubt, the desire to teach theory\nstems in part from wrong motives\u2014an unconscious desire to start every-\nbody on the road to becoming a professional economist or an absurd assump-\ntion that students will master enough theory in one year to be able to apply\nit to policy problems after they leave college. Nevertheless, there are sound\nreasons for teaching theory in an introductory course. A few will become pro-\nfessional economists; a number will major in the field; others will want to\ntake an advanced course or two. All such need to be shown what economics\nreally is like. There are weighty reasons for teaching theory even to those\nwho will go no further. Theory can and should give a deeper understanding of\neconomic issues. Moreover, one of the objects of a liberal education is to learn\nsomething about the methods of science. From this point of view, the typical\nmethods of analysis used by economists ought to be demonstrated if at all\npossible.\n\nTheory must be taught\u2014but how? Comparison of examination results with\nother teachers and observation in advanced courses of students who had ele-\nmentary economics from some one else gives evidence that the poor results\nof which I am painfully aware in my students are not just the result of poor\nteaching.

It consisted of four graduate students and three\nundergraduate seniors. They were all good students. In addition they were un-\nusually mature: six out of seven were married, five were over 25 years of\nage.

The course was already under criti-\ncism from other departments because it was a beginning course for seniors and\ngraduate students. They doubted if the course would have a sufficiently high\nintellectual content, even though they were not aware that it was being de-\nliberately made much simpler (in one sense at least) than our sophomore\ncourse. To make matters worse, three of the graduate students had had\nprevious work in economics. Nevertheless, no effort was made to step up the\ndifficulty or the intellectual content of the course.

At the end of this part of the course there is a\nfinal discussion of the over-all problem.

Hence, the study of theory diverts them from\nthe main idea. This result is enhanced by the practice of stating theory in\ndiagrammatic as well as verbal form, so that the student has to learn every\nidea twice; and it is further enhanced by the common misconceptions of stu-\ndents as to what theory is all about, particularly the unrealism of the as-\nsumptions. Diversion of the students' attention from the main point is not an\ninevitable consequence of teaching theory; but it is an inevitable consequence\nof trying to teach too much theory.\n\nIt is, of course, a simplification to assume that all the material of an ele-\nmentary course can be neatly classified into three types: a single crucial idea,\na limited number of significant ideas, and those lesser ideas which students for-\nget immediately. In reality, there is a continuum. Some students learn and\nretain more than others; moreover, it may be underestimating students'\ncapacity to assume that most of them can make only one idea part of their\npermanent active thinking. The three kinds of material shade off into each\nother.\n\nMy candidate for the runner-up spot is the creation of money by banks.\nThis, irrespective of what conclusions one may draw from it, seems to me\nthe single idea which most illuminates the problems of depression and infla-\ntion. It is not difficult to give it considerable emphasis. It can be taught once\nby itself, emphasized again in connection with the F'ederal Reserve banks, re-\nemphasized when discussing business cycles, touched on in connection with\nthe theory of employment, and brought in once more in connection with inter-\nnational trade.\n\nNow let us consider the second type o\u00ed material, the significant ideas\u2014and\nfacts\u2014which the students are expected to know at the time of the final\nexamination but which will afterwards fade from their memories. Some stu-\ndents will have an active, writing knowledge of them all at the time of the\nexamination and will retain some of them indefinitely; others will never get\nmuch more than a passive, reading knowledge of them; this difference gives\nthe basis for diversity of final grades. Every teacher should have his own list\nof ideas. Students vary in ability from college to college and even from one\nyear to the next. The extent of the list must be adjusted to their abilities.\nWhat we aim to teach must vary with our students. Moreover, strict uni-\nformity among teachers, even where students of the same ability are involved,\nwould hardly be advisable; progress is made by each teacher thinking for\nhimself and exchanging the fruits of thinking. But it is important that the\nteacher have such a list, that he make up his mind how much he is trying to\nteach; otherwise, the danger of teaching too much (or too little) is enormously\nincreased. It is our indecision about the content of the course that Taylor and\nHewett in the passages cited above rightly criticized. The principles under-\nlying such a list should be these: the ideas should be important in themselves;\nthey should be limited in number; where possible they should contribute\ntoward teaching the price mechanism.\n\nTo avoid overloading a course, we must not only decide what we are aiming\nto teach but must also be careful about the third (supplementary) kind of ma-\n", "924\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "5": ["other information for the examination, much of which we can hope will con-\ntribute permanently to their reading knowledge of economics; and that a\nthorough knowledge of an idea is acquired primarily through repetition.

I have in mind a very elementary level, the level at which\neducated people who are not economists are apt to talk about economic prob-\nlems; in other words, the level of Chapters 10 and 11 in Chandler's A Preface\nto Economics, or pages 36-40 (together with pages 14-17) of Samuelson's\nEconomics, or Chapter 9 in Burns, Neal and Watson's Modern Economics?\nEven at this level, educated people are woefully ignorant. A brilliant faculty\nmember, who has several advanced degrees and has studied a little economics,\nlistened to a lecture in which Frank Knight touched on rent control in an ele-\nmentary way; in the discussion period afterward, he asked a question which\nshowed he did not understand that price can act as a rationing device if it\nis free to seek its own level. This was no blind spot in the thinking of a single\nman. It is typical.\n\nIt is commonplace that repetition is an important aid to learning. Few stu-\ndents have the steel-vise type of mind which needs contact with an idea only\nonce in order to master it. But the billboard advertising kind of repetition,\nwhich reiterates the same message in the same words, will not work with college\nstudents. We must keep coming back to the same idea but always with a new\ntwist, a different context, a fresh application. This is not difficult to do in a\ncourse organized around policy problems, for each new problem involves a new\napplication of the basic idea of the price mechanism. This is true even in\nmacroeconomics. In the field of monetary policy, interest rates are prices; and\nKeynesian analysis is a reply to the contention that prices free to fall, particu-\nlarly wage and interest rates, would ensure full employment.\n\nIn the elementary course, formal economic theory, far from contributing to\na basic understanding of the price mechanism, is ordinarily a positive hin-\ndrance.

The full-year course described in this note\nfulfills this requirement in the process of attaining its other objectives.\n\nII. Content of the Course\u2014First Part\n\nThe statement quoted earlier from Hewett says that the content (as well\nas the objectives) of the elementary course should be reduced.? Apparently\nthe other members of the sub-committee did not disagree with this half of his\nargument; and to judge by some of the textbooks on the market, in many\ncases it is only too true. On the other hand, some textbooks (and presumably\nsome courses) make the opposite error: in the effort to simplify the analysis\nand cut down on content, they eliminate important ideas. One reason for the\nperpetual dissatisfaction with elementary texts is that those that give an ade-\nquate statement of important ideas are overloaded; and those that are ad-\nmirably simple give short shrift to some of the main points.\n\nHere I want to make a suggestion which I have not noticed in the Report on\nteaching economics: that we organize the course on the basis of explicit as-\nsumptions about how much economics students can learn in one course. Al-\nthough this suggestion is simple and obvious, it could help in solving the\nproblem of how much content to put into the elementary course. It would be\nbetter, of course, if we had scientific knowledge about how much students can\nlearn; but that would require long and extensive research, for which an\neconomist is not particularly well equipped. It is far better to proceed on the\nbasis of our guesses than that we not think about the matter at all.\n\nIt is common knowledge that students retain precious little permanently;\neven for examination purposes they know only a small fraction of what we\nteach. Moreover, a great deal of what they learn is not learned well enough\nfor them to use and apply it independently. To make this clearer, let us apply\nto economics the kind of distinction made in foreign languages between a read-\ning knowledge and a speaking (or better, writing) knowledge. It is much\neasier to learn to read a foreign language than write it. Similarly, it is much\neasier to learn to read (or hear) an economic discussion with understanding\nthan to speak or write about it afterwards or apply the ideas to a new context.\nWe should not despise a reading knowledge of economics. The role of the\neducated citizen in a democracy is not to be an expert on all things but to\nknow enough so that he can follow the arguments with some understanding\nand to choose among the experts when they differ. It is not important that the\ncitizen be able to explain the process by which banks create money; and\neven if he does not remember that they can create money, it is helpful if the\nidea is familiar enough to him so that if he listens to a speech by Senator\nDouglas, a brief reminder will bring it back to him. But of course a writing\nor speaking knowledge of economics is better.\n\nI propose the following working assumptions: that if we succeed in giving\nmost of our students a writing (or speaking) knowledge of one important\nidea which he will retain permanently, we shall accomplish more than most\ncollege courses; that students can learn only a limited number of ideas and\n\n?

Such problems as inequality\nof income, monopoly, depression, inflation, restrictions on foreign trade, and\ninternational monetary arrangements have troubled America since the found-\ning of the republic. Most of them are not restricted to free enterprise econ-\nomies; they are inherent in asy kind of economy.\n\nBut though the problems themselves endure, their context constantly\nchanges. For this reason, there is little enduring value in a course which puts\nits whole emphasis on a thorough discussion of current issues. In a free society\nthe best we can do is to clarify the issues for the student, arouse his interest,\nand give him some tools of analysis to help him make up his mind. Our aim\nshould be to stimulate his interest, not satisfy it. If we use just so much dis-\ncussion of the great issues as helps us most to get across ideas and principles,\nwe shall have gone as far as is wise toward teaching the issues themselves.\n\n3. To acquaint students with basic economic facts and. institutions. Some\nknowledge of facts and institutions is indispensable to teaching ideas and is\nworth while for its own sake. The question is how far should we go. In a\ncollege course, such information should be subordinated for several reasons:\ncollege students come to us with a greater store of information than we com-\nmonly realize; such information is constantly becoming out of date; and we\nought not to sacrifice principles to description. If we aim at teaching ideas,\nusing policy problems as a vehicle, it will take very little care to ensure that\nthe course contains sufficient facts for this purpose.\n\n4. To get students to think through their economic value judgments. 'To\nmake up their minds on economic issues, students have to have value judg-\nments. It is better that they consciously decide what they want and resolve\ncontradictions than that they adopt goals uncritically and unconsciously.\nClearly, a course in elementary economics cannot also be a course in philoso-\nphy, religion, and ethics; but clearly also economic goals are too specific to\nbe left entirely to other parts of the curriculum. The elementary course ought\nto encourage students to think through what goals they want policy to pursue.\n1f, as is argued above, we want policy problems to loom large in the course,\nit will require very little care and no extra time to do this. It takes no extra\ntime because to teach the significance of economic ideas we must clearly dis-\ntinguish between means and ends.\n\n5. To help achieve the general objectives of a liberal arts education. ^\nliberal arts college has many objectives; I shall discuss only one: to acquaint\nthe student with the heritage and ideals of the West. In economics this does\nnot mean inculcating the principles of nineteenth-century free enterprise, but\nit does mean teaching what those principles were, together with the leading\ncriticisms of them that have led Americans to modify greatly their economy.\nOn the one hand, the student should not be ignorant of traditional ways of\nthinking; on the other hand, he should be their master, not their slave.\n\n6.

Although the elementary course is often over-loaded, the prob-\nlem is not to cut down on the number of objectives but to find ways of\npursuing them simultaneously. There is, however, an important problem of\nemphasis: we must decide which objective is most important.

Very likely the consensus\nhides a large measure of disagreement. But there is one reason to which many\nwill subscribe: the elementary course is most likely to be of permanent value\nto students, especially to those who take no more economics, if it concen-\ntrates on basic ideas. Institutions change; the context of policy problems\nchange; but the basic ideas we want to teach in an elementary course today\nwould have been useful fifty or a hundred years ago; and we have faith that\nthey will go on illuminating economic problems for a long time to come.\n\nEconomic ideas are only half-taught unless the student is shown why they\nare important and how they can be applied. Now, their importance stems\nprimarily from their power to illuminate problems of government policy.\nHence, the teaching of ideas could not be divorced from discussion of policy\nproblems even if the latter were not itself an objective.\" Furthermore, a great\ndeal is lost if the ideas are taught in the first semester and their applications\nare deferred to the second. Ideas can be more effectively taught if the ideas\nand their applications go hand-in-hand. This means that a course designed to\nteach principles should really be oriented around policy problems.\n\nPolicy problems can serve the teaching of principles in another way\u2014by\nstimulating interest.

It is impossible to say how much was lost or foregone by the union's\ninsistence on the principle of the guarantee.\n\n? Whether or not the wage plans developing in the auto industry become a pattern for\nother industries is highly conjectural. The annual improvement factor which was intro-\nduced in this industry five years ago has not spread. On the other hand, health and welfare\nand pension programs have developed in the past few years on a fairly widespread basis,\nbut they have an appeal for all workers since old age is inevitable and sickness and ac-\ncidents are uncertain. The insecurity arising from possible layoff is not so generalized or\nuncertain and many workers and their unions will not favor using their bargaining\nstrength for objectives which do not benefit the majority of the membership. In many\nindustries unions have already decasualized income among members by decasualizing em-\nployment through job control and the hiring hall or dispatching office. Such unions are not\nlikely to bargain for supplementary unemployment compensation at the expense of other\npossible gains. In industries in which employment is highly sensitive to seasonal or cyclical\nfactors and where the union does not have job control, privately negotiated supplementary\nunemployment compensation may be more likely to become a major bargaining issue.\nThe auto industry is the first major industrial area where management has accepted the\nresponsibility for maintenance of workers! incomes.\n\n*' The author is assistant director of the Institute of Labor Economics, University of\nWashington.\n", "in the auto industry have not as yet (October 1955) announced an increase\nin the prices of cars, and this probably will not occur until new models are\nintroduced. Even if the prices are raised it would be virtually impossible to\nassert that the increase exactly covered the cost of the new wage plan since\nlabor costs are affected by other changes in wage rates, fringe benefits, etc., in\nthe new contract. Undoubtedly the cost of the guaranteed wage would be an\nimportant causal factor in inducing a price increase if such occurs.\n\nWith a guaranteed wage plan such as that of the Ford Company, the income\ntransfers which are likely to occur will be a mixture of those discussed above.\nThere may be some slight increase in the stability of employment in the com-\npany, causing the transfer among workers. In part the 5 cents per hour won\nat the bargaining table for this guarantee was at the expense of some other\ngains which might have been won;? and thus some workers have foregone in-\ncome which they might have had. On the other hand, the 5 cents per hour was\nprobably in part a net additional gain to the total wage package, and, since it\nnow represents a new dimension to the contract which must be bargained for,\nit may result in future net gains to the wage package. Thus the other forms\nof income transfers will be likely to result.\n\nThe types of income transfers which we have discussed are not new in our\neconomy since similar transfers occur with the various state unemployment\ncompensation programs, and they produce desirable stabilizing effects on the\neconomy. If the UAW-Ford settlement should become a pattern for other\ncollective bargaining negotiations, and this is by no means certain,!^ these\ntransfers would become far more important in our economy. The fact that\nseems to be overlooked by unions and their membership when they negotiate\nfor guaranteed annual wages, particularly of the UAW-Ford type, is that they\nare bargaining for income transfers, some of which they may not approve.\n\nPururP.

CARTWRIGHT*\n", "937\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "5": ["* Some evidence of this feeling was apparent from the discontent shown by many skilled\nworkers after the contract had been signed.\n\n\"There may be subsequent effects on the level of investment of the firm as well, but\nthis cannot be thought of as a transfer.\n\n\"Since the General Motors Corporation share of the industry demand is over 50 per\ncent and that of the Ford Motor Co. over 25 per cent, and since each is concerned in its\ncompetitive practices primarily with the other, it would appear that these two firms would\nestablish the price pattern for the industry whether the other firms followed or not, and\nalmost certainly the other firms would follow such leadership.\n\n* In the event of price increases there may be some impact on profits and dealer margins\ndepending on the industry elasticity of demand. There may also be shifts among the auto\ncompanies as shares of the market change with price increases. These changes are not\nstrictly transfers, as they generally result from a decline in total output rather than a\nredistribution of that output.\n", "The remaining cases assume the other extreme, which in fact appears more\nlikely, that the pattern of production through time remains unaffected by the\nguarantee. Several cases emerge, depending on whether the direct cost of the\nguarantee (2.e., the 5 cents per hour contribution) is in addition to or is in lieu\nof a wage increase. In the latter event two types of transfers occur. The first\nis simply a transfer over time, the workers receiving the income at one period\nof time which they contributed at another. The second is a transfer among\nthe workers from those who are employed relatively more to those who are\nlaid off relatively more. This probably means a transfer from workers with\nmore seniority to those with less since the latter are more likely to be laid off.\nIdentified in this way, the more senior workers may not have preferred to\nforego a possible wage increase in order to maintain the income of less senior\nworkers. They might prefer spreading the work rather than the income.\nUntil such time as the trust fund reaches 85 per cent, a senior worker will\nunder most circumstances be eligible for more benefits than a junior worker as\na consequence of the provisions described in the table of cancellations of\ncredits. However, the fact remains that the less senior workers are far more\nlikely to be drawing benefits. Once the trust fund reaches 85 per cent the\ntransfer of income from senior to junior workers is, of course, more obvious.\n\nNext let us assume that the cost of the guarantee, 7.e., the 5 cents per hour\ncontribution, is in addition to any other wage benefits which might have been\nwon at the bargaining table. Then various groups are forced to transfer in-\ncome to workers whose income is sustained by benefit payments. If the guar-\nentee had been negotiated only with the Ford Motor Company in an industry\nsuch as the auto industry the transferors would undoubtedly become the\nstockholders in so far as payments into the trust fund come from profits. This\nmay mean a reduction in corporate retentions rather than dividends, of course,\nbut this still represents a transfer from the stockholders.*\n\nSince a similar guarantee has been negotiated with other major firms in the\nindustry, it is quite possible that the firms involved may raise the price of\nautos to compensate for the additional 5 cents per man-hour cost.\" In this case\nthe transferors become the buyers of the product, presumably the auto-con-\nsuming public, perhaps to some extent automobile dealers. The major firms\n", "936\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "4": ["doubtedly not practicable. In fact, if changes in production or merchandising\nwhich would significantly increase stability of employment were economically\nprofitable in the auto industry, they would have been made regardless of the\nguaranteed wage commitment. Stable production brings large cost reductions\nper unit of output both in savings on overtime and premium labor rates and\nin better utilization of capital equipment. The nature of the market demand,\nhowever, precludes the profitable possibility of substantial changes in stability\nof employment. However, it should simply be borne in mind that to the extent\nthat greater stability of employment ensues asa result of the guarantee,\nworkers, more or less, pay for their own guarantee by transferring income\namong themselves.\n\nTo the extent that stability of employment over the year reduces the capital\nrequirements per unit of output it results not only in cost reduction to the\nfirm but also in a transfer of income from other factors to labor. In the auto\nindustry, however, capital-output and capital-labor coefficients are not com-\npletely variable, resulting in what is sometimes referred to as \"lumpiness of\ninvestment.\" It could hardly be expected, for example, that the Ford Motor\nCompany would reduce the number of assembly plants even if it could sta-\nbilize its production over the year. However, they might defer adding new\nplants with the growth in the market, thus altering the capital coefficients.\n\nChanges in the capital-labor coefficients may result for a different reason\nthan the stabilizing of output. It has been argued* that in the auto industry\nthe guarantee may be expected to reduce the rate of substitution of automatic\nequipment for labor, thus resulting in a transfer of income from producers of\nthis equipment to workers (transferees) or a deceleration in the rate of trans-\nfer from workers to these producers. The argument here is somewhat obscure\nand really is concerned with the rate of substitution of capital for labor rather\nthan the ultimate or desired capital-labor ratio. The increase in the relative\nprice of labor under the guarantee and the fact that it becomes a partially\nfixed cost reduces its relative desirability as a factor, thus tending to cause\nan increase rather than a decrease in the ratio of capital to labor. However,\nthe existence of an obligation for 26 weeks lay-off (in this case severance)\npay to workers who would be displaced by the introduction of labor-saving\ncapital equipment makes the introduction of that equipment appear less profit-\nable. Changing payroll cost into a partially fixed or sunk cost makes the cal-\nculation of the profitability of introducing new equipment in place of labor\nanalogous to the problem of replacement of obsolete but usable equipment\nwith new, more ef\u00fccient equipment. The firm must recognize that the old\nmethod of production (whether it be with the existing capital-labor ratio or\nwith old machinery) is cost-free as far as the fixed cost factor is concerned,\nwhereas the amortization cost of the new method is a real cost to be incurred.\nIn our case this means that in so far as is practicable substitution of capital\nfor labor would proceed at a rate consistent with market expansion and attri-\ntion of the labor force, but that substitution at a rate in excess of this would\nbe retarded by the guarantee commitment.\n\n*S.

However, much of this analysis is\ninappropriate to the guaranteed wage plan negotiated by the UAW and the\nFord Motor Company. The feasibility and desirability of this plan can per-\nhaps best be determined by examining the plan in the context of transfer pay-\nments.\n\nIf a specific group of auto workers receive an income under the terms of\nthe UAW-Ford wage plan which they would not have received in the absence\nof the contract, and if the plan does not result in an increase in production and\nhence in national income, then the additional income received by these workers\nmust be simply a transfer from some other group. It is certainly not expected\nthat the UAW-Ford Company wage guarantee will result in significant in-\ncreases in output over a year's period, and hence all payments resulting from\nthe plan are really income transfers. The desirability of the plan from the\nstandpoint of all parties concerned depends in large measure on who the\ntransferors are, i.e., who gives up income. It is the purpose of this note to\nidentify the transferors under the UAW-Ford plan given certain assumptions\nconcerning the effects of the plan. Although the following discussion refers to\nthe specific plan negotiated by the UAW and the Ford Motor Company, most\nof the analysis is applicable to other guaranteed wage proposals.\n\nThe essential features of the UAW-Ford contract as they affect the transfer\nproblem are as follows. The company agrees to contribute to a trust fund at\nthe rate of 5 cents per hour for each employee hired until the trust fund\nreaches a figure of $55,000,000, known as 100 per cent trust fund position.\"*\nAfter this position is reached the company will contribute, at the same rate,\nonly when necessary to maintain the fund in this 100 per cent position. This\ncontribution to the fund is the sole and maximum financial liability of the\ncompany under the plan.\n\nEvery worker who has a year of seniority will be eligible to apply for bene-\nfit payments from the fund according to the credits he has accumulated.\nWorkers will acquire credits at the rate of V4 credit per week of work of 32\nhours or more until June 1957 and 77 credit per week thereafter. Credits may\nbe accumulated to a maximum of 26. When the worker is laid off he becomes\neligible, after a waiting period of one week, for payments from the trust fund\nwhich supplement his unemployment compensation. The total of his unem-\nployment compensation and his supplementary payment will be 65 per cent\nof his weekly take-home pay for four weeks, and thereafter 60 per cent of\ntake-home pay. The credits which the worker has accumulated are canceled\n\n* Actually there are two trust funds, one for workers designated as defense workers and\none for other workers.

This paper is\nintended to help clarify some of the underlying issues and to begin\nto provide a theoretical basis for their analysis.\n\nMany of the underdeveloped areas of the world have large agrarian\npopulations in which there is either persistent open unemployment\nor in which the marginal productivity of the working force is so low\nthat it is commonly believed that withdrawal of a sizable fraction\nwould not significantly affect output. This seems to be the case to\nvarying degrees for much of Asia and the Middle East. Other countries,\nsuch as Italy, show persistent urban as well as rural unemployment\nor underemployment. It is a common feature of the unemployment in\nthese countries that it fails to respond to fiscal policy measures designed\nto increase employment by stimulating effective demand. Use of con-\nventional income-generating techniques appears in fact to create infla-\ntionary pressures and balance-of-payments difficulties long before full\nemployment is approached.\n\nThis interpretation of the condition of many underdeveloped areas\nhas led to the formulation of a number of alternative explanatory\nhypotheses which are presented in Section I.

In commenting on this question, I\nshall limit my discussion for the most part to the very special case of isolated,\nsymmetrical groups of z rival firms.\n\nIn such cases, Hieser and I agree that the ratio \u2014Eii/E;; \u2014 n \u20141 reflects\nthe \"numbers\" criterion to at least a fair approximation (p. 376). We also\nagree that the classification of market relationships requires a \"substitution\"\ncriterion as well. We differ, however, in that I prefer the own elasticity E;; for\nthis purpose, while Hieser prefers the cross-elasticity E;;. At bottom, this dif-\nference between us is definitional; but it is well worth debating which defini-\ntion is the more useful analytically. For my part, I acknowledge that the cross-\nelasticities E;; and Ei; indicate the substitutability between the ith and jth\nproducts; and Hieser seems to agree, in turn, that Ei; reflects what I called\nthe \"total substitutability\" between the ith product and all others taken to-\ngether\u2014or all others within the relevant group when there is no significant\nsubstitution between the ith product and others outside that group (p. 375).\nWe would further agree, I take it, that both \"'total substitutability\" and the\n\"individual substitutability\" between pairs of products have their own respec-\ntive significances. It remains, therefore, for me to indicate my reasons for pre-\nferring Ei; as the more useful substitution criterion for the specific purpose of\nclassifying market relationships. I am especially grateful for the opportunity\nto do so; for Hieser's note has made me belatedly aware that I have never\ngiven anything like a complete explanation of my choice in this respect.\n\nIn reply to the first round of criticisms of my article, it was necessary for me\nto emphasize that a remarkably close approach to pure competition is con-\nsistent with very large magnitudes of E;;, provided only that \u2014Zi; is all\nthe larger\u2014such that \u2014E;;/Ej; \u2014 n \u2014 1 is also large.* At the same time, I\nalso observed that \"'cross-elasticities are not necessarily high in atomistic com-\npetition.\"? This goes to the heart of the question as to the relative merits of\nEi; and Ej as the preferred criterion of product homogeneity or heterogeneity\nin the context of market classification. I must now emphasize that a remark-\nably close approach to pure competition is also consistent with very small\ncross-elasticities, provided that \u2014 E;;, while itself very large, is small relative\nto n\u2014such that \u2014E;;/(n \u2014 1) \u2014 Ej; is small?\n\n! *Reply,?

As indicated above, these structural changes were one\nof the most important factors making possible the great union expansion from\n1933 to the end of the war. There is, however, no reason to suppose that future\nstructural changes will be so fortuitous from the standpoint of organized labor.\nThe increasing complexity of our industrial system, the expansion of govern-\nmental functions, and rising real incomes are bringing about a decline in the\nmanual segment of the labor force, that segment which has furnished the only\nfertile field for the union organizer. The South, and other areas of anti-union-\nism, have been expanding industrially relative to those areas which are more\ncongenial to organized labor. The ultimate result of this development may be\nto lessen greatly the currently strong and widespread anti-union sentiment in\nthese areas, but there is no assurance that this will be the case. A trend toward\nwide decentralization of industry in the not too distant future is a definite\npossibility. By shifting industry toward the smaller communities, such a\ndevelopment would increase substantially the organizational problems of the\nunions. These few examples of possible future developments suffice to indicate\nthe fallacy of assuming that future structural changes will benefit, or will not\nbe detrimental, to organized labor. It is possible, and in the writer's opinion\nprobable, that they will create a continuously less favorable environment for\nthe unions. In any case, conclusions concerning the future growth of the\nAmerican labor movement based upon an analysis which does not include con-\nsideration of this important factor do not warrant a high degree of confidence.\n\nIn drawing upon historical evidence to support his contention that unionism\n\"will suffer little or no loss in bad times\" the author fails to consider the fact\nthat, in comparison with past decades, a very much higher percentage of union\nmembers are now concentrated in those very industries which are most subject\nto cyclical decline. In 1950, the United Automobile Workers, Steelworkers,\nand Machinists alone comprised nearly 20 per cent of the total of organized\nlabor, and these same three unions were responsible for over one-third of the\ntotal increases in membership which occurred from 1948 to 1953.* Also at pres-\nent a much higher percentage of total membership is made up of workers in the\nunskilled and semiskilled groups than was true during most of the period under\nstudy by Bernstein. These workers are not as likely as skilled workers to retain\ntheir membership during periods of layoff. It seems reasonably certain, there-\nfore, that a major decline in the level of business activity would substantially\nreduce union membership. Even the relatively mild and short-lived recession of\n\n1949 reduced union membership by 200,000.\n\n*Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Directory of Labor Unions in the United States,\n1949; BLS, Directory of Labor Unions in the United States, 1953.\n", "388\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "2": ["The writer does not contend that Bernstein's inferences with respect to the\nfuture growth of organized labor are necessarily incorrect, but in the absence\nof more adequate analysis than that presented in this study he finds it difficult\nto accept them with the same degree of confidence as Bernstein. It is quite\npossible that certain weaknesses in Bernstein's analysis may have misled\nhim into an overoptimistic appraisal.\n\nIn his analysis of the growth of the American labor movement Bernstein\nwas concerned entirely with the determinants of the long-run trend and failed\nto consider the special circumstances which may have conditioned the growth\nduring particular periods. This was especially unfortunate with respect to the\nperiod 1933 to 1946, since the highly favorable environment making possible\nthe phenomenal growth of organized labor during these years is unlikely to\nexist again in the future. By 1933 the stage was set for a great union advance.\nPopulation growth and industrialization had created a pool of millions of\nindustrial workers, largely concentrated in the urban centers, and for reasons\nthat are well known these workers were almost entirely unorganized in 1933.\nThus a tremendous potential existed at the beginning of this period. Within\nthe climate of opinion toward group action created by the psychological impact\nof the depression, industrial unionism and the protection of a benevolent gov-\nernment provided the immediate stimuli for union growth. As a result, millions\nof workers flocked into the unions. The industrial expansion during the second\nworld war created additional millions of jobs in those industries which lend\nthemselves readily to organization, or which were already highly organized,\nthus providing further impetus to the union movement. In the postwar period,\nhowever, the labor movement has lost its momentum. Those segments of the\nlabor force most susceptible to organization had by 1946 been fairly well\nexploited, and the postwar campaigns to penetrate those areas and those labor\ngroups less amenable to unionization have met with only very limited success.\n\nThe great expansion of employment in the construction industry and in\nother industries which lend themselves readily to organization has made possi-\nble continued growth in the postwar period; however, since the membership\nincreases have been concentrated primarily in these industries, the over-all\nincrease has not been impressive. According to the estimates of the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics, membership in labor organizations rose from 15 million to\nbetween 1614 and 17 million, an increase of only two million or less, during\nthe period 1946-53.? During this same period employment in nonagricultural\nindustries increased by 8.5 millions. This experience is in sharp contrast to the\nwar years (1940 to 1945) when organized labor drew 5.9 million additional\nmembers into its ranks while employment in nonagricultural industries rose by\nonly 6.2 millions?

It is a sequel to an earlier\nstudy! which set forth the theory of the offset factor and applied it to\nan interpretation of the relation of time losses from labor disputes to\nthe production of bituminous coal for the eighteen years 1933-1950.\n\nGiven a dispute limited to a portion of a multifirm industry with a\ncommon market and a margin of unused capacity outside the area of\nthe dispute, the impact upon production might be totally and immedi-\nately neutralized by simple shifting of orders from firms concerned in\nthe dispute to those which are not so involved. This is the offset factor\nin its current-transfer form. An empirical test showed that in bituminous\ncoal mining after 1939, the growth of unionism and the shrinkage in\nunemployment brought a weakening in the power of current-transfer\nto cushion the impact of labor disputes upon the production of coal.\n\nAs the power of current-transfer is restricted, however, that of the\ntime-shift form of the offset may become greatly augmented. Even if\ndisputes encompass an entire industry so that current-transfer dis-\nappears, there may still be possibilities of great expansion in output\nbefore a dispute begins, and reclamation after the event: the anticipa-\ntory and retroactive features of the time-shift form of the offset factor.\nThe record for 1942-50 showed that the offset factor had been in effec-\ntive operation especially in the form of anticipatory time-shift.
