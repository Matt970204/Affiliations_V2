Then we could put the\nseparate theories together and have a more satisfactory treatment of fiscal\neconomics than we presently have. A theory of debt management and a theory\nof transfer payments would also be necessary to take care of Buchanan's\ncomplaint, because the proceeds of any given tax may be used to retire gov-\nernment debt or to pay pensions.\n\nThe second answer is that it is impossible to determine what is done with\nthe proceeds of any given tax under modern monetary institutions. The dollars\na given tax raises go into a cash balance, which is augmented by the proceeds\nof other taxes, bond sales, and the sale of government-provided goods and\nservices. From this cash balance the government spends and thus acquires\ngoods and services, it retires debt, and it makes transfer payments. If\nBuchanan means that the analysis of a given tax should encompass an analysis\nof every possible use that may be made of tax dollars, he is asking for a\ncompletely integrated theory of fiscal economics, the formulation of which\nmust transcend the separate examination of distinct fiscal acts and of taxes\nas such.\n\nFor the time being I choose to concentrate on taxes alone, and on excise,\ncorporate, and property taxes in particular. This choice rests on the feeling\nthat each tax exerts effects which are peculiar to the given tax, and that these\neffects are important. Moreover, I feel that the effects of any given tax are\nindependent of what is done with the proceeds of that given tax.\n\nlf taxes do exert effects peculiar to themselves and independently of what\nis done with the tax proceeds, then it is methodologically legitimate to ignore\n(or abstract from) \"what is done with the money,\" even if we know in fact\nwhat is done with the specific dollars raised by a particular tax, which we do\nnot. \"These effects of taxes are a consequence of shifting their money burden\n(a tax's \"income effect\") and the ramifications of that shifting process\nthroughout the price system. The shifting process is complex. It merits\nintensive analysis. It is difficult\u2014for most of us at any rate\u2014to treat such a\ncomplex process and simultaneously develop theories of government spending,\ndebt management, and transfer payments.\n\nBuchanan states that: *The net effect of the fiscal action on the net yield\nof capital is held to be determined primarily by the productivity of the state's\nusage of the funds relative to the alternative productivity of these funds in\nprivate employments in the absence of the tax.\" This is Einaudi's argument.\n(1f the adverb \"primarily\" is taken seriously, the statement really means that\ntaxes are relatively unimportant\u2014it is what the government does with the\nmoney that is vital.

Frankly, I had never con-\nsSidered these as likely consequences of personal income taxes (and transfer\npayments).

It was the earnings of things,\nspecifically the agencies for which it is meaningful to keep capital accounts,\nand the behavior of people toward things with which my analysis dealt. If\nthe distinction between the earnings of things and the personal income of\nprivate individuals is relevant, and the logic and justification for capital\naccounting rests on this distinction, then it seems appropriate to hold that any\nforce which reduces asset earnings will lower the capitalization rate even\nthough the disposable income of private individuals somehow remains un-\nchanged\u2014provided, of course, we accept a productivity\" theory of capitaliza-\ntion rate determination.\n\nNevertheless it may be possible that a reduction of personal income taxes\n(and an increase of transfer payments) in combination with the imposition\nof a general excise tax will have the effect on asset earnings and the capital-\nization rate which Buchanan asserts. I would not be dogmatic about the point.\nIf Buchanan should be correct, then all I can say is that I made an unhappy\nchoice of a *compensating variation\"; and that Buchanan's interpretation of\nthe particular combination of fiscal acts I used may be a better one than mine.\nHowever, had I used some other *compensating variation\"\u2014like the reduction\nof a hypothetical poll tax\u2014to by-pass the deflationary impact of excise taxes,\nmy analysis of the capitalization effects of excise taxes would have been the\nsame. But had I done so, Buchanan no doubt would have \"demonstrated\"\nthat my \"neutral\" poll tax was not neutral after all.\n\nYet it is not clear that Buchanan himself really believes that personal in-\ncome taxes (and transfer payments) directly affect the capitalization rate and\nasset earnings relevant for individual behavior toward assets. Rather, his\nassertions about this substantive issue seem to be his way of *demonstrating\"\nthe superiority of his methodology of tax analysis over mine. The main point\nof his remarks is that it is improper to consider the effects of a given tax as\nsuch independently of an examination of the effects of offsetting government\ndisbursements, including changes in other taxes. The tax analyst must take\naccount of what is done with the proceeds of the given tax he examines.

Accord-\ning to this model, the national income must always grow at a rate that\nHarrod calls the \"warranted\" rate.

In\nhis explanation of this instability, Harrod is forced to depart from his\noriginal model and consider the role of producers! expectations and the\npossibility of unintended investment.\n\nProducers! expectations modify the analysis in two ways: (1) the\nquantity of goods produced for either consumption or investment pur-\nposes does not depend upon the realized level of current income, but\nrather upon the level of income that is expected when the production\nplans are formulated; (2) there will be unintended investment if pro-\nducers' expectations about the level of current income are not realized.\nIt is then reasonable to assume, with Harrod, that producers will seek\nto compensate for this unintended investment in later periods.

The first\nconcerns the nature of the handicap which interrelatedness imposes on an\neconomy. The second involves the causes of the apparent backwardness of\ncertain British industries. Let us take up these points in turn.\n\nIt is Gordon's position that \"sunk costs,\" even accompanied by interre-\nlatedness, cannot be considered a handicap. He contends that if the older\neconomy (A) did replace its obsolete capital, it would be on the same footing\nwith the younger economy (B). Since it chooses not to replace on rational\ngrounds, i.e. since it prefers its present situation, obsolete capital and all,\nthat choice may indicate an advantage over B. Relatedly, the persistence of\ntechnically obsolete equipment may be required by economic efficiency. Where\nthis is so, such equipment must be regarded as an advantage, not a liability.\n\nSidestepping for the moment the question of the significance of interrelated-\nness, these contentions are correct. Indeed, my article says nothing to the\ncontrary. Directly or by implication it recognizes the same points,! and these\npoints are entirely consistent with the main propositions developed in the\narticle.\n\nA restatement of a part of my argument in somewhat di\u00edferent form may\nclear up the trouble. Consider two economies, A and B, identical in all\nrespects but one. A has some rather ancient plant and equipment in use,\nwhile B has no capital stock at all. Is A better off or worse off because of this\ncircumstance? Ordinarily, some equipment, even old equipment, is better than\nnone. Moreover, with technological change A has open to it an alternative\ndenied to B: It can continue with its old equipment, or any portion of it, if\ncost analysis indicates that solution to be the economic one.

They are implicit in the development in Part I on innovation\ncriteria.

It is clear that in investigations of the pro-\nductivity problems of this industry the issue has usually not been explicitly\nraised, and in some cases, the opposite has been assumed.!? In a world where,\non the one hand, the low-wage countries such as India and Japan are\ndominating the export market in cotton textiles, and where, on the other\nhand, the British shipbuilding industry, for example, is losing orders due to\nlack of facilities and long delivery dates, to give official encouragement to\nthe investment of scarce capital resources in the cotton textile industry may\nrequire some second thoughts. Correct policy in these matters is dependent\nupon correct answers to the issues that Frankel has raised.\nDowarp F. GonpoN*\n\n?!

Just\nas the existence of obsolete equipment in a particular industry may indicate\nan advantage for a region as a whole, so the high-wage difficulties of the\nBritish cotton textile industry indicate the same. In both cases the resources\nhave more productive alternative opportunities.!*\n\nIn the belief that difficulties are caused by obsolete sunk capital due to,\nor together with lack of entrepreneurship, much capital equipment may be\ninvested in faltering industries. There is some evidence that such waste has\nbeen encouraged by official policy toward the British cotton textile industry\nfor example.\" If, instead, the difficulties are the result of a variety of en-\nvironmental factors, wiser policy would dictate a shift of capital and labor\n\n?5 To speak of cotton textiles as a single industry vastly oversimplifies the picture. For\nhigher quality cotton products the situation may be different. But for the greatest part of\nthe 7 billion square yards of cloth that Britain exported in 1913 (out of an output of\n8 billion) her advantage was bound to disappear. Tari\u00ed\u00eds have been another external\nfactor. I am interpreting \"environmental\" as including the configuration of world markets\nand supplies over which a particular region has no control.\n\n\"There is ample evidence that the British cotton textile industry has kept informed\nof technical progress elsewhere. The United States Productivity Team Report on The\nBritish Cotton Industry (London, 1952) concludes: \"Three weeks of mill visits and inter-\nviews convinced us that the cotton industry in Lancashire lacked no technical information\nthat would increase productivity. Reading the reports by, and talking with members of,\nthe British missions which had visited the U. S., India, Japan, Sweden, Italy, and the\nmachinery fairs on the Continent proved to us that they had the world's technical informa-\ntion at hand. Our visit to the Shirley Institute (British Cotton Industry Research Asso-\nciation) showed us that it was equipped to undertake to solve any technical problem\nreferred to it by members of the industry\" (p. 8). The fact that an industry suftering\nfrom a Veblen-type backwardness in mental habits would probably not know or care for\nforeign missions or research institutes suggests that something further may be at stake\nwhen technical information is not applied. While advocating re-equipment the Team\ndid find that: *Hypothetical cases based on assumptions as to rates of depreciation for\nnew Lancashire looms at present-day replacement costs and new automatic looms com-\npared with partially or fully written off Lancashire looms always seemed to come out on\nthe side of retaining the old\" (p. 26).\n\nMoreover, it is not sufficient to show that with best practice there is a margin of profit\navailable for innovation. Management everywhere requires a substantial margin for un-\ncertainties, etc., before making new investments, and in any industry with a large number\nof firms, \"best practice\" by definition will not be attained by all. What must be shown\nis that, faced with roughly the same margin of profitability, the British cotton industry\nhas failed to innovate where another (British or foreign) industry has done so. There is\nno evidence in the Productivity Report that such is the case.\n\n\"The complexity of the cotton textile industry makes it difficult to say with certainty\nthat such is the case. Britain may still have a comparative advantage in exporting particu-\nlar cotton specialties. On the other hand, it may be significant that appeals to the industry\nhave been couched in terms of national rather than individual profitability. In the absence\nof a compensating divergence between marginal private and marginal social profitability\nthis would indicate waste. It is true that the fixed price of foreign exchange probably\nunderstates its social value, but this would not indicate the desirability of investment\nin cotton textiles as opposed to other export industries.\n\nIt may, therefore, be just as well that the price system apparently has been stronger\nthan such exhortations. New capital does not appear to have been invested in the industry\nto the extent of the government's wishes, and management has complained of the \"short-\nage\" of labor due to the attractiveness of other industries. Cf. The British Cotton Industry,\npassim.\n", "651\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "5": ["less wealth, no depreciation reserves, and less-developed financial institu-\ntions.'^ It should also be remembered that whatever general difficulties can\nbe imagined in the integrating of old facilities, there are endless examples of\nsuch integrations being effected in mature industrialized economies, with or\nwithout the assistance of financial markets.\n\nBy way of conclusion, I should like to suggest that a sufficient explanation\nfor the particular case Frankel wishes to explain may be found in the en-\nvironmental factors\u2014relative natural resources, and the position of the\neconomy in the external matket.!' To begin with, to some extent the \"stagna-\ntion\" of the British economy is an appearance created by comparisons with\nGermany and the United States. Once the industrial techniques had spread\nit was inevitable that the growth of economies with larger populations and/or\nraw material bases would create the illusion that the originally industrialized\ncountry was stagnating.'?\n\nWhile it is no doubt true that particular industries in Britain have actually\nexperienced a decline, the explanation will be found in all probability in the\nenvironmental reasons rather than in the facts of interrelatedness, techno-\nlogical or institutional.'? In the British coal industry, for example, the rela-\ntive lack of rich resources is obviously a fundamental handicap.'* In cotton\ntextiles, the situation is only slightly more complicated. The comparative ad-\nvantage given this British industry during the first half of the nineteenth\ncentury was essentially transient. As Britain entered the upward spiral of\nmore saving, more capital, more income and more saving, she became, for-\ntunately of course, a high-wage economy. But as it turned out, when the\ntechniques had spread, the nature of this industry gave low-wage countries\na comparative advantage. Even in low-income societies there is a large\ndomestic market for textiles. With small capital requirements and little\nskilled labor needed one would hardly expect cotton textiles to be an industry\n\n?' Of course, it could be argued that the gains in a more primitive economy being greater,\nthe risks are less and the capital less hesitant. But this being true for a particular industry\nonly indicates A's over-all advantage, since the same capital resources, as mentioned above,\ncan be devoted to other industries.\n\n\"' Frankel, I am sure, would not deny the significance of the environmental factor as\na partial explanation of the British case, although I presume he would object to my\nsuggestion that it is suificient. In this note it can be no more than a suggestion.\n\n?Tt should be unnecessary to point out that German per capita output has not as\nyet surpassed that of Britain despite a resource picture which, if anything, favors the\nformer. In the United States the resource pattern is enormously superior, and we do not\nhave any evidence that over-all per capita output has not been superior since colonial\ntimes,\n\n5 | am fully conscious that the paragraph that follows in the text is no adequate substi-\ntute for serious industry analyses.\n\n^ [ronically, the British themselves seem to believe that dif\u00fcculties in coal stem, at least\nin part, from ine\u00edficiency. Thus it seems to be agreed between the two major parties\nthat nationalization was necessary because the industry was \"inefficient.\" In this, Labour\nprobably claimed too little while the Conservative Party granted too much. \"Inefficiency\"\nas it happens to strike particular industries constitutes a bad argument in favor of a\ngeneral theory of socialization or private enterprise. Surely the fact that this \"inefficiency^\nstruck a signi\u00fccant majority of all coal mines, while it appears to leave unscathed the\nmajority, say, of chemical plants, suggests that something more profound is at work.\n", "650\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "4": ["? [bid., p. 310.\n", "aspects of the industry's technology on the other. Thus the labor skills,\nmanagerial know-how and administrative organization may be adjusted to\nthe old equipment and difficult to change.\n\nA particularly acute form of this blending occurs where the different com-\nponents of an interrelated process have separate owners. In these circum-\nstances, faced with an innovation in one component, the firms have three\nalternatives. They may (1) remain separate but through price adjustments\nbe induced to switch over their equipment; (2) one firm (not necessarily\nthe owner of the obsolete component) may buy out or compete with his\nprevious customers and suppliers; or (3) they may do nothing. Frankel\nsuggests that the first may not occur because the gains must be great to be\nspread, while the risks devolve upon the innovator alone. The second will\nnot usually occur because the potential integrator may be handicapped by\nlack of knowledge, uncertainty, lack of financing or pre-emption of the field\nby others. So Frankel concludes that *not least likely\" is the third case. Since\nthe innovation \"would require solution of problems external to the firm, the\nfirm might justifiably disregard it, just as it disregards all those events to\nwhich it has no power to adjust.\"?\n\nBut the question is not whether in actual fact, with interrelatedness or\nwithout it, innovation is performed by errorless mechanical maximizers in an\neconomy with perfect flexibility of prices and fluidity of labor and capital.\nBy comparison with such models any actual economy operates with institu-\ntional rigidities and want of enterprise. Again, as in the case of sunk costs,\nthe fact that it is easy to imagine a better situation constitutes no valid\nargument for the view that an economy is handicapped. Because Frankel\ndiscusses the diffculties of the mature industrialized economy alone, he\nsuggests this irrelevant comparison. The real question is whether the mature\nindustrial economy is handicapped by comparison with others. Are the insti-\ntutional rigidities that obstruct economic adjustments more effective in a\nmature industrial economy than they would have been if it had continued\nin its previous state? More important, are they more effective than in its\npre-industrial neighbor?\n\nOnce the question is put in this perspective it is probably obvious that\nthe industrialized economy has a substantial institutional advantage. Con-\nsider the older industrialized region A with obsolete plants and patterns of\nownership, and with labor and management resistant like most humans to\ndisturbing changes. But on the other hand, region B perhaps has a largely\npeasant economy with handicraft manufactures controlled by mercantile\ninterests. In these circumstances interrelatedness, particularly that between\nhabits of thought and techniques, is likely to be a much more powerful\nhandicap to innovation in B. Again, A's innovators (perhaps in old estab-\nlished firms) may have difficulty getting sufficient liquid capital from depre-\nciation reserves, or overcoming the doubts of the controllers of the financial\ninstitutions that mobilize the wealth produced by A's early industrialization.\nHowever, surely capital-raising is far more difficult in pre-industrial B with\n", "649\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["may be worse off than it had been before region B industrialized. If the in-\ndustry in region A previously had markets in A, B, and other areas to itself,\nthen the new competition may lower prices, incomes and capital values. The\nregion may lose some of the advantages that it had expected would continue\nand its income may fall to a lower level. But this does not constitute a burden\ndue to earlier industrialization or due to the existence of the obsolete equip-\nment. For had the earlier industrialization not taken place, and were the\nobsolete equipment not in existence, the existing level of real income would\nbe lower still. The burden is the new competitive situation and its causes,\nenvironmental or institutional. Rather than inquire as to why the new com-\npetitive situation has arisen, why the industry originally domiciled in A is\nnow growing in B, and why, therefore, the industry in A has fallen on leaner\ndays, superficial observers may point to the obsolete capital equipment as the\ncause. It is the effect of the difficulty, not the cause.\"\n\nBefore departing from these assumptions, one particular case should be\nindicated in which it would be legitimate to say that a region has suffered\nfrom an early industrial start, and that this hardship is due to interrelated-\nness. As Frankel has thoroughly demonstrated, interrelatedness increases the\nlikely rate of obsolescence. Suppose in a particular case the increased cost due\nto this increased obsolescence was not foreseen at the time the investment\nwas made. Suppose, secondly, that the investment was close enough to the\nmargin of profitability so that, had this increased obsolescence due to inter-\nrelatedness been foreseen, it would have lowered the expected rate of return\nbelow the critical level and caused the investment plans to be abandoned.\nSince in fact this increased obsolescence was not foreseen the investment has\nturned out to be uneconomic. The early industrialization was a handicap in\nthe sense that it wasted capital resources a\u00a3 that time. It is still true that the\nmere existence of the inefficient interrelated equipment at the present time is\nnot a current handicap compared to any other region. Of course, all this is\nonly a logical possibility. In the case of Britain surely the major part of the\ncritical investment during its industrialization was economic despite all sub-\nsequent obsolescence, and this conclusion is strengthened when we consider\nonly the increased obsolescence due to interrelatedness.*\n\nThe second part of Frankel's argument requires that we change our as-\nsumptions. We revert back therefore to the realistic world from the assumption\nof absolute management efficiency. Frankel's argument is that interrelatedness\nmay exist not only among the physical components of the productive process,\nbut also between these physical components on the one hand, and institutional\n\n' By abstracting from new entry in the old region Frankel avoids the really significant\nquestion as to why the old firms have to meet competition from new firms in the foreign\nregion only.\n\n* Except in the highly unlikely case suggested in this paragraph, Frankel's conclusion\nthat interrelatedness \"under usual conditions can have distorting influences upon costs,\nprices, competitive strength, income distribution and future rates of growth . . .\" which\nconstitute a. \"real penalty . . . for . . . early industrial leadership,\" is highly misleading\nas to the true nature of the cost of obsolescence. It would be more accurate to say that\nlike all components of investment cost\u2014like the original labor cost, say, of the equipment\u2014\nobsolescence affects, not distorts, these variables.\n", "648\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "2": ["reconciliation Frankel finds in the concept of *interrelatedness.\"* This note\nwill attempt first to show that, although interrelatedness is a real and perhaps\nhitherto unduly neglected aspect of the capital equipment problem, it cannot\nbe validly used to prove the penalties of early industrial leadership. Secondly,\nit will suggest the sufficiency of alternative explanation for the phenomenon\nFrankel seeks to explain through interrelatedness.\n\nTo show that \"sunk costs\" even accompanied by interrelatedness cannot be\nconsidered a handicap, let us imagine an old industrialized region, A, along\nwith another region, B, in the very process of industrializing with more\nmodern equipment. To abstract from other effects, let us further imagine\nthat the old, interrelated and technically obsolete industry in region A is con-\ntrolled by an ideally efficient management, and that there are no divergences\nbetween social and private profitability. Now also assume that A's industry\nis obsolete in the sense that if it were to be built today it would be built\ndifferently, but has some economic value since the improvements have not\nbeen sufficient to make it worthwhile to replace. Since if A did replace,\nA and B would clearly be on the same footing, the fact that in our case A\ncould renovate and yet chooses not to on rational grounds, is indicative of her\nrelative advantage. This conclusion follows regardless of interrelatedness.*\n\nSuperficially region A may appear to be in a bad way. If the innovation is\nlabor-saving then output per man-hour in this industry will be less than in\nregion B, and hasty observers of this statistic (for one industry) may be\nexpected to view with alarm. But this obsolete equipment cannot itself be a\nhandicap save in the trivial sense that it would be better if it could be re-\nplaced at no capital cost. For while the industry in A has higher labor costs,\nit has lower capital costs. The capital goods industry which in B is equipping\nthe new industry is available in A for adding equipment (and increasing labor\nproductivity) in other industries. Paradoxical though it may appear, under\nour present assumptions the persistence of the technically obsolete equipment\nwith its lower labor productivity (in that industry) is required by economic\nefficiency and may indicate relative economic advantage.

On a number of occasions the railroads have attempted to eliminate\nthis overtime provision of the guarantee, but their attempts were futile.\n\nUnterberger's contention that these guarantees are necessary to maintain\na sufficient supply of labor is an interesting one, but I fail to find, in any of\nwage and rules negotiations of the last 35 years, where the railroads have\npleaded to maintain these guarantees or to increase the guarantees. The\nrailroads have attempted in a number of cases, however, to modify these\nguarantees in order to make them less costly. But should the railroads be\nconcerned about incentives to maintain their supply of labor? In 1918 road\nservice employment reached a peak of over 225,000, and then declined to a\nlow of 127,700 in 1933, the depth of the great depression. By 1944 employ-\nment of road service workers reached its wartime peak of 185,300, which\nwas significantly less than in 1918. And by 1955 employment dropped to\n125,600, a decline of 38 per cent. Is it surprising that the railroads are not\nconcerned about wage guarantees to maintain their labor supply?\n\nUnterberger's point concerning the dif\u00fcculties of getting employees to ac-\ncept promotions from the junior to the senior cra\u00edts fails to impress me. The\nexistence of a compulsory promotion rule does not show that wage guarantees\nare necessary; if anything, it shows that there are some serious defects in the\nbasic wage structure of the industry. I iully subscribe to the findings by an\nEmergency Board that \"It should be possible to revise the rate structure\nto increase daily and annual earnings of the employees and yet reduce labor\ncosts per ton mile and per passenger mile. .. . The Board has concluded that\nthere is imperative need in this industry, and specifically in the operating\nclassifications, for a thorough-going review and modernization of the internal\nwage structure. Indeed, such a review and rationalization is long overdue.'?\n\nIn his comment Unterberger has overlooked a number of significant aspects\nof the wage guarantees in the railroad industry. First, he has overlooked the\nfact that unlike most other industries, the railroads are generally precluded\nfrom eliminating the situations that result in the payment of these guarantees.\n'That is, there is practically no way for the railroad to *beat the system\" and\nnot pay the extra compensation called for by the guarantees. Secondly, he\nomits completely the value of leisure time from his conjecture on the amount\nof earnings necessary to xeep a railroad worker on the job. And thirdly, he\ndisregards the monthly mileage limitation rules, which have the most direct\nbearing on road service employees' earnings and which are specifically geared\nto maintain a supply of labor sufficient to meet the general need of the rail-\nroads.\n", "662\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "3": ["8 hours for which the guarantee does not come into play because the em-\nployees earned a basic day's pay through mileage run? The employees on\nthe 18-mile run between Boston and Waltham and return would earn 14\nhour pay less, but they would be relieved from duty in 774 hours at their\nhome terminal, whereas the other employees would be relieved from duty\nin 8 hours at a foreign terminal. Both trips have advantages and the choice\nis a purely personal one, not based on some one's preconceived criteria\nas to what determines more desirable work.\n\nLet us assume, for the moment, that Unterberger's assertion that the runs\non which the basic daily rate guarantee is paid involve the least desirable\nwork because of the low earnings opportunities. Is a wage guarantee the\nanswer, or is the answer to make the earnings opportunities greater? As\ndiscussed in my article the creation of interdivisional runs would unquestion-\nably permit employees to earn more than the basic daily rate, but the rail-\nroads are not free to establish such runs. The unions have opposed the crea-\ntion of such interdivisional runs because such runs would relieve some crews\nfrom employment. Are these crews the ones that Unterberger is concerned\nwith when he pleads that the guarantees are necessary to maintain a sufficient\nsupply of labor?\n\nThe guarantee of a daily earnings minimum is applicable to employees\nin passenger service when their earnings are less than a certain level above\nthe basic daily rate. But a passenger service assignment may be far from\nundesirable as compared with a higher paying freight service assignment.\nThe basic day for a passenger service engineer is 100 miles or less, 5 hours\nor less, while for a freight service engineer it is 100 miles or less, 8 hours or\nless. Is a 90-mile passenger run, completed in, say, three hours, less desirable\nthan a 90-mile freight run completed in, say, seven hours? Without any of\nthe guarantees there would be about $1.75 differential in earnings in favor\nof the freight service employees, but a four-hour differential in leisure in\nfavor of the passenger service employees. Imposing the guarantee of the\nbasic day's pay widens the differential to about $1.90. If on top of this is\nimposed the guarantee of the daily earnings minimum, the differential is cut\nto about $1.40. Is not four hours more work by the freight engineer worth\nat least $1.90? Or put another way, is not four extra hours of leisure by the\npassenger engineer worth at least $1.90? The choice is a personal one, but\nit would not be unreasonable to contend that the elasticity of demand for\nincome in terms of effort is likely to be less for older workers with high\nseniority than for younger workers with low seniority.\n\nThe guarantee of monthly earnings is applicable to conductors and brake-\nmen on regularly assigned runs in passenger and local freight service and\nthe rule comes into play when monthly earnings minus overtime earnings\nare less than the guarantee. Two factors should be noted. First, by no stretch\nof the imagination can one consider regularly assigned runs in any service,\npassenger or freight, less desirable than the unassigned runs which are most\nirregular in earnings, hours, days and place of rest. And these unassigned\nruns are a significant proportion of all runs. Secondly, if the guarantee were\n", "661\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "2": ["full employment, the railroads have made attempts to modify these wage\nguarantees, indicating that they do not believe these guarantees necessary to\nobtain a sufficient supply of labor. In addition, there has been a significant\ndownward trend in the employment of road service employees since the second\nworld war, which indicates a surplus of labor and the lack of need to be\nconcerned about a sufficient labor supply.\n\nLet us next examine the evidence Unterberger offers that the guarantees\nare necessary to obtain a sufficient supply of labor. He states that the assign-\nments on which the guarantees are paid generally involve the least desirable\nwork, and usually offer the lowest earnings opportunities or the most onerous\nworking conditions. Also, because of the undesirability of these assignments\nthey go to employees with the least seniority in the job classification. From\nthese two assertions he draws the conclusion that the guarantees are necessary\nto maintain a sufficient supply of labor.\n\nI beg to differ with both assertions. There is no rigid pattern of promotional\nline from one type of service to another. One finds top seniority men in all\nbranches of train and engine service. Some employees prefer foregoing the\nmore lucrative road service assignments in order to take a yard service job,\nwhich has the advantage of giving the worker a regularly scheduled eight-hour\nday with the opportunity of being home every night. Other employees forego\nthe glamour and ease of a passenger train assignment in order to take a local\nfreight assignment where the hours are exceptionally long but the average earn-\nings are higher than in any other branch of service. And still others forego\nthe regularity of yard service and the high earnings of local freight service\nin order to take a passenger train assignment, where the earnings are less\nthan in local freight service but the hours of work are relatively short.\nWhereas the promotional line is generally considered to be from yard service\nto local freight, to through freight, to passenger service, there are numerous\nexceptions. And one should bear in mind that the lowest step in the promo-\ntional ladder is the \"extra board\" where the engineers, firemen, conductors\nand brakemen work on a first-in, first-out rotational system for all types of\nunscheduled and extra runs.\n\nIn my article (p. 854) I listed eight different runs of less than 100 miles\nthat are completed in less than 8 hours for which the employees receive a\nbasic day's pay as a result of the guarantee of the basic daily rate. Do these\nnecessarily involve the least desirable work? Not necessarily, since they may\nhave advantages over other runs that pay no guarantee. Let us take, for\nexample, the 18-mile run from Boston to Waltham and return, assuming that\nthe time consumed is 714 hours, which means that under the guarantee of the\nbasic daily rate the employees are paid for eight hours. Is this run less pref-\nerable, without the guarantee, than a one-way run of 100 miles consuming\n\n' Carriers Exhibit Nos. 21, 22, 29, and 30, presented to the arbitration board in the\n1954 Engineers 3096 Wage Case, clearly show that the choice of service by the top\nseniority is a purely personal one. More top seniority men select passenger service runs,\nbut there are numerous other top seniority men who select yard service and local freight\nruns.

The issue came to the\nfore again in the revival of the customs union controversy a\u00edter the\nwar.' It goes deep and affects some fundamental tenets of tariff theory\nand the theory of value itself. The purpose of the present paper is to\nattempt a reconciliation between those who advocate a lowering of\ntarif\u00ed barriers between complementary economies and those who want\nto facilitate trade between competitive economies.\n\nSince the issue is whether a removal of trade barriers is more bene-\nficial if the freed trade is complementary or competitive, it is neces-\nsary to start with a definition of what is meant by complementary and\ncompetitive goods. In this paper Abba Lerner's definition of comple-\nmentarity will be accepted: 'Complementarities can be positive . . .\nwhere the possession or consumption of one good enhances the satis-\nfaction yielded by another, or negative, where the possession or con-\nsumption of one good is a substitute for another good and diminishes\nthe additional satisfaction it can provide.\"?\n\nIn this sense all goods are complementary to one another, but their\ncomplementarity can be either positive or negative. Where their com-\nplementarity is negative, the goods are substitutes or rival or competi-\ntive goods. Below, complementarity will mean positive complemen-\ntarity, unless specially stated. Goods of negative complementarity will\nbe called competitive goods.\n\nApplied to trade, this definition means that trade will increase satis-\nfaction if it is an exchange of goods whereby each party to the trans-\naction acquires a more complementary assortment of goods in place\nof a more competitive assortment of goods.

The issues raised cannot be fairly discussed, or the treat-\nment fairly summarized; both works are hard to describe or classify. Mr.\nLamont is a philosopher (University of Glasgow) but his book lies rather in\nthe field of psychology, economic psychology. That of Professor Glansdorff\n(Free University of Brussels) is emphatically psychological, to begin with,\nrather on the physiological side. Neither work contains any reference to\npsychoanalysis. In professional psychology there are, of course, many schools\nof thought and method, and the tendency in other fields is for everyone to\nbe his own psychologist\u2014notably in economics. Moreover, value theory is\ndisputed territory, between psychology and philosophy, the latter perhaps\nhaving the prior claim.\n\nFirst as to general coverage. The field of values traditionally includes the\nthree main types or species, \"truth, beauty and goodness,\" a division which\ncannot be critically considered here. Lamont says nothing explicitly about\ntruth or objectivity in general. He disposes of esthetics in three pages (14-18)\nin his introduction, with a few observations at other points. Glansdorff says\nsummarily that truth is not a value (pp. 100 ff.), giving reasons which seem\nto me inadequate as well as vague. As suggested by his title, he devotes one\nof three main divisions of his work (a brief 38 pages, 117-155) to Value in\nEsthetics. The main content of both books is an overhauling of economic\npsychology or, with Glansdorff, more broadly, psychological causality in\neconomics. Lamont's view of morals will be noticed later; Glansdorff explic-\nitly omits consideration of this field, *in order to finish the present work\"\n(Introduction, ie, Avertissement, p. 14 admitting that \"application\" to\nmorals is strongly called for, and promising this in a later work (in his final\nsentence). Lamont mentions (p. 296) an earlier book of his on Principles of\nMoral Judgment (which I have not read). At this point I may regretfully\nsay that I cannot place either of these books on a list of *must's\" for Ameri-\ncan economists. Where the fault lies must of course be judged by the reader,\n\nin the light of such reasons as I can give\u2014which may excuse a rather lengthy\nreview.\n\n* The author is Morton D.
