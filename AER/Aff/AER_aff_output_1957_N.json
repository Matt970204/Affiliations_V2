Tsiang,\n\"Liquidity Preference and Loanable Funds Theories, Multiplier and Velocity\nAnalyses: A Synthesis,\"' reopens a discussion which has never long been\nabsent from the journals since the publication of Keynes! General Theory.\nIt is unfortunate that, for twenty years, so much time and attention have\nhad to be devoted to the mere mechanics or logic of the relationship between\nliquidity preference and loanable funds forms of statement of interest theory,\nand with results that have frequently been to compound the confusion. Per-\nhaps because of this focus of the discussion too little attention has been\npaid to some real questions of substance raised by Keynes! contributions to\ninterest theory.\n\nNevertheless, a correct understanding of the relationship between the two\nforms of statement of interest theory does probably constitute an essential\nprerequisite to an intelligent discussion of substantive problems. Fortunately,\nTsiang has now shown clearly what is wrong with certain former attempts to\nreconcile the two methods of statement, and has, at least for one specific\nset of period-analysis assumptions, provided a clear reconciliation between\nthe two. It is only to be regretted that his analysis was not more general,\nthat it was not clear on the relationship between equilibrium and disequilib-\nrium (statics and dynamics), and that he did not consider what this author\nbelieves to be some of the more relevant questions of substance.\n\nMore specifically, we shall argue that: (1) Contrary to Tsiang's view,\nliquidity preference and loanable funds theories have different subject matter:\nthe former identifies an asset-holding equilibrium, the latter (unless it is a\nmere trivial rearrangement of the former) deals with what happens in\ndisequilibrium. (2) Tsiang's specific period assumptions cause him to miss the\ncrucial question for loanable funds analysis\u2014at base, an empirical one\u2014\nwhich relates to the speed of the hoarding or dishoarding flows which occur\nwhen stock equilibrium does not exist.

What he has to say concerns primarily the\nlast two pages of the article, or an implication of the main theme. Vet if\nthe earlier portion still survives\u2014and his remarks do not lead me to believe\notherwise\u2014the necessary modifications for shifts in the functions ought not\nbe hard to find, without departing substantially from the original text.\n\nJunk's basic criticism is that in the case of labor positively responsive to\nreal wages, a supply shift which increases equilibrium employment (as does\nhis S, curve) and a supply shift which decreases employment (his 5;) are\nboth invalid, i.e., inconsistent with the hypothesis of diminishing returns with\ngiven equipment in conditions of rising investment demand. Hence, he argues,\nthe equilibrium employment level must remain unchanged.\n\nI think this proves too much. While the S; curve, with its smaller equilib-\nrium employment can be eliminated as contrary to \"usual\" experience, with-\nout at the moment stopping to analyze it in more detail, the same is not true\nof S,. Conceptually, it is possible for reduced aggregate consumption to go\nalong with higher investment (measured in employment units), higher real\nwages, and higher employment. For example, moving up along the labor-\nsupply (or demand) curve involves higher money wages and higher prices.\nThus through the price rise the income shift from rentiers to profits can\ndiminish aggregate consumption; as I suggested in the earlier article (pp.\n844-45) this income shift was one of the factors tending to support the\nclassical version of the labor-demand curve. In the present case, with higher\ninvestment demand shifting the full labor-demand curve the ensuing income\ndistribution at the higher prices at each money wage is also adverse to the\nreal rentier position and favorable to profits. The cut-back in rentier con-\nsumption through \"forced-savings,\"* together with the higher interest rate?\nand the inroads of the corporate and personal income tax structure which\ncan block an offsetting rise in entrepreneurial consumption, will limit the\nsize of the price rise on consumption goods at each money wage; this thereby\nprovides a margin which helps maintain the real-wage position of labor at\n\n'I have made use of the concept of \"forced-savings\" in an article on \"The Micro-\n\nFoundations of Aggregate Demand and Supply,\" to appear in the Economic Journal.

The use of compulsion by a government to achieve\neconomic ends can usually be defined as involving a tax upon individuals,\nthough typically the relationship is not as obvious as in the case of forced\nloans.? A method of estimating the amount of tax in the case of Soviet forced\nloans will be indicated below.\n\nThe Soviet so-called *mass-subscription\" loans have been sold to workers\nand peasants at their places of work since 1927.* Payment is typically made\nin 10 equal monthly installments in the form of wage-withholdings.

In\ndoing so they will agree that such a model describes badly how markets\nreally work, but will often disagree as to its normative role.

Important among them\nis the credit-rationing doctrine. Briefly, this is the doctrine that central\nbank operations on the money market affect investment, not mainly\nthrough the cost of credit, but through its availability. When the central\nbank pushes up the yields of short-term government securities, banks\nand nonbank lenders will increase the share of short-term governments\nin their portfolios at the expense of other earning assets. This action\nreduces reserves for the banking system as a whole and causes further\nrestriction of loans to business borrowers. Conversely, when the\ncentral bank pushes down money-market rates, the decreased attractive-\nness of short-term yields, and the increase of reserves, will lead to in-\ncreased availability of loan funds at relatively unchanging cost. In\naddition, it is sometimes argued that banks and nonbank lenders\nconsider probable future movements of intermediate- and long-term\nsecurity prices. The fear of capital losses induced by a rising pattern of\ninterest rates may cause prospective bond purchasers to hold off until\nthey expect no further rise of rates.

Some aspects of product quality and\nselling effort are thought of as being nonquantitative. As far as selling\neffort is concerned, this difficulty traditionally has been overcome by\nusing not selling effort itself but selling-effort expenditure, which is\nalways quantitative, as the variable to be optimized. If this were a\nsatisfactory approach, it could obviously be used for nonquantitative\naspects of product quality, too. But it is not a satisfactory approach for\nselling effort any more than for product quality, for selling effort and\nproduct quality are both multidimensional. Moreover, from the point\nof view of demand, alternative dimensions may be substitutional. For\nexample, quantity sold might rise if the input of aluminum were to be\nsubstituted for the input of steel, or if television advertising were sub-\nstituted for magazine advertising.

In content, it is one of the most hopeful-looking of the long\nseries of policy proposals designed to meet J. M. Clark's celebrated difficulty\nthat labor cost, though an overhead for society, is a variable item for the\nindividual employer. In form, it suggests a widely adaptable linkage of\ncontrol instruments with market mechanisms.\n\nIt is very common to carry on economic-control operations by buying\nand selling on an existing market. But this is a proposal to create both the\nmarket and the commodity it is to deal in, so that the commodity itself\nbecomes an instrumentality of control.\n\nOnce we look at the proposal in this way, we can see that it represents a\nbroad class of control possibilities. Some of these are familiar as academic\nexamples, others as bits of economic history; but something is added when\nwe see them as a class.\n\nTo begin with academic examples, we often present in the classroom cases\nwhere use of market mechanisms might forestall the creation of certain\nSorts of vested interests. Grazing rights in the national forests, for example,\ntend to become vested, and to attach an extra element of value to property\nin ranches which have enjoyed such rights.

The main\nobjective would be to induce the public to buy cars that would use less of\nthe scarce, publicly owned resource which when used by one person is taken\nfrom others. A secondary objective would be an increased contribution to\nthe public treasury from those choosing vehicles that use more public prop-\nerty. To illustrate, assuming that length alone is the basis of graduation,\nthe annual fee might be $1 for each inch of length between 180 and 185\ninches, $3 per inch between 185 and 190 inches, up to, say, $10 per inch of\nlength exceeding 195 inches. Rates might well be less for cars already in\nexistence when the new system became effective. An effective date of 1960\nor thereabouts should give auto manufacturers time to plan for the transi-\ntion.\n\nIn some states auto value might also remain a consideration in setting\nthe fee because of ties to property taxation. However, since streets and\nhighways are now built to carry much heavier loads than the heaviest auto,\nweight is outmoded as a rational basis for graduating charges for passenger\nautos.\n\nTotal dimensions, however, are of great significance. Length and width\nare of concern not only to the owner but also to others who wish to use the\nsame joint facilities (streets), and to taxpayers who may be called upon to\nprovide facilities for which the demand depends partly upon size of vehicle.\nSome of the driving of almost every motorist is in areas where he uses a\nvery scarce resource, urban street space, for which no charge is feasible.\nEconomizing its use is very much in the public interest. With the motiva-\ntions now provided, however, individual actions do not combine to serve\nthe public interest to best advantage.

If restrictive policy were overdone, the fact would register it-\nself in a stiffening of the money-pump price, and in reports from business\nthat sales were not rising enough to validate the existing output-inventory\nposition. In this case, a downturn would be in the making. But, for the\nreasons just mentioned, there would be time to diagnose the situation and\nadapt monetary-fiscal policy to it before substantive damage was done.

Certainly I would not be willing to testify that it was sound\npractical policy (in case it became of political interest) till these matters\nhad been much more thoroughly thrashed out.

Under\nalmost any other stabilization strategy I have seen suggested,? the inter-\nplay of inventory position, business expectations and employment is ca-\npable of giving a downswing some momentum before the situation is recog-\nnized and corrected.
