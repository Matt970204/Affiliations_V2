While \"turn-\nover\" may still be an ugly word, *mobility\" has taken on a favorable\nconnotation, something like *alkalinity\"; and while \"stabilization\" is\nstill a virtue, *immobilization\" is a vice.\n\nIt is said that seniority systems, health and welfare plans and\nnegotiated pensions have chained the worker to his job; that the\nadaptability and flexibility of the labor force are being sacrificed; and\nthat a new industrial feudalism is being built. The crux of the problem,\nit is held, is that the worker can no longer afford to quit his job.\n\nProponents of this view emphasize the record\u00e9d decline in quit rates\nsince the second world war.

The relationship of the aid program to the budget, the\ndevelopment of free enterprise in South Korea, and the \"windfall profits\"\nrelated to the aid program were all described in much the same terms before\n1954. Our belief is that Korean institutions are more complicated than such\ndescriptions indicate and that they cannot be understood properly in terms\nof their counterparts in the United States,\n", "to meet expenditures of individual government agencies. The illustrations\nwhich the authors give however\u2014 specifically those of gasoline and fertilizer\u2014\nare not cases that can substantiate the authors! assertions that the Korean\ngovernment pursued the policies described by them.\n\nFor instance, all of the gasoline and other petroleum products required for\nthe civil economy are procured by the United States Army and turned over\nfor distribution to the Korea Oil Storage Company, jointly operated by\nCaltex, Socony Vacuum, and the Shell Company, which retails the products\nthrough its authorized dealers. Decision on the kinds and quantities to be\nprocured, on their distribution, and on their pricing are made by the U. S. aid\nauthorities and the Korean government, acting jointly though the Combined\nEconomic Board.\n\nEvery phase of the fertilizer program, comprising procurement, inland\ntransportation, and distribution, is also conducted under the joint supervision\nof the Korean government and the U. S. aid agency in Korea. And since there\nis a strict requirement of joint agreement between the Korean and United\nStates government authorities on every important aspect of the fertilizer\nprogram, it simply is not true that the Korean government can or does act\nunilaterally in any material way to \"produce revenue for individual bu-\nreaus.\" Indeed the pricing of fertilizer is not only subject to this joint\ncontrol, but to the approval of the Korean National Assembly as well.\n\nThere probably were some irregularities among some officials in times of\nproduct scarcity resulting from poorly coordinated programs. But they were\nundoubtedly much less prevaient than Campbell and Tullock suggested; and\nthe situation in any event has greatly improved as government operations\nhave increased in efficiency.\n\nI am nevertheless anxious to add that, despite my rejection of certain por-\ntions of the article, there is no intention to deprecate the authors' approach\nto the problems of the Korean economy and its administration.\n\nSxr-Youwc Pank*\n\n'I may be excused a brief personal reference.

A 100-ruble bond\nbought in 1930 had, by 1940, less than 20 rubles of purchasing power in 1940\nprices; a 100-ruble bond bought in 1948, had, by 1958, about 200 rubles of\npurchasing power in 1958 prices.\n\nNow Bornstein argues that prices have been relatively stable since 1954,\nand therefore from the point of view of the bondholder the tax element is\nstill fairly high (though I would argue not as high as in the \"thirties). The\nstate's decision to discontinue the sale of bonds, however, is not based on\nbondholders! expectations but rather on its own plans regarding the consumer-\ngoods price level.' I would anticipate that in the future the Soviets will con-\ntinue to use price cuts as a means of passing on increases in the standard of\nliving while keeping wages and other incomes roughly stable. This has been\ntheir avowed policy since 1928 and has been implemented since 1948 when\ncontrol over incomes made price cuts possible. I regard the cessation of price\ncuts since 1954 as temporary in nature due to: the stepped-up industrializa-\ntion when Khrushchev first took over; the numerous special measures which\nhave been taken in the past few years to adjust relative incomes (increase in\npayments to collective farmers, increase in pensions, increase in minimum\nwages, etc.) ; the stepped-up housing program, a form of consumer service not\nreflected in the price indices; and so forth.?\n\nFinally, I agree with Bornstein that the \"official\" argument concerning the\nfreeze and discontinuation has merit: that with repayments plus debt service\ngradually overtaking receipts, the bond program had become less attractive to\nthe planners. But I think this argument is much more convincing when\nviewed in the perspective of the change from an inflationary to a deflationary\neconomy with its implications for the *tax element.\" I do not believe the\nSoviets would have repudiated (in effect) 260 billion rubles in bonds, equal\nto about one-half year's personal income, just because their net receipts from\nsales of bonds were declining. This is not the kind of action that a govern-\nment, even as centralized and powerful as the USSR, contemplates lightly.\nThe big problem is that repayments today are worth so much more in real\nterms than the original receipts, whereas in the 'thirties they were worth so\nmuch less.\n\nIf inflation were still rampant: (1) It would still pay the Soviets to sell\nbonds today paying back a fraction of their real value sometime in the future.\nBonds, unlike taxes, are an intertemporal fiscal weapon and it makes sense to\nassess their utility over time as well as in relation to problems of the moment.\n\n' The major purpose of my original note was to estimate the tax element from the point\nof view of the bondholder. As the note was about to go to press, the Soviets initiated their\nfreeze. My brief addendum on the freeze which is a major target of Bornstein's, was un-\nfortunately misleading on this point.\n\n?'This point was made in a letter to Problems of Communism accepted for publication\nin January 1958.

These discussions deal mostly with the issue of\ncapital longevity within the framework of problems of underdeveloped\ncountries. It is not necessary, however, to deal with the longevity prob-\nlem in such a restricted manner; virtually everything that need be said\nabout capital longevity actually holds for any stage of development.\n\nThus W. A. Lewis argues that it is a frequent fault of development\nprograms to build capital structures for an unduly long life and too\nsolidly. These are luxuries which underdeveloped countries can ill\nafford because capital is so scarce for them [8, p. 395]. On the other\nhand, Galenson and Leibenstein hold that long-lived capital offers to\nunderdeveloped areas the great advantage of a longer period during\nwhich no replacement has to be made. This in turn, makes possible\na greater net output and greater reinvestment per man, which may be\ncrucial for overcoming a critical early stage in the development process\n[4, p. 362]:\n\nNeisser, commenting on the Galenson-Leibenstein article and con-\nsidering the issues of lesser cost of short-lived equipment versus the\ngain of postponed replacement of more durable equipment, states:\n\"I do not know of a criterion for weighing the advantages of a more\nrapid initial growth of operating capital against the disadvantages of\nan earlier temporary interruption\" [10, p. 646].\n\n* The author is assistant professor in the department of economics, Northwestern Uni-\nversity.

If the average length of life of capital should be 10 years, the\nratio of replacement to gross investment drops to 61 per cent; and if the average length\nof life of capital is 30 years the ratio of replacement to gross investment would be\nmerely 22 per cent per year [2, p. 8]. Domar, however, makes it quite clear that more\nlong-lived equipment, while it has the agreeable quality of postponed replacement, also\nhas the disagreeable quality of being more expensive; he states explicitly: \"There is no\ndoubt that beyond a certain range greater capital longevity becomes very expensive . . .\"\n[2, p. 7].

It seems appropriate\nto investigate the relationship of a production ceiling to the turning-\npoint of 1920 because demand forces were extremely strong and sharp\nprice rises also occurred.\n\nThe basic argument is that the production ceiling is normally en-\ncountered first in the investment-goods industries. Thereafter further\ngrowth in demand for consumption-goods output depends largely upon\nlagged expenditures generated by the multiplier. Since these do not\ngenerate sufficient consumption, however, induced investment falls off\nand shortly consumption also declines.' This explanation of the causal\nfactors in an economic turning-point seems unsatisfactory for 1919-20,\nbecause production of consumer goods reached its peak in November\n1919, before that of investment goods, and began to decline markedly\nin February 1920, although prices and real consumption expenditures\nwere still rising. Moreover, demand for investment goods, as reflected\nin new and unfilled orders, in many industries continued to rise for\nsome months after production of consumption goods began to decline.\n\nThe data appear consistent, however, with a second type of produc-\ntion ceiling which, according to Hicks, may occur on rare occasions,\nprimarily after big wars. At such a time a production ceiling may be\nencountered first in consumption-goods industries, and lack of adequate\ncapacity in these industries then leads to further increases in produc-\ntion in the investment-goods industries.

Limitations of space make it impossible to cata-\nlogue the changes in the conditions of employment secured in the six separate\nnegotiations in the period 1948-56.?* It should be noted, however, that changes\nin the geographical and occupational wage structures in the industry and in\nso-called *fringe benefits\" (including pensions and insurance, paid holidays,\nshift differentials, and the Supplementary Unemployment Benefit Plan), as\nwell as in basic wage rates were negotiated under collective bargaining during\nthis period. This brief account, however, will consider only changes in the\nlevel of average hourly earnings, which, of course, fail to reflect some of the\nchanges in the terms of employment other than basic rates. On the other\nhand, average hourly earnings have tended to increase more rapidly than\ncontractual rates in this period; this is due in great part to the inclusion of\nan increasing proportion of the work force under incentive pay plans\u2014a\nprocess, incidentally, in which the local unions involved have played a signi-\nficant role.\n\nTable II compares increases in average hourly earnings in basic steel with\nwage increases in some of the lightly organized industrial categories identical\nwith or corresponding closely to those employed by Rees (those for which data\nhave been continuously available) and in all manufacturing. The table reveals\nthat basic steel's standing in the group including itself and the 9 lightly\norganized (in 1946) trades improved markedly between 1948 and 1956. Be-\ntween 1939 and 1948 and between 1945 and 1948, 4 of these trades had ob-\ntained increases in average hourly earnings greater than those secured in basic\nsteel. (Some of the factors contributing to this result were offered in Section I\nabove.) But between 1948 and 1956 only the ice-cream workers received\ngreater increases than the steel workers-\u2014a phenomenon most appropriate to\nthe democracy's cold-war economy.\n\nWe need not repeat our early caveats concerning the interpretation of the\nresults of such comparisons. They are consistent with the hypothesis that\nunionism exerted an independent impact on the level of steel wages in any\nor all or none of the periods considered. However, certain additional infor-\nmation makes plausible the hypothesis that the union probably did exert an\nindependent influence on the level of money wages in basic steel after Septem-\nber 1948. In the first place, while the increase in basic steel production (33\nper cent) over the period 1948-55 was about the same as the increase in\nindustrial and manufacturing production as well as in gross national product\nin 1956 prices (34, 36, and 33 per cent respectively), employment in basic\n\n75 See U.

In the first place, employers unionized\nat the outset would have to reckon with a higher probability of a strike for\nhigher wages during the period of labor shortage than would nonunion em-\nployers. Thus, if unionized employers wished to secure a future wage rate\nwith which no excess supply of labor would be associated, they would pre-\nsumably have to choose between incurring a strike in good times and in the\nnear future in order to hold wages below the levels at which markets could\ncurrently be cleared, and incurring a strike to reduce wages in some possible\nperiod of future labor surplus. Since the loss of business from a strike would\nbe less and the prospects of their winning would be greater under the latter\nalternative, that alternative would presumably be preferred. Moreover, a\nfirm like U. S. Steel, to which a policy of present restraint probably commended\nitself with particular force under nonunion conditions, found that unionism\neliminated certain exceptional circumstances which had prevailed in the past.\nSince U. S. Steel had traditionally sought to play the role of wage and price\nstabilizer within the industry under nonunion conditions, it lagged behind\nother firms in reducing wages during the downswings of 1920-21 and 1929-32.\nA policy of wage restraint during periods of labor shortage might well have\nappealed to such a \"leader\" under nonunion conditions since it tended to\nminimize its differential losses during ensuing downswings. But once the\nunion was able to inherit the stabilizer's mantle, the dominant firm no longer\nhad such a strong private stake in holding wages below the levels at which\nthey would have cleared the labor markets.\n\nOf course, one need not rely upon the theory of unionism as a price de-\npressant to account for the industry's conservative pricing policies during\nthis period. In the light of the industry leaders! conviction (mentioned above)\nthat postwar operating rates were abnormally high, their consequent reluctance\nto expand capacity in the face of strong public pressure to do so, their fear\nof price controls and their frequent desire to ration in the interests of their\ntraditional customers, wage-price restraint is understandable enough.?*\n\nNow price restraint, whatever its cause, tended to hold down the rate of\nincrease in the demand for production labor in basic steel; thus one need not\nabandon Rees! hypothesis that \"the smaller increase in steel prices\" in\n1939-48, as against 1914-20, was a factor which helped to account for the\nsmaller increase in money wages during the latter period. But if we refuse\nto agree that the 1939-48 price increase would have been greater in the\nabsence of collective bargaining, we are certainly not obliged to conclude that\nthe 1939-48 increase in money wages would also have been greater in the\nabsence of collective bargaining. Rees' data (p. 398) reveal that the rise in\nsteel wages relative to steel prices was much greater in 1939-48 than in\n1914-20; in the earlier period base prices of finished steel rose by 144 per cent\nwhile wages rose 148 per cent, whereas in 1939-48, a price rise of 61 per cent\nwas accompanied by a wage increase of 99 per cent. For reasons presented\nin this section, we regard it as improbable that the union was instrumental in\nholding prices down during the latter period; for reasons presented in Section\n\n\" Loc. cit.; The Iron Age: Jan. 29, 1948; June 10, 1948; Sept. 21, 1948; Oct. 7, 1948.\n", "423\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "15": ["man-hours worked in the entire steel industry declined, while the number\nof hourly rated employees rose by over 4 per cent.?*\n\nThus an alternative to raising the base rate existed, but it was not signifi-\ncantly used, apparently because it cost too much. How, then, do we interpret\nthose reports of local labor shortage? It is possible that they signified merely\nthat, while employers would have been willing to hire more labor than was\navailable to them at the going rate, they would not have been willing to raise\nthe average rate suffciently to pay overtime. Indeed, in this context, it is\neven possible that reports of local shortages might have signified in some\ncases that the employers involved wanted to hire more labor, but only at a\nlower wage rate. For that is what would be implied if their unwillingness to\npay overtime meant that they would also have been unwilling to raise their total\nhourly payroll costs by the amount necessary to defray the additional costs\nof recruitment, selection, training, etc. involved in the expansion of their\nwork forces.\n\nIn any event, the phenomenon of reported local labor shortages combined\nwith employer unwillingness to raise the average rate of pay by as much as the\noffer of time-and-a-half would necessitate is consistent with another hypothesis\nadvanced by Rees as applicable to this problem.?* This hypothesis is that the\nindustry's policy of setting steel prices below the levels at which the product\nmarkets would be cleared depressed the level of demand for its production\nlabor. But now one might question his further claim that the union was in\npart responsible for this price policy.\n\nHolding Down Prices and Wages. We have suggested that, in the pre-union\nera of the basic steel industry, the fear of future unionism (or, as it used to\nbe called, *labor unrest\") led employers to exercise restraint in granting wage\nincreases in response to labor shortages which they believed to be temporary.\nNow, in the postwar period under consideration, the expectation of a future\ntapering off in demand was widely held by the industry's leadership.?? There-\nfore, even if the steel union had been nonexistent in 1946-48, it appears more\nlikely that the industry would have exercised some moral restraint in its wage-\nprice policy than that it would have thrown caution to the winds. Hence one\ncannot easily accept the view that the substance of unionism contributed\nindependently to the restrained behavior of the industry in 1945-48 if the\nsame type of behavior would have been elicited by its shadow.\n\nOf course one might maintain that the threat of unionism would exert a\nlesser degree of influence than the presence of unionism, but it would be at\n\n\" New York Times, Dec. 15, 1945, p. 12; The Iron Age, Aug. 15, 1946, p. 92.

Presumably neither Rees nor we would\ndeny that employers who believe it to be in their short-term interest to raise\nemployee compensation to a given level would hesitate to do so if they could\nsubsequently reduce compensation without fear of employee resistance. We\nmight further agree that workers would tend to oppose an attempt to reduce\ntheir basic rate of pay and that knowledge of this would make employers\nunwilling to raise that basic rate in the first place. But there is more than\none way to skin this cat, and it is available to union as well as to nonunion\nemployers. By paying overtime premiums during transitional periods of worker\nshortage, employers could expand their employment of man-hours (a) without\nhaving to pay a higher rate for the straight-time hours throughout the enter-\nprise, (b) without contravening either the letter or spirit of their fixed-term\nagreements, and (c) without courting the alleged peril of being prevented by\nthe union from reducing average wages in response to a subsequent decrease\nin demand for labor.\n\nRees cites the specific instance of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Com-\npany whose vice-president in charge of industrial relations testified before a\nSenate committee that, in August 1947, his company was short 1,000 workers\nof its normal complement of 24,000 in the Youngstown and Chicago-Gary\nareas. But this official added, We do make up that thousand men by em-\nploying men overtime, but at the same time the efficiency is not there.\"??\nWhether or not this company would have been any more willing to increase\nits unit labor costs by raising its straight-time wage rate and its outlays on\nemployee selection and training sufficiently to increase its work force by 4 per\ncent than it was to increase them by paying an overtime premium and incur-\nring loss of efficiency is not known. However, we do know that throughout\nthe period 1946-1948 basic steel was not, in the aggregate, on an overtime\nbasis. In the ten strike-free months of 1946, the average work week was 37.4\nhours; in 1947, 39 hours; and in 1948, 39.5 hours. (In all manufacturing, the\nlength of the work week was 40.4 in 1946 and 1947 and 40.1 in 1948.) During\nthe wartime period, 1942-1945, however, the work week in basic steel exceeded\n40 hours, as it did\u2014 although to a much lesser extent\u2014in 1951 (40.9), 1953,\n1955, and 1956 (all 40.5).?* Apparently the industry was unwilling to pay\npremium wages for overtime\u2014according to one report of a labor shortage at\nthe end of 1945, \"mostly because it feels that only on a straight-time basis\ncan it meet its present costs. This has meant the elimination of overtime.\"\nBetween 1945 and 1946, when the work week declined by 9.1 hours, total\n\n?* U. S.

They would be restrained by their fear of \"cheating the expecta-\ntions\" of entrants to the trade. Employers in the U. S. steel industry might\nwell have been similarly motivated in the period between August 1918 and\nAugust 1923 (when the 8-hour day was introduced). With the exception of\nthe depression of 1920-21, this was a period of chronic labor shortage in the\nindustry, unrelieved by the five wage increases which were either too little or\ntoo late to remove the specific shortages which had provoked them.?^ Two\nmonths after the ineffective wage increase of April 1923, The Iron Age\napprovingly quoted an admonition from W. I. King to *Raise wages as little\nas possible, thus avoiding the necessity of severe wage cuts at a later date\";\nand it added, *Advancing wages that must afterward come down causes\ntrouble and it is human nature that it should be so. We are dealing with\nmen as they are, not as they would be if the Golden Rule were their sole\nguide to thought and conduct.\"?:\n\nBoth Hicks and King presumably assumed that the employers whom they\nhad in mind were able to act on their long view; however, the employers\"\nability to do so implies in turn a departure from perfect competition on their\nside of the labor market. This condition, as we have argued, is satisfied in\nthe case of basic steel. But now consider the assumptions underlying the argu-\nment that employers in steel, if there were no union, would set a wage high\nenough to eliminate what they regard as a temporary shortage and without\nregard to a foreseeable future excess supply with which that wage might be\nassociated. This argument assumes either that such employers act irrationally\nin terms of their long-run situation or that the degree of competition among\nthem is so high that they (literally) cannot help themselves. Hence, as in\n\n?See J. R. Hicks, *Economic Foundations of Wage Policy,\" Econ. Jour., Sept. 1955,\nLXV, 401.\n\n?* In 1920 local labor shortages were reported and persisted from April to September;\nthese followed a wage increase in February and were terminated before the next rise in\nwages, which did not occur until May 1921. In 1922, shortages which were reported from\nthe beginning of the year were not responded to by a wage increase until September, and\nthis increase did not have the effect of stopping complaints of labor shortage. Furthermore, a\nwage increase of 11 per cent in April 1923 failed to alleviate a severe and persistent shortage\nof labor; as a result of this U. S. Steel inaugurated the basic 8-hour day in August with a\ncompensating wage rise. The latter move did put an end to the persistent labor shortage,\nincidentally, which clearly reveals the prior effect of the industry's policies with respect to\nhours of work upon its ability to attract and retain native-born labor.\n\n^ The Iron Age: Apr. 15, 1920; Sept. 2, 1920; Jan. 26, 1922; May 4, 1922; June 29,\n1922; Oct. 12, 1922; Nov. 9, 1922; Dec. 28, 1922; May 31, 1923; June 21, 1923.

In this\ncontext, the reporting of \"labor shortage\" might have signified only that\nemployers wished to hire at the union rate more labor than was available at\nthat rate. It did not necessarily signify that multiplant companies would have\nbeen willing to raise the wages of the existing forces in all their mills in an\nattempt to employ additional workers in some mills in those localities where\nlabor was tight at the time, or even that they would have been willing to raise\nthe local basic rate alone.\n\nSome Dynamic Considerations. Even if the wage level at which the local\nmarket could be cleared is assumed to have been above the union wage, it need\nnot follow that, in the absence of collective bargaining, a labor shortage would\nhave resulted in a wage increase. When the dominant employing units expect\nthat the short-run supply curve of labor in the local labor market will shift\nto the right or that the demand for labor will be reduced in the near future,\nit is unlikely that what is regarded as a temporary shortage would touch off\na wage increase. The period July 1946 to at least August 1947 was cited by\nRees as having been characterized by serious local labor shortages in the\nChicago-Gary and Youngstown areas. Now some of these reported labor short-\nages were due to shortages in housing facilities near the plants; in one in-\nstance, it was specifically reported that, *The number of workers recruited\n[from the Pittsburgh region] was limited, apparently, only by the availability\nof housing at the plant site.\"!* And, during the same postwar period, some\nreported shortages were attributed to the availability of unemployment com-\npensation benefits to war-weary civilian workers and returning servicemen;\nwhile the Chicago steel mills were trying to fill about 3,300 jobs (mostly\nunskilled), 135,000 individuals in the area were reported as unemployed \u2014\nand over 50,000 returning servicemen were expected.!?\n\nIf the steel employers had had no union to contend with in 1946-47, would\nthey really have responded to such shortages by raising wages sufficiently to\nhave eliminated them? If not, then the reported existence of shortages under\ncollective bargaining is not sufficient to create the presumption that collective\nbargaining held wages down. Nor can it be held to imply that unionized\nemployers were not paying wages higher than they would have been willing\nto pay in the absence of the union but with all other conditions remaining\nthe same. If we admit that the employer, under nonunion conditions, might\ntolerate some excess demand which he regards as temporary, then we cannot\ntell whether the shortage actually observed under collective bargaining is\n", "419\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "11": ["because they believed that \"the union could successfully maintain the higher\nlevel of wages after the demand for steel had declined.\" Hence in the absence\nof the union, it is alleged, wages would have risen to higher levels during this\nperiod.\n\nCan we presume that, in the absence of the union, the existence of local\nlabor shortages would have sufficed to induce employers in basic steel to\nraise wages above the levels actually reached under collective bargaining?\nWere any alternatives to raising the basic hourly rate available to basic steel\nemployers; and might they have availed themselves of these alternatives\neither in the presence or in the absence of collective bargaining?\n\nThe Assumption of Perfect Competition. Y1 we assume perfect competition in\nthe labor markets for basic steel, we can presume that \"a shortage would\ncause the bidding up of wages in the absence of collective bargaining. . . .\"\nHowever, the assumption of the existence of conditions which would ensure\nperfect competition in the labor markets for production workers in basic\nsteel in the absence of unionism is unwarranted. One writer noted that *a\nlarge company . . . adopt[s] and follow[s] a uniform policy for all its plants,\"\nand that at least the major companies tend to engage in \"uniform behavior\non labor conditions.\"!* In addition to the policies of the union and the rela-\ntively large size of U. S. Steel and its consequent ability to assume its historic\nrole of wage leader, he attributes these phenomena to the fact that steel mills\ntypically employ a relatively large proportion of the labor of the types they\nrequire in the local labor markets involved. Where there is only one steel\ncompany in a town, \"they are either the one company in a one-company town\nor one of a handful of large employers in a somewhat bigger community.\"\nMost of the industry's tonnage is produced in the large steel centers of the\ncountry; however: *\"When two steel plants are part of the same labor market,\na wage increase by one certainly affects the other.\" And while steel employers\ncompete with other industries for skilled maintenance workers and for common\nlabor, the majority of the skilled and semiskilled jobs are unique to the indus-\ntry? and are usually staffed by promotion.\n\nThis writer is describing monopsonistic or oligopsonistic labor markets.\nNow if a labor shortage exists in such a market it cannot be presumed that\nremoval of an institution (in this case, the trade union) responsible for hold-\ning the wage rate at the level with which the shortage is associated would be\nfollowed by a \"bidding up of wages.\" The new wage (and the new level of\nemployment) would be determined by the relative positions of the demand\ncurve for labor and the marginal-cost-of-labor and labor-supply functions;\nand the new wage might well fall below the union wage, even if at the latter\nwage there existed excess demand due presumably to an upward shift in the\ndemand curve. Moreover, even immediately following a subsequent rise in\nthe negotiated wage, the higher union wage could still be associated with\nsome excess demand; this, however, does not appear to have been the case.\nThus if \"shortages existed soon after wage increases were negotiated,\" this\n\n5 Robert Tilove, Collective Bargaining in the Steel Industry, Philadelphia 1948, p. 31.\n\" [bid., pp. 31-32.\n", "418\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "10": ["We believe that the assumption that it was more difficult for basic steel\nto retain and recruit the marginal worker in the second period than it had\nbeen in the first is difficult to maintain in the face of the historical evidence\ncited above. Indeed, the contrary assumption appears easier to defend, al-\nthough it is not necessary to do so. Let one merely assume equal difficulty in\nboth periods and then compare the two periods with respect to changes in\nsteel employment\u2014whether in percentage terms or relative to changes in\nthe labor force\u2014as well as changes in wages. Such a comparison might well\nlead one to wonder why the 1939-48 wage change was not smaller than in\nfact it was.\n\nNeedless to say, the rough calculations in the preceding subsection cannot\nbe used to show by how much the steel union was responsible for the increase\nin money wages in 1939-48. For one thing, if we accept the hypothesis that\nunionism was an independent influence on wages, we must also reckon with\nthe possibility that the increase in basic steel employment would have been\ngreater in the absence of the union than it actually was during that period\n(and that this would have reduced the difference between the predicted and\nthe observed wage increases).\n\nIH. Shortages and Expectations\n\nRees would presumably agree that in the absence of the union the increase\nin steel employment would have been greater than it actually was before the\ninflationary peak had been passed in September 1948, but for a quite dif-\nferent reason; he believes that the union helped to choke back the demand\nfor steel labor and thus to prevent both employment and wages from rising as\nrapidly as they would have in the absence of the union. And he refers to\nreports of local labor shortages during the postwar period as evidence that\nwages would have risen more than they did had it not been for collective\nbargaining. Let us now test the third leg of this tripod.\n\nTwo alleged causes of local labor shortage are considered. On the one\nhand, \"wage increases were undoubtedly delayed by fixed-term collective\nagreements\" (p. 402). However, such fixed-term agreements need not have\nresulted in shortages if the periodic negotiations had resulted in wage rates\nsufficiently high to compensate in advance, as it were, for subsequent increases\nin demand. Since it is noted in another connection that \"shortages existed\nsoon after wage increases were negotiated, indicating that negotiated rates\nat these times were probably below those which would have prevailed in the\nabsence of collective bargaining\" (p. 393), one might infer that the existence\nof fixed-term agreements is not regarded as the most important agent of re-\ntardation.\n\nThe more important cause of local labor shortage is alleged to have been\nthe union's contribution to the industry's decision to underprice its product,\nthereby permitting product shortages to develop and also making it unprofit-\nable to raise wages to levels which would have obtained in the absence of\nprice restraint. In part, the union's publicity campaign against price increases\nhelped to hold down steel prices, according to this argument, but more\nimportant was the alleged fact that employers feared to raise prices and wages\nsuffciently to overcome the \"temporary\" shortages in steel and steel labor\n", "417\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "9": ["BTVMBPS p.

It also uses month-to-month link relatives, but is based on the year 1929\nand extends the BLS index for 1923-36 back to 1919. Presumably the difference between the\nlow and the high estimates for 1920 reflects the fact that the sample of firms reporting year-\nto-year changes in employment each month for 1919-20 was different from the sample re-\nporting for the year 1920\u201421.\n\n* The middle estimate (B) for 1920 was obtained by applying an estimated increase of 156.9\nper cent to the Census figure of 1914. This estimate was taken from an \"adjusted employ-\nment index\" constructed by the BLS in 1926 (Mo. Lab. Rev., July 1926, p. 9) which reflects\nchanges in hours of work as well as in the number of employees. However, since the number\nof hours worked declined during this period, this estimate understates the increase in the\nemployment of workers. Like our high estimate, this estimate of the increase in worker em-\nployment for the period 1919-20 takes 1914 as a base and uses the Census figures for 1919\nand the monthly reports on changes in employment compiled by the BLS in deriving the\nestimate of employment for 1920.\n\n* Estimate (C) for 1920 was obtained by applying to monthly Census data on employment\nin steel works, blast furnaces, and rolling mills percentage changes in employment reported\nto the BLS by a sample of employers in \"iron and steel\" for the 9 months, January through\nSeptember. The monthly changes in employment for October through December were omitted\nin this calculation because employment in 1920 was depressed due to the A.F. of L.'s organiz-\ning strike and the reported year-to-year increases averaged greatly in excess of the increases\nreported for the other months. Inclusion of all twelve year-to-year changes would yield an\naverage total of 459.5 thousand production workers in basic steel in 1920.\n\n4 The estimate for 1948 was obtained by multiplying the BLS figure of 536.8 thousand for\n1948 by the ratio of the 1947 item in the Census series to the 1947 item in the BLS series. As\nthe following data show, these proportions show some tendency to decline over the period\n1947-50; hence applying the 1947 ratio tends to overstate 1948 employment in the census\nseries.\n\n(Continued at bottom of next page)\n", "1n DdsiC otcci\n", "413\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "5": ["might merely indicate that the United Steelworkers were unable to keep up\nwith the Joneses over the period 1939-1948 and specifically in the subperiod\n1939-1945.\n\nIn any event Rees claims only that his evidence \"does show . . . that the\nefforts of the union were not sufficient to offset apparent differences in other\nfactors, probably including the smaller increase in steel prices . . .\" (p. 400),\nand, as we have seen, unionization in manufacturing in the second period.\nBut we might ask whether one might find other evidence to support the more\nrelevant hypothesis that, but for the existence of widespread collective bar-\ngaining in basic steel, the percentage increase in hourly earnings which did\noccur over the period 1939-1948 would have been smaller than it was\u2014\ndespite the fact that it was much smaller than the increase in 1914-1920.\n\nThe latter hypothesis, I believe, acquires greater plausibility than does\nRees! view to the contrary when the following additional evidence is arrayed\nagainst the wartime wage comparisons: (1) a comparison of changes in em-\nployment in basic steel in the two wartime periods, taken in conjunction\nwith (2) the changed nature of the jobs and the work force in this industry.\n\n1. The Two Wartime Increases in. Employment. According to Table I\nemployment in basic steel increased by much more in 1914-20 than it did\nin 1939-48, not only in percentage terms but absolutely as well, and relative\nto total civilian employment and labor force. Thus while steel wages rose\nmore rapidly in 1914-20 than in 1939-48, so did employment in basic steel.\nMoreover, while the per cent increase in average hourly earnings in 1939-48\nwas about .6 as great as that in 1914-20, the per cent increase in basic steel\nemployment in 1939-48 was only about .45 as great as that in 1914-20.\n\nSuppose, for illustrative purposes, that one wished to estimate the percent-\nage increase in hourly earnings in basic steel for 1939-48 on the assumption\nthat it bore the same relationship to the percentage increase in employment\nduring that period as the percentage increase in hourly earnings in 1914-20\nbore to the percentage increase in employment in 1914-20. Then, given the\nlatter ratio and the observed increase in employment in 1939-48, one would\nhave predicted that hourly earnings would have increased about 71, 66, or\n62 per cent in 1939-48, depending upon which estimate of employment for\n1920 is used. This is well below the calculated increase of 87 per cent.\nMoreover, we have not taken into account the fact that, while the increase in\nsteel employment was much smaller in the second period than in the first,\nthe increases in total employment and labor force were much smaller in the\nfirst period. Thus, in 1914-20, basic steel claimed between 149 and 172\nthousand of the 4,315,000 new jobs created in the economy\u2014roughly 315-4\nper cent; whereas in 1939-48, it claimed only about 100 thousand of the\n13,628,000 new jobs created\u2014under 1 per cent.'* In addition, as the table\n\n*\u00bb The example in the text might be altered to make some allowance for differential move-\nments in the labor force as well as in purely inflationary components of the wage increases\nby comparing increases in real wage rates (which. according to Rees' data, amounted to 27\nper cent in 1914-1920 and 13 per cent in 1939-1948) with increases in steel employment\nrelative to civilian labor force. In any event, the example is intended merely to illustrate\nthe possibility that the observed increase in wages during the second period might well have\n", "412\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "4": ["IL. Comparisons Between Two War Periods\n\nRees presents data which reveal \"that steelworkers made larger percentage\ngains in money and real hourly earnings during the period 1914 to 1920 than\nduring the period 1939 to 1948. In the earlier period steelworkers' money\nearnings increased relative to earnings in all manufacturing, while in the\nmore recent period they decreased\" (p. 400).* However, during the postwar\nperiod 1945-1948 average hourly earnings in steel rose as rapidly as average\nhourly earnings in all manufacturing, and money hourly earnings in both\njust about kept pace with the cost of living. (The annual increases were 33,\n32, and 34 per cent respectively.)?\n\nNow it is evident that interpretation of all these findings must be subject\nto the same class of restrictions which apply in the case of the interindustry\ncomparisons discussed in the preceding section, since no control was explicitly\nestablished for all relevant differences between the two periods apart from\nthe difference in the degree of unionization in steel. Comparing basic steel\nwages relative to wages in all manufacturing in the two periods might be\nconstrued as an attempt to control for other differences; however, it also\neliminates the differences with respect to unionization. For, unionization in\nmanufacturing increased along with unionization in steel during the second\nperiod; by 1946, 69 per cent of the production workers in manufacturing\nwere covered by collective bargaining.\" Manufacturing wages rose less rapidly\nin 1939-1948 than in 1914-1920 (see footnote 14), but this does not warrant\nthe conclusion that unionism in all manufacturing had no effect upon the\nmovement of hourly earnings in manufacturing and upon the cost of living\nduring the second period. Hence, the fact that steel wages fell relative to the\nformer and failed to rise relative to the latter by as much as in 1914-1920\n\n5 The statement concerning the movements in money earnings in basic steel relative to\nthose in manufacturing is supported by computations from data of the National Industrial\nConference Board for 1914-1920 and from data of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for\n1939-1948. Computations from BLS data for the period 1914-1920 indicate that steel\nwages rose no more rapidly than did manufacturing wages in the early period. See foot-\nnote 14 below.\n\n\"Average money hourly earnings in basic steel rose from $1.188 in 1945 to $1.580 in\n1948; in all manufacturing they rose from $1.023 to $1.350.

And it is clearly possible\nthat, in the absence of widespread collective bargaining, steel wages might\nhave lagged more, in percentage terms, relative to the other wages than they\ndid in fact.\n", "411\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["which 53.3 per cent of all employees were women in 1950 as against 49.9\nper cent in 1940; confectionery and related products\u201465.4 and 67.1 per cent,\nrespectively; laundry and dry-cleaning\u201467.1 and 66.8 per cent; and whole-\nsale and retail trade\u201437.9 and 34.1 per cent. In all of these categories, the\nnumber of women employed increased despite the fact that, during the wartime\nperiod, employment of women in higher-paid defense industries expanded\ngreatly. At the same time, the proportion of women workers to the entire\nfemale population 14 years of age and over increased from 26 per cent in\n1940 to a peak of 37 per cent in 1945 and then declined to a level of 29 per\ncent in 1950.* But whether or not increased wages were required to attract\nthese additional female workers to the labor force, it is reasonable to presume\nthat these lower-paid trades were under especially strong market pressure to\nraise wages in order to retain and increase their own female work forces.**\n\nA further element of difference between basic steel and most of the com-\nparison industries consists in the fact that steel was far more \"essential\" to\nthe wartime economy; and it is a matter of common knowledge that wartime\ncontrols on wages were much more effectively imposed on such essential\nindustries than they were on more purely *'civilian\" trades\u2014such as con-\nfectionery, laundries, cleaning and dyeing, retail trade, ice cream, etc.\n\nMoreover, in the subperiod following the removal of wage controls, basic\nsteel's pricing policy tended to retard the increase in its demand for labor.\nRees pointed this out and attributed this phenomenon in part to the existence\nof widespread collective bargaining in basic steel. In Part III below, however,\nwe question this explanation and suggest that the existence of another set of\ncharacteristics, its oligopolistic structure and political sensitivity, sufficed to\naccount for this industry's price behavior\u2014in which respects basic steel\ndiffered notably from all of the other comparison industries with the exception\nof crude petroleum.\n\nIn addition, Rees! method carries the implication that in none of the\nindustries which were lightly organized did unionism exert an impact upon\nthe level of money wages. This method makes no allowance for the possibility\nthat nonunion firms might have raised wages in order to prevent themselves\nfrom becoming organized.*\n\n*U. S.

Nor can the movements in wages of male wage earners be regarded as independent of\nthe special influences which affected the wages of their female co-workers. If employers\nwere under especially strong market pressure to raise the wages of women in those\nindustries which had heavy concentrations of female labor, considerations of tradition,\nequity, and morale alone, in addition to interchangeability in some occupations, would have\ninduced them to raise the wages of their male employees to a certain extent. (Men and\nwomen employees in such industries are frequently in the same family!) Slichter notes some\n(\"not pronounced\") tendency for the hourly earnings of male common labor to be low\nwhere the percentage of women among wage earners is high. He attributes this in part to\nthe fact that employers in those industries might wish to hire inferior male workers, some\nof whom could not transfer to \"heavier\" industries where wages are higher.

This much is true for the majority of the industries\nin question, but of course it does not imply that, in the absence of a well-\norganized union, wages in basic steel would have risen as much as they ac-\ntually did. The latter inference is implied in the conclusion quoted above\nonly if one could have confidence that, for the purpose at hand, the only\nsignificant difference between basic steel and the comparison industries con-\nsists in their respective degrees of unionization. But no attempt was made\nto control for other differences between basic steel and the other industries\nto which it was compared\u2014such as di\u00edferential changes in employment and\nproductivity and differences in market structure or in original level of earn-\nings. Other writers believed such differences to be significantly associated\nwith variations in relative wages, and some of them attempted to make allow-\nance for them in assessing the impact of unionism per se.?\n\nFor example, apart from the difference in the degree of unionization, basic\nstecl differed from most of Rees! comparison industries with respect to certain\ncharacteristics which tended to hold wages in basic steel down relative to\nwages in the comparison group in the early wartime subperiod, and with\nrespect to other characteristics which tended to exert the same effect in the\nsubperiod between the suspension of controls and the onset of recession in\nlate 1948.\n\nIn the first place, the original level of earnings in basic steel greatly\nexceeded that in all other categories except crude petroleum. (See Table II\nbelow.) Since, in wartime the labor markets in essential industries were char-\nacterized by widespread substitution of less skilled and lower-paid labor for\nmore highly skilled and higher-paid workers, one would expect greater per-\ncentage, as well as absolute, increases in earnings in industries which originally\nemployed relatively high proportions of low-paid workers and which sought\nsubsequently to retain them.?* This point is related to another element of dif-\nference between basic steel and most of the highly organized industries with\nwhich it was compared. Over the decade 1940-1950 (which includes the period\nunder discussion), women comprised a high and in some cases an increasing\nproportion of the work force in certain occupational groupings which are\nrelevant to 7 of Rees 12 comparison industries: textile-mill products, in\n\n*See especially J.

Levinson's study does compare groups of highly\norganized industries with groups of lightly organized industries in the same classes of\noriginal earnings; and the author finds that the former did not secure greater wage increases\nthan the latter during the period 1941-47. But a comparison among large groups at once\nraises the possibility that wage movements in the nonunion sector might be affected by wage\nmovements in the unionized sector. Levinson calls attention to the fact that part of the\nwage increases in the union sector might have been due to \"union pressure\" and that \"this\ngreater increase might then have been transmitted to the nonunion workers through sym-\npathetic pressure.\" H.

That is not\nour position. Our proposed equation of demand for money explicitly provides\nfor varying rates of substitutability between money and other financial assets,\nboth direct and indirect.\n\nThird, he interprets our suggestion to mean that we would not be concerned\nwith effects of the changing composition of direct debt on excess money\n(pp. 129, 130). We have repudiated this interpretation at an earlier juncture\nin the present paper. In fact, we consider public-debt management, held in\nhigh esteem by Culbertson, to be a prime illustration of the case we are\nmaking\u2014and of the case that Culbertson is condemning\u2014for financial con-\ntrols in addition to monetary control. Replacement of Treasury bonds with\nTreasury bills tends to reduce demand for money, and complements easy-\nmoney policy. Funding does the reverse, and complements tight-money policy.\nIt mystifies us that Culbertson should write so fondly of public-debt manage-\nment and, at the same time, regard with horror the notion that management\ntechniques should be applied to other assets than Treasury bills that displace\nmoney in some degree (pp. 120, 121).\n\nIt may be appropriate, in connection with this discussion of debt manage-\nment, to suggest that Culbertson is astride two theoretical horses in his essay\nand is riding rapidly in opposite directions. Through his page 124, a Treasury\nbill would not partake of the uniqueness of money. It would resemble a time\ndeposit or a savings and loan share as a savings medium, with its volume\noutstanding depending on demand by savers. As a vehicle for matching\nplanned saving with planned investment, it would be noninflationary in\ncharacter. Since the public gives up money to get a Treasury bill, bill issue\nwould be contingent on a private act of saving, a private act of abstention\nfrom demand for goods. On the first set of principles enunciated by Culbert-\nson, bill issue should be as free of management as issues of all other assets\nthat do not qualify as money in the sense of means of payment.\n\nCulbertson mounts his second steed on page 125. Henceforth savers save\nby Aolding money as well as other financial assets. And money, no longer\nunique, differs from other assets only in the degree of its liquidity. Its\n*]iquidity-enhancing services\" (p. 128) place it at an extreme of the liquidity\nspectrum of assets, but this position is not so distinctive that such fairly\nclose substitutes as Treasury bills should escape the network of financial con-\ntrol. For Culbertson remounted, financial intermediaries create close money-\nsubstitutes (p. 129). And now he would *want to keep account\" of changes in\nthe volume of these substitutes and of the possible need for regulating them\nnot only by public-debt management but by other devices as well. This is\nthe horse that we too are riding. We welcome Culbertson aboard.\n\nJouwN G. GunLEv\nE. S.

It worries Culbertson that his logic deprives\nthe market for money of a demand schedule, but he does not retract the view\nthat banks are unique in being able to create as much money as they like.\n\nIt worries Culbertson, too, that his contrasts between banks and other\nintermediaries deprive the market for the latter's debt of a supply schedule.\nAfter stating categorically that intermediaries \"cannot control the volume of\ntheir outstanding obligations,\" he adds, although they can influence their\nsales, by altering quality of service, intensity of advertising, or profit margins\"\n(p. 00). If this means anything, it means that the volume of debt produced\nby these intermediaries is determined by a supply as well as by a demand\nfunction and that the intermediaries are not, after all, mere taps to be turned\non or off by the saving public.\n\nThe supply function, then, is not wholly determining on the money market.\nThe demand function is not wholly determining on the market for indirect\nfinancial assets. Moreover, Culbertson concedes, the latter assets can be\nsubstitutes for money (note 7 and p. 129), and their creation can result in ex-\ncess money. When Culbertson has finished with these concessions, what re-\nmains of his view that the banking system is unique and that our conception\nof the banking system is \"radical\"?\n\nA decade ago, when stabilization of long-term interest rates was the goal\nof monetary policy, it was frequently said that the Federal Reserve had \"lost\ncontrol\" of the money supply. But it loses control in precisely the same way\nwhen it pursues a policy of price or output or employment stabilization. The\nmoney supply is a \"tap\" issue, adapted to a policy goal and to the demand\nfor money in a way compatible with that goal. If the monetary system is\nunique, the reason cannot be that its output is independent of demand while\nthe output of other intermediaries is controlled by demand.\n\n5. Under present financial arrangements, banks are subject to a form of\ncontrol that is not applied, in peacetime, to other industries, financial or\nnonfinancial. One raw material, reserves,\" is rationed or allocated to the\nbanking system. The input coefficient relating reserves to money output is\nspecified, as a reserve requirement. These direct controls define production\ncapacity which, the assumption goes, is always short of output that the banks\nwould wish to produce: the banks are a *disequilibrium system.\" Such con-\ntrols may be familiar to the banking system alone in peacetime, but few\nindustries escape them under wartime conditions.\n\nWe have suggested that comparable direct controls should be applied to\nthe supply function of other financial intermediaries. In some degree, the\ndebt they create is a substitute for money. In some degree, hence, their\nexpansion results in excess money. Perhaps such expansion can and should\nbe restrained\u2014by rationing of reserves and stipulation of a reserve require-\nment, so that the entire brunt of protecting bond and commodity markets\nagainst excess demands will not be borne by the monetary system.\n\nCulbertson does not approve this suggestion. First, he interprets it to mean\nthat we would exempt the banks from control, lifting the harness of direct\ncontrols onto other intermediaries (pp. 124, 131). That is not our position. The\n", "137\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "5": ["the desired increments in net financial assets that balance excesses of income\nover consumption. Savers do not want money, and investors want it only\nto pay it out on the commodity markets. In short, there is no demand for\nmoney, and all money is excess money. In their own distinctive ways, J. B.\nSay and J. M. Culbertson have wrought havoc with the money-demand func-\ntion. Say would have savers content with any amount of real balances. Cul-\nbertson would have savers demand no real balances. According to the earlier\nof these landmarks of monetary theorizing, the price level is indeterminate:\naccording to the latter, money is desired by neither savers nor investors, there\nis no demand for money, money is valueless, and the price level is infinite.\n\nThe profession of economics has two conceptions of the saving-investment\nprocess. In income and employment theory, savings are a difference between\nincome and consumption, a rise in savers! net worth, a gain in their net finan-\ncial assets. The net financial assets are tickets of participation in investment,\nsupplied to savers by investors. On this definition, savings may take the form\npartly or wholly of increases in money balances (one variety of ticket for\nsavers to accumulate), and the monetary system as an intermediary transmits\nreal purchasing power over current output (o\u00a3 money balances) from savers\nto investors. This is the conception of saving-investment that Culbertson, with\nus in mind, dismisses as \"their terminology\" (p. 122). In Culbertson's \"existing\nbanking theory,\" savings are decreases in money balances of savers and in-\ncreases in savers' nonmonetary financial assets, and the monetary system has\nunlimited power to enlarge the flow of money to investment. In the former\nview, savings are always equal to investment ex Post, and there may be\nequality ex ante when the money supply is rising, falling, or unchanged. In\nthe latter, savings are equal to investment only when the money supply is\nvalueless. Existing banking theory,\" one gathers, has not been touched by\ndevelopments in income and employment theory these past twenty years\nand more. For so long as savings are interpreted by (financial) economists\nas increases in any asset but money, and by (income-employment) economists\nas the margin between income and consumption, little progress can be expected\nin relating the world of finance to the world of goods.\n\nCulbertson offers a second reason for thinking that the banks are unique.\nThey are not inhibited by \"the public's decisions about holding demand de-\nposits\" (p. 123). True intermediaries, on the contrary, \"cannot control the\nvolume of their outstanding obligations\" (p. 120), and the total of their debt\nis determined for them by savers. In short, there is no relevant demand\nfunction for money and no relevant supply function for other indirect financial\nassets.\n\nAs a monetary economist, Culbertson is impelled to qualify the dictum\nthat demand for balances is irrelevant to the money supply. It is not relevant\nin a way that is \"direct\" or immediate\" or \"natural,\" and it is not determin-\ning unless the central bank is *omniscient\" (p. 123). \"In a sense,\" the au-\nthority's choice of a price level and the public's choice of balances at that\nprice level inhibit the banks, but then the *mechanism\" of inhibition is not\nthe same as that to which other intermediaries are subject. The authority's\nchoice of price level and the public's choice of balances at that price level\n", "136\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "4": ["an excess demand for bonds may \"originate\" in D when that market is in\npartial equilibrium.?\n\n4. Culbertson claims that commercial banks are unique among financial\ninstitutions in several ways. First, they create money. We have to agree with\nthat. Second, they create loanable funds, while other financial intermediaries\nare mere middlemen in this respect. As Culbertson defines loanable funds,\nwe also have to agree with that. His account of how banks create loanable\nfunds\u2014\"acquiring additional debt by creating demand deposits\" (p. 121)\u2014\nis only a reiteration of the first point above, that banks create money. What-\never the combination of words one uses to make the point, banks do create\nmoney.\n\nBut something more than semantics is involved here. Culbertson considers\nit a piece of whimsy on our part that we define loanable funds as savings, in\nthe sense of income earned and not spent on consumption, of an increase in\nSavers! net worth and of an increase in their net financial assets. He prefers\nthe conception that loanable funds are payments of money to investors in\ncapital goods. These payments, for which investors issue direct debt, derive\nfrom two sources. One is \"private act[s] of saving\" (p. 122), and money flow-\ning from this source may flow directly from saver to ultimate borrower or\nindirectly through nonmonetary financial intermediaries and bank time-\ndeposit departments. The second source of moneyflows to investment is money\ncreation by the banking system, through its demand-deposit departments,\non its own initiative and with no by-your-leave to any saver. This definition,\nCulbertson indicates, is a piece of *existing banking theory\" (p. 122), and we\nregret that he is probably quite right in thinking so.\n\nIn Culbertson's image of the saving-investment process, saving is the act\nof paying out money, and savings are decreases in money balances accom-\npanied by accretions of nonmonetary assets. One saves by getting rid of\nmoney, and moncy rejected by savers ?/4s money created by banks are the\nloanable funds that finance investment.\n\nIf we interpret Culbertson correctly, that the saving process which finances\ninvestment consists of replacing money balances with *nonmonetary debt\"\n(pp. 121, 122), it must be concluded that his views on saving are disastrous for\nmonetary theory and are incompatible with income and employment theory.\nOn his rule that savers repel money, holdings of money can be no part of\n\nmoney balances over to the savings and loan associations, receiving in return $10 in\nshares. The public's demand for bonds is not changed; the banks' demand for bonds is\nnot changed; but the savings and loan associations express a demand of $10 for bonds\n(assuming the associations wish no reserves) that is excess demand at the initial bond\nrate of interest. The market for shares is continuously in partial equilibrium, but it\n\"originates\" a general disturbance in markets for money, bonds, and possibly goods.\n\n* Culbertson advances a third line of attack against our views on interest theory by\ncomparing our interpretation of interest-rate behavior in 1915-1921 with a \"more orthodox\nexplanation\" (p. 130). The rise in rates over these years he attributes to \"the unusually\nrapid increase in the volume of outstanding debt.\" We are wondering how this version\nof \"orthodoxy\" would account for the fall in rates during 1940-1045 when the volume\nof outstanding debt rose even more rapidly. For a monetary economist, Culbertson is\nremarkably reticent about the role of monetary policy as it a\u00edfected interest rates in\n1915-1921.\n", "135\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["direct debt, nonmonetary indirect debt, and money\u2014whether they are substi-\ntutes, complements, or unrelated goods\u2014 an increase in the supply of the first\ntwo lowers, raises or does not a\u00edfect the demand schedule for money. If one\nis interested in explaining the growth of all financial intermediaries including\nthe monetary system, as real growth generates direct debt, our tripartite\nframework is useful whatever the relationships among the three assets. Cul-\nbertson is wrong, then, in saying, \"In order to justify using the concepts of\n*direct debt\" and 'indirect debt,\" then, the authors must show that all types of\nobligations of [nonmonetary] intermediaries substitute for money to a greater\ndegree than do all types of 'direct debt.'\" If this special relationship did\nhold, it would mean one thing for the growth of the monetary system and\nof other financial intermediaries. Other possible relationships, including\ncomplementarity between money and nonmonetary indirect debt, would yield\nother results. The usefulness of the analytical framework does not depend\non any particular set of relationships, as we attempted to point out in Aspects\"\n(pp. 528-29).\n\n3. Culbertson offers two criticisms of our comments on the theory of\ninterest. To make these clear, suppose that there are four goods in the econ-\nomy, commodities (4), direct debt (B), money (C) and nonmonetary indirect\ndebt (.D). Interest theory bears on the price of B. Culbertson's first argument\nis that the 4-B-C-D framework is unrealistic because the composition and\naverage liquidity of B and D change over time, and these changes cannot be\ntaken into account within our framework. Since we have taken them into\naccount in our published work, though no doubt imperfectly, and since Cul-\nbertson is aware of the fact in some degree (note 18), we turn to his second\nargument.*\n\nThe second argument is that shifts in demand schedules for D, or changes\nin amounts demanded as a result of shifts in supply schedules, cannot lead\nto excess demands or supplies at prevailing yields in B and C unless the market\nfor D moves into disequilibrium (p. 130). And since issues of D are apparently\ntap issues, this market cannot be in disequilibrium. Hence changes in amount\nof D demanded cannot affect the rate of interest on B\u2014-or the price level on\nA. This argument misses the point that an increase in demand for D may be\npartly at the expense of money and so create an excess supply of money (and\nan excess demand for direct debt, as nonmonetary intermediaries bid for it),\neven though the market for D is in equilibrium.?

Reference to changes in the quality of direct securities and to the impact of such\nchanges on demand for money may be found not only in Culbertson's own citations to\nour work but also, for example, in \"The Growth of Debt and Money in the United\nStates, 1800-1950; A Suggested Interpretation,\" Rev. Econ. Stat. Aug. 1957, XXXIX,\n252 and 259. Studies nearly ready for publication explore this matter at length. The article\ncited above is even more explicit on the subject of changes in the quality of nonmonetary\nindirect debt. See, for example, pp. 252, 255, 259, and 261.\n\n?

On what basis is this choice made? With a\nfew reservations (e.g., \"irrational behavior\"), Culbertson believes that it is\nmade solely on the liquidity-illiquidity basis. We disagree. The term liquidity\npreference suggests that allocations of funds to money balances are determined\nby the marginal advantage of liquidity over illiquidity. But in highly differ-\nentiated security markets, this is only a part of the story. As we have used\nthe term, diversification (which is \"portfolio balance\" for others) is meant\nto call attention to the fact that money is not desired just because it is more\nliquid than something else, and other financial assets are not desired simply\nbecause their illiquidity has been overcome by the bond rate of interest.\nRather, a particular stock of money is wanted because the marginal dollar\nin money balances provides more utility, in terms of liquidity, than the same\nmarginal dollar would provide, when invested in other financial assets, in\nterms of income, liquidity, corporate control, patriotic satisfaction, insurance,\nor dozens of other portfolio attributes. Liquidity preference does not do justice\nto the complexities of choice between money and more or less highly differ-\nentiated financial assets.\n\nAfter all, economists do not reason so narrowly when it comes to the\nallocation of funds in other ways. They do not have an \"intoxication-prefer-\nence\" theory of liquor; a dollar may be allocated to liquor because of its\ncapacity to intoxicate, but if instead the dollar is allocated to clothing it is not\nbecause the price of clothing has overcome the lesser ability of clothing to\nintoxicate. Intoxication preference\" would not do justice to the intricacies of\nconsumer choice in allocating the consumption budget, and by the same token\nliquidity preference falls short of explaining how much money is desired in\nfinancial portfolios.\n\nWe group financial assets to fit our problems and then explain the public's\nChoices on the basis of the many attributes\u2014liquidity being only one\u2014that\nhighly differentiated financial assets have. Direct debt may become more\nor less attractive, for many reasons, relative to monetary or nonmonetary\nindirect debt. A changing mixture of direct debt hence can affect demands\nfor indirect debt and so the growth of financial intermediaries. That we have\ntaken this into account is both acknowledged and denied by Culbertson\n(pp. 129, 130 and note 18). Moreover, the usefulness of our framework, for\nstudying the conformation of financial growth, does not require, as Culbertson\ninsists, that the public think in terms of \"direct\" or \"indirect\" assets. People\nchoose between assets according to their (explicit and imputed) yields and\nprices and, accordingly as this choice favors assets we choose to call indirect,\nfinancial intermediaries experience relatively rapid growth. Culbertson credits\nliquidity-preference analysis with \"definite logic,\" though he would hardly\nbe prepared to allege that the terminology of liquidity-preference analysis\nwas taken over by economists intact from the market place.\n\nWhen indirect debt is broken into its monetary and nonmonetary com-\nponents, it is clear that the public's choices between direct and indirect assets\nhave significant consequences not only for financial intermediaries generally\nbut also for the monetary system.

Our comments follow this\norder.\n\n1. Money is unique in the sense that no other financial asset is exactly like\nit. But as much, or rather as little, could be said for any financial asset. The\nimportant consideration here for monetary, interest, and price-level theory\nis how the demand for money is affected by demand for and terms of supply\nof other financial assets. And on this point we share the general belief with\nCulbertson that money has many close substitutes. He cites as examples\ntreasury bills, time deposits, savings bonds, and savings and loan shares. To\nthe extent that such substitutes are available, then, the demand for money\nis less than it otherwise would be. This is the essential point: the \"uniqueness\nof money\" is a red herring.\n\n2. The manner in which financial assets are to be grouped or ranked de-\npends on the problem. A way of grouping financial assets that is appropriate\nfor one array of problems does not preclude other ways that bear on different\nproblems. Our main interests are in analyzing the relationship between real\ngrowth and financial growth, in isolating the function of intermediation for\nspecial study, and in considering the relative roles during the growth process\nof monetary and nonmonetary intermediaries. Since the accumulation of\ndirect (or primary) debt almost inevitably accompanies real growth, and\nsince a principal function of the monetary system and other financial inter-\nmediaries is to purchase direct debt from and issue indirect debt to non-\nfinancial spending units, the framework of direct and indirect debt seems\nadmirably suited to our interests.\n\nWe do not object to other schemes for classifying financial assets. The\ndifference between equity and debt, ambiguous though it is, can be useful in\nstudying business organization, business incentive and motivation, or stability\nof business income and spending. The difference between short-term and long-\nterm securities, arbitrary as it is, is relevant to study of the interest-rate\nstructure. A ranking of financial assets along a liquidity spectrum may be\nuseful in explaining asset-holders' behavior on the commodity markets, which\nmay or may not be the problem Culbertson has in mind (he never says) when\nhe advocates such a procedure. All of these methods can be useful, but to\nimply, as Culbertson does, that one has to settle once and for all on money-\nbonds, liquidity-illiquidity, direct-indirect, or some fourth or nth grouping\nand stick with it through thick or thin without stipulating the purpose for\nwhich it is used, is to miss the mark completely.\n", "Reply\n", "132\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"]}}, "content_type": "Reply", "authors": ["John G.
