The postwar era in Europe has seldom been faced with this problem.\nIt is therefore hardly surprising that, with the Keynesian problem of unem-\nployment largely solved, a chief means of increasing output should be to\nimprove the allocation of resources. Thus \u00edar it is difficult to disagree with\nEgon Sohmen [2]. However, his main thesis\u2014that the rapid growth achieved\nin the West German economy can be attributed firstly to the degree of\ncompetitiveness achieved by virtue of Allied \"trust busting\" and secondly\nto the orthodox monetary policies pursued by West German governments\u2014is\nmuch more difficult to accept.\n\nIn view of all the clamor about the German \"miracle\" of postwar growth,\nit would be well to keep this achievement in proper perspective.

Here Germany's performance appears\nmuch less spectacular, and on this basis she ranks lower than Austria, France\nand Italy.\n\nIn Sohmen's judgment the linkage of greater \"competition\" with *more\nefficient resource allocation\" and hence with growth, is quite firm.\n\nMonocausal explanations of unusual phenomena are always suspect, and\n\n'! Reliable figures are available only from 1950 onward. As Sohmen notes, the antitrust\nand anticartel policies are rapidly fading, and so 1957 was chosen as the terminal year.

Few would deny that competition may spur growth. But Sohmen's\ndismissal of another\u2014and some would argue more powerful\u2014factor cannot\nbe left unchallenged. This is simply the very high ratio of capital formation\nto gross national product in the Federal Republic. If the United Kingdom\nand the Federal Republic are taken as two economies in similar stages of\neconomic development, the difference is striking. Over the years 1950 to\n1958 inclusive, gross domestic fixed capital formation (in machinery and\nequipment) took 8.4 per cent of the United Kingdom's gross national product\nat factor cost in 1954 prices, and no less than 13.1 per cent of that of the\nFederal Republic. It would be surprising if this factor alone did not account\nfor most, if not all, of the difference between the rates of growth in the two\ncountries.\n\nThese figures conceal the really important ones, viz. the amounts of re-\nsources devoted to et investment. One would expect that the ratio of replace-\nment investment to gross investment would be much lower in Germany than\nin the United Kingdom since the war, simply because of much greater de-\nstruction and dismantling of existing equipment during and immediately after\nthe war. The data support this view. In the years 1954 to 1958, the propor-\ntion of replacement investment in gross investment in Germany averaged 42\nper cent, and in the United Kingdom 54 per cent [2] [3]. Thus a given vol-\nume of real resources devoted to fixed capital formation in these years pro-\nduced a much larger addition to existing production facilities in Germany than\nin the United Kingdom. One would guess that this was an even stronger\ntendency in the earlier years of the 1950's.\n\nHow was it done? One can conveniently distinguish between the factors\nthat caused this high rate of capital formation, and those that permitted it.\nThe former are obvious\u2014the need to reconstruct, the desire to satisfy the\ncompelling export demand for the sort of goods Germany can supply, the com-\nmon urge of businessmen to control larger rather than smaller units, and so on.\n\n! Sohmen's implied refutation of this view by taking Norway as an example of a country\nwith an even higher rate of capital formation but a lower rate of economic expansion, of\ncourse, fails. As a matter of policy, the Norwegian authorities, faced with an economy\npossessing limited natural resources, have deliberately promoted investment in shipbuilding\nand public utilities, both with a high capital-output ratio. If there had been other more\n\"profitable\" outlets, they would doubtless have been preferred.

Some scholars (e.g., J\u00fcrgen Kuczynski)\nbelieve Marx proved that the real wage would fall and claim by empirical\nstatistical observation to verify this law of immiserization of the proletariat;\nother scholars (such as Maurice Dobb, perhaps?) seem to argue that, with ex-\nceptions, this was Marx's view about competitive capitalism but that it came\nto be falsified by historical reality primarily because of the growth in political\nand economic powers of trade unions and the working class; still other schol-\nars (notably Thomas Sowell in the March 1960 issue of this Review) argue\nwith considerable persuasiveness that in his major economic writings, Marx\ndid not conclude that the real wage per hour or day would decline under com-\npetitive capitalism. I claim no competence or interest in such doctrinal history.\n", "tion and improvement of machinery) . . . (Capital, Vol. III, p. 256; my\nitalics)\n\nMore fundamental to this discussion, however, is the question: Did Marx\nactually hold to a fixed coefficients of production model?

While many of\n\nthese clearly depict technological change in the production function rather\n\nthan movement within one function, the fact that the old methods are\nstill known along with the new shows that Marx and Ricardo definitely\nenvisage the existence of more than one technique.\n\nMarx was obscure in his discussion of this matter. In Marx's analysis of the\nrate of profit however, one finds \"averaging\" of organic compositions of capital\nin a specific sphere of production\u2014thereby implying the presence of variable\ncoefficients (Capital, Vol. III, pp. 182-85). So Samuelson's assumption of fixed\ncoefficients of production is not always warranted.\n\n4. Concluding Remarks. Samuelson's exposition attributes assumptions to\nMarx (e.g., the rate of profit is a function of time; the market economy is\ncharacterized by instantaneous price adjustments; foresight is perfect; and\ncoeffcients of production are fixed) which differ more or less from those to\nwhich Marx seemed to adhere. Samuelson's findings, though quite valid on the\npremises postulated, are not accurately descriptive of Marx's system.\n\nFnrED M. GorruEIL*\n\n*'The author is assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois. He is\nindebted to J. J. Spengler for discussion of the paper.\n", "719\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "4": ["old technology, since 7\" is a sequel to recourse to the new technique. If both\nthe new and old techniques are available, and uniform prices are assumed, the\nold technique is no longer profitable, since the price of the product has fallen\nwith the introduction of the new technique. Therefore, in Samuelson's ex-\nample, if the old technique is used labor is \u00bbo\u00a3 better off; it may even be in\na less favorable position. If one incorporates in the above equation the Marx-\nian assumption that r is a function of the state of applied technology one may\nselect certain values for the variables in the equation which permit falling\nrates of profit and falling real wages to be compatible. If r were determined\nby some exogenous factor (e.g., time or *ripening\") Samuelson's assumption\nwould be legitimate. Such assumptions, however, lie outside the framework of\nMarxian theory.\n\n3. Changing Factor Proportions and Prices. Samuelson describes what may\nhappen to factor prices and factor shares when their relative supplies (or\nrates of growth) change, given a situation in which the technical coefficients\nof production are rigidly fixed. He writes (p. 900):\n\nIn this case where capital goods have ceased growing as fast as labor, the\nrate of profit has risen to become all of the product. So bizarre a result\ncame from the bizarre assumption of fixed coefficients.\n\nOn the following page he adds (p. 901):\n\nThe Marxian model with fixed coefficients presents some quite pathologi-\ncal features. For if the attempt to accumulate were to cause physical ma-\nchines K to grow relative to fixed labor L, the machines would become\nredundant in supply and their rents would fall immediately to zero.\n\nMarx would have objected to such statements of the matter. In the Marxian\nmodel, the growth rates of K and L depend upon relative factor prices. If K\nincreases more rapidly than L (Samuelson's example), wages increase concur-\nrently with the decline in the price of capital. The total effect of the price\nchange, however, is not instantaneous or as great as Samuelson assumes. Price\nchanges of L and K, in the Marxian system, induce qualitative changes in\ninnovations, and these ultimately counteract the initial price changes. For\nexample, suppose that, compatibly with the Marxian model, K becomes super-\nfluous. Capitalists would obviously switch to more capital-using techniques of\nproduction. 'This *deepening\" of capital would make K more scarce (increasing\nthe price of K) and L relatively more abundant (decreasing the price of L,\nLe., wages). Thus Marx explained the more rapid introduction of machinery\ninto the American than into the English economy (Capital, Vol. I, pp. 429-30).\nElsewhere he writes:\n\nA momentary excess of the surplus-capital over the laboring population\ncontrolled by it would have a twofold effect. It would, on the one hand,\nmitigate the conditions, which decimate the offspring of the laboring class\nand would facilitate marriages among them, by raising wages. Tris would\ntend to increase the laboring population. On the other hand, it would em-\nploy the methods by which relative surplus-value is created (introduc-\n", "718\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "3": ["Samuelson states, *A technical improvement must be an improvement or it\nwill not be introduced into a perfect-competition market economy . . .\" (p.\n894). By improvement he means a change resulting in either an increase in\nreal wages or in the rate of profit. Thus, he suggests that a rational capitalist\nwould not employ a technique that depresses r, or, that in a labor-dominated\neconomy, labor would not select a technique that diminishes (w/5;) real\nwages.\n\nMarx's market economy, however, differs from Samuelson's. Marx assumes\nthe presence of temporary monopoloid market structures. These structures are\na prerequisite to innovation, the means through which greater profits (Marx's\n\"surplus profits\") may be earned. It is this possibility of realizing surplus\nprofits (monopoly profits) that induces capitalists to innovate. These surplus\nprofits, however, do not persist. Competition, in the Marxian model, compels\ncapitalists to adopt available innovations, hence supplies increase and their\nprice falls to a lower equilibrium (cost of production) level. As a result sur-\nplus profits are eliminated; only surplus value, attained by the \"exploitation\nof labor-power,\" remains. Since Marx assumes that the employment of labor-\npower decreases with the introduction of new techniques, the amount of sur-\nplus value realized may be less with the new than with the older technique. So\nMarx, in Volume III of Cafital, attempts to resolve the \"paradox\" or \"rid-\ndle\" of capitalist production, namely that the capitalist's quest for higher\nprofit rates results in diminished rates of profit. Only by assuming temporary\nmonopoly conditions in the market economy does Marx arrive at this seem-\ningly paradoxical conclusion, and its corollary that capitalists do not revert\nto the old technique of production, even if it had formerly been more reward-\ning, because the now prevailing (lowered) price no longer permits the higher\nprofits formerly associated with use of the old technique. The new position,\nthough less favorable than the old, still is the best to be had.\n\nSamuelson \"proves\" the incompatibility of falling profits and falling real\nwages through recourse to the new theorem. First, he sets down the reciprocal\nof his equation (6) to show that, with specified values for a, a; and 5, 5;\n(the labor and capital coefficients), a decline in the rate of profit (r) must\nproduce an increase in real wages (2/52) :\n\n[7 1\u2014 b(1-4r)\n\nf\u00bb a4 n[t \u2014 bY(1-- 7] Tay rb 4 r7)\nHowever, as Samuelson notes, Marx, by introducing technological change,\nmakes necessary a relaxation of the assumption of fixed ai, a; and 5i, b;. Yet,\n\neven with changing coef\u00fccients, Samuelson asserts, the incompatibility con-\ntinues to prevail (p. 894):\n\nRemember that in a perfectly competitive market it really doesn't matter\nwho hires whom: so have labor hire \"capital,\" paying the new market\nrate of interest 7' \u00ab 7; then labor could always use the old technology\nand paying less than r get better than the old real wage.\n\nIn Samuelson's example the old technology is assumed to yield the new\nrate 7\".

Time, in the sense of a process of *ripening,\" is nowhere found\nin Marxian price theory. Samuelson, however, suggests the presence, as a rule,\nof such a process in Marx's model. He writes (p. 887):\n\nOnly under special, and unrealistic, market assumptions can the competi-\ntive supply and demand relations be expected to ignore these timing rela-\ntions. . ..\n\nHe develops Marx's rate of profit on the basis of the difference between\nripened and unripened products (p. 887):\n\nThe fundamental factor relating unripened product today to ripened prod-\nuct one period from now is the market interest rate r (or what Ricardo\nand Marx would call the rate of profit, a pure percentage per period).\n\n'This \"ripening\" time, though present in Samuelson's Marxian model, does\nnot appear in any guise in the model Marx endeavored to use.\n\n2. Profits and Wages. Prefacing his discussion on the incompatibility of\nfalling profits and falling real wages, Samuelson writes (p. 892):\n\n. . we must tackle directly the question of what accumulation will tend\nto do to r, basing ourselves on the actual behavior equations of competi-\ntive capitalism.\n\nBut the question arises: do Samuelson's \"actual\" behavior equations accu-\nrately represent the behavior equations employed by Marx?? The answer\nseems to be in the negative. The contrast between Marx's and Samuclson's\nequations stand out in the latter's formulation of a new theorem respecting\ntechnological change under perfect competition.\n\n'Samuelson uses the following symbols: Y and K, output in consumer and capital\n\u00a3oods industries; (a;b:) (a\u00bbb:), labor and capital coefficients of production in capital\nand consumer goods industries; f,\u00bb cost of production of capital and consumer goods;\nLjL:; the quantity of labor employed in capital and consumer goods industries; w,\nthe wage-rate; and r, the rate of profit.

The credit extended by such institutions represents a substantial\nproportion of the volume of institutional credit outside of Federal Re-\nserve control and has been growing at a very rapid rate. In fact, credit\nbased upon savings deposits now exceeds credit based upon demand de-\nposits. Savings and demand deposits are close asset substitutes, and a\nlack of control or an inadequate control over the institutions issuing\nsavings deposits has raised serious problems regarding both the effec-\ntiveness and the equity of Federal Reserve policy.\n\n* The author is associate professor of economics, University of Minnesota.\n"}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["James M.

But the elaboration of this theory\nto include multiple-product firms has made little progress since the\nfamous Pigou-Taussig controversy in 1912-1913 [3]. Since most of the\nfirms dealt with by the applied economist produce a number of com-\nmodities or services, he has much difficulty in applying the theory to the\ndata (see, for example [1, p. 339 ]). One particularly acute difficulty arises\nfrom the allocation of joint costs. Theory suggests that we calculate the\nmarginal cost of each product separately by holding the quantity of\nothers constant while we increase the production of one product by a\nsingle unit. To find the most profitable mix of products we need to\nequate marginal cost and marginal revenue for each product.! There is\nno \"allocation of joint costs\" involved directly in this procedure; it has\nall been taken into account in calculating marginal cost.\n\nTo estimate costs we need to know how total costs change as outputs\nchange. Now it is extremely rare that the cost investigator finds enough\nobservations of outputs and total cost to enable him to estimate the\nrelationship between total cost and the various levels of output.

Political reality indicates that even\nwithin a single government's over-all policy program internally conflicting and\noffsetting measures are often encountered. Even more likely is it that, when\ntwo or more independently organized and overlapping governmental units\nenact economic policy measures simultaneously over the domain of the same\neconomy, the separate governmental units may have sharply conflicting policy\nobjectives as well as different constitutionally determined powers of action. In\npolitical federalism, conflicts between the national government and the state or\nregional government units seem certain to occur. In such a political setting, the\neconomist's tools may be quite helpful in suggesting ways and means through\nwhich a separate governmental unit may take action to offset or negate the\neffects of policy measures taken by an overlapping jurisdiction. The possibility\nthat action taken by the separate states may serve to offset national govern-\nment policy which is contrary to the interest of the national economy, has not\nbeen adequately considered.

I\nagree with many of his statements, but I view his facts in a perspective differ-\nent from his.\n\n1. I agree that my model would correspond to reality more fully if availa-\nbility of birth control had been included as a variable. The Japanese case is a\nhighly pertinent one. Still further, the differential desires of men and of women\nare pertinent, and the psychic costs of birth control methods might well be\nanalyzed separately from their impact on births. If a method of birth control at\nlow psychic and economic cost were readily available to women, I do not doubt\nthat the lag between decline in death rates and that in birth rates would be\ngreatly reduced. However, the model would be greatly complicated by such\nconsiderations.\n\nThe facts that the rate of population declined in the United Kingdom after\n1869-1879, in France after 1855-1865, and in Russia after 1870-1885 are not,\nI suspect, explained by increasing availability of birth control, and the per-\nsistence today of high population growth rates in many countries where death\nrates were cut sharply ten or fifteen years ago indicates that birth control is\nnot apt to spread rapidly everywhere today. Hence I think that the simpler\nmodel is of analytical importance.\n\nMoreover, I do think that psychological attitudes, as distinguished from\navailability of birth control methods, are very important.

I gather that while Hagen is inclined to deplore the extent to which our\nincreasing productivity is being devoted to the production of children, he is\nnot worried even for \"the very long run\"\u2014 partly because of his faith in\ntechnological progress and partly because he is not bothered by the prospect\nthat 99.9 per cent of our population may in the future be living elsewhere than\non earth. I think it is important to be clear on the magnitude and timing of the\nproblem technology will have to solve. Let us conservatively assume that the\npopulation of the United States grows in the future at no more than a 1.3 per\ncent rate (the top of Hagen's range). I doubt if I would get widespread support\nfor a proposal to invite the entire present world population to come live in the\nUnited States. At a 1.3 per cent rate of increase the same result will be\nachieved by 2170.

I take it that Hagen offers his hypothesis regarding inculcations before\nsix in an effort to explain the observed lag between the fall in death and birth\nrates. I very much doubt whether a satisfactory explanation of the lag is possi-\nble unless the availability of birth control and abortion is brought into the\npicture\u2014though this will o\u00a3 provide a full explanation and in fact is itself in\nneed of ultimate explanation. I shall cite only three bits of evidence. The birth\nrate first declined among those with higher income, who obviously were among\nthe first with access to birth control information. Secondly, the great reduction\nin the differential between the birth rates of those with high and low incomes\nthat has recently taken place coincides with evidence from a recent sample\nsurvey that 90 per cent of fertile white married couples now use some form of\nbirth control. And, thirdly, the fact that very large families\u2014five children and\nover\u2014have declined all through the sharp postwar rise in birth rates appears\nonly capable of explanation in terms of increasing availability of birth control.\n\n3. It seems unfair to Malthus to suggest that his model implies that the\n*birth rate is not influenced by the level of income\" (p. 322). Surely Malthus\nwould not have denied the impact of income on birth rates under conditions\nsuch as presently prevail in Japan. If he reached a different conclusion, it was\nonly because he was prepared to allow income\u2014or anything else\u2014to influence\nbirth rates only by encouraging continence or postponing marriage. With the\npossible exception of postponed marriage in Ireland, is there any evidence that,\nif these are the only acceptable techniques, he was wrong?\n\n4. Hagen suggests that birth rates are likely to fall to a level close to that of\ndeath rates, yielding a \"fairly low\" positive rate of increase varying between\n.5 and 1.3 per cent per year. He quotes Notestein to the effect that \"Western\nEurope and the English-speaking countries\" are tending toward a birth rate\n'115 per cent above the secular minimum\" with \"the conspicuous exception of\nfive countries\" where the rate is considerably higher (p. 324). I wish Hagen\nhad devoted more time to a discussion of the probable future behavior of birth\nrates. Keep in mind that what he brands \"exceptions\" include perhaps four-\nffths of all English-speaking people and perhaps 40 per cent of the total\npopulation in question.? Particularly if we continue to have enough illegitimate\nchildren to provide infertile couples with two or three children via adoption,\nan average three-child family involves substantial population growth and an\naverage four-child family very rapid growth. It seems to me that, for a con-\nsiderable period, the private benefits of having a third or even a fourth child\nare likely to exceed the private cost. Further, if Hagen's expectations regarding\ntechnological progress are realized, it seems likely that the rate of population\ngrowth of the \"exceptions,\" where income is higher and expanding more\nrapidly than in the rest of the area, may well come to be the \"rule\" for the\nentire area. In short, there seems no certainty that in the future the rate of\nincrease of developed areas will be \"fairly low.\" Nor do I see any reason for\n\n3T have taken \"Western Europe\" to mean non-iron-curtain Europe excluding Greece and\nYugoslavia.\n", "439\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "1": ["Population and Economic Growth: Comment\n\n1.

In this role, the wage-lag axiom constitutes\nthe foundation of a theory of industrial development.\n\n2. The lag of wages behind prices caused by inflation accentuates\noscillations in the general level of economic activity. The failure of\nwages to keep pace with prices reinforces disequilibrating movements\nin the general level of economic activity. In this capacity, the wage-lag\naxiom functions as an integral part of both overinvestment and under-\nconsumption business cycle theories [14, p. 137 and ff.].\n\nThe contention that inflation causes real wages to fall appears fre-\nquently in the literature of economics. Those who make this contention\nargue in effect that inflation produces a negative correlation between\nreal wages on the one hand and money wages and prices on the other.\nAs a practical matter, it is extremely difficult to employ this idea as a\ntool of analysis for understanding observed movements of time series\nof wages and prices. This difficulty stems from the fact that, as almost\neveryone would agree, the level of real wages can be affected by such\nreal forces as the relative supplies of labor and capital, the quality of\nthe labor force, the pattern of final demands in the economy, and the\nstate of the arts. Furthermore, increases in the general price level can\nbe produced by changes in the real stock of goods, e.g., by droughts,\nplagues, wars, etc., even with a fixed money stock. For any time series\nof real wages, there exists a fantastically difficult problem of imputing\nchanges in the level of real wages to one or the other of two classes of\n\n* Alchian is professor of economics at the University of California, Los Angeles and\neconomist at The Rawp Corporation, Santa Monica.

While\nbuyers' inflation is caused by too much spending, i.e., by buyers trying to buy\nmore goods than are available and thereby bidding up prices, sellers! inflation\nis caused by sellers raising prices even in the face of a deficiency of spending.\nA failure to distinguish between the two types of inflation aggravates a prob-\nlem which has become a serious threat to democratic society.\n\n\"The appropriate treatment for buyers' inflation is to cut down the excessive\nspending that causes it. This may be done by a restrictive monetary or fiscal\npolicy. But if restrictive monetary or fiscal policy is used against sellers' infla-\ntion, spending is reduced when it is o\u00a3 excessive, so that we get a deficiency of\ndemand, depression and unemployment. The inflation will continue, however,\nunless the induced depression is severe enough to destroy the power of sellers\nto raise their prices. This may call for more depression than the authorities\nare prepared to impose or the public willing to suffer. We then get insufficient\ndepression to stop the inflation and we suffer from both evils at the same time.\nIn 1958 we seem to have had sufficient depression to stop the inflation, at\nleast temporarily, but this remedy involved a loss of output estimated at some\n$30 billion per annum and it severely reduced our rate of economic growth.\n\nGalbraith has suggested [1, Ch. 13, 21] that we are rich enough to pay this\n\nprice for price stability. But it is not simply a matter of a reduction in our stand-\nard of living; we are involved in a competition with communism for the planet.\nThe failure to provide full employment is a serious handicap in this race. The\nloss of the $30 billion may be responsible for a fatal economizing in our expen-\nditure on defense.

Bach and Ando estimated the distributional burden\nof inflation by measuring the monetary assets and liabilities of various income\ngroups. They have shown that while the government sector is the most im-\nportant net debtor, the household sector is a net creditor. This is true about\nthe sector as a whole and about each income group within this sector. How-\never, different income groups were discovered to have different ratios of mone-\ntary assets to liabilities. The closer this ratio is to unity, the smaller is said\nto be the loss caused by inflation.\n\nThe conclusion that everybody loses by inflation in proportion to his net\n1oney assets is not fully satisfactory, because it rests on the implicit assump-\ntion that the alternative to the burden of inflation is no burden at all. Actually,\nthe real alternative facing the public is whether to bear the cost of inflation\nor the cost of some economic policy designed to achieve equilibrium through\nother means: direct controls, or monetary policy, or fiscal policy, or some\ncombination of all. Even if inflation originated completely with the consumer\nand thus could be prevented by the use of self-restraint, the burden of the\nadditional self-restraint needed to prevent inflation would have to be taken\ninto consideration.\n\nIn this paper I shall compare the distributional burden of inflation with the\ndistributional burden of taxation.

Even\nwhen they continue to make the same product, firms do not purchase, at the\nend of a machine's lifetime, a machine identical to that which wore out. And\nthe significant nature of productive capacity as a requisite for current income\n(or net national product) is that it provides the shifting and altering bundle\nof goods and services which consumers demand. Economists frequently suggest\nreplacement cost as a basis for figuring aggregate capital consumption al-\nlowances, but this overlooks the basic fact that replacement rarely takes place.\nTn fact, our present capital consumption allowances are imperfect not because\ndepreciation allowances based on original cost do not match replacement costs,\nbut because our concept demands that the entire capital structure, not just\nthat which wears out in the current year, should be revalued each year in\nterms of its potential to satisfy current tastes and preferences. In 1958, $28\nbillion, or 88 per cent of the total funds invested by corporations, was spent\non plant and equipment. There are no data to divide these expenditures into\nreplacement, expanded capacity, or wholly new forms of capital. Any attempt\nto do so requires an impossible definition\u2014that of the word new.\" But leading\nfirms take pride in their sales of products which did not exist a decade ago,\nand the growth in productivity is attributed to technological change and\nnew capital equipment.\n\nConsequently, let us abolish the notion that depreciation has anything to\ndo with replacement. From a welfare point of view, we should not want our\ncapital replaced from year to year. Rather, we want it changed as our prefer-\nences change. From a productivity point of view, we want our capital im-\nproved, not replaced. And from the point of view of describing the accounting\npractices of individual firms, we are contradicting the express pronouncements\nof the accountants themselves.\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "158\n"], "4": ["structed indices to deflate current dollar figures have been argued at length.\nThe consensus seems to be [4], reflecting the accountants' reliance on the\nprinciple of complete disclosure, that attempts to explain the effects of price\nchanges are indeed worthy, but that such explanations should, for now at least,\nremain supplementary. Conventional accounting statements record the dollars\nand cents of transactions which have in fact occurred. No one interpretation,\nstemming from the problem of price changes or from any other single problem,\nshould be allowed to supplant these basic data.\n\nThe economist has a perennial concern with real, as opposed to money,\nvalues, and a current concern with the influence of changing price levels upon\ncapital investment. But the emphasis on depreciation charges as a means of\nreplacement of plant and equipment within the firm leads to a misleading\nanalysis of the capital consumption allowances, based on business depreciation\nfigures, which are deducted from the gross national product.\n\nNational income or output can be estimated to measure welfare or to meas-\nure productivity, and some of the differences implied in the two concepts have\nbeen explored at length. From a welfare point of view (if you believe in free-\ndom of consumer's choice) government expenditures on goods and services\ndiffer from business or consumption expenditures because consumers are not\nfree to choose, by money votes, what government services will be produced,\nand because taxes must be paid. From the productivity angle, government\nproduct equals government purchases of goods and services because no market\nprice exists for the output of government. The same problem arises in estimat-\ning the amount of capital consumed in any one time-period.\n\nConceptually, it is easy to say that current net national product consists of\nthe goods and services currently available for consumption and investment\nafter providing for the maintenance of capacity required to produce the\namount of net national product. *Capital consumption\" therefore would be\nthe current loss in productive capacity of currently valued capital goods. The\nmajor difficulty in measuring this amount, as in measuring the product of gov-\nernment, is that no market prices exist, and hence current dollar figures cannot\nbe used. The textbooks are careful to point out that the \"capital consumption\nallowances\" of the Department of Commerce do not coincide with the concept\nnoted above. For example: *Over a longer period of time, the NNP would be\na better representation of the economy's productivity, if accurate data could\nbe obtained for depreciation and obsolescence allowances\" [9, p. 282]. \"In\nprinciple we must look at some current production of buildings, machinery,\nand so forth as simply the replacement of wear and tear on the outfit we use in\nproduction. . . . Unfortunately, however, our measures of capital consumption\n(the technical term for the using up of durable producers! goods and buildings)\nare very crude\" [6. p. 424].\n\nThe emphasis on replacement, coupled with the incorrect notion that busi-\nness depreciation accounting provides for replacement, allows no concern for\nthe welfare implications of capital consumption allowances, which are worth\nmore stress. Students come to economics convinced of the power of tech-\nnological change in our land, and they find it reiterated throughout any con-\ntemporary introduction to economics. But the essence of technological change\n", "157\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["cumulated?\" If, in fact, the previous condition of making a profit or not mak-\ning losses in excess of depreciation charges has been met, revenues to the firm\nwill provide a ten-year stream of money capital amounting to $1,000 a year.\nThis money capital may be invested in inventories, accounts receivable,\nfixed plant, or the reduction of liabilities. If the firm is profitable, this new\nmoney capital presumably earns income, and at the end of ten years, therefore,\nthe firm will be better off not only by the $1,000 generated yearly, but also\nby the profits earned on this sum during the ten years, so that considerably\nmore than $10,000 will accrue. At only 8 per cent per year, for example, the\nten-year proceeds will amount to $14,487. Furthermore, it seems unrealistic\nto assume that the price doubling took place entirely within the tenth year,\nso that we may expect the firm's management, in expending this yearly $1,000\nof new capital, to have notice of current cost increases, and, presumably, use\nthese in justification of price increases by the firm.!\n\nTextwriters can find some support, of course, in the criticisms of original\ncost depreciation given by business executives. A typical statement from man-\nagement, in answer to a questionnaire from the Journal of Accountancy, reads,\n^I believe most everyone agrees that the increased cost of almost everything\nhas made the provision for depreciation . . . inadequate to serve the purpose\nfor which it was intended; namely, to provide funds for the replacement of\nplant and equipment\" [2, p. 78]. DuPont Vice-President T. Crawley Davis\nwas quoted recently urging the recovery, through depreciation allowances, of\n*the original investment in terms of current purchasing power\" [5, p. 2]. In\n1947 the management of United States Steel, without the approval of their\nindependent auditors, charged extra depreciation expense, beyond that based\non original cost, in order *'to give some recognition to increased replacement\ncosts\" [14]. What chiefly concerns business executives, however, is not the\nabstract problem of analyzing inflation, but the concrete possibility of secur-\ning more favorable tax treatment by altering the definition of allowable de-\npreciation. As Jones points out, *When businessmen say that depreciation is\ninadequate because it does not provide for replacements, they are simply\ntaking an easy short-cut which avoids the complications of a full explanation\"\n[8, p. 81]. The short-cut presents an impressive argument for altering the base\nof the corporation income tax; but such a proposal must be considered on\ngrounds of equity of tax treatment and administrative possibilities, rather than\nbeing adopted because of a misunderstanding of the nature of depreciation.?\nThe elementary texts do not provide the student with an accurate explanation\nof the accounting technique, and they infer rather careless ignorance on the\npart of the accounting profession.\n\nThe problem of how to treat changing price levels in accounting statements\nhas been debated fervently and brilliantly for many years within the account-\ning profession.

The report of a symposium conducted by the Tax Institute [15], illustrates clearly that\nthe present concern over depreciation methods in times of inflation reflects the 52 per cent\n\ncorporation tax rate. It should be remembered that depreciation accounting was generally\naccepted by U.S. business only after the income tax provided a financial incentive to do so.\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "156\n"], "2": ["important. Indeed, during the postwar years, corporate business as a whole\nraised more money in this way than it did through the sales of stocks and\nbonds\" [13, p. 134]. *Depreciation reserves against relatively new equipment\nbecome available for current use. . . . The tremendous size of modern deprecia-\ntion allowances means that the business community . . . may greatly increase\nits productive capacity without ever tapping new outside savings\" [1, p. 180].\n\nBut nowhere in an elementary discussion have I seen reference to the\nobvious but vital fact that it is revenues, not charges, which provide money\ncapital, and that depreciation accounting generates \"internal\" funds only when\nthe firm is making profits, or when its losses do not exceed depreciation ex-\npense. As a result, many students rightfully wonder where, if \"depreciation is\nonly a bookkeeping entry\" and depreciation reserves **do not consist of a pool\nof cash,\" the money does come from, when replacement time rolls around.\n\n\"The 1958 depreciation charges of $34.7 billion amounted to 50 per cent of\ngross private savings, a proportion which has fluctuated in recent years. Of the\ntotal funds available to corporations, $19.6 billion or more than half was\nattributed to depreciation. Another $6.0 billion represented retained profits. As\nfunds to be spent by the firms, both these sums consist of money payments\nby purchasers for the output of corporations. Business prices, and sales, were\n$25.6 billion higher than they would have been if depreciation costs had not\nbeen figured and if the firms had not made profits. The accounting technique\nof charging depreciation is no more responsible for the firm's revenues than\nis the necessity of paying for labor or material. The total funds available for\ninvestment by corporations, some $30 billion, were used to acquire physical\nand financial assets, and to reduce liabilities. But there is no necessary cor-\nrespondence between any one form of investment and any one source of the\nfunds thus spent. Any part of retained profits, or borrowed capital, or money\nacquired through new issues of securities, or the difference between revenues\nand out-of-pocket expenditures which represents depreciation charges, may be\nspent on one or many uses. Replacement of worn-out or obsolete equipment is\nonly one kind of possible capital expenditure, and the means of financing such\nexpenditures bear no relationship to the means of recording the cost of pre-\nvious expenditures. Perhaps the easiest way of emphasizing the lack of cor-\nrespondence would be to review the years during the 30's and during the\nsecond world war, when depreciation charges exceeded expenditures for new\nplant and equipment. In the first period, depreciation charges did not provide\nfunds for replacement because firms made losses, and their revenues did not\ncover the amount of the depreciation charges. In the second period, funds\nwere provided, not by depreciation accounting but by higher wartime sales,\nyet these funds could not be spent on plant and equipment.\n\n'This disregard of the process of generating funds leads the text writers,\nwhen discussing price changes, to overstate woefully the effect of original cost\nin depreciation accounting. For example, *Suppose the price of a piece of\nequipment costing $10,000 has doubled by the time it wears out. If a reserve\nhad been accumulated at the rate of $1,000 a year, when the machine had to\nbe replaced at the end of ten years the accumulated $10,000 would be only\nhalf enough to replace it\" [6, p. 93]. But where has the $10,000 been \"'ac-\n", "155\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "1": ["Elementary Economics and Depreciation Accounting\n\nMost introductory courses in economics describe depreciation, a technical\naccounting concept with far-reaching implications for economics, in extremely\nmisleading terms. Students are confused by depreciation in abbreviated ex-\nplanations of business financial statements or in discussions of national income\naccounts. Kuhlman and Skinner, in a recent text, are typical of the first.\n* Businesses, like consumers, save by not spending all of their income. They\nmay set aside depreciation and obsolescence allowances in order to be able to\nreplace plant and equipment\" [9, p. 180]. The explanation does not jibe with\nPaton and Littleton on corporate accounting standards: \"Under accrual ac-\ncounting, depreciation is not a valuation process nor a means of capturing re-\nplacement prices from customers\" [11, p. 17]. Jome, in a text on money and\nbanking, states that Good accounting policy seems to dictate that the purpose\nof the depreciation charge, after all, is to recover the money paid for an asset\nalready constructed\" [7, p. 429]. But the accountant May denies this policy:\n\"Tt is a gross error to assume that it is a part of the function of accounting\nto insure by depreciation charges or otherwise, the return of the investment\nthat has been made in the entity\" [10, p. 24].\n\nThe basic problem here is that economists are using a word which has a\n\"dictionary\" or layman's meaning, but which also has a technical definition in\nthe field of accounting. If economics insists on precise definitions for its own\npurposes of such common words as investment, capital, labor, profit, and\ncompetition, then should it not also recognize this practice in other fields?\nAccountants draw a clear distinction between Webster's definition of depreci-\nation and their technical one, which they describe as an artificial convention.\nThe American Institute of Accountants has formulated a standard expression\nfor this arbitrary or conventional usage which can be duplicated by reference to\nleading authorities in the field of accounting. *Depreciation accounting [is] a\nsystem of accounting which aims to distribute the cost or other basic value of\ntangible capital assets, less salvage (if any), over the estimated useful life\nof the assets in a systematic and rational manner. It is a process of allocation\nand not valuation\" [3, p. 76].\n\nThe outlook of accounting records is to the past. Depreciation charges refer\nto an expenditure which has taken place, and are merely a special method of\nwriting history. Depreciation accounting enables the business firm to make\nseveral ledger entries, instead of one, when a capital expenditure occurs. The\nproblem of replacement, which is not the purpose of depreciation, requires an\noutlook to the future. Sunk costs, expenditures which have already taken\nplace, have no relevance to present or future investment opportunities. The\naccountants' use of depreciation\u2014merely a method of recording a cost\u2014en-\nsures that no backward glance to a past expenditure which is over and done\nwith can influence the rational consideration of a new decision on capital\ninvestment.\n\nSome text-writers, fascinated by the role of \"internal\" funds in expanding\nbusiness capacity, discuss depreciation charges as a source\" of money capital.\n*Among the various sources of capital, depreciation charges are extremely\n", "154\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Carolyn Shaw Bell"], "stable_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1813467"}, "1813468": {"affiliations": {"raw": {"11": ["MAMMA EAD BRUM Roc c ont\n\nSiuoN N.

However, on most of the questions with lowest scores the\naverage improved during the course\u2014as on Nos. 4, 23, 35 and 39 of Set A,\nthough No. 50 is an exception. This suggests that the propositions should not\nbe excluded, but that their difficulty calls for more attention to them by\nteachers.\n\n5. [t must be conceded that not all the questions in these sets are covered\nin all elementary courses, and not all could be squeezed into every course\nunder any conditions. For three reasons, this weakness was not considered\nfatal. First, students should be able to answer certain questions by their rea-\nsoning processes as developed in the course, even though the particular point\nhas not been covered. Second, low scores at these points may serve to high-\nlight gaps in the course\u2014in this respect the questions test whether coverage\nof the course is adequate rather than how well the topics it actually covers\nare taught. Finally, though no student could possibly score 100 on a test on\nwhich he has only half a minute to answer each question and which contains\n", "RELATION BETWEEN TEST SCORES AND FINAL EXAMINATION GRADES\n\nAverage of Same Students on | Range of Scores on Number of\nTest Score Final Examination in Course | Final Examination Students\n80 78.2 86-71 6\n78 71.6 85-72 7\n76 71.2 84-62 18\n74 75.2 85-69 19\n72 70.2 80-60 28\n\n70 68.9 81-59 29\n\n", "re\n", "student's abilities. The essay question, however, (a) sometimes goes wrong\nwhen the student writes so badly that it obscures his real understanding;\n(b) may call for more of the grader's time, in deciphering handwriting and com-\nparing the different essays, than he may be able to spare; (c) cannot cover\nas many parts of the course in 50 minutes as 100 true-and-false questions can;\nand (d) does not permit accurate comparisons of attainments between differ-\nent colleges, or the same college in different years. Thus the objective question\nhas definite functions in supplementing the essay.\n\nIn so far as teachers supplied course grades for their students, a correla-\ntion was revealed between these and the test grades. In the largest group for\nwhich marks were supplied, 292 students took the test, with the following\nresults, in part:\n", "168\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "9": ["of 60 true-and-false questions on marketing institutions and policies the first\nday of the course, and 48 right, on the same questions, in the final examina-\ntion. We need at least this much success in the more important elementary\ncourse.\n\n2. The purpose of giving colleges a chance to compare results has been\neffectuated by circulating scores at intervals, with each school identified by\na code number.\n\n3. Individual topics reflecting the greatest, and particularly the least, suc-\ncess, are highlighted by the test. Also, testing before the course enables the\nteacher to spot some of the areas of special ignorance or prejudice which he\nwill face.\n\n4. Finally, it was hoped to develop 500 objective questions which a teacher\ncould thereafter give, with any selection or in any combination he wished, in\nthe knowledge of average scores elsewhere.\n\nSecondary purposes might be served by a more extended survey. Are scores\ncorrelated with size of classes, or with textbook? On what topics do women\nstudents do worse or better than men? Has reorganization of the course at a\nparticular college improved results?\n\n\"These questions, and this whole method of testing, are subject to various\npossible objections. Some of these objections and possible answers to them\nare as follows:\n\n1. Will the brightest students be the ones to think of the qualifications to\na simple proposition, and hence be more confused than others as to whether\nto call it true or false? To test this objection, the scores of the 182 whose\ngrades on Set A had been 76 or above, out of the first 1,136 male students to\ntake the set (after either the full or half-year course), were compared with\nthe averages for all 1,136. On every question the 182 averaged significantly\nbetter than the rest. The closest the two groups came was on Nos. 49 and 50,\nfor which the 182 made 86 and 88 per cent as many errors per man, respec-\ntively, as the other 954 students. On average, they made only 59 per cent as\nmany errors.\n\n2. Is reasoning power tested in true-and-false questions, or do the students\nmerely guess? The answer is that the individual student may often guess, but\nthat it is statistically impossible for every class to have improved its average\ngrade, as has been the case, without an increase in understanding.\n\nIn one class, the students were given only 25 questions and were asked to\nstate in a single sentence the reason for each answer. A good reason for a cor-\nrect answer received 3 points credit, a weak reason one point, and an illogical\nreason nothing. Between the beginning and the end of the course, this class\nincreased its average score by 9.3 points; while the computed average validity\nof the reasons on correct answers improved by 8.6 points. Both on answers\nand on reasons, the class covered 18 to 19 per cent of the distance from its\nstarting point to 100.\n\n3. Some teachers are opposed to the use of objective questions. Tt can be ad-\nmitted that a well-chosen, well-corrected essay question will show more of the\n\n* Those who might doubt that the students scoring highest on these tests are the \"brightest\"\nare asked to note the correlation with other marks, reported later in this communication.\n", "167\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "8": ["tal. This could well be the result of overemphasis by teachers on the fact\nthat higher incomes are saved more often than lower ones. It appears that the\nrole of dividends in consumption, as well as their role in saving, should be\nreferred to in the course.\n\nNo. 29. The decline in understanding on this question indicates that teach-\ners may have oversold public works as a remedy for depression, with the result\nthat a few students lost their original realization that they are not a panacea.\nA few extra words in class should clear up this confusion.\n\nNo. 43. This retrogression may have been a statistical accident, but the\nabsence of improvement is significant. A student not knowing that rising world\nprices for an American export commodity tend to improve the dollar's posi-\ntion can hardly be said to understand the elements of foreign exchange.\n\nNo. 48. (The decrcased understanding on this question\u2014which opens up an\nissue that has threatened to divide the national political parties\u2014may be an-\nother statistical accident. But there was at least no gain!\n\nNo. 49. This rather sharp drop in realization that an excise tax is a burden\non the producing industry may be a by-product of teacher emphasis on the\nimpact of such taxes on the consumer. Perhaps some students decided that\nthis meant that industry simply \"passes all taxes on\" with no loss to itself.\n\nNo. 50. The fact that students lost ground on the shifting of land taxes\nmight be due in part to this same emphasis by teachers on tax shifting, except\nthat most students (perhaps tenant-oriented in their thinking) believed from\nthe start that land taxes are shifted. Until they learn the opposite, such a\nfamous American philosophy as Henry George's must be a closed book. But\nteachers seem to have bypassed the difficult problem of explaining land-tax\nincidence.\n\nOn Set A as a whole, the average grade of 628 male students who had taken\none-semester courses was 63.8, as compared to the grade of 67 for the 978\nfull-year students. On money and banking, and public finance, there was no\nsignificant difference in the scores of the two groups. On international eco-\nnomics, the full-year students gained 8 percentage points and on production,\ncost and business organization 11 points, more than the one-semester students.\nThe largest single difference, 20 points, occurred in No. 4, on economies of\nscale, and No. 41, on the tariff.\n\nFailure of the course at particular institutions to cover important areas\nthoroughly is also revealed by the tests. To cite one example, the several\nhundred students at one college averaged only 65 at the end of the full-year\ncourse on question 2 of Set A, whereas at all others the scores were between\n80 and 95. Apparently the course at this college skimped cost analysis (it\nranked lowest on question 4 also).\n\nIV. Purposes of the Survey and Possible Objections\n\n1. The first aim has been to test whether the course is achieving generally\nsatisfactory results. When classes score 55 at the start of the course and only\n65 at the end, it is hard to boast. Possibly the advanced courses which empha-\nsize institutions do better. One teacher reports having tried the same experi-\nment in his 20-student course in marketing. The class averaged 36 right out\n", "166\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "7": ["On 8 of the 50 questions in Set A, the course improved the average knowl-\nedge of male students by 49 per cent or more of the difference between the\nbeginning mark and 100. A brief comment on each of these follows:\n\nNo. 1. 49 per cent of potential gain achieved. Good progress was evidently\nmade in learning that productivity is related to capital investment, innova-\ntion and similar factors.\n\nNo. 3. 61 per cent. The law of diminishing returns was grasped at the end\nof the course by three-fifths of the students who had not sensed it at the start.\n\nNo. 8. 64 per cent. The difference between elastic and inelastic demand was\nwell taught.\n\nNo. 15. 50 per cent. Three-quarters of the students already knew that the\ngold standard does not ensure price stability, and this was learned by half\nthe remaining students.\n\nNo. 17. 54 per cent. More than half the students who had not already\nknown it learned the fundamental principle of multiple bank expansion on\nadditions to reserves.\n\nNo. 20. 50 per cent. More than 70 per cent of the students realized already\nthat easing bank reserves facilitates lending, and half the rest learned this\nduring the course.\n\nNo. 41. 61 per cent. Very good progress was made on the tariff questions of\nall sets, as on this question from Set A. On a \"protariff\" question, No. 40,\nprogress was less (37 per cent) than on this \"'antitariff\" question, No. 41. The\nantiprotection position of textbooks and teachers is known to all.\n\nNo. 47. 67 per cent. Almost 80 per cent of students thought at the start of\nthe course that it would be foolish to try to pay off the public debt at once;\nand two-thirds of the rest learned this during the course. *Prodebt\" proposi-\ntions were well taught in the course, as appears in several of the question sets.5\n\nIt can hardly be said that there was real success on the other 42 questions,\nwhere progress toward the score of 100 was 47 per cent or less. On 8 of them,\nthere was retrogression\u2014though if more students had taken the test, it would\nprobably appear that several decreases in scores were not statistically signifi\ncant.\n\nNo. 11. Both at the beginning and the end of the course, guesses as to the\neffects of speculation went about fifty-fifty. Speculation would seem to be an\nimportant enough subject for students to be given an idea of its fundamental\nnature and consequences\u2014though not of its technical details.\n\nNo. 18. It is perhaps surprising that on so complex a banking question two-\nthirds of the students should have known, sensed or guessed the answer at\nthe start. The apparent decrease in knowledge during the course may prove\nnot to be statistically significant, although perhaps students became confused\nby attempting to undertake a complex chain of reasoning.\n\nNo. 25. There was a substantial decline in realization that dividends have\nan impact on consumption different from that of building up working capi-\n\n51Tt could be argued that students had merely learned the instructor's views, both on this\nand the tariff question, and given back on the test what they thought he wanted.

The average of all grades before the course, for the different sets of\nquestions, has been between 52 and 58; and the average after it, between 61\nand 68. The widest spread among men's colleges on a single set was from 60.6\nto 71.0; and among women's colleges, from 56.6 to 70.1 (both were Set E,\nafter the course). The spread was usually much smaller: thus on Set A, for\nmen, it was from 56.6 to 58.2 at the start and from 63.6 to 71.9 at the end.\n\nMale students have begun with a slightly greater knowledge of the subject,\nand have usually maintained or improved that advantage. At 12 coeducational\ncolleges, the unweighted arithmetic mean of the male advantage was 1.9 points\nbefore, and 2.7 points after the course.*\n\n* One 12-year old boy asked to take the test. Scoring 58 on Set A, he proceeded confidently\nto B, where his mark proved to be 42. It took 100 questions\u2014but only 100\u2014to reveal his\ntrue knowledge of economics! Though the score of a single student on 50 or even 100\nquestions may be misleading, the law of averages has emerged whenever 20 or 25 took the\ntest.\n\n* Numbers of colleges and students taking the tests:\n\nBeginning of Course End of Full-Year Course\nTest Men Women Men Women\nSets\nColleges | Students | Colleges | Students || Colleges | Students | Colleges | Students\nA 4 1,123 3 296 7 978 4 163\nB 3 71 3 265 5 581 6 184\nC 5 784 3 189 6 513 4 52\nD 3 284 3 99 5 392 4 126\nE 3 42 3 206 6 921 6 235\n\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "160\n"], "1": ["I. The Questions Used\n\nEight sets of 50 questions have been used, each containing 5 propositions on\nproduction, cost and business organization; 8 each on price, money and bank-\ning, income and employment, distribution of income, and international eco-\nnomics; and 5 on public finance. The sets come in pairs, each of the two treat-\ning the same topics though in slightly different wording.*\n\nIn preparing the questions, the attempt was made to apply the following\nprinciples: (1) to use ordinary language rather than technical terms, and to\navoid both catch questions and self-evident propositions; (2) to make the\nstatements analytical rather than factual\u2014though there are some exceptions,\ndealing with topics like rates of growth, distribution of income, banking prac-\n\n'The origin of the survey was in the 1953-55 \"self-study\" of New York University\nfinanced by the Carnegie Foundation. All faculty members were asked for suggestions as to\nhow academic work could be evaluated; and this method occurred to the writer as an obvious\nway of doing it. In 1954-56 it was tried at more than twenty colleges, and in 1958-59 at\nseveral more. The survey did not draw on the Carnegie grant.\n\n? A few of the questions selected in 1954 and 1955 were those of other writers, taken or\nadapted from teaching manuals, Other questions are undoubtedly almost identical with ones\nused elsewhere. The writer does not claim that, where they differ, his own are superior to\nthose developed by others.\n", "Measuring the Success of the Elementary Course\n\nThere is justifiable dissatisfaction with the state of economic understanding\nin this country, and therefore with the results achieved by the teaching of eco-\nnomics\u2014especially at the elementary level. The work in the high school field\nof the Joint Council on Economic Education reflects this feeling, as does the\nsearch at various colleges for some new approach.\n\nThe purpose of this communication is to present the findings to date of a\nsurvey of the success of the elementary course. Identical or closely similar sets\nof true-and-false questions have been administered\u2014when possible both before\nand after the course.! The experiment has revealed (1) an unsatisfactory rate\nof progress generally, and (2) particular fields in which students have learned\nlittle or nothing.\n\nT o m n o. T? 3\n", ". J. M.
