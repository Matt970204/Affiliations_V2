Alexander [1] [2] and Fritz\nMachlup [13] [14] on the relative merits of the relative prices (or\nelasticities) and aggregate spending (absorption) approaches to the\nproblem of determining the effect of devaluation appears to have ended,\nfor the time being, in a rather disappointing anticlimax. After having\nwitnessed the mutual accusation of the rival approaches as consisting\nof implicit theorizing based upon purely definitional tautologies [13,\npp. 268-71] [2, pp. 22-24], one feels somewhat let down by the com-\npromise which Alexander now proposes [2, pp. 26-34]: that the result\nobtained by the traditional elasticities approach may be treated as the\n\"initial\" (or primary) effect of a devaluation to which a sort of *multi-\nplier\" (normally less than unity), computed from the propensities to\nhoard, to import, etc., is to be applied to yield the final effect of the\ndevaluation.\n\nThe extension of the elasticity approach by a superimposition of a\nmultiplier analysis in this manner is essentially the same as what A. J.\nBrown had already done in 1942.! Indeed, it was already indicated by\nJ. Robinson [18, esp. p. 93] in her pioneering article on the foreign ex-\nchanges first published in 1937.\n\nThe superimposition of a multiplier upon the elasticities solution of\nthe effect of a devaluation usually glosses over the following difficulty:\nUnless the supplies of exportable and domestic goods in both countries\nconcerned are all infinitely elastic, so that prices in both countries (ex-\ncept prices of imports) will remain constant, the multiplier effect of the\ninitial change in the trade balance will bring about further changes in\nrelative prices, and hence further substitution between imports and\ndomestically produced goods in both countries. Thus if the conven-\ntional elasticities solution is treated as a sort of multiplicand, to which\na multiplier (or a damping coefficient) is to be applied to obtain the\nfinal effect, then the multiplier itself should again involve the relevant\nelasticities that are in the multiplicand.

(2) If we have to accept these\ndifferential trends as actually existing, how do we account for them?\n(3) What are the more important economic implications of such\ndifferential price behavior, if in fact it exists\u2014for example, for multi-\nplier analysis, the relation between capital and output, etc.?

Harry G. Shaffer discusses some of the minor\ndifficulties that arise in practice in distinguishing between consumption and\ninvestment expenditures in the formation of human capital and then examines\nin considerable detail, and in my judgment correctly, some major difficulties in\nidentifying and measuring the earnings (return) that are associated with a\nparticular investment in man. Shaffer does not object to the concepts of in-\nvestment in man and human capital; on the contrary, he explicitly accepts\nthe underlying theory. He is, also, careful to disassociate himself from those\nwho believe that it is morally wrong to apply the concepts of investment and\ncapital to people. However, if any new knowledge were attainable by the use\nof these concepts, despite the empirical difficulties, Shaffer appears to believe\nthat such knowledge would be grossly misused\u2014by implication, more so than\nother economic knowledge\u2014in making policy decisions. This view of the rela-\ntion between economic analysis and policy seems unreal and irrelevant.\n\nShaffer's first point is addressed to the question: When are educational ex-\npenditures consumption and when are they investment? This question deserves\ncareful investigation because so much depends upon the correctness of the\nanswer. To follow the conventional procedure of treating all such costs as\nserving only current consumption will not do. But to allocate all of these costs\nto investment in future earnings, is fully as extreme and unwarranted. Al-\nthough the economic logic for allocating the costs of education is clear and\ncompelling, no one has as yet developed a wholly satisfactory empirical pro-\ncedure for identifying and measuring the particular resources that enter into\neach of these components. Faced with this difficulty, any allocation that one\nmakes, based on such clues as seem relevant, must in all honesty be labeled\n\"arbitrary.\" There is little intellectual comfort in the fact that a similar brand\nof arbitrariness characterizes other areas of analysis, for example, in the way\nexpenditures for electricity and for automobiles used by farmers are divided\nand distributed between household and farm expenses, or the way a part of\nthe costs of some private residences used for offices, libraries or studies are\ntreated as business expenses.\n\nIn discussing the central question of allocating resources between consump-\ntion and investment, Shaffer emphasizes two facts, namely that most students\nattend public schools, and that up to a certain age school attendance is com-\npulsory. But neither of these facts is relevant to a logical basis for distinguishing\nbetween consumption and investments.

And once again it might prove\ndetrimental to the best interests of society (measured in terms other than\naggregate economic returns on investment) to have governmental policy de-\ntermined (or even substantially influenced) by an investor's point of view.\nGovernmental programs, for instance, providing for medical care or financial\nassistance to individuals beyond the retirement age (individuals thus fully de-\npreciated as human capital) would be difficult to defend from the point of\nview of profitable investment per se (except, perhaps, in terms of the greater\ntranquility and therefore productivity of those still serviceable as human capi-\ntal); and slum clearance projects might be considered poor investments as\ncompared with the improvement of golf courses that would aid in steadying\nthe nerves of more productive human capital.\n\nV. Conclusions\n\nWhether productive human beings should be treated as capital and whether\nsome direct expenditures intended for or resulting in an increase in their pro-\nductive capacities should be treated as investment in human capital are not\nquestions of principle. There is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way, because what\nconstitutes capital and what constitutes investment is a matter of definition.\nShould one decide to include under \"investment in human capital\" everything\nthat tends to increase man's productivity, the overwhelming part of all ex-\npenditures to which we usually refer as consumption expenditures would have\nto be considered investments. A substantial part of all expenditures for food,\nshelter, and clothing, many expenditures for recreation, entertainment, and\ntravel, and even some expenditures for mere conveniences and luxuries would\ncertainly need to be reclassified as investments to the extent to which they\ncontribute, directly or indirectly, to the enhancement of a person's productiv-\nity.\n\nWhile it is undeniable that the sum total of countless sensible expenditures\non man (including expenditures for his education, health, proper nourishment,\netc.) will tend, on the average, to have a beneficial impact upon his produc-\ntivity, present and future, each of these expenditures individually and all of\nthem in the aggregate consist of inseparable and indistinguishable parts of\nconsumption and investment expenditures. The spender's motivation is essen-\ntially different from that of the investor in nonhuman capital. The return on\nthe investment cannot be computed satisfactorily as both the amount of pure\n\"investment\" and the return to be allocated thereto are conjectural. And in\nsociety's allocation of productive resources for the advancement of economic\nand noneconomic welfare, the question of the financial wisdom of any direct\nexpenditure on man must be reduced to one of secondary importance.

But if we were to take return\non investment as the guiding rod, how would we proceed? A teacher's im-\nmediate, direct contribution to GNP (equal to his gross income) would not\nbe a true reflection of his value to society, and his indirect, long-run eifect\n(expressed in terms of his influence on the income of others) is not measur-\nable. Marshall proclaimed that: **AII that is spent during many years in open-\ning the means of higher education to the masses would be well paid for if it\ncalled out one more Newton or Darwin, Shakespeare or Beethoven\" [8,\np. 216]. Was Marshall wrong? I do not think he was. Yet, how would one\nobtain empirical evidence that such investment would be \"well paid for\"?\nHow would one go about computing a significant rate of return on such an in-\nvestment?\n\nIndeed the advocate of more governmental aid to education who attempts\nto defend his proposal exclusively on an \"it's sound investment policy\" basis\nstands on shaky ground, for he would logically have to advise expenditures\non education up to the point where the marginal productivity of the human\ncapital created equaled the marginal productivity of other nonhuman capital,\nas well as the rate of interest. And what would this advocate of more govern-\nment aid to education do if he were confronted with a study such as Becker's\nwhich reaches the conclusion that *. . . it would appear that direct returns\nalone cannot justify a large increase in expenditures on college education rela-\ntive to expenditures on business capital\" [1, p. 349]? He could find support\nin arguments such as Schultz's that Becker failed to take into consideration\nthat a part of the expenditure on education is always for education as a\npure consumer's good, that Becker therefore underestimated the return on in-\nvestment in education, and that it is reasonable to assume that there has been\nunderinvestment in education [16, p. 15]. But, on the other hand, our ad-\nvocate of more government aid to education might also have to cope with the\nargument that Becker, perhaps, overestimated the return on investment in edu-\ncation, as no allowance was made in Becker's study for such parts of total\nreturns as may have been attributable to factors other than education (as dis-\ncussed in Part II above) or offset by increased \"maintenance costs.\" And\nonce the advocate of increased government aid to education reaches the con-\nclusion that it is impossible to compute a scientifically unassailable rate of re-\nturn for such investment, he loses even his theoretical basis for azy govern-\nment \"investment\" in education, forcing him once more to utilize arguments\nother than *it's sound investment policy\" to defend his proposals.\n\nIV.

Relation to Expenditure on Education\n\nAt present, the investment-in-human-capital concept appears to be gaining\nin favor among \"liberals\" who apparently intend to utilize it as a rationaliza-\ntion of federal aid to education (and, secondarily, other governmental invest-\nment-in-man expenditures). Walter Heller, Chairman of the Council of Eco-\nnomic Advisers to the President, for instance, refers to the human mind as\nAmerica's greatest resource and points to the \"vast implications for public\npolicy\" embodied in the development of the investment-in-human-capital con-\ncept [20]. But nothing is more dangerous to the very position of the liberals,\nI fear, than to attempt to defend government expenditures for education as a\ntype of collective business investment which will yield economic returns at-\ntractive to the investing society in terms of maximum increase in GNP over and\nabove costs. To cite just one example of the untenable position to which such\nargumentation could lead: Schultz sees a direct correlation between the lower\nincomes of Negroes in the United States (as compared with whites) and their\nrelatively lower productivity resulting from inadequate educational preparation\n[16, p. 3-4] [17, p. 109] and he considers an \"investment\" in their education\nas financially sound. But more specific studies clearly show that due to greater\nvocational opportunities, the income differential correlated with additional edu-\ncation is considerably higher for whites than for Negroes.\" Were we to agree\nthat the government should treat expenditures for education as investment,\ncould not a good case be made for the decrease, if not the discontinuation, of\ngovernmental subsidization of nonwhite students and a consequently higher\nsubsidization of the financially more remunerative white students?\n\nBy the same token, should society discourage advanced studies by women\nunless they can give some reasonable assurance that their \"human capital\"\nwill be used even after they are married? Or should we\u2014COULD WE???\u2014\ncompute the indirect, long-range value of such women to society in terms of\n\n?'That there is some education-created increase in consumption (and not just substitu-\ntion of one kind of consumption for another) appears evident from observation.\n\n? Schultz does not count such education-created consumption expenditures as maintenance\ncosts. On the contrary, while acknowledging their existence, he suggests that the part\nof the cost of education that induces them be classified as consumption expenditure. By\nso decreasing the cost base for investment in education Schultz arrives at a higher rate\nof return on the investment than he would otherwise [16, pp. 12-13].\n\n\"In 1949, for instance, the difference in income between nonwhite college graduates\nand nonwhite males with one to three years in college (for the 45-54 year age group) was\nabout $500 for the year while the corresponding differential for white males was about\ntwice as great [6, p. 309].\n", "penditure results from the educational development of greater cultural, aesthet-\nic and discriminating tastes (which is not a separable part but rather a result\nof the aggregate education process), it reflects an increased expenditure di-\nrectly and uniquely attributable to the specific type of investment (in edu-\ncation).? In time, these education-created expenditures will probably tend to\nbecome essential for the former student's efficient performance as a producer\nand, thus, part of the maintenance costs of the education-created human capi-\ntal.!9\n", "1031\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "5": ["ever effects the training factor per se might have) [10, p. 302]. Therefore,\nhe could not and did not claim that a quantitative estimate of the effect of\ntraining on personal income distribution could be derived using his model.\n\nJ. R. Walsh, in his early (1935) study of the applicability of the capital\nconcept to man, explained that in order to isolate the effect of education he\nwould have to eliminate all other influences (such as ability, age, occupation,\nhealth, etc.) but that he had attempted no such elimination as he considered\nit impossible [21, p. 272]. Indeed, it is so completely impossible to eliminate\nall other influences? that one has to agree with Houthakker that *. . . we can-\nnot even be sure that the apparent effect of education on income is not com-\npletely explicable in terms of intelligence and parents! income, so that the\nspecific effect of education would be zero or even negative\" [7, p. 28].\n\nThere is another factor that enhances the difficulty of determining the re-\nturn on \"investment in education.\" This factor I shall call *maintenance\ncosts.\"\n\nCertainly, whenever the financial return on any investment in nonhuman\ncapital is computed, maintenance costs of the capital good are considered. But,\nto the best of my knowledge, such maintenance costs have been utterly neg-\nlected in the case of human capital by all economists who have advocated the\napplication of the capital concept to man. These maintenance costs first arise\nduring the investment period. The tuxedo, the evening dress, the more fre-\nquent haircuts may not be absolutely necessary for the increase in subsequent\nearning capacity but they are de facto expenses connected with higher educa-\ntion (and they might be indirectly necessary for the intended investment goals\nlest the anxiety and the loss of tranquility caused by their absence interfere\nwith scholastic accomplishments). But maintenance costs by no means end\nwith the completion of the investment period. A part of these continuous\nmaintenance costs (such as the more expensive car, the more luxuriously\ndressed wife, and the more lavishly furnished home of the \"organization man,\"\nor the more frequently washed shirt and the more frequently dry-cleaned\nsuit of the white collar worker) are almost unavoidably connected with the\nretention of the position which yields the higher income to the more educated.\n\nAnother part of these maintenance costs, perhaps less conpulsive but still\nwidely prevalent, relates to increased qualitative (and to some extent also\nquantitative) consumption demands resulting from higher education, higher\nincome, or both.? To the extent to which increased consumption expenditure\nresults from increased income per se (which it will whenever the marginal\npropensity to consume is more than zero) it is independent of the cause of the\nincrease in income.

However, amount of education is at least partly a matter of personal choice.\nAs long as this is true, no matter how many factors have been considered, one can never\nbe certain that there are not some unanalyzed variables influencing this choice which\nin themselves are responsible for the income differential attributed to education.\n\n*Other causes of increased consumption, if any, are disregarded as irrelevant to the\nmain argument,\n", "1030\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "4": ["\"investment \u00edn education\" expenditures), to compute the rate of discount\nwhich will equate the expenditures with lifetime income differentials, and,\nfinally, to compare this rate with the rate of return on investment in nonhuman\ncapital\u2014all these do not present insurmountable dif\u00fcculties. But to establish\na cause-effect relationship, to prove, in other words, that the income di\u00edferen-\ntial is the result of the additional education is quite a different matter. To do\n80, one would have to assume that the more educated individual does not differ\nfrom the less educated in any characteristic (other than education) that could\nexplain part or all of the income differential. Such an assumption would be\nhighly unrealistic as it is evident that there is a close correlation between in-\ntelligence and years of schooling (especially at the higher levels). There are\nalso good indications of at least some correlation between the financial stand-\ning of parents and the years of schooling of their children. Finally, there is\nthe possibility, if not the strong probability, that other factors such as con-\nnections, residence (urban vs. rural, North vs. South, etc.), occupational and\ncultural level of parents, health, etc. have some influence on years of school\nattendance. And surely all these factors have a direct bearing on income, in-\ndependent of years of preparation.\n\nIn the early '\"forties, Elbridge Sibley studied the case records of 2,158\nPennsylvania students and discovered that, at the below-college level, in-\ntelligence had a greater influence on years of education than parental status.\nHowever, as to the probability of spending at least one year in an institution\nof higher learning, *while the most intelligent boys have only a 4 to 1 ad-\nvantage over the least intelligent, the sons of men in the highest occupational\ncategory enjoy an advantage of more than 10 to 1 over those from the lowest\noccupational level\" [18, p. 330].* In his study of the relationship between in-\ncome (annual and lifetime) and education for the years 1939-1959, Herman\nP. Miller noted that at least part of the higher income of those with more\neducation could probably be accounted for by differences in inteiligence,\nhome environment, family connections, and other factors [9, p. 964] [6, p.\n312]. D. S. Bridgman points to evidence that *unearned\" (property) income\nof college graduates is higher than that of noncollege-trained individuals and\nhe expresses the view that factors such as ability and property income have\nbeen given insuff\u00fccient recognition in the past as causal agents of higher in-\ncome of the more educated [2].\n\nIn 1958, Jacob Mincer constructed a model to account for personal income\ndistribution in terms of differential \"investment\" in education [10]. He\nstarted out with many admittedly oversimplified assumptions, one of which\nwas the assumption of identical abilities. But when he relaxed this unrealistic\nassumption, the plausibility of a positive correlation between ability traits\nand amount of education (with the obvious effect on income distribution)\nbecame apparent [10, p. 286]. To this he added that \"when incomes rather\nthan earnings are considered, the positive association of property incomes with\noccupational level . . . magnifies income differences\" (thus accentuating what-\n\n*Sibley's study was published in 1942.

But during the\nfirst half of the twentieth century, certainly, the overwhelming majority of\neconomists, following Alfred Marshall [8, pp. 71-72], have shown a tendency\nto use the concept of capital as applicable only to that portion of the non-\nhuman, material, man-made stock of wealth which is utilized directly in fur-\nther production.\n\nIn spite of \"majority opinion\" the application of the capital concept to\nman has not disappeared from economic literature? and the past few years\nespecially have witnessed a revival of the idea in U.S. economic journals.

This, however, is not the reason for my opposition. It is my con-\ntention that, mainly for three reasons, economics has little to gain and much\nto lose by the universal application of the capital concept to man:\n\nFirst, *investment in man\" is essentially different from investment in non-\nhuman capital. The difference arises largely from the fact that, as a general\nrule, at least a part of any one direct expenditure for the improvement of man\nis not investment as the term is usually used, i.e., it is undertaken for reasons\nother than the expectation of a monetary return, it has no traceable effects on\nfuture output and it satisfies wants directly. To the extent to which any part\nof such an expenditure is investment in this sense it is rarely if ever \"rational\"\ninvestment based on a careful comparison of alternate investment opportuni-\nties, with the anticipated monetary return and the degree of safety as guiding\nrods. Furthermore, any such part is inseparable from other parts which, not\nbeing classified as investment, are then conveniently referred to as consump-\ntion expenditure.\n\nSecondly, were it possible to separate consumption expenditure from invest-\nment in man it would still remain a virtual impossibility to allocate a spe-\ncific return to a specific investment in man (though aggregate expenditures for\nthe improvement of man's skill, abilities, and productive capacities certainly\n\n* See for instance [11] [19, pp. 265-66] [5, p. 13] [4, p. 65].\n?

I suspect, however, from what he says about them that they\nare conglomerates of compressed sand and at best weak materials for his\nconclusions. To have started off by lecturing \"liberals\" on their rationalization\nof federal aid to education, is not conducive to a calm and reasoned discussion\nof the policy implications of expenditures for education. If the argument were\nthat the knowledge now available about the increases in earnings from education\nis still too fragmentary to be of any use whatsoever in making policy decisions,\nit would deserve careful consideration. If the argument were that knowledge\nabout the effects of education upon future earnings will be misused by people\nand therefore any efforts to acquire such knowledge should be very much dis-\ncouraged, this conclusion from such an argument would be patently false.\n\nThe principal source of Shaffer's confusion in discussing policy arises from\nhis belief that, if it were to become known that particular forms of educa-\ntion pay in terms of increases in future earnings, policy decisions which took\nthis fact into account would necessarily no longer take into account any of\nthe other important contributions of education. People, including those who\nmake policy decisions, are simply not that monolithic in their evaluation of\neducation. Shaffer's implied apprehension that society will proceed to deny\nadvanced education to women merely because most of them do not enter the\nlabor market is a pure illusion. If Shaffer only means that knowledge about\neconomic returns accruing from investment in human capital, in terms of future\nearnings, sAtould not be the exclusive basis for public policy decisions in making\nexpenditures for education, we are in full agreement. My view on this issue can\nbe stated very simply: It is altogether proper that people should prize highly the\ncultural contributions of education and they will continue to do exactly that; but\nit is very short-sighted of us not to see its economic contributions. Education\nhas become a major source of economic growth [5] in winning the abundance\nthat is to be had by developing a modern agriculture and industry. It simply\nwould not be possible to have this abundance if our people were predominantly\nilliterate and unskilled. Education, therefore, in addition to having high cul-\ntural values, is presently also an investment in people to the extent that it\nimproves their capabilities and thereby increases the future earnings of people.\n\nShaffer says that there are specific studies which \"clearly show . .. the income\ndifferential correlated with additional education is considerably higher for\nwhites than for Negroes,\" and suggests the inference that less rather than more\nshould therefore be spent on education for Negroes, provided this were the sole\ncriterion. The specific studies in this case are based on national averages,\nmaking no adjustments for the effects of city size, different rates of unemploy-\nment, regions, and the quality of education. Nor is any account taken of the\ndifferences in the cost of education, including income foregone by the students,\nwhich is fully half of the total cost of college education. Furthermore, should\nthere still remain a differential, as is to be expected because of discrimination,\nthe relevant figure is not this income differential but the absolute difference\n", "1038\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "3": ["Let me do no more than restate the effects of education upon consumption\nand earnings. The consumption component of education is either for current\nconsumption, satisfying consumer well-being in the present, like food, or for\nfuture consumption, like houses. Education can also improve the capabilities\nof people and thus enhance their future earnings. The investment formed by\neducation is, therefore, of two parts: a future consumption component and a\nfuture earnings component.\n\nIn Education and Economic Growth\" [4], in examining education for con-\nsumption, I emphasized the current consumption component. It is now clear\nto me that most education that satisfies consumer preferences is for future\nconsumption and that this component has substantial durability and it is,\ntherefore, to the extent that it serves consumption, mainly an enduring con-\nsumer component, even more so than other consumer durables. As an enduring\nconsumer component, it is the source of future utilities (and thus this com-\nponent, also, contributes to future real income) which in no way enters into\nmeasured national income.* This component accordingly is like investment in\nhouses, automobiles, refrigerators and the like. Thus we have the following:\n(1) education for current consumption (which, it seems to me, is of minor\nimportance); (2) education for long-period future consumption, making it\nan investment in an enduring consumer component, which is undoubtedly of\nconsiderable importance; and (3) education for skills and knowledge useful\nin economic endeavor and, thus, an investment in future earnings [5].\n\nShaffer's second point, which presents a number of the real difficulties that\narise when one attempts to identify and measure the increase in earnings that\nare associated with education, is well founded. Differences in innate abilities,\nrace, employment, mortality, and family connections all enter and must be\nfaced. It should not distract from the merits of his presentation to observe that\nthese several difficulties are very much in the forefront in the work of econo-\nmists who to my knowledge are engaged in studying this set of problems. The\nforthcoming study by Becker [1] will be a landmark on this score as well as on\nother relevant theoretical and empirical issues. A major new study by Denison\n[2] is both bold and original in bringing aggregate analysis to bear on the\nsources of economic growth in the United States. He finds education to be one\nof the major sources of economic growth a\u00edter adjusting for differences in\ninnate abilities and associated characteristics that affect earnings independently\nof education. Shaffer introduces a concept which he calls *maintenance costs\"\nwhich in terms of the studies available to him has been neglected. But Weis-\nbrod [6] in his paper *The Valuation of Human Capital,\" builds on \"the\nproposition that the value of a person to others is measured by any excess of\nhis contribution to production over what he consumes from production\u2014this\ndifference being the amount by which everyone else benefits from his pro-\nductivity.? Weisbrod then proceeds to estimate the relevant consumption, or\n\n! Immediately following my presidential address, \"Investment in Human Capital,\" Abba\nLerner pointed out to me in conversation the role of future utilities from education and\nthat this part of education also represented an investment. His logical and precise mind\nhelped to clarify my thinking on this point and I am much indebted to him.\n", "1037\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "2": ["in it until it would no longer increase his future earnings. If a part of the\neducation expenditures were borne on public account, the direct private costs\nof education would of course be less than the total costs of education, and to\nthe extent that such education increased the future earnings of the student,\nhis private rate of return to what he spent on education would be higher than\nthe rate of return to total educational expenditures entering into this part of\nhis education. Thus, private incentives to consume and to invest in education\nare affected by public educational expenditures, but the fact that there are\nsuch public expenditures has no bearing on the question whether education is\nconsumption or investment. The fact that some schooling is compulsory is also\nirrelevant to the question at hand. To argue that it applies is analogous to\nsaying that a city ordinance which requires private owners of houses to install\nplumbing and sewage disposal facilities is a factor in determining whether such\nfacilities are a consumer or producer durable. Clearly, the compulsory city\nordinance does not provide a logical basis for distinguishing between these\ntwo types of durables.\n\nAlthough Shaffer is clear in seeing the positive effects of education upon the\nfuture earnings of students, he believes that the economic motivations of stu-\ndents and parents to invest in education is weak or even nonexistent. They\nare, in Shaffer's view, strongly motivated as consumers of education but only\nweakly or not motivated at all as investors in education. Such a dichotomy\nwith respect to economic motivations is far from convincing. It is undoubtedly\ntrue, as Shaffer points out, that some education is wholly for consumption, and\nobviously in that case there would be no investment opportunity, hence no\nbases for an investment motivation. But are there no economic motivations in\nthe case of students who attend our medical schools, schools for dentists, lawyers\nand engineers to invest in each of these particular skills with an eye to increases\nin future earnings? I am sure that the prospects of larger future earnings play\na strong motivating role in these situations. Let me observe again, however,\nthat private incentives either to consume education or to invest in it are\naffected by the amount and the nature of public expenditures for education.\nIt is of course true that any attempt to explain total behavior with regard to\nthe allocation of all public and private resources entering into education, takes\none beyond the scope of the conventional private economic calculus of people.\nIn studying the responses of private individuals to whatever investment op-\nportunities education affords, it should be borne in mind: (1) that where\nthe capital market does serve human investment it is subject to more imper-\nfections than in financing physical capital; (2) that most investment in people,\nnotably in the case of education, is in a long-period capacity, for it has a\nrelatively long life and it is thus subject to the additional uncertainties which\nthis implies; (3) that many individuals face serious uncertainty in assessing\ntheir innate talents when it comes to investing in themselves; and (4) that\nour laws discriminate against human investments [3]. These factors affect the\nobserved responses, and their adverse effects may be confused with the real\neconomic response, other things equal, to a given rate of return which is then\nthought to be weak or nonexistent.\n", "1036\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "1": ["Investment in Human Capital: Reply\n\nIam surprised and pleased that under the restraints of a presidential address\nto the American Economic Association, enough could be said to warrant so\ncareful and valuable a comment.

Shaffer discusses some of the minor\ndifficulties that arise in practice in distinguishing between consumption and\ninvestment expenditures in the formation of human capital and then examines\nin considerable detail, and in my judgment correctly, some major difficulties in\nidentifying and measuring the earnings (return) that are associated with a\nparticular investment in man. Shaffer does not object to the concepts of in-\nvestment in man and human capital; on the contrary, he explicitly accepts\nthe underlying theory. He is, also, careful to disassociate himself from those\nwho believe that it is morally wrong to apply the concepts of investment and\ncapital to people. However, if any new knowledge were attainable by the use\nof these concepts, despite the empirical difficulties, Shaffer appears to believe\nthat such knowledge would be grossly misused\u2014by implication, more so than\nother economic knowledge\u2014in making policy decisions. This view of the rela-\ntion between economic analysis and policy seems unreal and irrelevant.\n\nShaffer's first point is addressed to the question: When are educational ex-\npenditures consumption and when are they investment? This question deserves\ncareful investigation because so much depends upon the correctness of the\nanswer. To follow the conventional procedure of treating all such costs as\nserving only current consumption will not do. But to allocate all of these costs\nto investment in future earnings, is fully as extreme and unwarranted. Al-\nthough the economic logic for allocating the costs of education is clear and\ncompelling, no one has as yet developed a wholly satisfactory empirical pro-\ncedure for identifying and measuring the particular resources that enter into\neach of these components. Faced with this difficulty, any allocation that one\nmakes, based on such clues as seem relevant, must in all honesty be labeled\n\"arbitrary.\" There is little intellectual comfort in the fact that a similar brand\nof arbitrariness characterizes other areas of analysis, for example, in the way\nexpenditures for electricity and for automobiles used by farmers are divided\nand distributed between household and farm expenses, or the way a part of\nthe costs of some private residences used for offices, libraries or studies are\ntreated as business expenses.\n\nIn discussing the central question of allocating resources between consump-\ntion and investment, Shaffer emphasizes two facts, namely that most students\nattend public schools, and that up to a certain age school attendance is com-\npulsory. But neither of these facts is relevant to a logical basis for distinguishing\nbetween consumption and investments.

Should we abide by the golden rule even when out of\ngolden-rule equilibrium?\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Oiko replied. *We might attempt to approach the golden-rule\npath asymptotically. However I urge that we, in our lifetime, take whatever\nsteps are required to place Solovia securely on the golden-rule path. Associated\nwith that path is a unique capital-output ratio. If our present capital-output\nratio is smaller, then our consumption must be slowed until our ratio is no\nlonger deficient. If our present ratio exceeds the golden-rule ratio, then we\nmust consume faster until our capital-output ratio is no longer excessive.\n\n*Once our capital-output ratio has attained its golden-rule value, we must\nmake a solemn compact henceforth to invest by the golden rule. If the in-\nvestment ratio remains ever equal to the profit ratio, no generation in all the\nfuture of Solovia will ever wish we had chosen a different, successfully en-\nforced investment ratio.

It is, however, far easier to\npose the problem and to criticize the alternatives than it is to offer construc-\ntive and feasible suggestions for the elimination of what has become an\ninternational disequilibrium system.* The present paper, unfortunately, illus-\ntrates that proposition by cautioning against the practicability, in certain\ncases, of the most plausible alternative: a system of national currencies con-\nnected by flexible exchange rates.\n\nA system of flexible exchange rates is usually presented, by its propo-\nnents,? as a device whereby depreciation can take the place of unemployment\nwhen the external balance is in deficit, and appreciation can replace inflation\nwhen it is in surplus. But the question then arises whether all existing na-\ntional currencies should be flexible. Should the Ghanian pound be freed to\nfluctuate against all currencies or ought the present sterling-area currencies re-\nmain pegged to the pound sterling? Or, supposing that the Common Market\ncountries proceed with their plans for economic union, should these countries\nallow each national currency to fluctuate, or would a single currency area be\npreferable?\n\nThe problem can be posed in a general and more revealing way by defining\na currency area as a domain within which exchange rates are fixed and asking:\nWhat is the appropriate domain of a currency area? It might seem at first that\nthe question is purely academic since it hardly appears within the realm of\npolitical feasibility that national currencies would ever be abandoned in\nfavor of any other arrangement. To this, three answers can be given: (1) Cer-\ntain parts of the world are undergoing processes of economic integration and\ndisintegration, new experiments are being made, and a conception of what\nconstitutes an optimum currency area can clarify the meaning of these experi-\nments, (2) Those countries, like Canada, which have experimented with\nflexible exchange rates are likely to face particular problems which the theory\nof optimum currency areas can elucidate if the national currency area does not\ncoincide with the optimum currency area.

A limitation on the size of\nindividual enterprises would serve this end by helping to insure the mainte-\nnance of many independent sources of productive factors, including initiative\nand financing, in sufficient abundance to make their influence felt in every\nmarket.\n\nFrom a broader point of view, such a limitation would help to insure the\nexistence of \"many\" independent sources of employment and income in\norder to prevent, or to reduce to a minimum, coercion of the individual in mat-\nters rightfully reserved to his own judgment.

On the other\nhand, to regard firms as competitive only where they are so evenly matched that\nthe buyer must flip a coin to choose between them is most certainly to under-\nestimate the extent of effective competition\u2014i.e., the area in which the exist-\nence of a particular competitive source exerts a limiting effect on the willingness\nof the supplier to raise prices or reduce quality.\n\nWhat is needed here is an indicator of effective competition between the\nfirms in question in so far as this competitiveness exceeds the background\nlevel\" of potential competition\u2014the competition of entrepreneurs in general\u2014\nwhich may be regarded as practically unaffected by the disappearance of any\none firm. Thus, while a merger of two firms in dissimilar and noncompetitive in-\ndustries would not be ordinarily regarded as having any significant anti-\ncompetitive impact, an indicator of effective competition s\u00a3ould take into ac-\ncount potential product-lines which the firm in question is able to enter more\nquickly or more efficiently than the average potential new entrant into the\nfield. Effects too small to justify the cost of policing and prosecution could\npresumably be eliminated from consideration by exempting transactions in-\nvolving companies below a certain minimum size. (This discussion has re-\nferred only to the horizontal aspect of mergers; a vertical integration may have\nan entirely dissimilar anticompetitive effect.)\n\nIt should be remembered that any proposed expansion is not blocked by\ndenial of permission to acquire a competitor, but simply confined to a channel\nwhere it cannot ordinarily take place unless accompanied by some desirable\nconsequences. Moreover, it is often possible to achieve substantial cost sav-\nings by eliminating duplicate facilities and by limited cooperation short of\nmerger. In these instances, proper policy would prevent merger but would not\nprevent these economies. Many of the advantages brought about by rail con-\nsolidation are examples of this sort of saving.\n\nAlternatively, if future experience should suggest a need for selective per-\nmission of some mergers between competitors, a screening process could be\nset up, perhaps to be administered by the Federal Trade Commission, with\nthe burden of proof on the applicant firms to show that their merger measures\nup to the rigorous test of indispensability. Permission for an anticompetitive\nmerger might well be followed by special surveillance for a period of years\nwith a view to determining whether or not price control should be instituted.\n\nFinally, in spite of the above-mentioned presumption that the expansion of\na firm which occurs through simple growth rather than combination, and\nwithout cutthroat tactics, is economically justified, there appear to be good\ngrounds for some sort of limit on the size of the individual enterprise, a limit\nwhich may or may not require present embodiment in law. The psychological\ncosts involved in such a limit may perhaps be minimized by avoiding its\nformulation in absolute terms; I do not mean to suggest that a satisfactory\nresult cannot be achieved by a policy of gradual braking on expansion rather\nthan building a blank wall. From the economic point of view, it is evidently\n", "655\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "12": ["\"There appears to be a considerably greater probability of net economic loss\nwhen a competitor is eliminated by merger than when he is displaced through\nloss of business to other firms. Product change and/or price reduction would\nalmost certainly be necessary to attract customers away from an existing firm\nand thus to eliminate it by simple displacement. Except in instances of cut-\nthroat tactics, which should be dealt with directly in law, simple growth\nthrough displacement of competitors does not imply net economic loss even\nthough the choice of firms available to customers is thereby rendered less ex-\ntensive. It is otherwise with mergers, which will be undertaken if the total pro-\nSpective gains\u2014 possibly originating wholly or in large part from the protected\nstatus to be obtained thereby\u2014appear sufficient to cover whatever incidental\ncosts may arise, and if a suitable distribution of the proceeds can be agreed\nupon. This does not mean, of course, that no merger could result in economic\ngains sufficient to justify it regardless of an appreciable protective effect, but\nonly that we cannot presume that any merger will have some desirable results,\nas we can in the case of simple expansion.\n\nFor reasons admirably set forth by Markham [7, pp. 493-95] it seems prob-\nable that few mergers can be shown to be indispensable to the production\nof cost savings or other economic benefits. Thus, to prohibit mergers between\nfirms significantly competitive with one another might well be the best avail-\nable course.\n\nThe chief conceptual problem connected with such a policy is the provision\nof a suitable definition of \"significant competitiveness.\" It is necessary to\ndraw a definite and defensible line between the competitiveness which will\nmake a merger subject to legal control and the general competitiveness be-\ntween each pair of firms in the economy; and the rough distinction between\n\"potential\" and \"actual\" competition is not sufficiently precise to serve this\npurpose. It has been suggested (in Section I) that the legal test of significant\ncompetitiveness among merger participants be satisfied by a showing that\nsome nonnegligible amount of dollar revenues of one participant is accounted\nfor by sales for which buyers would have substituted the other participant's\nproduct, had it been offered at the lowest cost-covering price, if the actual\nseller had withdrawn his supplies. In a sense, this test is an indicator of poten-\ntial rather than actual competition. Not actual price relationships nor immoe-\ndiate product availability are referred to in assessing competitiveness, but\nrather the possibility of substitution of the products of firm A for those of firm\nB under the most favorable conditions for such substitution, given the\nactual costs and (with an exception to be noted below) the product-lines\nof firm A. But some such set of conditions must be chosen in any assessment\nof competitiveness.\n\nSince only one firm can in fact supply each particular shipment actually\nbought, azy criterion of competitiveness relates to potential rather than actual\nsubstitution; and potential substitution\u2014or substitutability\u2014has different\nmeanings according to the conditions under which the opportunity for substi-\ntution is supposed to take place.

A similar observation applies to the\nnarrowing of the asset market by prohibiting firms from selling out to their com-\npetitors. Indeed, if the price offered by a competitor is markedly above that\navailable from others, does not the excess probably represent the \"protective\"\nvalue to the competitor of removing independent competition, and permitting\nits payment therefore an undesirable method of promoting liquidity? If, on the\nother hand, the excess is due to considerations of superior ef\u00fcciency, this\ncase reduces to that identified by the first point, and could be dealt with (if\nnecessary) by the same policy modification. As to the third point, suffice it to\nsay that the value of these other percentage criteria is at least as doubtful as\nthe value of those applied to mergers.\n\nOn the other hand, some relatively large-scale mergers may be economically\ndesirable, in the sense that they are necessary to produce an otherwise unavail-\nable economic benefit. To the extent that such transactions are prevented by\na policy of merger control based on a percentage-share criterion, the results of\nsuch a policy are disadvantageous. It would seem, on the basis of present evi-\ndence, that this sort of effect would not often occur; however, its possibility\ncertainly should not be ignored.\n\nIII. Proposed Basis for Merger Regulation\n\nAlthough there seems to be no economic case for a policy of merger regula-\ntion aimed at limitation of the share of a given market accounted for by one\nfirm, there is an alternative basis which appears to be more promising.\n\"This rationale is based on the general economic case against practices restricting\nthe choices open to sellers or buyers: that is, against activities by which a seller\n(or buyer) makes it more difficult\u2014or impossible\u2014for buyers (or sellers) to\nobtain access to the products of (or to sell to) his independent competitors.\nIn brief, acquisition of a competitor may, by depriving some set of buyers of\na formerly available source of supply, enable the acquiring firm to charge a\nhigher price and/or to make an alteration in product (broadly defined so as\nto include all the nonprice aspects of his sales) which would not otherwise\nhave been profitable. Unless the merger is necessary for the achievement of\ncost reductions or product improvement, it can be shown that, if actual (un-\nrestricted) expenditures and revenues are acceptable indicators of the costs\nand benefits of any resulting change in output, the increase in net profit accru-\ning to the combined firm as a result of such a stratagem is almost certain to be\nless than the losses incurred by others; indeed, this is almost self-evident,\nsince any such output change would ex Aypothesi produce no net revenue gain\nin the absence of restriction. (Increased profits from higher prices on out-\nputs which would have been sold anyway, however, represent merely trans-\nfers of income from buyer to seller, without any net benefit or loss.) The argu-\nment is essentially the same as the general case supporting free entry and\nfree mobility of resources, and is open to the same objections; if the general\ncase is accepted, so is the case for an antirestrictive merger policy.\n", "653\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "10": ["portant aspect of the competitive process is that it is self-controlling with\nregard to private economic power. For all the important qualifications\nand limitations of the doctrine of the invisible hand which modern\neconomic analysis has produced, that doctrine remains the basic politi-\ncal justification for an enterprise economy in which major economic\ndecisions are compelled and coordinated through the market. It is the\nfact that the competitive market compels the results of its processes\nwhich is the ultimate defense against the demand that economic de-\ncisions be made or supervised by politically responsible authorities. With-\nout such market compulsion, that demand appears ultimately irresistible\nin a society committed to representative government.\n\nIt does not seem likely that this sort of demand will in fact be made; but be\nthat as it may, the primary objective of the suggested policy is clearly to avoid\ncertain alleged political dangers rather than to improve the functioning of\nmarkets in an economic sense.\n\nThe second argument against the percentage-share limitation is the practical\nconsequence of the first: that is, that its economic influence may well be un-\ndesirable. A merger need not be relatively large-scale in order to be economi-\ncally objectionable. The absorption of a small maverick by an average-sized\ncompetitor may easily have a more harmful effect than the marriage of two\napathetic giants, in that in the former instance a promising source of new\ntechniques of production or product variation, or of independent price experi-\nmentation, may be removed from the scene, whereas the latter might well\nleave everything essentially the same. Again, the disappearance of a firm is per-\nhaps seldom just a matter of subtracting one from a list of sources of identical\ngoods; there are in many cases certain needs, certain markets, which are less\nwell served after any merger. There is, moreover, the ever-present possibility\nthat the small firm might grow because of its superior merit. That this possibil-\nity cannot be predicted or assessed in advance does not make it any less real\nor important. Where a firm disappears as a result of losing business to its com-\npetitors, there is a presumption that these competitors' relative growth at the\nexpense of the defunct firm is accompanied by some superiority in product or\nprice; as will be pointed out below, there is no such presumption in connection\nwith disappearance by merger.\n\nIn support of a policy of permitting all relatively small-scale mergers, cer-\ntain arguments are frequently advanced which on examination do not appear\nvalid. It is said that such a policy is necessary (1) to permit transactions that\nbring about cost savings and/or product improvements; (2) to provide that\nfree market for the disposal of business assets which is necessary to promote\nmaximum mobility of resources and justified investment of capital [7, p. 493];\nand (3) to bring the treatment of mergers into line with the treatment of other\nrestraints of trade which are subject to equally vague permissive limits.? The\nfirst point is cogent only with respect to mergers not merely sufficient but\nactually necessary to bring about the improvements involved. Should these\ninstances turn out to be frequent enough or important enough individually to\n\n* See, for example, the discussion of \"exclusive dealing\" in [3].\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "652\n"], "9": ["advantages claimed for the suggested doctrine turn out upon examination to\nbe nonexistent. These three objections will be discussed in turn.\n\nAs has been pointed out above, the question of market definition and deter-\nmination of a proper limit for the share to be accounted for by any one firm is\nno less difficult here than under the Sherman Act. Moreover, the use of market\nShare as a policy guide appears to have no real economic justification under\neither statute. In connection with monopolizing or merger, such a justification\ncan hardly be found in any analogy with the virtually negligible share of in-\ndustrial supply attributable to the pure competitor. Nor does it appear that a\njustification can be found in terms of the theory of *workable competition.\" As\nI have written [6, pp. 298-99] in connection with Section 2 of the Sherman\nAct, this theory:\n\nas applied to the antitrust problem issues in little more than a generalized\nprescription that any group of goods that *we think of as the (same\nproduct\" should be sold by more than one firm (or *a considerable num-\nber of firms\") none of which accounts for a \"large\" percentage of sales.\nIn this form, the doctrine is too vague and too unreliable to be of use as\na policy guide: too vague, because of the indistinct boundaries of the\n* product\" concept fixing the area to be considered as within the industry\n(i.e., belonging to the relevant market), because of the lack of any clue\nas to how many competitors within this boundary would be sufficient\nor as to what percentage of sales would be too large for any one firm, and\nbecause of the uncertain status (if any) given to the competition of sub-\nstitutes outside the industry; too unreliable, because the mere counting\nof firms and figuring of percentages within any defined area of produc-\ntion is not an accurate measure of either the stimulus to the producer or\nprotection to the consumer afforded by the presence and/or possibility of\ncompetition.\n\nIn view of the failure of these attempts to trace a dependable causal con-\nnection between market share and economic performance, with results suit-\nable for use as a legislative or judicial guide, it is not surprising that more re-\ncent advocates of a policy of deconcentration have preferred to defend their\nproposals on essentially political grounds. Thus, Kaysen and Turner, in a work\n[4] which I have discussed in detail elsewhere [5], assert their belief that the\nadoption of improved economic performance as the primary goal of antitrust\npolicy would *present definitional and administrative problems of such mag-\nnitude that consistent and sensible enforcement would be well-nigh impos-\nsible\" [4, p. 49]. Their own program of deconcentration is justified as a means\nof eliminating *unreasonable market power\"\u2014an entity whose operational\ndefinition turns out to be rather complicated, but which appears to occur when-\never a business management exercises some degree of continuing discretion\nwith regard to price policy, and cannot prove that the ability to exercise this\ndiscretion arises from one or some of a short, enumerated list of causal factors\n[4, pp. 265-70]. The following passage sets forth their reasons for regarding\nthe elimination of this *power\" as a proper primary target for antitrust policy\n[4, pp. 48-49]:\n\nOur positive reasons rest ultimately on a value judgment.

Objections to the Court's Argument\n\nThere are three main objections to injecting the question of market share\ninto the regulation of mergers. The first is that the definition of the relevant\nmarket and the determination of a proper limit for the share of any one firm\nare essentially wide-open questions, not subject to judicial determination in\nany one case and not subject to discovery by examination of similar past in-\nstances and averaging the results. The second is that the injection of this con-\ncept may very well unduly limit the application of the statute so that eco-\nnomically undesirable mergers may be permitted to escape its prohibition;\nmoreover, it is also possible that certain economically desirable mergers may\nbe prevented. The third is that these fundamental faults do not appear to be\nbalanced by any compensating advantage. Certainly at least some of the\n", "steel market]. . . . In sum, the merger of Bethlehem and Youngstown\nwould bring together the second and sixth largest integrated steel com-\npanies with 23,000,000 and 6,500,000 tons of ingot capacity, respectively,\ngiving Bethlehem almost 21 per cent of industry capacity. This would\nadd substantially to concentration in an already highly concentrated in-\ndustry and reduce unduly the already limited number of steel companies.\nThe merger would increase concentration in the hands of the Big Four\nand the next three companies after U.S. Steel by 4.6 percentage points,\nwhich would be the greatest increase in concentration in the iron and\nsteel industry [roughly, in any decade] from 1901 to 1958 . . . with the\nexception of the decade 1920 to 1930 when Bethlehem and other large\ncompanies were engaged in a series of important mergers and acquisitions.\n\nOnly if at least one of the participants is relatively large can an over-all in-\ndustrial concentration ratio be significantly affected by a merger. It is for this\nreason that the emphasis on the over-all ratio tends to reinforce the probable\nlegal importance of the market shares of the participants.\n\nSome aspects of the treatment of concentration in the Bethlehem-Youngs-\ntown decision may be thought of as differentiating this case from the general\nrun of mergers, and as limiting the applicability of its doctrine to firms which\nare absolutely large [9, p. 586], show a past history of growth through merger\n[9, pp. 586-87], and are in industries where entry is extraordinarily difficult\n[9, pp. 606] or which are already characterized by a high degree of concentra-\ntion. (On the other hand, the presence of \"vertical\" anticompetitive aspects\n[9, pp. 611-15] does not serve to differentiate this case, since prospective vio-\nlation was found in several markets unaffected by these aspects.) However, it\nis hardly to be expected that Section 7 is henceforth to be enforced only with\nrespect to giants in concentrated industries, or that an entirely different set\nof principles will be used with respect to nongiants. A somewhat less drastic\ndifferentiation appears more likely. For example, a larger share of the market,\non the part of one or both participants, may well turn out to be legal in indus-\ntries of smaller size, more favorable entry characteristics and less concentra-\ntion, and with respect to applicants with little or no past history of growth\nthrough merger. Such a development as this would still leave the concept of\nmarket share in a key position in the application of Section 7.\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "650\n"], "7": ["Judge Weinfeld's general statement of the meaning of the statute leaves this\nquestion in doubt;* and, as has been noted, the extended consideration of\nmarket shares and the emphasis on the concentration ratio tend to support\nthe view suggested here.

It would have\nbeen necessary only to show that some nonnegligible amount of dollar sales\nby each company was accounted for by orders for which the other company\nwas a significant competitor: that is, for which the buyers would have sub-\nstituted the other company's product, had it been offered at the lowest cost-\ncovering price, if the actual seller had withdrawn his supplies. (This suggested\ndefinition of \"significant competitiveness\" will be further discussed in Part III,\nbelow.)\n\nSince it would not be necessary in this connection to calculate the degree\nof monopoly power resulting from the merger, or to predict the extent to which\nbuyers are probably going to be worse or better off, there would be no need to\ndefine the relevant market, or to attempt to measure the effectiveness of com-\npetition either before or after the combination. Similarly, differences of opinion\nregarding the precise boundaries of competitive areas would not present cru-\ncial difficulties. It would be sufficient to show that there is some area of sig-\nnificant competition (as defined above) which would be eliminated by the\nproposed merger.\n\nApart from the significance attributed to the market shares accounted for\nby the participants themselves, and hence to the proposed merged firm, the\ndecision apparently ascribes an independent importance to concentration of\nownership in the steel industry as a whole: that is, to the fact that the con-\ncentrating effect of the merger would be added to an already high degree of\nover-all concentration. The following quotation illustrates this point [9, pp.\n604-5]:5\n\nA major purpose of Section 7 is to ward off the anticompetitive effects\n\nof increases \"in the level of economic concentration resulting from cor-\n\nporate mergers and acquisitions\" [12, p. 3]. . . .

As stated in those Reports they\nwere, in some instances iz haec verba, (1) to limit future increases in the level of economic\nconcentration resulting from corporate mergers and acquisitions; (2) to meet the threat\nposed by the merger movement to small business fields and thereby aid in preserving small\nbusiness as an important competitive factor in the American economy; (3) to cope with\nmonopolistic tendencies in their incipiency and before they attain Sherman Act proportions;\nand (4) to avoid a Sherman Act test in deciding the effects of a merger.\" An intent to deter\nconcentration does not, of course, justify limiting antimerger action to those cases where\nsignificant concentration exists or threatens to occur.\n", "649\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "6": ["over, it is expressly found, and therefore presumably considered relevant,\nthat an amount of direct competition both absolutely and relatively substan-\ntial would be eliminated by the merger of the two steel companies.?

In other circumstances, the effect may be\nreversed. The choice of market definition, like the choice of a maximum\nlegal percentage for market share, remains subject to the same basic uncer-\ntainty here as under the Sherman Act.\n\nThe purpose of the *line-of-product\" discussion in the Bethlehem-Youngs-\ntown decision was to define statistical categories of output in order that the\nsales of each output by the participant firms might be compared, in a given\narea, with the corresponding total sales figure for all producers. Since it was\nquite properly concluded that the steel companies compete for business\nthroughout the United States, subareas were selected simply by choosing sec-\ntions accounting for a large proportion of total sales, and of the sales of each\ndefendant.

On the other hand, it must be admitted that the\npercentages at issue in this case, while certainly large as compared with the\nnegligible share attributable to the member of a pure-competition industry, are\nsmall compared to the shares considered significant in Sherman Act cases, as\nmay be seen in the accompanying tables (Tables 1 and 2). This relative\nsmallness becomes more impressive when it is noted that the proposed merger\nwas found to be (prospectively) in violation of the statute in eaczz of the mar-\nkets considered. The essential point is, however, that some minimum share may\nwell be crucial in the law's application; furthermore, what may be large\nenough for one judge may be much too small for another.\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n", "647\n"], "4": ["or tend to create a monopoly in the market for that product even\nthough it does not substantially lessen competition or tend to create a\nmonopoly in the broader market embracing all the products which are\nreasonably interchangeable with that product. . . . This does not, how-\never, mean that interchangeability can be ignored\u2014a high degree of\ninterchangeability may under certain circumstances make it more or\nless the same product. [Citations omitted.]\n\nA simpler and, in the long run, probably more expedient way around the\nCellophane doctrine would appear to have been available: that is, to accept\nthe general relevance of imperfect substitutes in assessing the competitive\nposition of a given firm (as is done by indirection in the last sentence of the\npassage quoted); but to require a smaller percentage share for a violation of\nSection 7 of the Clayton Act than would be necessary under the antimonopoli-\nzation law. For the argument used here tends to undermine the entire ortho-\ndox rationale for the consideration of market shares in merger cases: If *the\npower to control prices or exclude competition\" is not at issue under Section\n7, then why invoke the elaborate apparatus of market definition and percent-\nage share computation which is alleged to be specifically designed to measure\n\"market control\" or *monopoly power\"\u2014i.e., the power to control prices or\nexclude competition? Why not, for example, simply demonstrate that the two\nsteel companies were satisfactory alternative sources of supply of the same or\nsubstitute products to some of the same buyers, and that the purchases of\nthese buyers were \"substantial\" in terms of money value? Let me hasten\nto say that I do not believe that the orthodox case is valid under either Section:\nI merely mean to suggest that the attempted distinction does not seem entirely\nconsistent with the rest of the Bethlehem-Youngstown decision.\n\nAt any rate, it does not appear that this decision has furnished an accept-\nable rule for market definition in merger cases which is any more satisfactory in\npractice\u2014that is, any more objectively determinate\u2014than that which would\nbe appropriate under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The suggestion that com-\npetition among imperfect substitutes can always be ignored under Section 7\nmust, of course, be rejected. A merger involving two producers of imperfect\nsubstitutes obviously could have as much anticompetitive impact, in depriving\nbuyers of alternative independent sources of effective substitutes, as a mer-\nger between producers of perfect substitutes. And if it is admitted that the im-\nperfect competition between the participants must be considered in deter-\nmining their premerger competitive relations, then it must also be admitted\nthat imperfect competition between the participants, on the one hand, and\nthe firms remaining outside, on the other, must be considered in assessing the\nexpected competitive status of the proposed combination.\n\nAn \"asymmetrical\" market definition\u2014one which would use one criterion\nfor interparticipant competition and another for competition between the par-\nticipants and outsiders\u2014cannot be defended in any way that I can see. In\nsome circumstances, admitting the relevance of nonhomogeneous competi-\ntion will tend to weaken the case against a proposed merger by enlarging the\nadmitted area of competition remaining after the merger, without any com-\nmensurate increase in the estimated amount of interparticipant competition\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "646\n"], "3": ["I. The Court's Argument\n\nThere is no doubt that Judge Weinfeld considered the definition of the af-\nfected markets to be one of the two most important questions to be considered\nin applying Section 7. In denying a motion for summary judgment, he de-\nclared [8, p. 879]:\n\nIn broad outline, the essential ultimate issues which the Court is called\nupon to determine and as to which the Government has the burden of\nproof in order to sustain its charge that the proposed merger comes with-\nin the prohibition of Section 7 are: the line or lines of commerce and the\nsection or sections of the country in which the effects of the merger may\nbe felt, or as phrased by the Supreme Court, the relevant market\u2014\"'the\narea of effective competition\" [11, p. 593]\u2014and whether the merger may\nsubstantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.\n\nThe main decision itself is to a large extent devoted to the selection of \"lines\nof commerce\" and \"sections of the country\" with reference to which the pro-\nspective impact of the proposed merger is to be measured.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect of this part of the decision is its attempt\nto distinguish between the market definition relevant under Section 2 of the\nSherman Act and that appropriate under Section 7 of the Clayton Act\u2014a dis-\ntinction which would, in brief, make \"reasonable interchangeability\" the\nproper classificatory guide in the former context as against \"peculiar charac-\nteristics and uses\" in the latter. The significance of both definitions lies, of\ncourse, in their use to delimit the nature and quantity of outputs to be in-\ncluded in the global total\u2014\"the area of effective competition\"\u2014with\nwhich the defendants! outputs are to be compared. Needless to say, the defini-\ntional distinction made in Bethlehem-Youngstown does not indicate the real\nor purported discovery of some new economic principle which would take the\nplace of substitutability in indicating competitiveness among the products\nof different firms. The distinction serves rather to epitomize the doctrine that\na (somehow) different view of market definition is appropriate under Section 7\nthan under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, and in particular that the Cellophane\ncase is not a proper precedent in cases involving the former Section. On this\npoint, the decision reads [9, pp. 593-94, note]:\n\n. . . the basic issue in the Cellophane case was that of monopoly power\nand the Supreme Court expressly limited the market definition there to\nthe monopolization clause of $2 of the Sherman Act. There is a basic\ndistinction between $2 of the Sherman Act and $7 of the Clayton Act.\nFurther, monopoly power was defined by the Supreme Court in the Cello-\nphane case as *the power to control prices or exclude competition.\"\nObviously, when the question is power over price, substitute products\nmay be relevant because they can limit that power. The issue under $7\n... s not whether a merger may result in a company having power over\nprice or the power to exclude competition . . . [it] is whether there is a\nreasonable probability of a substantial lessening of competition. There\ncan be a substantial lessening of competition with respect to a product\nwhether or not there are reasonably interchangeable substitutes. The\nmerger of two producers of a product may substantially lessen competition\n", "645\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "2": ["But beyond this, the content of the law remains uncertain. The leading re-\ncent decision [10] leaves unsettled two key points of interpretation: (1) the\ndefinition of *market control\" or *monopoly power\" as a necessary element\nin violation; (2) the need for some additional factor\u2014such as exclusionary\npractices\u2014to complete the crime of monopolizing.*\n\nAt least until the new Section of the Clayton Act [2]? is interpreted by the\nSupreme Court, the role of the market-share concept in merger regulation must\nbe similarly uncertain. However, the administration of the new Section\n[7, p. 519] and in particular the interpretation accepted by the District Court\nin what seems to be the major relevant case [9] tend to support the belief\nthat this role will be of great practical significance in the treatment of \"hori-\nzontal\" mergers. It may well be that in this area the law will prohibit those\nmergers, and only those mergers, which would combine suppliers of *large\"\npercentages of the output of some \"product,\" or would increase the share of the\n\"product\" accounted for by a firm with an already \"large\" existing share. The\naspects of the Bethlehem-Youngstown decision which appear to support such\na prediction are, first, the amount of attention devoted to the definition of\nmarkets and to the calculation of the shares in these markets accounted for\nby the participants in the proposed merger, both individually and in combina-\ntion; and, second, the treatment of the degree of concentration in the industry\nas a factor relevant to legality.\n\nLet it be said at once that the same practical outcome\u2014that is, the decision\nto enjoin the merger\u2014could very likely have been wholly justified without\nany reference to shares or concentration, and this indeed without adducing any\nevidence not cited by Judge Weinfeld. It is what appears to be the main\nline of argument, rather than the resulting action, which can be criticized on\neconomic grounds. This main line of argument is discussed in the first section\nof the present study. The second section outlines certain objections to the\npolicy implied by this argument. Finally, an alternative approach to the prob-\nlem of merger control is suggested.\n\n*In this proceeding, the majority held that the duPont company did have \"monopoly\npower\" over the cellophane market, but held this fact to be irrelevant on the ground that\nthe market which should be considered relevant is not the cellophane market but that for\n\"flexible packaging material.\" In general, the relevant market should, the court held, include\n\"commodities reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes.\" As to the\nneed for some other element in addition to monopoly power, the Cellophane decision does\nnot expressly reject the court's \"conclusion in prior cases that when an alleged monopolist\nhas power over price and competition, an intention to monopolize in a proper case may be\nassumed\"; but it is also pointed out that at least one of the framers of the Sherman Act\ncertainly intended that \"something like\" exclusionary practices must be employed by an\nalleged monopolist before he could be convicted under Section 2. Since the Cellophane de-\ncision hinges on a finding that no monopoly power existed, the question of completion of\nthe crime is not directly at issue.\n\n^ In 1950, Section 7 of the original 1914 Act was strengthened by an amendment making\nit applicable to acquisitions of assets as well as of securities; eliminating the provision which\nlimited the \"substantial lessening of competiton\" relevant under the Act to that \"between\nthe acquiring and the acquired corporation\"; and substituting the phrase \"in any line of\ncommerce in any section of the country\" for the older \"in any community\" as a description\nof the sector of commerce within which illegal restraint might occur.\n", "644\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "1": ["One of the most important unsolved problems in antitrust policy concerns\nthe precise significance of the market share of the defendant in determining\nwhether or not certain violations have occurred.

The\nmarginal propensity to consume out of wind\u00edall income is .167. It is only one-\nfifth of the marginal propensity to consume out of current income. When dura-\nble goods are excluded from consumption, the marginal propensity to consume\nnondurables out of windfall income is .156. Since the term \"consumption\" as\nused by Friedman is broader than the strictly nondurable concept, the mar-\nginal propensity to consume relevant to this hypothesis would be somewhere\nbetween .156 and .167. The smallness of this figure is consistent with the\npermanent income hypothesis.\n\nIn commenting on Bodkin's results, Milton Friedman suggested the possi-\nbility that the dividend payments were partly a proxy for a permanent in-\ncome. Thus, he writes: My casual inquiry sufficed to show that it is not\nimplausible to suppose a connection between the size of the dividend payments\nand factors connected with permanent income\" [4, pp. 197-98]. There are\nhardly any a priori reasons for expecting such a relation in the case of restitu-\ntion receipts by Israelis. Indeed the data reveal a low correlation* between\nwindfall and current income with R,, \u2014 .34.\n\nTo be sure, the data used in this study are not comparable to those em-\nployed by Bodkin. First, availability of goods on the markets varied greatly\nbetween the two countries. Second, the reparation payments in Israel were\nmuch larger relative to current income than the insurance dividends in the\nUnited States, and the difference between Bodkin's and my results may be\ndue to this factor.

By buying the bonds, the public\nreveals its preference for the bonds over current consumption or private secu-\nrities and incurs no more of a burden than if it had bought Ford stock or Ford\nautomobiles instead.? A burden is imposed on the public only if and a\u00a3 the\ntime when the promise written into the bonds is either formally broken or bro-\nken in spirit. This happens, for example, when the public project financed by\nthe bonds fails to raise the gross national product and the government pays\ninterest on the bonds out of additional taxation. In such a case, the interest\npayments fail to add to disposable income and thus fool the public. This con-\nstitutes, in a sense, a breaking of the government's original promise, since the\npublic sacrificed consumption and/or private capital formation in exchange\nfor the promise of additional income (the interest on the bonds) which it is\nnot getting. Bowen ef al. are right in arguing that the burden so imposed is a\ngenuine burden and that it is distributed over the entire lifetime of the bonds\n\u2014as well as over the lifetime of all future bonds that may be issued for the\nsake of redeeming the original ones.*\n\nI part company with the authors when they speak of yet another burden\nimposed by and at the time of the redemption of the bonds. They argue that\nwhen the government repays the debt, the additional taxation reduces dispos-\nable income and hence consumption, while the replacement of the public's\nholdings of bonds by cash has little or no effect on its market behavior, so that\non balance consumption is reduced, which, they assert, is the main burden of\nthe debt. This would be all right, except that the authors forget about the\ncrucial assumption of full employment they made earlier. If full employment\nand stable prices obtain when the debt falls due for redemption and an unen-\nlightened government raises taxes (or lowers public spending) in order to cre-\nate the budgetary surplus needed to redeem the debt, then the redemption\nwill lower GNP and inflict a burden on society\u2014but the assumption of full\nemployment has thus been abandoned hal\u00edf-way. If on the other hand the gov-\nernment successfully offsets the restrictive effects of its budgetary surplus by\na monetary policy designed to encourage private investment, then the result-\ning rise in GNP will offset the effect of higher taxes on disposable income and\nno burden will be imposed on the public. Or again, if all this happens at a time\nof inflationary pressures and the government redeems the debt as part of its\nprice-stabilization policy, then again no additional burden is imposed; for the\n\n*'This correction is necessary, because individuals in their economic calculations always\nassume their incomes to be fixed.\n\n*Tt might be argued, however, that the purchase of war-bonds under pressure of patriotic\nappeal does involve a burden; but is this more of a burden than that imposed on the buyer\nof a new car who acts under the influence of high-pressure salesmanship?\n\n*In the language of opportunity costs, this burden is the foregone fruit of growth sac-\nrificed.\n", "138\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "1": ["The Burden of the Public Debt: Comment\n\nIn *The Public Debt: A Burden on Future Generations?,\"* Messrs.

At the same\ntime, however, we must insist that none of these comments alters our central\npoint\u2014that debt financing, by means of the intergeneration transfer process\ndescribed in our original paper, can serve to shift the burden of government\nspending from present to future generations.\n\nThe main thing to be said about Vickrey's paper is that it represents a dif-\nferent approach to the debt burden problem. Whereas we chose to analyze the\ndebt burden in terms of the distribution of lifetime consumption between gen-\nerations, Vickrey has chosen to analyze the e\u00edfects of debt finance on the fu-\nture level of real income for society as a whole.\n\nFrom this latter vantage point, Vickrey is certainly entitled to object to our\nassumption that bond purchases are financed entirely out of consumption.! In\nthe real world an increase in the public debt will undoubtedly lead to a re-\nduction in both consumption (C) and investment (7) ; and the secular growth\nin GNP will be slower the greater the reduction in / relative to C.\n\nBut this is by no means the only way in which debt financing can alter the\nrelative economic position of different generations. Vickrey's line of reasoning\nis in no way inconsistent with the important point that, regardless of whether\nloan finance reduces C or 7, loan finance can result in intergeneration trans-\nfers of burden. No matter what happens to C and 7, Generation I (the present\ngeneration) is going to enjoy a higher level of lifetime consumption relative to\nthe consumption of future generations if government expenditures are financed\nby issuance of debt instruments than if taxes are employed. Under the tax op-\ntion, Generation I loses either immediate consumption or private claims\nagainst investment goods and receives no monetary asset in exchange; under\nthe dept option, Generation I also sacrifices some combination of C and 7, but\nin this case receives an asset (government bonds) in exchange, and thus en-\njoys the option of selling these bonds later in life to obtain either consumption\ngoods or claims against private investment. Consequently, the assumption that\nloan finance reduces private consumption is in no way essential to the logic of\nour argument, and was used to highlight the otherwise unrecognized fact that\neven if loan finance fails to dampen private investment, the present generation\ncan still shift at least a part of the burden of government spending to future\ngenerations.\n\nAnother way of making the same point is to note that even if the method of\nfinance were to leave the investment-consumption mix unaltered, the loan-\nfinance technique would make the members of Generation I better off relative\n\n* There are several places in our original paper where it appears that we assert\u2014Trather\n\nthan assume\u2014that borrowing a\u00edfects only consumption. This was unfortunate, and we\napologize for any resulting confusion.\n", "Jawzs R. ErL10TT\n", "during a potentially deflationary period without serious consequences.

They state: |1, p. 703]\n\n.. Suppose... that during the lifetime of Generation II the govern-\nment decides to retire the debt by levying a general tax in excess of current\ngovernment spending and using the surplus to buy up the bonds that are\nnow held by members of Generation II. The inevitable outcome of this\ndecision is a reduction in the lifetime consumption of Generation II. The\ntaxpayers of Generation II forego consumption in order to retire the debt\nand yet the bondholders of Generation II do not experience any net life-\ntime increase in their claims on consumption goods since they are simply\nreimbursed for the consumption foregone at the time when they (Genera-\ntion II) bought the bonds from Generation I. Conclusion: the burden of\npublic project X rests squarely on Generation II, and not on Generation I.\n\n1f, however, taxpayers reduce consumption in order to pay additional taxes,\nwho will consume the goods made available? Surely not the bondholders\nwhose bonds are retired. Had they wished to consume, they would have sold\nthe bonds on the market or not bought them in the first place. The bond re-\ntirement will force the (former) bondholders to shift their savings into other\nforms\u2014insurance, equity securities, industrial bonds, etc. Bowen, e\u00a3 al., im-\nplicitly assume that the bondholders of Generation II, having been bought out,\nwould use the proceeds for consumption. This is a completely unwarranted\nassumption. The bond retirement program simply changes the form of the as-\nsets of the (former) bondholders from bonds to deposits but does not increase\ntheir income or consumption.\n\nAs the government (of Generation II's lifetime) raises the tax surplus to\nretire the debt, one of two possibilities may occur: (1) aggregate real con-\nsumption does not decline (although aggregate dollar consumption does) in\nwhich case the bond retirement must have been effected during a period of in-\nflationary pressure; or (2) aggregate real consumption does decline, forcing\nGNP and investment down, and possibly initiating a chain reaction.\n\nIn the first case there has been no burden whatever on Generation II. The\nreal standard of living remains constant and the debt has been repaid from\notherwise-inflationary purchasing power. In the second case (which is actual-\nly outside of the Bowen-Davis-Kopf frame of reference because they assume\nfull employment), there is a very real burden but it follows from poor fiscal\npolicy rather than from the repayment of debt.\n\nWere prices free and flexible, a surplus in taxes and a concomitant reduc-\ntion in dollar consumption would lead to lower prices\u2014leaving the taxpayer\nwith fewer dollars for consumption but with correspondingly lower prices. In\nthis case, too, the repayment is burdenless. In an economy with sticky, ad-\nministered prices, however, a surplus cannot be accumulated through taxation\n", "140\n", "''HE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "1": ["The Burden of the Public Debt: Comment\n\nThe DBowen-Davis-Kopf thesis presented in \"The Public Debt: A Burden\non Future Generations\"! purports to show that, under certain circumstances,\nthe burden of a portion of the national debt can be shifted to future genera-\ntions.

In other instances, as one\nmight expect, we found cases where perfectly valid conclusions were reached\non the basis of an inappropriate assumption. Again we found that a more de-\ntailed examination of test results indicated that the typical student understands\na good deal more basic economics than Whitney's study would lead us to expect.\n\nQuantitative evaluation of the progress of a college student on any basis ex-\ncept a comparative one seems doomed to futility. To test adequately the abso-\nlute progress of principles students, we must first find a test that measures ab-\nsolute progress with reasonable accuracy. As any instructor knows, it probably\nwould be possible to construct a test on which most students would score\nabout as well at the beginning as at the end of the course; or to construct a test\non which students would usually do poorly at the beginning and very well at\nthe end, etc. To meet this problem we need a test that gives an accurate meas-\nure of progress in understanding. The simplest way to construct such a test\nwould be to take students with known capabilities and develop a test on\nwhich \"A\" students typically perform well, ^B\" students not so well, and so\non. But, if we adopt this procedure, we define our testing procedure circularly.\nOur results would be that, after two semesters of economics, good students do\nwell, poor students do not, and the average student makes average progress.\nWhitney apparently does not fully appreciate this problem. He cites several\npossible objections to his testing procedure and then goes on to show that even\ngranting the objections the direction of the results will not normally be affect-\ned. He misses the point. To the degree that criticisms of the test sets Whit-\nney used have a bearing on his quantitative results the objections are highly\nsignificant. That is we accept the premise that students learn something in\ntwo semesters of economics; we want to know how much.\n\nIn contrast to Whitney we conclude that, lacking valid data to the contrary,\nthe teaching of economics on the college level is satisfactory. We share the\nhope that it can be improved, but we consider economics to have an important\nenough place in college training so that, with or without measurable improve-\nment in the teaching of this subject, the course should be retained. This is our\nvalue judgment. We would never pretend it is anything else.\n\nCuanLEs E. Rockwoop*\nRicuangp B. HARSHBARGER\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. H.
