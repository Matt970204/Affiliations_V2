When this function is used in a simple growth model, in which\ninvestment (saving) is a constant fraction of output, results are gen-\nerated that make rough sense in terms of observed experience. Thus, a\nrate of net investment of 10 per cent together with an output-capital\nratio of one-third will yield in such a model an annual growth rate of\nabout 3 per cent. Economists have found such models attractive be-\ncause of their relatively simple structure, because of the emphasis they\ngive to capital accumulation as an \"engine of growth\"\u2014an emphasis\nwith deep roots in economic thought\u2014and because of their pragmati-\ncally satisfying results. In consequence they have played a central\nrole during recent years in theories of growth and development.\n\nUnfortunately the production function P \u2014 aK has nothing interesting\nto say about resource allocation or income distribution. Worse than\nthis, as a general statement of the resources required in production, it is\npositively wrong, as any one-factor production function must be. The\nlimitations of the Cobb-Douglas function, this time in a growth setting,\nare less transparent but nonetheless weighty. When this function is used\nin a growth model of the kind just described, with growth in the labor\nforce taken as autonomous, the resulting Jong-term rate of growth in\noutput turns out to equal the rate of growth in the labor force. Growth\nin output per worker, commonly regarded as the essence of develop-\nment, is zero, and the rate of investment exerts no effect *\n\nA second limitation of the Cobb-Douglas function appears when it is\nfitted to historical data. An improved fit generally is obtainable if the\nexponents B and a are allowed to vary freely instead of being constrained\nto equal unity. With some sets of data, the resulting sum of the expo-\nnents has differed significantly from unity, an outcome that opens the\ndoor to economies and diseconomies of scale and that leads to abandon-\nment of the convenient assumption that factors are paid their marginal\nproducts. A reluctance to use the Cobb-Douglas function in its pure\nform results also from findings like those of M. Abramovitz that for the\n\nfactor shares will remain stable. The use of a constant elasticity function, a broader class of\nlinear homogeneous production functions in which the Cobb-Douglas function becomes a spe-\ncial case, opens up interesting possibilities for economic analysis. See [2].\n\nShare stability is not an issue of consequence in the present paper. Although the unitary\nelasticity property of the Cobb-Douglas function, like others of its properties, affects the par-\nticular results obtained at various points, the main line of argument is not dependent on it.\nFor the purpose at hand, moreover, there are advantages in the function's simplicity and\nfamiliarity.\n\n?

In\neffect, for Clark this process consists mainly of underlining the monopolistic\ntendencies that neoclassical theorists often ignored and of heavily discounting\nthe monopolistic tendencies inherent in a situation where sellers are few and\nproducts are differentiated. The upshot is a persistent emphasis on the benef-\nicent role of big business as it has developed willy-nilly and as it currently\noperates.

This of course provided him with a curve of constant elasticity\nand hence supplied a secure basis from which to develop his results. Thus\nhe showed that, if the risk allowance is constant over all projects or if the\nallowances differ but are random with respect to expected yields, the func-\ntion adjusted for risk is less elastic than the unadjusted one. Although these\nresults support the usual claims that risk reduces elasticity, Tarshis pointed\nout that over a wide range of circumstances the introduction of the risk\nallowance would not necessarily transform an elastic unadjusted function into\nan inelastic one. He then considered the case where the risk allowance is a\nfixed proportion of the expected yields. Here the introduction of risk produces\nno effect on the elasticity\u2014a result which clearly contradicts the effect usually\nattributed to risk.\n\nHad Tarshis used the linear instead of the hyperbolic function as his spe-\ncial case he could have (1) handled each of the three conditions more simply,\n(2) reversed the elasticity effects for the first two cases and thus raised even\ngreater scepticism about the effects of risk on elasticity, and (3) obtained a\nstronger result for his last condition. Whereas the use of the hyperbolic\nrelationship conveniently provides a function with constant elasticity, the\nlinear relationship makes use instead of the property of constant slope. This\nfeature also gives rise to a function which, at successively higher levels of\ninvestment, shows decreasing elasticity. Whether either a function with de-\ncreasing elasticity or one with constant elasticity is a reasonable one is, of\ncourse, an empirical question. This is not an issue which we shall pursue\nhere (other than to note that in at least one recent empirical study of the\neffect of the interest rate on investment, the authors explicitly express a\npreference for a linear function over a hyperbolic one [1, p. 85]).

In order to maintain direct\ncomparability to standard results on excess reserves and the expansion of\ncredit, we dealt with a highly artificial model. Any relevance that a sequential\nformulation might have for the task we undertook was deliberately dissipated\nby the assumptions of footnotes 4 and 6 of our paper, noted earlier in this\ndiscussion. It is quite true, but nonetheless irrelevant, that a carryover of\nexcess reserves from one evaluation period to the next is indistinguishable\nfrom an injection of new free reserves at the beginning of the second of these\nevaluation periods.\n\nThe distinction between marginal credit expansion (net deposits created\nin response to an extra dollar of free reserves) and total credit expansion (the\nratio of total deposits to total reserves) should be a familiar one.\n\nDawi\u00a3L Ong AND W.

In the sixth example of Table 1 (p. 619) we tried\nto illustrate the absurdity of precisely the profit function coefficients sug-\ngested by Miller. Note b to that example points out that by setting r greater\nthan i, one \"takes into account only the money gained, and ignores such\nnonquantified factors as reputation for soundness.\" It should be noted that\nif the response of the profit function to changes in r and i is not linear as we\nhave assumed [equation (4), p. 617], the stricture quoted in the preceding\nsentence would not necessarily be valid. Since our analysis is illustrative,\nrather than empirical, we used this linear response for computational viabil-\nity. If it can be shown that the use of more satisfactory alternative forms of\nthese responses jeopardizes the validity of our conclusions, we will defer to\na valid criticism of our approach: meanwhile, Miller's rearrangement of the\nmagnitude of r and i is not admissible for our model.\n\n2. In elementary expositions of the credit expansion process, one encoun-\nters cascaded \"generations\" of banks; each generation receives as excess re-\nserves the loans extended as a preceding generation expands credit in re-\nsponse to an excess reserve position. Miller associates a heuristic time period\nwith each round in the credit expansion process, and he mistakenly identifies\nthis interval with the time period referred to in our paper, the period at\nwhich the reserve positions of member banks are reviewed by the Federal\nReserve System. (Nowhere do we use the word \"period\" to refer to any other\ntime span: longer intervals are irrelevant because of the assumptions of foot-\nnote 4, p. 616; shorter intervals are ruled out by the assumptions of footnote\n6, p. 616.) Miller is correct in suggesting that we take into account only one\nperiod of activity (which we attempt to justify in footnote 4); however, we\ndo not thereby ignore all rounds of the credit expansion process which suc-\nceed the first, as he erroneously concludes. Our quantitative results on the\nsystemwide expansion process (pp. 620-21) are in fact based on quite the\nopposite assumptions; we see the entire response as taking place within one\nof our periods.\n\nMiller's misunderstanding of our paper is not confined to these two central\npoints. We assume that the variance of the probability distribution of cash\nflows into and out of the banking system is invariant with the number of\nbanks, and analyze the effect of the number of banks on the theoretically\noptimal volume of credit expansion. Miller finds this assumption indigestible\non the ground that it conflicts with **. . . the observed behavior of the larger\nbut still far from monopoly banks in our system whose aim is to hold vir-\ntually no excess reserves.\" That our assumption is not incompatible with\nMiller's observed empirical fact is evident from the conclusion that we draw:\nas the number of banks in the system decreases, the total precautionary re-\nserve balances also decrease. For any bank the optimal level for these reserve\nbalances is a function of the standard deviation of cash flows confronting the\nbank. A variance of 100 con\u00edronting a single bank leads to precautionary\nbalances of some multiple of 10 (say 105); the same variance confronting\n10 identical banks leads to total precautionary balances of (10)?/5; with\n100 identical banks, precautionary balances are 100&.

Homan, I have occupied the chair of managing editor of\nthe Review for eleven years. Engrossing though the work has been and much as I shall\nmiss it, I am certain that it is wise for the responsibility for selecting the contents of the\nmajor publication of the major economics association to be passed on fairly regularly to\na younger member of the profession who will view current research afresh.\n\nThe Association is fortunate that John G. Gurley is willing to assume these responsi-\nbilitie. Given his previous experience on the editorial board of the Journal of Finance\nand his recent three-months period as acting managing editor during my absence, I know\nthat the transition will be a smooth one. His good judgment, his catholic interests in\neconomics, his keen analytical mind, and his fine critical sense will serve the Review and\nthe profession well.\n\nHe will find, as I have, that the work can only be done at all satisfactorily if he has\nthe conscientious help of many members of the profession. A genuine concern for the\nadvancement of economics and a strong sense of responsibility to the Association have\nmade some of the most brilliant younger economists willing to serve on the editorial\nboard during my eleven years\u2014and I would have been badly off indeed without their\nadvice and good judgment. Literally hundreds of other economists have read manu-\nscripts for me and appraised them critically\u2014\u00edrequently contributing substantially (but\nanonymously) to the research results of many, particularly younger, authors. Hundreds\nof economists have been willing to set aside other, more interesting work to perform the\nvery important task of book-reviewing. To all of these people, the economics profession\nis heavily indebted\u2014and so, in particular, am I. I wish it were possible for me to thank\nevery one of them individually.\n\nThe exercise of judgment in the final selection of materials to be accorded publication\nis the most difficult\u2014and sleep-disturbing\u2014responsibility of the managing editor. No\nmatter how much good advice may be at his disposal, he finally has to decide which of\nmany good articles should be accepted. When space limitations permit only the acceptance\nof 12 to 16 per cent of the manuscripts submitted, many authors have to be disappointed.\nFortunately the really important contribution nearly always is published, even though\nthe first journal to which it is submitted may not be able to use it. And the competition\nfor publication undoubtedly has a good effect on the quality of research in our field.\nNevertheless, rejection hurts; and I want to express my appreciation to the many hundreds\nof authors whose papers I have been unable to accept for the almost unfailing good\nnature and understanding they have shown in their acceptance of my decisions\u2014even\nthough they did not always think them wise ones.\n\nFinaly, I must add my appreciation for the constant helpfulness, complete devotion\nto the task, and intelligent good judgment of my editorial assistant, Miss Doris Merriam,\nwho after sixteen years with two managing editors of the Review has been unable to\ncontemplate the prospect of breaking in still a third managing editor. I know that the\nmany members of the Association who have known her, at least through correspondence,\nwill join me and other officers of the Association in wishing her well in her new career\nwith the Peace Corps in Latin America.\n\nTo John Gurley go my best wishes for a highly successful term as the fourth managing\neditor of the American Economic Review.\n\nBrnwamp F.

Warren\nNutter has said that Soviet industrial output was about 25 per cent of\nthe U.S. level in 1955 [23, p. 112], while Allen Dulles of the Central\nIntelligence Agency asserted in 1959 that the correct figure was 40 per\ncent of the U.S. level [22, p. 4].

Nutter explains his method, but it is an\nextremely indirect one that prompts suspicion because it compounds two\nkinds of index-number ambiguities. His approach is to project the alleged\nrelative standing in 1913 to the present by means of his indexes of growth\nfor each country.\n\nAnother analyst has concluded that Soviet industrial output in 1956\nwas about 48-51 per cent of the U.S. level, depending on weighting sys-\ntems and estimating procedures [13].

In building the case for\nhis conclusions Baumol states, as a minor point in his argument, that:\n*Executive salaries appear to be far more closely correlated with the\nscale of operations of the firm than with its profitability\" [1, p. 46]. It\nis this statement which is the principal concern of this paper.

And, of course, few things have\nbeen less common than objective analyses of the grounds for dissatisfaction\nor coherent and comprehensive programs for accelerating our growth. This is\nthe gap that Edward Denison's book attempts to fill. His work is, in fact, a\nnotable contribution to a vexed and difficult subject. In astonishingly brief\ncompass, Denison presents a picture of past trends in output growth and in\nthe development of the various sources to which the growth of productive\ncapacity can be traced, a projection of the probable future flows from these\nsources, and a measured evaluation of the possible steps that might be taken\nto make the flows still larger. Moreover, in grappling with these complicated\nand still largely unexplored issues, he has achieved a quite remarkable com-\nbination of technical finesse and depth with clear and almost deceptively\nsimple exposition. The book is, therefore, a minor miracle of lucidity and\npersuasiveness which calls for the most serious study by economists while it\nengages the attention of a much wider audience.\n\nIt would perhaps be too much to say that, with the appearance of Denison's\nbook, the whole subject of U.S. economic growth has been decisively clarified,\nthat we now know where we have come from, where we are going, and what\nwe can reasonably try to do about it.

This evidently raises\nethical issues similar to those involved in the suppression of unfavorable\nwar news or of unpromising medical diagnoses. It also poses a technical\ndilemma: to achieve economic objectives it may be necessary to repeatedly\nhoodwink the public; but the possibility of hoodwinking derives from gul-\nlibility, and even the most gullible will not be deceived indefinitely by the\nsame confidence trick.

It is sometimes suggested that econ-\nomists' forecasts are \"self validating,\" implying that a forecast will be\nmore nearly correct if it is made public than if it is kept a dark secret.\nAlmost at the other extreme, there is the view that publicly announced fore-\ncasts must inevitably be invalidated by the response of the business world\nto the forecast. On a slightly different plane, it is sometimes argued that the\ninstability of the economy can be traced, at least in part, to faulty fore-\ncasting and would be reduced by an improvement in the quality of fore-\ncasts.\n\nThis paper will examine the validity of these three points.

One judge, in a dissenting opinion, argued that competition be-\ntween the firms must have existed for the law to be violated. The latter in-\nterpretation became the law after the Supreme Court opinion in the Inter-\nnational Shoe case in 1930, which said [7, pp. 297-99]:\n\nThus it appears that in respect of 95 percent of the business there was\nno competition in fact and no contest, or observed tendency to contest,\nin the market for the same purchasers; and it is manifest that, when\nthis is eliminated, what remains is of such slight consequence as to\ndeprive the finding that there was substantial competition between the\ntwo corporations, of any real support in the evidence. . . .\n\nMere acquisition by one corporation of the stock of a competitor,\neven though it results in some lessening of competition, is not forbidden;\nthe act deals with such acquisitions as probably will result in lessening\ncompetition to a substantial degree . . . that is to say, to such a degree\nas will injuriously affect the public. . . . If it be conceded that the entire\nremaining 5 percent of each company's product (although clearly it was\nmaterially less than that) was sold in competitive markets, it is hard to\nsee in this, competition of such substance as to fall within the serious\npurposes of the Clayton Act.\n\nThe Court thus judged substantialness in terms of the share of the total\nbusiness of the two firms that was done in competition with each other,\nrather than the shares of the total sales in any particular market that were\nin the hands of the two parties to the merger. As a result of this decision,\nthe Federal Trade Commission adopted the policy that the public interest\nis best served by preventing mergers between companies that displayed a\nsubstantial proportion of their business in competition with each other ir-\nrespective of the structure of control of the particular markets in which they\noperated [9, Ch. 5].\n\nThe Celler-Kefauver Act, by changing the language of the criterion of\nillegality of Section 7, superseded the pre-1950 Clayton Act precedents. By\nincluding asset acquisitions, the 1950 legislation superseded the Sherman\nAct precedents. A new body of law on mergers is now being evolved. Mrs.\nKeyes's proposal would allow the courts to draw upon the old Clayton Act\nprecedents by refocusing on the relationship between the merging firms.\nWhere two firms sell some product in a particular section of the country,\nthe effect of their merger does not necessarily depend on how much they sell\nof other products in other markets.

The Keyes Criterion\n\nMrs. Keyes suggests that *. .. . to prohibit mergers between firms signifi-\ncantly competitive with one another might well be the best available course.\"\nShe recognized that such a criterion raises a conceptual problem of defining\n\"significant competitiveness,\" saying [8, p. 654]:\n\nIt is necessary to draw a definite and defensible line between the com-\npetitiveness which will make a merger subject to legal control and the\ngeneral competitiveness between each pair of firms in the economy; and\nthe rough distinction between \"potential\" and *actual\" competition is\nnot sufficiently precise to serve this purpose.\n\nMrs. Keyes, therefore, further suggests [8, p. 654]:\n\n. .. that the legal test of significant competitiveness among merger par-\nticipants be satisfiied by showing that some nonnegligible amount of dol-\nlar revenues of one participant is accounted for by sales for which buyers\nwould have substituted the other participant's product, had it been offered\nat the lowest cost-covering price, if the actual seller had withdrawn his\nsupplies.\n\nAlthough this line is reasonably precisely drawn conceptually, it would\nbe extremely difficult for the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Com-\nmission to prove its allegations with substantial evidence. Just as the court\nmust now decide subjectively on the relevant market and the effects of a\nmarket-share increase, it would have to speculate about what buyers would\nhave done if things had been different. Furthermore, the judge would have to\ndecide what.constitutes a *nonnegligible amount of dollar revenues.\" Would\nthis be interpreted to mean a \"substantial amount\"? If so, we would return\nto a criterion of illegality very similar to that used by the Federal Trade\nCommission and the courts in interpreting the original Section 7.\n\nI have argued elsewhere [9, Ch. 3-5] that it was this interpretation of the\nlanguage of the statute rather than the so-called assets loophole that really\nemasculated the statute. The original Section 7 of the Clayton Act prohibited\na stock acquisition [2].\n\n. . Where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen\ncompetition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the\ncorporation making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any\nsection or community, or tend to create a monopoly of any line of com-\nmerce.\n", "In the recent Clayton Act cases the courts have shown their willingness\nto prohibit mergers with horizontal aspects on the basis of a showing that\npreviously independent suppliers of some clearly defined and well recognized\nproduct to customers in some geographical area recognized as a trade area\nhave been joined by the merger, even though their market shares are small\nas compared to the Sherman Act precedents. Is this not what Congress in-\ntended? What are the alternatives to such a case-by-case examination of the\neffects of a merger on the structure of control of the relevant markets?\n", "526\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "4": ["tion of control in such a market is sufficient to convince the judge that a\ntendency toward monopoly or a substantial lessening of competition may\nresult. Mrs. Keyes objects to the use of such a criterion because it requires\nthe application of a rule of reason that may result in the statute prohibiting\nonly those acquisitions that involve firms with large market shares.\n\nFurthermore, she sees a contradiction inherent in the statement of Judge\nWeinfeld that the issue is not, under the Clayton Act, *whether a merger\nmay result in a company having power over price or the power to exclude\ncompetition.\" She points out [8, p. 646] that a more expedient way around the\nCellophane doctrine would have been simply to have accepted the relevance\nof substitute products and required a smaller share for a violation of the\nClayton Act because\n\n. . the argument used here tends to undermine the entire orthodox\nrationale for the consideration of market shares in merger cases: If \"the\npower to control prices or exclude competition\" is not at issue under\nSection 7, then why invoke the elaborate apparatus of market definition\nand percentage share computation which is alleged to be specifically\ndesigned to measure *market control\" or *monopoly power\"\u2014i.e., the\npower to control prices or exclude competition?\n\nAmbiguous as it may be, Judge Weinfeld's reasoning can be defended on\nthese grounds: Congress clearly intended that the new Clayton Act standard\nof illegality be such as to prohibit some mergers that would be allowed under\nthe Sherman Act test, The Sherman Act test required the plaintiff to demon-\nstrate the relevance of a market defined in terms of products to be included\nas well as in terms of some geographical limitation. Within such a market\nthe share of the accused firm had to be large. A body of precedents exists\nfor evaluating al] t/ree of these aspects of a case at bar\u2014 particularly the\nAlcoa, Columbia Steel, and Cellophane decisions. In enacting the new legisla-\ntion Congress was instructing the courts to depart from the existing prece-\ndents in the direction of prohibiting more mergers. Why should the change\nbe made only with respect to market shares? Economists certainly have no\nobjective method of delineating a market. A subjective value judgment must\nbe made. Congress was dissatisfied with the judgments under the Sherman\nAct, but the Celler-Kefauver Act provided no new method of making deci-\nsions. It simply called for value judgments by judges and the Federal Trade\nCommission that would place a lighter burden of proof on the government\nthan the Sherman Act required in merger cases. In effect, Judge Weinfeld\nand the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, have decided to implement the new\nCongressional policy by providing new precedents that change the law with\nrespect to the definition of the product and the section of the country as\nwell as the magnitude of the market shares required for conviction. It is, of\ncourse, true that the Bethlehem-Youngstown decision does not provide a rule\nfor market definition that is *any more objectively determinate . . . than that\nwhich would be appropriate under Section 2 of the Sherman Act\" [8, p.\n646]. But it does provide a precedent that will serve to make it easier for\nthe government to stop horizontal mergers.\n", "525\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["[4].

In arguing the case on appeal, the Commission's attorneys substi-\ntuted eight discontinuous areas around the port cities for the continuous\nstrip. It was on this ground that the court remanded the case to the Com-\nmission for further consideration. Significantly, however, the court said that\n\"the government's proposed definition of the relevant market area is not on\nits face inconsistent with anything in Section 7 of the Clayton Act.\"\n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recently reviewed another decision of\nthe Federal Trade Commission, in which the Commission ordered Crown\nZellerbach to divest itself of the assets of the St. Helen's Pulp and Paper\nCompany [5]. Since this was the first case to be decided on its merits by\nthe Commission and the first to be finally reviewed by a Court of Appeals,\nit is likely to become an important precedent and needs to be considered\ncarefully in evaluating the new statute.\n\nThe Commission decided that the relevant line of commerce was *'coarse\npaper\" as defined by the Census Bureau, although the respondent urged the\ninclusion of other types of paper products [6, p. 3]. Crown Zellerbach argued\nthat the relevant section of the country should be the whole United States,\nor at least the part west of the Mississippi River. The Commission decided\ninstead to use the eleven western states on the grounds that sales made in\nthat area by producers located to the east were \"relatively insignificant.\"\nWith the relevant market thus defined, there were only ten producers in the\nmarket, and during the year of the acquisition the market shares of Crown\nZellerbach and St. Helen's were 51.5 and 11 per cent, respectively.\n\nThe court upheld the decision of the Commission, but it went even further\nin narrowing the definition of the market. The court added manufactured\nbags\" to \"census coarse papers\" as the relevant line of commerce, but it\nruled that the three Pacific Coast states were the proper section of the coun-\ntry. The court explicitly stated that \"the line of commerce need not even\nbe a large part of the business of any of the corporations involved.\" Fur-\nthermore, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals gave its sanction to Judge\nWeinfeld's distinction between the Sherman Act criterion on monopolizing\nand the new Clayton Act criterion by quoting with approval this statement\nfrom the Bethlehem opinion [10]:\n\n. . When the question is power over price, substitute products may be\nrelevant because they can limit that power. The issue under Section 7\nof the Clayton Act is not whether a merger may result in a company\nhaving power over price or the power to exclude competition. The issue\nunder Section 7 is whether there is a reasonable probability of sub-\nstantial lessening of competition.\n\nThe ultimate test of the meaning of the standard of legality contained in\nthe amended Clayton Act will come only when a series of cases have been\ndecided by the Supreme Court. These two Circuit Court of Appeals opinions,\nhowever, indicate that a policy is evolving that will prohibit horizontal merg-\ners among firms competing in azy market so long as the resulting concentra-\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "524\n"], "2": ["two grounds: (1) several recent cases indicate that her pessimism about\nthe effectiveness of the market-share criterion in stopping horizontal mergers\nis unwarranted, and (2) the alternative criterion she suggests would very\nlikely achieve no better, if not worse, results.\n\nI. The Market-Share Criterion in Other Cases\n\nThe use of the market-share criterion has already resulted in a number\nof Federal Trade Commission and lower court decisions to stop or dissolve\nhorizontal mergers that clearly would have been allowed under either the old\nClayton Act (if they had been stock acquisitions) or the Sherman Act. The\nmarkets have been defined very narrowly both with respect to the line of\ncommerce and the section of the country, and the condemned market shares\nin some cases have been quite small compared with those applied in Sherman\nAct cases. Mrs. Keyes, herself, in discussing Bethlehem-Youngstown [8, p.\n647] says:\n\nOn the other hand, it must be admitted that the percentages at issue in\nthis case, while large as compared with the negligible share attributable\nto the member of a pure-competition industry, are small compared to\nthe shares considered significant in Sherman Act cases. . . . This relative\nsmallness becomes more impressive when it is noted that the proposed\nmerger was found to be (prospectively) in violation of the statute in\neach of the markets considered.\n\nThis observation does not, however, allay the fears of Mrs. Keyes, who\ngoes on to say:\n\n\"The essential point is, however, that some minimum share may be crucial\nin the law's application; furthermore, what may be large enough for one\njudge may be much too small for another.\n\nThe share of the market that is used, however, must be considered in con-\njunction with the breadth of the definition of the line of commerce and the\nsection of the country. In the Bethlehem-Voungstown case the district court\nwas willing to declare the merger unlawful on the basis of proof of substan-\ntial lessening of competition in a market as small as that of hot rolled bars\"\nin Ohio [8, p. 647]. Citing this case as a precedent, Judge Weber, in the\nBrown Shoe Company case [11, p. 736], found a relevant market by which\nto judge the acquisition of the Kinney Company by Brown to be the retail\nmarket for shoes in any city in the country in which a Kinney store and a\nBrown store are operated.\n\nIn the Erie Sand and Gravel Company case the Federal Trade Commission\ndistinguished between \"lake sand\" and \"pit or bank sand,\" and defined the\nmarket geographically as a strip along the southern shore of Lake Erie ex-\ntending twelve miles inland. This decision was reviewed by the Third Circuit\nCourt of Appeals, which rejected the distinction between lake and pit sand\n\n?Before the 1950 amendment to Section 7, the Clayton Act applied only to the\nacquisition and continued holding of the stock of one corporation by another.

The dollar amount should be determined,\nafter an empirical study of past mergers, with a view to inclusion within the\nlaw's reach of as many anticompetitive mergers\u2014beginning at the top of the\nsize range of affected sales and proceeding downward\u2014as the budget of the\nAntitrust Department could accommodate without encroaching on more ur-\ngent uses for public funds, due account also being taken of the costs to the\ncourts and private litigants. This minimum should be either written into the\nlaw as a dollar amount, with provision for periodic amendment to take into\naccount changes in the price level and other relevant variables, or adminis-\ntratively determined, at appropriate intervals, subject to Congressional re-\nview.\n\nMartin also observes that *the suggested change in the law would not\navoid the disadvantage of having to submit to judicial determination ques-\ntions of fact very hard to discover by objective examination.\" It is probably\nunrealistic to expect to develop antitrust criteria capable of being adminis-\ntered by computers. However, it does not seem impossible so to state my\nproposed criterion that well over 50 per cent of the judges would agree on\nthe result of its application to any given set of facts. I am indebted to Mar-\ntin for a constructive suggestion in connection with this drafting job: that is,\nthat the criterion be rephrased to omit the offending \"would have substi-\ntuted,\" so that what would be required would be a showing that some (speci-\nfied) nonnegligible amount of dollar revenues of one participant is accounted\nfor by sales for which buyers could have substituted the other participants\nProduct, had it been offered at the lowest cost-covering price, without by\nthis substitution their suffering financial disadvantage as compared with the\nnext best remaining alternative, had the first participant's product been\nwithdrawn.\n\nIt is almost certain that other improvements can and should be made. The\ndevelopment of a generally acceptable formulation for this criterion could\nrepresent a very important advance in the clarification and effective enforce-\nment of antitrust policy, which are essential elements in the continuing\nsuccess of an economy of regulated private enterprise.\n\nLucit.E SurPPARD KEvEs*\n\n* The author is an economist who specializes in problems of economic regulation.

In Section IV some gen-\neral conclusions are presented.

The bill of goods is determined by a central authority, although in\nsome cases in terms of categories, of varying breadth, the specific com-\nposition of which is determined by individual enterprises.\n\n2.

The evaluation of well-\nbeing when tastes have changed has not been satisfactorily dealt with,\nand very little is known about the conditions of taste-change. In this\npaper I deal with those situations in which individual tastes do change,\nnot only as a result of changes in the autonomous cultural determi-\nnants of taste, but as a result of ordinary economic activity in which\nincome is gained and used in response to existing tastes.\n\nThe assumption that tastes are largely stable over time and between\npeople, is, it seems to me, unwarranted. Consider the following:\n\n1. Utterly implausible contrasts in the conditions of well-being are\nimplied by available real-income measures of welfare in the comparison\nof people of an industrial society with people of a pre-industrial so-\nciety. Even though such income comparisons are understood to imply\nno more than an ordinal standard, or a ranking of societies, it is not at\nall clear that the Balinese, for example, are so much worse off than the\naverage American that the average of all Europeans and most South\nAmericans can safely be fitted between them on a welfare scale. The\ncustomary disclaimer of taste comparability in making international\ncomparisons such as these fails to deal adequately with the difficulty.\nThe trouble is that the Balinese may be better off than many groups\nhigher on the real-income scale; this can very well be so even if ^well-\noffness\" is confined to economic welfare. For economic welfare is a\nmeasure of the degree to which given tastes are satisfied by means of\nScarce resources. I am not concerned here with spiritual qualities, but\nwith tastes which change in some kind of systematic way.\n\n2.

This article is such an examina-\ntion of the recently published quarterly econometric model of the economy of\nthe United Kindom, done by L. R. Klein and three co-workers.! This model\nrepresents a significant advance in at least two respects:\n\nFirst, it is the only major econometric model for the current economic\nstructure of the United Kingdom. An earlier investigation by Tinbergen of\nthis structure covered the period 1870-1914, and is thus essentially a statisti-\ncal essay in economic history [15]. A very small-scale and rudimentary model\nwas done by Radice before the Second World War [14]. In addition to being\nhighly simplified, it, too, has only little relevance to the current situation. In\nview of the substantial economic difficulties Britain bas faced during the post-\nwar era and is likely to continue to face, a detailed econometric model of the\nsort presented by KBHV is a most welcome addition to the stock of knowl-\nedge about the British economy.\n\nThe second respect in which the KBHV model represents a significant ad-\nvance is that it is a quarterly model. Indeed, it is the first substantively seri-\nous attempt to develop a quarterly econometric model for any economy.?\nEarlier attempts by Barger and Klein [1], by Clark [3] and by Gallaway and\nSmith [6] contain six, seven and four equations respectively. The Barger-\nKlein model is frankly experimental; the Clark model contains no monetary\nvariables and is highly aggregative so that its significance for policy decisions\nand forecasting is limited.

Nonmarketable Government Securities and Commercial Banks\n\nAfter first surveying the ineffectiveness of various other proposals for\ncontrolling commercial bank credit, Alhadeff suggests (p. 658) that, with\nthe exception of short-term securities to serve as liquidity reserves, only\nnonmarketable government securities be sold to banks, thereby preventing\nactivation of idle balances through bank sales of securities. Alhadeff seems\nunaware of the many pitfalls to such a proposal. First, he underestimates the\ndifficulties in implementation. Second, he ignores some undesirable reper-\ncussions, if the proposal could be implemented. Third, his emphasis on long-\nterm securities might be misplaced; for credit control purposes, movements\nin bank holdings of other maturities are of greater importance than his\nanalysis suggests. Each of these points will be discussed in turn.\n\nDifficulties in Implementation. Selling nonmarketable government securities\nto banks is likely to prove difficult and costly because bank portfolio prac-\ntices in general, and special tax considerations in particular, rely heavily on\nmarketability; With respect to bank portfolio practices, Alhadeff argues\n(p. 657) that nonmarketables would replace *. . . the potentially troublesome\ngovernment securities purchased with funds which are temporarily surplus\non the customer loan market and which are held for income purposes pend-\n\n!'CDhis would preserve for banks most of the advantages of government security hold.\nings . . . fully effective without compulsion on banks to hold government securities. . . .\nThe main disadvantage for individual banks would be the greater inflexibility in portfolio\nmanagement\" [1, p. 658].

A more reasonable explanation is that the period used to obtain X; for each corporation\nwas one in which the trend in share prices was upward. The shares that rose the most\nare those that would have small values for y. The shares that changed in price the most\n(rose in this period) probably also had the greatest fluctuations around their trend values\nin relation to their mean price over the period, i.e. the highest values for X;.\n\n* The author is associate professor of industrial management, School of Industrial Man-\nagement, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n", "of variability in past earnings to measure risk are widely accepted. It would\ntherefore seem likely that the lack of correlation reflects on Benishay's model\nand/or his measurement rules. X;, equity stability, is analogous to X, with\nequity value substituted for earnings. We would expect y and X; to be nega-\ntively correlated, but the data produced positive correlation. Benishay in-\nterpreted this result as evidence that investors have a preference for price\nfluctuations due to their speculative urge? X,, a corporate-size variable,\nshowed significant inverse correlation with y. This finding is the only signifi-\ncant correlation for which he could provide a plausible explanation.\n\nBenishay's last variable was the debt-equity ratio. X; proved to be inversely\ncorrelated with y, and in explaining this result Benishay provided another\nstrange piece of reasoning. He stated that the \"debt-equity ratio can be in-\nterpreted in two ways: (1) if it represents deviations from its equilibrium\nvalue, then it ought to be positively associated with the rate of return. (2) If\nit were to be measured at its equilibrium level it ought to be negatively cor-\nrelated with the rate of return, since then it becomes a measure of safety\" [1,\np. 92]. What does Benishay mean by equilibrium value? If his dependent\nvariable had been e, earnings before interest divided by equity plus debt,\nthen under Durand's [3] theory one could talk about an equilibrium leverage\nratio, the one that maximizes share price. Under the Modigliani-Miller theory\nthere is no such thing as an equilibrium value. However, Benishay's dependent\nvariable was y and not p and everyone including the writers just mentioned\nagree that a corporation's earnings yield increases with its leverage. His find-\ning of inverse correlation between y and leverage is contrary to generally\naccepted theory.\n\nBenishay's *measure of safety\" explanation for the correlation may be\nstated more clearly as follows. The other risk variables did a poor job of\naccounting for the variation in the leverage-free risk among corporations, and\nthe corrective variables did a poor job of accounting for g(r \u2014 y*). Since\nsecure profitable corporations are likely to borrow more than unstable un-\nprofitable ones, the correlation between y and X; is due to the variation among\ncorporations in stability and profitability and not the variation in leverage,\nother things the same. In short the results further demonstrate that the meas-\nurement of the other variables was unsatisfactory, and one cannot infer that\nan increase in leverage reduces the earnings yield at which a share will sell.\n\nSmoothing past earnings and using corrective variables are promising lines\nof attack in the analysis of variation in earnings yield among shares. How-\never, Benishay's choice of variables and his explanation of the findings were\nmost unfortunate.\n\nPOM Lon EMI\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "208\n"], "5": ["With r \u2014y* the earnings generated by investment will just cover the cost\nof the funds provided and leave the expected earnings on the existing capital\nunchanged. By contrast with r 7 y* a return of r will be earned on investment\nand a return of y* will be paid for the funds provided. The excess will accrue\nto the existing stockholders, and investors will expect the earnings on the\nexisting equity to increase over time. The price at which the stock will sell in\nrelation to current earnings will thereby be raised. In other words, with y*\nthe true yield, the observed yield will be y \u00ab: y*. Therefore, a corrective\nvariable Benishay should have used is q(r \u2014 y*) where q is the investment\nrate.\n\nIt may appear that the two corrective variables X, and X; have some simi-\nlarity with the variable just proposed. However, they differ in important re-\nspects from q(r \u2014 y*). As to X,, I have shown elsewhere [4] that the rate at\nwhich a corporations income grows is roughly equal to the product of its rate\nof profit on investment and b, its retention rate. Hence 7b \u2014 X;. Assume a\ncorporation with r \u2014 y* has been retaining and investing a large fraction of\nits income. X, will be large, but for this corporation no correction should\nbe made in y as a measure of y*. By contrast another corporation with r 2\u00bb y*\nmay have a low b and use other sources of funds to finance investment. For\nthis corporation y will seriously underestimate y*, and a large correction is\nneeded. However, X; will be lower than the value for the previous corpora-\ntion.? It is evident that X; is no better than X, as a corrector for error in the\nmeasured yield due to differences between a corporation's cost of capital and\nthe profitability of its investment opportunities.\n\nThe reason that Benishay offered for the statistically significant correlation\nbetween y and X, is most unimpressive. Inverse correlation between y (earn-\nings divided by price) and rate of growth in price is almost inevitable, and it\ncould arise for a number of reasons, among which a recent re-evaluation of\nexpected income is only one. For instance, assume that confidence in expected\nearnings has recently changed in varying amounts for the corporations in the\nsample. For corporations in which there was a rise in confidence the share\nprice would rise and DotA measured and true yield would decline. The result\nwould be inverse correlation between y and X;, but under this cause for the\ncorrelation there would be no error in y as an estimate of y* for a corporation.\nIn contrast, Benishay would have someone interested in the value of y* for a\ncorporation use X; to correct the measured yield.\n\nBenishay's model contained four risk variables, and all but the last can\nbe dealt with quite briefly. X,, income stability, is the mean of earnings for\nthe nine years divided by the standard deviation of earnings around its\ntrend. There was no correlation between y and X,. Aversion to risk and the use\n\nby its leverage rate. Note that we are here accepting the assumptions of the Modigliani-\nMiller theory under which Q* is a corporation's cost of capital. Also, by assuming no\nleverage we may continue to refer to y* as the cost of capital.\n\n* The absence of correlation between y and X; that Benishay found may possibly be\nexplained as follows: There is positive correlation between y and b, and there probably\nalso is an inverse correlation between y and r. The result will be no correlation between\ny and rb, and rb \u2014 Xi.\n", "207\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "4": ["expected income, the rate of return is 'too high' and the pay-out ratio 'too\nlow.' This will introduce into the relationship a negative spurious correlation\"\n[1, pp. 83-84]. The Modigliani-Miller [7, pp. 666-68] statement of what I\n(and also Benishay) believe is the same position is that corporations pay a\nstable fraction of expected income in dividends. Actual income fluctuates con-\nsiderably and is a poor estimate of expected income, so that correlation of\nstock price with dividends is due to the informational content of dividends\"\nwith respect to expected income.\n\nThis interpretation by Benishay of the correlation he found between earn-\nings yield and pay-out rate is, to put it mildly, not convincing. He took great\npains to deal with the problem of earnings measurement without reference to\nthe dividend rate. Recall, y is based not on current earnings but on a weighted\naverage of earnings, and two corrective variables other than the pay-out rate\nare used to further correct for the difference between actual and expected\nearnings. Yet Benishay still found it necessary to introduce the pay-out rate.*\n\nReturning to the other corrective variables, X; and X;, closer examination\nreveals that even within the framework of his theoretical preconceptions Beni-\nshay's model is a seriously defective instrument for realizing his objective\u2014\nexplaining the variation in yield among common stocks. Assume a sample of\ncorporations with the following attributes: (1) All corporations have no debt\nand have the same leverage-free riskiness. This eliminates the need for the\nrisk variables. (2) The Modigliani-Miller theorem that the earnings yield is\nindependent of the pay-out rate holds true. This eliminates the need for X;.\n(3) Finally, the amount each corporation is expected to earn on its existing\ncapital can be observed free of error. This eliminates the need for X; and X;.\nUnder these assumptions y*, the true yield, is the same for all corporations\nin the sample. According to Benishay, the measured yield, y, should also be\nthe same for all corporations. In fact, with y* the same, y would vary among\nthe corporations in the sample. As Bodenhorn [2] has shown and Modigliani\nand Miller [7, pp. 662-63] recognized independently, all corporations will\nhave the same y only if each has a rate of return on new investment, r, that is\nequal to y*.*\n\n* When Modigliani and Miller advanced the informational content explanation of correla-\ntion with the pay-out rate, what they seemed to have in mind were situations where cur-\nrent income alone was used in the model. One wonders at the implications of the argu-\nment when it is used without proper caution. For instance, one might imagine a financial\nanalyst would respond as follows when called upon to advise a corporation that is con-\nsidering a reduction in the dividend to finance investment: \"You need have no fear a\nreduction in the dividend will depress the price of your stock. What you must keep in\nmind, however, is that investors believe you pay a stable fraction of expected income\nin dividends. Therefore, the informational content of the dividend reduction will lead in-\nvestors to believe your expected income will decline. Of course the price of your stock will\nfall but this will be due not to the dividend reduction but to its informational content.\"\n\n\"A corporation will have y \u2014 y* if r \u2014 y*, because it has no leverage. The more\ngeneral condition is that r \u2014 Q*, where Q* is a firm's true cost of capital. (Since measured\nand true earnings yield may differ, o and o* may differ.) With zero leverage y* \u2014 o*.\nWith leverage varying y* will vary among the corporations in the sample, but Q* will not.\nThe value of y* for each is y* \u2014 o* -- h(og* \u2014 i).

The introduction of corrective variables is the main contribution of\nthe paper, and they will be our primary concern.\n\nSince a corporation's earnings are subject to wide year-to-year fluctuations,\nthe earnings in any one year may not represent what investors believe the\ncorporation is able to earn. For this reason Benishay uses as his dependent\nvariable, y, a weighted average of the corporation's earnings for the nine years\nup to and including the cross-section year* divided by the market value of the\nequity outstanding in the cross-section year. His first corrective variable X, is\nthe rate of growth in earnings over the nine-year period up to and including\nthe cross-section year. It is included because the averaging process for obtain-\ning y biases its value downward for a corporation with a trend rate of growth\nin earnings. The second corrective variable, X; is the rate of growth in the\nmarket value of the common equity over the nine years. If expected earnings\nhave been recently re-evaluated, the measured yield will be in error as an\nestimate of the true yield. X; is introduced on the grounds that the re-evalua-\ntion of expected earnings will be correlated with the rate of growth in the\nvalue of the stock. Hence, X; is a means of discovering error in the measured\nyield. Benishay found no correlation between y and X. There was statistically\nsignificant correlation with X;, but his rationale for this finding is open to\nquestion.\n\nThe third corrective variable, X;, is the log of the average dividend pay-out\nrate for the three years up to and including the cross-section year. There was\nstatistically significant inverse correlation betwen y and X;, and I judge that\nX; contributed most to explaining the variation in y among the corporations.\nInverse correlation between earnings yield and dividend pay-out rate is usually\ninterpreted as evidence against the Modigliani-Miller theory.

However, this\nwould not cause inverse correlation between payout rate and earnings yield. If anything, the\ncomparatively favorable tax treatment accorded capital gains and the likelihood that cor-\nporations with high rates of return on investment have lower pay-out rates would lead one\nto expect positive correlation between pay-out rate and earnings yield.\n", "205\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "2": ["porations are very much concerned with financial policy\u2014debt-equity ratio,\ndividend rate, etc. Their observations have persuaded many of them that the\nconclusions arrived at by means of neoclassical theory for a world of cer-\ntainty are not valid when it is recognized that the future is uncertain and in-\nvestors may have an aversion to risk.\n\nThe purpose of a recent paper by Modigliani and Miller [6] was to bridge\nthe gulf between the capital theorists and the financial analysts. Their argu-\nment may be summarized as follows: Under uncertainty a corporation's cost\nof capital is not the rate of interest, but the corporation's earnings plus inter-\nest paid divided by the market value of its securities (equity plus debt). The\ncost of capital may vary among corporations in accordance with differences in\ntheir intrinsic riskiness. However, the method of finance remains of no conse-\nquence: \u00c0 corporation maximizes its value by undertaking every investment\nwith a rate of profit in excess of its cost of capital as defined above, inde-\npendently of the method of finance employed. In particular, dividend and\nleverage policy have no influence on the value of a corporation.\n\nAlthough Benishay did not explicitly address himself to the Modigliani-\nMiller paper, the question he tackled may be stated as follows: Does the\nexplanation of the considerable variation in earnings yield (earnings-price\nratio) among corporations support the Modigliani-Miller theory?? Benishay\nclassified his independent variables as \"corrective\" and \"risk\" variables. Risk\nvariables were included because a corporation's earnings yield may be expected\nto vary with leverage, earnings instability, and other risk attributes of a\nshare. The corrective variables have the following rationale: If a share has a\nprice of $50 and current earnings of $10, the measured yield on the share is\n.20. The /rue yield on the share is also .20 if the expected earnings in each\nfuture period are also $10.? However, if the expected earnings are only $5\nper period, the true yield is only .10, although the measured yield is .20. The\ndependent variable can only be a measured yield, and the purpose of the cor-\n\nof its value (ie, the value of the existing ownership equity). In this event the cost of\ncapital is a rate of return such that any investment with a higher rate raises the value of\nthe firm and vice versa. It is evident that under neoclassical theory a firm takes the rate\nof interest as its cost of capital.\n\n? There is no difficulty in the fact that the Modigliani-Miller ratio includes interest in\nthe numerator and debt in the denominator, what might be called the gross or leverage\n\u00cdree earnings yield. Under their theory a simple linear relation holds between their ratio\nand the earnings-price ratio. Let y \u2014 earnings-price ratio, o \u2014 ratio of earnings plus interest\nto equity plus debt, h \u2014 leverage ratio, and i\u2014 rate of interest. Under the celebrated\nModigliani-Miller theorem Q is independent of 7, and\n\ny\u2014o-h(o\u2014i)\nHence, y varies with A and it varies in the same maner as Q with every other variable.\nIt is also true that, under their theory, a corporation's cost of capital is equal to o. That\nis, a corporation increases the market value of the existing ownership equity by under-\ntaking every investment with a rate of return greater than its value for Q, regardless of the\nmethod of finance employed.\n\n* By true yield I mean the rate of discount that equates the future earnings stockholders\nexpect with the price of a share. Benishay refers to this quantity as \"the theoretical\nconcept of a rate of return on equity capital\" [1, p. 81].\n", "204\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "1": ["Variability in Earnings-Price Ratios: Comment\n\nThe analysis of earnings-price ratios by Haskel Benishay [1] in a recent\nissue of this Review is of interest in so far as it provides information on the\nvariation in the cost of capital among corporations. The concept of the cost\nof capital has been the subject of considerable theoretical controversy, and\nthere is a great need for empirical research to improve the factual basis of\nour knowledge on the subject. It is therefore most unfortunate that the errors\ncommitted by Benishay both in formulating his model and in interpreting his\nfindings are so numerous and serious that his results probably do more to\nconfuse than clarify the issues.\n\nIt will be useful to begin with a brief statement of the theoretical back-\nground for the paper.
