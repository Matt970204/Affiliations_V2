In such an economy, interest\nrates are determined by consumption loans between individuals of\ndifferent ages. By introducing production employing a durable capital\ngood into this model, one can examine the case where individuals pro-\nvide for their retirement years by lending to entrepreneurs. After de-\nscribing alternative long-run equilibria available to a centrally planned\neconomy, the competitive solution is described.

If we take a wife to be by definition someone who\nunderstands basic sentences but finds theoretical sentences incomprehensible,\nwe can restate Samuelson's Razor in linguistic jargon as follows: any sen-\ntence that cannot be reduced, without loss of meaning, to basic sentences\nshould be rejected. The upshot of Samuelson's Razor is, as Machlup has\nclearly perceived [6, p. 733], the complete eschewal of theory, for theoretical\nsentences are precisely those sentences that are not adequately translatable\ninto basic sentences. To what basic sentences, for example, could one reduce\nDalton's postulate that matter is composed of indivisible atoms? But let us\nnot be duped; not all our maxims need rest on sad experience.

If, e.g., there is\nany methodological moral to be drawn from the century-and-a-half-long\nsuccessful life of the atomic theory of matter, it would seem to be that an em-\npirical science comes to maturity only after it effects a clean break with basic\nsentences, only after it boldly postulates theoretical statements that ultimate-\nly are anchored, though not submerged, in experience by means of semantic\nties to basic sentences. Thus I myself would proclaim the contrary of Samuel-\nson's Razor, viz. all economic theories that can be explained to your wife are\ntheoretically worthless. Or, in linguistic terms, when theorizing, aim for pos-\ntulate-sets that cannot be reduced without loss of meaning to basic sentences.\nAnd furthermore, if one classifies as *unreal\" all sentences that are not basic,\nI would urge that, when theorizing, one be satisfied with nothing short of un-\nreality.\n", "1163\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "8": ["than the tip of your thumb. The rigid belief that acceptance of a sentence\ncommits one to the existence of objects which serve as referents for its denot-\ning expressions and which have the properties designated by its general terms\nis Ryle's *Fido\"-Fido fallacy, i.e. the fallacious inference from the sound em-\nployment of a name to an object which it denotes. Applied to basic sentences,\na *Fido\"-Fido principle of meaning is perhaps unobjectionable. It supplies, in\nfact, the rationale for our analysis that \"Fido has 4 legs\" is true if and only\nif Fido has 4 legs. Philosophical mischief begins only when the principle is\nextended to theoretical sentences. If we were to christen as \"naive realism\"\nthe view that the *Fido\"-Fido principle applies with equal force to all sen-\ntences, the thesis here outlined which restricts that principle to basic sen-\ntences might well be called \"critical unrealism.\" At the cost of being dubbed\nan unrealist, let me assert unconditionally that theoretical sentences are in-\nherently unreal in the sense that experience is germane to their acceptance\nonly in the indirect and devious way described above.\n\nFriedman, I believe, holds the same opinion about theoretical sentences,\nbut he expresses it in a somewhat misleading way. He rightly assails those\nwho, like Samuelson, would make the \"realism\" of a postulate set a separate\nand distinct test of its acceptability, separate and distinct, that is, from its\npredictive, retrodictive, and explanatory adequacy. But excess of righteous\nindignation prompts Friedman to laud postulate sets which are *descriptively\nfalse in (their) assumptions\" [2, p. 14]. Now the most significant feature of\ntheoretical sentences like Dalton's postulates is that they are neither descrip-\ntively true nor descriptively false. Those adjectives are properly applied only\nto basic sentences, ie. to sentences behind the denoting phrases of which\nstand bona fide referents. Indeed, if, as we shall see in a moment, Samuelson's\nmortal sin is to reject all theoretical sentences, Friedman's venial sin is to\nliken them much too closely to basic sentences. Friedman's overly Baconian\nmodel of theory formation leads him to assimilate theoretical sentences to\nbasic sentences, for he regards theory-formation as fundamentally an abstrac-\ntive operation. He conceives it much too narrowly as the practice of devising\n\"theoretical generalizations to fit as full and comprehensive a set of related\nfacts about the real world as it is possible to get\" [2, p. 300]. Or, as he suc-\ncinctly puts it, ^A hypothesis is important if it explains! much by little, that\nis, if it abstracts the common and crucial elements from the mass of complex\nand detailed circumstances surrounding the phenomena to be explained\" [2,\np. 14]. But surely the end-product of such an abstractive process of generali-\nzation would be basic sentences. Only by injecting the misleading thesis that\nthe basic sentences so abstracted are \"*descriptively false in their assumptions\"\ncan Friedman pretend to segregate them from the other basic sentences.\n\nThus, while we can concur with Samuelson's vehement denunciation of\nFriedman's \"unreal hypotheses\" [10, pp. 736-39], ie., descriptively false\npostulates, we must reject Samuelson's reasons for denouncing them. Samuel-\nson censures Friedman, not for likening theoretical sentences too closely to\nbasic sentences, but for positing any difference at all between them. *A life-\ntime of sad experience,\" says Samuelson, constrains him to advance the meth-\n", "1162\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "7": ["ized the basic sentences, as tieoretical sentences. Our present problem, then, is\nto clarify the manner in which experience is germane to the acceptance (as\ntrue) or the rejection (as false) of theoretical sentences of the likes of our ex-\nemplar This volume of gas contains 4.5 7X 107? molecules.\" A brief biography\nof the theory in which this particular theoretical sentence is embedded may\nperhaps shed some light on the problem.\n\nAbout 1808 Dalton proposed his atomic theory of matter of which the fol-\nowing were some of the leading postulates:!\n\n(1) Matter consists of indivisible atoms.\n\n(2) The atoms of a given chemical element have identical properties.\n\n(3) The atoms of different elements differ in weight and in other charac-\nteristics.\n\n(4) Atoms are indestructible.\n\n(5) Chemical reactions are simply rearrangements of atoms.\n\n(6) A compound substance consists of *compound atoms\" each of which\ncontains a small but definite number of atoms.\n\nOn the basis of these and other similar postulates Dalton was able to explain\na large number of well-known chemical facts. Inter alia, he explained the ex-\nistence of distinct chemical elements, Boyle's law, Proust's law of definite\nproportions, and the conservation of mass in chemical reactions. All these\n\"facts\" were accounted for by Dalton's theory in the sense that they were\nlogically and mathematically deducible from it, although some of the deriva-\ntions depended on such mediating assumptions as that a gas is composed of a\nlarge number of rapidly moving but extremely small atoms. Further\nconfirmation for Dalton's theory came indirectly from the study of the behav-\nlor of gases to explain certain aspects of which Avogadro postulated (1811)\nthat equal volumes of different gases contain the same number of basic\nparticles. By identifying these particles (molecules) with clusters of Daltonian\natoms, Avogadro made it possible to derive, by dint of rather complicated in-\nferences, such properties of atoms as their size, weight, and even their num-\nber. In particular, Avogadro was able to infer that one cc. of gas contains about\n4.5 X 107? molecules. Now clearly the evidence on which Avogadro accepted\nthe sentence \"One cc. of a gas contains about 4.5 XX 10!? molecules\" bears no\ndirect semantical relation to it. It consists, firstly, in all the true basic sen-\ntences derivable (in many instances inductively) from the atomic-molecular\ntheory and in the negative fact that no basic sentences so derivable were\nfound to be false. There is, secondly, the logico-mathematical fact that the\ntheoretical sentence in question is deducible from that theory, together with\ncertain basic sentences accepted as true. Given the way this theoretical sen-\ntence is related to the evidence for it, it appears that to say that this sentence\nis \"true\" is tantamount to claiming that there exists such evidence for it. To\nregard it thus as true does not entail that one believes that there really are\ntiny little particles 4.5 X 10? of which are crammed into a space no larger\n\n''This account of Dalton's postulates and the atomic theory of matter is taken sub-\nstantially from A.

This very fallacy, I will argue,\nlies at the heart of Samuelson's castigation of \"unrealistic hypotheses\" and\ncauses him, in Machlup's words, *'to reject all t/teory\" [6, p. 733]. Consider\nthe sentence *Fido has 4 legs.\" Now the services of a trained semanticist are\nhardly required to discover that that sentence is true if and only if Fido does\nindeed have 4 legs. Any English speaker who knows what the referent of the\nname \"Fido\" is knows how to verify whether or not that sentence is true. The\nsemantical rules implicit in English usage link the truth-value of that sen-\ntence to very elementary observations in a perfectly straightforward way.\nJust to have a name for them, let us call basic sentences those sentences of\nEnglish to whose truth-values experience is germane in the same direct and\nimmediate way as it is to our paradigm \"Fido has 4 legs.\"\n\nLet us now consider another sentence which superficially resembles our\nparadigm, viz, the sentence This volume of gas (1 cc.) contains 4.5 7X 101?\nmolecules.\" Puffed up by our success in analyzing the first sentence, we might\nrepeat our previous analysis and pronounce, with appropriate gravity, that\nthe second sentence is true if and only if this volume of gas really does con-\ntain 4.5 X 10!? molecules. But will an English speaker, supplied with our anal-\nysis, know how to set about ascertaining whether it is true or false? Of course\nnot, unless he is a trained scientist, for the semantical rules of English do not\nbind this sentence directly to experience. This sentence, therefore, does not\nbelong to the class of basic sentences. Although its ties to experience are nei-\nther direct nor immediate, unless this sentence has some rapport with experi-\nence, unless experience is somehow germane to its truth-value, it has no fac-\ntual significance at all. For surely sentences with no experimental ties what-\nsoever must be judged empirically meaningless.

And with respect to the degree to which they systematize obser-\nvational sentences so as to make prediction, retrodiction, and explanation\npossible (the tripartite aim of positive empirical science), uninterpreted cal-\nculi and analytical mathematical systems are quite on a par. The degree in\neither case is zero. Perhaps the utter futility of both for purposes of predic-\ntion, retrodiction, and explanation prompted Friedman to warn of economics\ndegenerating into *disguised mathematics\" when he evidently meant to warn\nof it becoming an uninterpreted calculus.\n", "1160\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "5": ["consistent, but on its adversaries to present evidence of inconsistency. Consid-\ner, e.g., the economic theory of demand. Does the fact that no one has dem-\nonstrated its consistency render it highly suspect of this logical felony? The\nanswer, I believe, is *No.\" But how should one appraise this same theory were,\non some future date, he presented with conclusive evidence that the theory is\ninconsistent? He would have to declare the theory quite unacceptable and ei-\nther abandon it altogether or, what is more likely, modify it in such a way as\nto block the known ways of deriving contradictions within it.\n\nI come now to the third and last component of a scientific theory to which\nI wish to direct attention, viz. its semantical rules or, as they are sometimes\ncalled, rules of interpretation. 'These rules confer meaning, either partial or\nfull, on the postulates and theorems of a scientific theory. Without interpreta-\ntive rules, a theory would reduce to an uninterpreted calculus which points to\nnothing beyond itself. It would be as empirically irrelevant as the game of\nchess. Friedman makes this same point somewhat cryptically as follows:\n\"Viewed as a language, theory has no substantive content; it is a set of tau-\ntologies\" [2, p. 7]. Now the prime function of interpretative rules is to rend-\ner fact germane to theory. 'They stipulate, in terms of facts, partial or full\ntruth conditions for the sentences of the theory, i.e., for all sentences that can\nbe written in the notation of the theory. Put metaphorically, they legislate the\nofficial rates for converting theoretical paper money into factual coin. In\nvirtue of the semantical anchorage effected by interpretative rules, the accep-\ntance and rejection of the sentences of a theory become functions of observa-\ntion and experimentation.\n\n\"Though absolutely essential to a scientific theory, interpretative rules are\nseldom enunciated in a forthright manner. More often than not they are ne-\nglected altogether, with the result that someone who wishes to understand the\ntheoretical assertions of a science must glean, to whatever extent he can, what\nthe interpretative rules are by observing the practice and behavior of profes-\nsionals, i.e., he is forced to learn these interpretative rules in much the same\nway that a carpenter's apprentice learns the rules of woodworking and con-\nstruction. No doubt much of the polemics in the social sciences over the ac-\nceptability of certain theories can be traced to the failure to make these inter-\npretative rules explicit. For, to the degree that these rules are made definite\nand explicit, the testing of a scientific theory becomes a matter of intersubjec-\ntively ascertainable fact.\n\nWhat are the prospects in economics for eliminating the ills which stem\nfrom the failure to give theory a solid semantical anchorage in the bedrock of\nfact through precise and explicit semantical rules? In Friedman's opinion, not\nvery good! According to Friedman, \"One effect of the difficulty of testing\nsubstantive economic hypotheses has been to foster a retreat into purely for-\nmal or tautological analysis\" [2, p. 11]. Accordingly, Friedman even foresees\nthe contingency of economics degenerating into *disguised mathematics\" [2,\np. 11] and of substantive economic theory being reduced to a barren \"struc-\nture of tautologies\" [2, p. 11]. If Friedman's point is to be grasped, his\nwords must not be taken too literally. For obviously there is no present dan-\nger of economics developing into a branch of mathematics in the sense that\n", "1159\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "4": ["and does so alike for all users\u2014they play the same role here as checks\nfor arithmetical accuracy do in statistical computations [2, p. 10].\n\nHere as elsewhere Friedman uses the word *^hypothesis\" as a synonym for\n\"theory.\" Such usage is evident in the passage just cited, since completeness\nis an attribute of systems of propositions (hypotheses) and not of isolated\npropositions. Thus, when we bear in mind his idiosyncratic use of *hypothe-\nsis,\" Friedman seems to be saying that a theory is complete if it says what\nit is intended to say.\" Let me clarify somewhat Friedman's notion of com-\npleteness which agrees tolerably well with the customary logical one. Let O;\nbe a class of sentences that one intends or wishes to be the theorems of some\ntheory T. One might call O; the intended output of T. Let the actual output\nof T, viz. the set of sentences which really are its theorems, be O,. Now\nshould O; \u2014 O,, T will be said to be complete with respect to O;. In a sys-\ntem of economics, one might wish to have as theorems all true (or perhaps\nall highly confirmed) sentences that can be written in the notation of that\ntheory. Nothing is more easily done if one doesn't mind having false sen-\ntences also included in the actual output of the system. [It is very easy to\nattain truth (just assert everything), as easy in fact as it is to avoid error\n(assert nothing). What is difficult is not the separate pursuits of these two\ngoals but their joint prosecution.] But if the economic theory includes the\nconcepts of elementary arithmetic, we know from G\u00f3del's work [3, pp. 173-\n98] that it cannot be both consistent and complete with respect to the class\nof true sentences inscribable in the notation of the theory. The ideal of a\n(consistent) economic theory which embraces all the truths of economics\nis unattainable. Economists must perforce rest content with economic theo-\nries that are complete with respect to classes of sentences substantially short\nof the class of all true ones.\n\nAlthough Friedman's concept of completeness approximates the usual logi-\ncal one, his notion of consistency is quite unorthodox. We saw above that for\nFriedman a theory is consistent if what it says is \"alike for all users.\" He\nthus seems to confuse consistency with uwmivocity which characterizes, not\ntheories, but single hypotheses. When a logician describes a theory as cozsis-\ntent, he means ordinarily that no sentence and its negation are both theorems\nof the system. This notion of consistency has obviously nothing to do with\nunivocity, which signifies mere absence of ambiguity. Far from playing the\n\"subsidiary role\" in theory evaluation that Friedman consigns to consistency\n(i.e. univocity), logical consistency is an unqualifiedly necessary trait, the\nmost basic one even, to be demanded of any satisfactory scientific theory.\nAnd one need not look very far to discover the reason why. For, if a theory is\ninconsistent, every sentence of it is a theorem. What Friedman can lightly\ndismiss as relatively unimportant in theory evaluation, then, is not consisten-\ncy but univocity.\n\nThe importance of consistency is equalled only by the difficulty of estab-\nlishing it. So difficult is it to establish consistency that, like legal innocence in\na free society, a scientific theory is presumed consistent until proved other-\nwise. The burden of proof falls, not on the advocates of a theory to prove it\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "1158\n"], "3": ["orem in another, might be called the relativity of systematization or the rela-\ntivity of postulation. Now one of the issues of the methodological hassle men-\ntioned above is the status of the assumptions\" of positive economics, i.e., the\nstatus of its postulates. Specifically, it is contested whether they should be\n\"realistic\" or \"unrealistic.\" In the light of the relativity of postulation, we\nshould expect this issue to be as relevant to the derived propositions of posi-\ntive economics as to its postulates or assumptions. But allow me to defer ex-\namination of this issue for a few moments.\n\nTo derive theorems from a set of postulates, rules, known as rules of infer-\nence, are needed. A t/ieorem is simply a sentence which is the last member of\na proof, where a proof is defined as a finite sequence of sentences each of\nwhich is either a postulate or is inferrable from earlier sentences in the se-\nquence by means of the rules of inference. Since theorems are sentences for\nwhich there exist proofs, it may appear somewhat paradoxical that theorems\nare rarely proved. Instead of a proof, what is usually proffered are considera-\ntions designed to convince a reasonable and well-informed individual that\nthere exists a proof of the alleged theorem. Furthermore, the rules of infer-\nence of a scientific theory are almost never made very explicit. At best they\nare indicated by such loose phrases as \"the rules of mathematics and formal\nlogic.\" Now formal logic licenses the inference from a sentence A to a sentence\nB whenever the conditional sentence \"If A, then B\" is a truth of logic. It is\nimperative to notice that neither A nor B need themselves be logical truths.\nE.g., logic authorizes the inference from A, Everyone acts so as to maximize\nhis utility,\" to B, *Milton Friedman acts so as to maximize his utility,\" be-\ncause the conditional *If everyone acts so as to maximize his utility, then\nMilton Friedman acts so as to maximize his utility\" is a truth of elementary\nlogic. Thus we see that\n\nLogic has its practical use in inference from premises which are not\nlogical truths to conclusions which are not logical truths . . . and it is\nin this way that logical truth links up with extralogical concerns. Pre-\ncisely the analogous account holds with regard to applications of mathe-\nmatics generally; the tremendous utility of mathematical techniques in\nnatural science turns simply on the importance of discerning mathe-\nmatical truths of the form *If .. ., then . . .\" whose component parts\nare statements of natural science [7, p. 7].\n\nE.g. mathematics countenances the inference from Galileo's law, \"s \u2014 V4\n\u00a3/?,\" to the conclusion *ds/dt \u2014 gt,\" since the conditional *If s \u2014 Y gt?,\nthen ds/dt \u2014 gt\" is a mathematical truth.\n\nThe use to which logic is put by scientific theories is naturally something\nquite apart from the logical properties of such theories, chief among which\nare consistency and completeness. When discussing criteria for choosing\namong several alternative hypotheses, each of which accounts for all known\nfacts, Friedman asserts that\n\nLogical completeness and consistency are relevant but play a subsidiary\nrole [subsidiary, ie., to matters of simplicity and fruitfulness]; their\nfunction is to assume that the hypothesis says what it is intended to say\n", "1157\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "2": ["I.\n\nLet me begin by recalling J. N. Keynes's distinction, lately reaffirmed by\nFriedman, between positive science and normative science. Keynes character-\nized positive science as *a body of systematized knowledge concerning what\nis\" [5, p. 34], and he portrayed normative science as \"a body of systematized\nknowledge discussing criteria of what ought to be\" [5, p. 34]. It is only the\nformer, viz. positive science, that I wish now to discuss.\n\nIn a positive science, one can identify certain structural components. There\nare, first of all, the postulates. The postulates of a science\u2014they are some-\ntimes called assumptions or primitive propositions\u2014constitute its systematic\ncore. From them, by way of logical and mathematical implications, flow all\nthe remaining propositions of the science which are called its \u00a3eorems or de-\nrived propositions. 'Thus all the propositions of a science are compressed, so\nto speak, into its postulates, which are usually relatively simple and few in\nnumber. By another name this logical compression of the theorems into a\nhandful of simple postulates is known as systematization. AY of us are famil-\njar with the postulates of at least one highly systematic empirical science, viz.\nEuclidean geometry. (I am of course construing Euclidean geometry, not as a\nformal theory of abstract objects called points, lines, planes, etc., but rather\nas a factual or empirical theory of mensuration.) By Euclidean geometry let\nus understand the set of theorems of Hilbert's celebrated axiomatization\nthereof [4]. When Euclidean geometry is so understood, it is largely fortui-\ntous that a particular proposition is a postulate of some given formulation\nthereof. The reason, obviously, is that there are many, in fact infinitely many,\npostulate sets for Euclidean geometry, many of which bear little or no resem-\nblance to the particular set of postulates advanced by Euclid himself. (Eu-\nclid's axioms, by the way, are formally deficient.) This logical fact, viz. that\nwhat is a postulate in one systematization of a science may be a derived the-\n", "The foregoing remarks are by way of apology. For whenever, as I am\nabout to do, a noneconomist publicly enters an on-going hassle among leading\neconomists like M. Friedman, P. Samuelson, and F.

Now if the dispute were wholly within\neconomics, my credentials, which are philosophical, would be unacceptable.\nBut in fact the issues which these distinguished economists are debating bear\nupon the nature of positive science in general and on the nature of positive\neconomics in particular. They concern, among other things, the semantic rela-\ntion of experience to theory and the place of mathematics and formal logic in\nthe structure of empirical science. They are, in short, issues which lie at the\nboundary of economics, issues which happen to be the stock-in-trade of the\nphilosopher of science.\n\nHaving given my excuse, let me now make my proposal. I propose to do\ntwo things: (1) to present a semantical analysis of scientific theories, which I\nhope economists will find informative; and (2) to extract from this analysis\ncertain methodological maxims or morals which I hope economists will find\nuseful.

Further, our distribution estimates relate to the distribution\nof personal income as estimated by the CSO.\n\nSwamy finds that our estimates of the shares of ordinal groups in the *'all-\nIndia distribution do not appear to be consistent with the estimates of the\nrural and urban shares.\" This statement again shows that he has not careful-\nly studied our earlier article [4]. Since the all-India distribution is derived by\naggregating the rural and urban distributions, the question of inconsistency\nsimply does not arise. Swamy finds this inconsistency on the basis of his facts\nand assumptions, and not on the basis of our estimates. For example, his esti-\nmate of the share of the top 5 per cent in the national distribution is based on\nthe assumption that 24 per cent of the households, accounting for 50 per cent\nof income, reside in the urban sector. Our estimates show that 20.8 per cent\nof the households, accounting for 28.6 per cent of income, reside in the urban\nsector [4, Table III]. If Swamy makes a recalculation on the basis of our\nestimates, he will find that his charge is ill-founded. Again, his estimate of\nintersectoral inequality is based on his facts and assumptions. The urban\nhouseholds are assumed to represent 24 per cent of total households, while\nour estimate for the share of urban households in the total is 20.8 per cent.\nFurther, as pointed out earlier, since we have derived the national distribution\nby aggregating the rural and urban distributions, an estimate of intersectoral\ninequality is based on facts, while his estimate is based on his assumption\n", "Income with Special Reference to Asia,\" Rev.

We have accordingly\nregarded aggregate output (as measured by JN) as the variable to be pre-\ndicted, and Y4 (not N) as the income total inducing C, the major part of the\ninduced component of output. The reader can verify that the resulting\nmodel corresponds to the one given by FM under the heading ''A Slightly\nMore Complex Model\" [3, Sec. III.B], by noting the following identities\nrelating their symbols to ours:\n\nUzCcTZizmC Y'zyst A1mZ- LXX;\nAe \u2014 Qe X9;\nA-Z; Y-UXTAsS(CM-Z)4Z iN.\n\nThe induced part of the income total to be predicted (Y z N) is thus C-4-Z:\nwhich is our C/, and not C/\u2014 X^, as FM maintain in their reply [3, Sec.\nIV.C]. X\u00bb, like M, is not a part of the income total to be predicted.\nFurthermore, it is apparent that in our formulation both 4; and 4; are\npartly induced and partly autonomous. Hence, as FM correctly hint in\ntheir discussion of their more complex model, the solution for the induced\ncomponent (U 2C) is a linear function of Z* and X^ (and not of Ze-- X,*\nexcept under a set of very special assumptions, as we spelled out in our\npaper).!\n\nAs for the issue of which variables should be treated as autonomous, we\n\n!

This is especially so with\nrespect to the question of whether or not the tests must predict all of the\nendogenous part of income. We admitted that it would be useful to test the\nrelative performance of money and \"A\" in predicting inventory, imports,\nand so on. But each of these are separate reduced-form equations. What\nFM wish to do really adds together all the reduced-form equations for the\ninduced components of income. Why do this?\n\nIf the basic purpose of the research had been to predict income, then\nneither our approach nor the FM model would have been adequate. A user\nof FM's model first has to determine government expenditures and taxes,\nexports and imports, private domestic investment, and so on. He then finds\nconsumption as the induced variable. To use our model he does not need\nto know imports, taxes, or inventory to find consumption. However, he\nstill has to find them (by separate equations) to determine total income.\nFM overlook all this because they apparently forget that the government\ndeficit is the result of two variables: government expenditures and taxation,\nand that net exports are also the result of two variables. An excellent\nexample of this confusion is their claim that they are able to predict total\nincome using a smaller proportion of income than we do. This is illustrated\nin their Table 3. It is, of course, an illusion.!\n\nOur basic difference with FM can be summarized in their accusation at\nthe end of their second paragraph, *DM, after running basic tests. . . on\n20 different, but not unreasonable, definitions of autonomous expenditures?\nsettle on two but carry two others along for the ride.\" The point is that we\n\"settled\" on our two definitions before, not after, running the tests. Rather\nthan letting the correlation coefficients determine the definitions, we settled\non our formulations from the start. They were not the ones with the highest\ncorrelation, as Appendix Table A shows.\n\nIronically, the grounds for our a priori determination of autonomous ex-\npenditures are not crucial.

Two of their components\u2014imports and taxes\u2014are negative items in their autonomous\nterm. Actually, they must have a knowledge of a greater dollar amount of the various com-\nponents, but the sum is smaller because they subtract taxes from government expenditures\nand imports from exports.

Estimates\nbased on cohort analyses produce quite different results. Census data show\nthat the differences in real income for a given age cohort in two successive\ndecennial censuses (e.g., men 25 to 34 years old in 1950 and 35 to 44 years\nold in 1960) are far greater than those obtained for men in the same age\ngroups at a given point in time. The main reason for the difference is that the\nincome measures obtained ten years apart reflect economic growth which is\nentirely excluded from the cross-section surveys. The use of income averages\nby age based on the cross-section surveys therefore produces lower values\nthan would be obtained by the use of averages based on successive censuses.\nMoreover, the impact of growth appears to be greater for young men than for\nthose past the prime working years. 'This fact suggests an additional source of\ndownward bias in the currently available estimates, since the discounting pro-\ncedures used to convert estimated lifetime income to present values attach\ngreater weight to incomes expected early in life than to those expected later\non.\n\nThese conclusions are, of course, subject to the limitation that they are\nbased on only two points in time.

According to this view technological progress is neutral if it leaves the\ncapital-output ratio unaltered at a given rate of profit. In principle this differs\nfrom the concept of neutrality offered by Hicks [5, p. 121], in which the cap-\nital-labor ratio remains unaltered at a constant ratio of factor prices.\n\nSince each classification has been widely used, it is only natural that the\nconnection between the two has been analyzed. The basic result for one-sec-\ntor models in which capital goods are produced is that Hicks and Harrod\nneutrality come to the same thing only if the elasticity of substitution be-\ntween capital and labor is unity. The situation is slightly more complicated in\nmultisector models, as the value of the capital-output ratio in sectors not pro-\nducing the capital good depends in part on the price ratio between the output\nof that sector and machines.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to show how relationships involving Harrod\nneutrality can be illustrated and proved by use of the isoquant diagram. Al-\nthough such a diagram offers a natural means of illustrating the Hicksian\nclassification of technological change, it does not seem to have been used here-\ntofore to discuss the Harrod definition.? It turns out to be surprisingly\nsimple to employ the isoquant map to illustrate Harrod neutrality in single\nand multisector models and thus also to illustrate certain key relationships in\na neoclassical model in which growth proceeds at a constant rate of profit.\n\nAs a preliminary step I demonstrate how it is possible to calculate the\nelasticity of substitution of an isoquant diagrammatically.? Consider Figure 1,\nwhere K and L represent quantities of capital and labor. The initial equilib-\nrium is at A with the ratio of wages to rents given by the (absolute value of\nthe) slope of line (1) and the capital-labor ratio by the slope of (3). In moving\nto point B the capital-labor ratio increases to the slope of line (4), while the\n\n* Cf. Meade [10, Ch. 5], Uzawa [13], Kennedy [7], Asimakopulos [3], and Amano\n[1].\n\n? Meade [10, p. 41] uses a diagram showing total output varying with capital, with a\nfixed quantity of labor. Joan Robinson [11] used the average and marginal product\ncurves of capital in discussing the definitions. This is the kind of diagram also used by\nAsimakopulos [3]. In more recent work [12, p. 419], Mrs. Robinson employs a diagram\nshowing output/man against the real capital ratio (capital in wage units).

Given a choice between a new book at say, $10.00, and an equally good\nolder book at, say $7.00, he may adopt the older book, whereas if the books\nwere roughly the same price he would choose the newer.\n\nThe effect of this proposal on the supply of used books should also be sub-\nstantial. The student's decision to retain or sell his books is highly price-sen-\nsitive. The price of a used book is directly related to the price of new copies.\nA hypothetical example may help here. Suppose used books are sold by deal-\ners for 75 per cent of the new copy price and that the dealer mark-up on used\nbooks is 50 per cent. A book with a list price of $8.00 will be sold by used-\nbook dealers for $6.00, and they will be willing to pay $4.00 for used copies\nof the book. The student who bought a new book for $8.00 must decide, at\nthe end of the year, whether to retain it or sell it for $4.00. Consider the al-\nternative pricing system whereby a new book is priced at $10.00 the first\nyear, $8.00 the second year, and $7.00 the third year. The student who\nbought a new book for $10.005 must decide, at the end of the year, whether\nto retain it or sell it for $4.00. He is more likely to retain the book in the lat-\nter situation than in the former (even if he has read the chapter in the book\non sunk costs). Consider, further, the student who bought a new copy the\nsecond year for $8.00. At the end of the year he will be able to sell this book\nfor only $3.50,* and thus he is more likely to retain it than if it could be sold\nfor $4.00.\n\nThe over-all effect of this technique, then, would be to encourage the sale\nof new rather than used copies of books, encourage the retention of books by\nstudents, and thus lengthen the life of textbook editions. Reducing the need\nfor frequent revisions should reduce publisher's costs and allow a somewhat\nlower average price level for textbooks. The more uniform year-to-year sales\npattern that would result should yield printing and inventory economies, Sub-\nsequent printings of a given edition now tend to become smaller in accord\nwith the pattern of sales, despite the economies of larger printing runs. The\nlower publishing costs mean greater profits which would be shared to some\nextent with authors. Even apart from any additional royalties, authors would\nsave time and effort from the reduced need to revise their books. Students\nwould benefit from a lower average price level for books, and the fewer revi-\nsions would reduce the number of times a student would buy a new book and\nfind it worthless on the used-book market at year-end because a new edition\nhas come out. This gain to students should outweigh the loss to those stu-\ndents who would have to pay higher than present textbook prices for new\ncopies of new books. It is possible that even the used-book dealers would\nbenefit by the longer life of editions. Only the typesetters would seem to be\nlosers from this proposal.\n\nWhile the results of this policy would be in the direction I have indicated,\nit is possible that the magnitude of such changes would be small. If there are\nsignificant operational problems in instituting such a policy (need to give re-\n\n* He had no choice since used copies were not available the first. year.\n\n*Since the price the following year for new copies will be $7.00, used-book dealers will\nonly be able to get $5.25 for used copies and will be willing to pay only $3.50 for used\ncopies.\n", "847\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["books sold will be quite close to the number of students in classes for which\nthe book has been adopted as the text.\n\nThe preceding paragraph is correct only for the first year of a book's life.\nBy the second year an excellent substitute for the book is available\u2014a used\ncopy. While instructors will give no more (or less) regard to price in the sec-\nond year, students will have a choice between purchase of a new copy of the\nbook or a used one. Clearly the elasticity of demand is higher in the second\nyear than in the first year, the level of demand for new books is lower, and\nprofit-maximization thus calls for a lower price in the second year than in the\nfirst.\n\nPublishers are fully aware of the impact of the used-book market on the\nsale of new books. The used-book market is an efficient, well-developed one,\nwith books being transferred rapidly from one section of the country to take\nadvantage of changes in adoptions (shipping costs for books are low as a\nmatter of social policy). Given the prices of new books, the used-book market\nprovides a socially useful function in allowing students to minimize book\ncosts. Many textbooks (perhaps the majority) have their largest sales in\ntheir first year. In subsequent years the number of schools adopting the book\nmay increase but part of this demand is satisfied by used copies.\n\nTo meet the competition from used books, publishers resort to frequent re-\nvisions of their books.? With the appearance of a new edition, all used copies\nof the old edition become immediately obsolete and virtually worthless in the\nused-book market. Even a cursory examination of sequential editions of pop-\nular textbooks reveals that many books are revised more out of concern for\nthe competition of used books than because the author has discovered a new\ntheory of comparative advantage or law of supply and demand.*\n\nThe suggested policy of reducing prices as the age of a book increases will\nhave effects on both the supply of used books and the demand for them. Let\nus look first at the demand side. We have noted that the student's choice be-\ntween new and used books is likely to be highly price-sensitive. The student\nwho may choose a used copy at $6.00 in preference to a new one at $8.00\nmay prefer a new one at $7.00 to a used one at $5.50.\n\nThe modest price sensitivity of the instructor will also be brought into\n\n?* Economists would not agree with the statement made to me by an editor of a large\npublishing house that \"used book dealers are parasites, creating nothing useful, who should\nbe put out of business.\"\n\n*I do not mean to imply that this is the only reason for revising textbooks. There is a\nneed for bringing statistical data up to date. There is also a competitive problem in that,\nquality and price being equal, an instructor will tend to prefer the most recent book. It\nis possible, however, that a lower price for the older book may compensate for this\ndisadvantage.\n\n*'The analogy with so-called \"planned obsolescence\" of automobiles is obvious. It should\nbe stressed that I intend no criticism of motives or ethics. In a free-market economy\nauthors, publishers, and automobile manufacturers are entitled to seek maximum profits.\nMy point is that relating textbook prices to the age of the edition may result in larger\nprofits with a reduction in the social waste of resources devoted to rearranging paragraphs\nor pages in a \"revised edition.\" While the per-unit costs of frequent revisions are negligible\nfor books selling tens of thousands of copies per year, most textbooks sell only a few\nthousand copies per year, and costs of revisions become substantial.\n", "846\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "2": ["textbooks that may lead to larger profits for publishers, larger royalties for\nauthors, and lower textbook costs for students. It is suggested that relating\nprice to the age of the book may accomplish these objectives.\n\nlt is well-known economic theory that the profit-maximizing price for a\nproduct with no close substitutes is higher than the profit-maximizing price for\nthat same product when close substitutes are available.\n\nIt is a well-known fact of the publishing business that the fixed costs (edi-\ntorial work, typesetting, etc.) of producing a single copy of a book are large\ncompared to the marginal costs of printing additional copies of the book.\nThat is, it may cost $20,000 to set up production of a book which could then\nbe printed at a marginal cost of $1.00 per copy.\n\nWhat is not well known in the publishing business is the elasticity of de-\nmand for textbooks. Publishers seem to operate on assumption that potential\nadopters of a textbook are faced with a choice among many books which are\nonly moderately differentiated from one another. The price of a new textbook\nmust be somewhere in the neighborhood of competing books because the in-\nstructor may be reluctant to require his students to purchase a book costing\nsubstantially more than other texts which are similar in content and quality.\nWhile a difference in price of, say, 25 cents or 50 cents is not likely to be a\nsignificant factor in the decision of an instructor as to which text to adopt, a\ndifference of $3 to $4 would probably be given heavy weight. No publisher,\nregardless of how good he thinks his book is, is likely to price a new Prin-\nciples text at, say, $12.00 when existing books are selling for $8 to $9. Once\nthe publisher determines the price he will charge for his new book,! under\npresent practices, the price generally remains the same throughout the life of\nthe edition.\n\nThere appear to be advantages in reducing prices as the book gets older.\nInstead of pricing a book at $8.00 when it is published, and maintaining that\nprice regardless of changes in demand, the book could be priced at, say,\n$10.00 when published, $8.00 a year later, $7.00 the following year, and\n$6.00 in subsequent years.\n\nOnce an instructor has adopted a new book, his students have little choice\nbut to buy the book, regardless of price. While demand is not completely in-\nelastic\u2014two or more students may share a book, a student may rely on a li-\nbrary, and I have seen students whose examinations provide no indication that\nthe text was ever looked at at all\u2014nevertheless, it is clear that the number of\n\n![t is not clear to me exactly how prices are determined but certain rules of thumb\nseem to play a large role. Publishers are reluctant to carry inventories, and thus a first\nprinting is usually no larger than one year's estimated sales. It seems to be virtually an\narticle of faith that each printing (including the first) should pay its own way. A price\nmust therefore be chosen which will be roughly in line with that of existing books and\nwhich, when multiplied by estimated first-year sales, will more than cover the full costs\nof producing the books. Since other publishers have followed the same rules, this is\nusually possible. If this cannot be done because of small expected sales, the book will\nnot be published. If this cannot be done because of unusually high costs (a book with\nlarge numbers of tables, illustrations, or complex mathematical symbols), an attempt may\nbe made to reduce costs by cutting material (if the author is agreeable) or printing the\nbook where production costs are lower (England or Japan).\n", "845\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "1": ["A Note on Textbook Pricing\n\nEconomists have long been active in writing textbooks.

(5) If no technological progress takes place in the sector producing\ncapital goods, Harrod neutrality in any other sector is equivalent to Hicksian\nneutrality in that sector. (6) At a constant rate of profit, technological\nprogress raises the real wage. The rate of increase in the real wage is the sum\nof the increase in output per man in the machine sector weighted by capital's\nshare in the consumption sector and output per man in the consumption sec-\ntor weighted by labor's share in the consumption sector. Should technological\nchange occur at the same Harrodian rate in each sector, the real wage and the\nwage-rental ratio both increase at this rate.\n", "855\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "7": ["5 is pictured as being tangent to the o-line at point R, where the value of the\ncapital-output ratio is the same as at B. This shift from F to F' thus exhibits\nHarrod neutrality. The capital-output ratio in quantity terms is shown at Q,\nand is higher as the price of F is higher. To recapitulate, draw a ray from the\norigin such that it intersects the a-line (showing the new factor-price ratio at\nthe old rate of profit) at the old capital-output ratio. If the slope of F\" at the\ncapital-labor ratio shown by this ray equals the slope of \u00ab, the change is\nHarrod-neutral (and the appropriate radial expansion or shrinking of ' will\nbring F\" to a point of tangency with the a-line at the old capital-output\nratio).\n\nSeveral comments are suggested by this construction. First, suppose tech-\nnological change is Harrod-neutral in the F-industry and of different rates in\nthe two industries. It can then be what I have called *own\" neutral in the F-\nindustry only if the elasticity of substitution in F is unity. (In Figure 5 point\nN would have to lie on RB.) Secondly, consider the case in which no tech-\nnological change takes place in the M-industry. The a-line then corresponds\nto DG. If technological progress takes place in the F-industry, the unit iso-\nquant is shifted inwards. At a constant rate of profit the price of F must fall\nin order that both goods be produced in a competitive equilibrium. This\nserves to make P\" (the unit-value isoquant) a radial expansion of P\". If F\" is\nto be tangent to DG (the a-line in this case) at the same value of the capital-\noutput ratio as initially, the original movement from F to F' must have been\na radial shrinking towards the origin. That is, technological change in the F-\nindustry must be Hicksian-neutral if it is to be Harrod-neutral and no tech-\nnological progress takes place in the industry producing capital goods.\n\nFinally, consider the changes in the factor-price ratio (w/7) and the real\nwage (w/pr) associated with technological progress at a constant rate of\nprofit. The rate of increase in the wage-rental ratio is given by EG/OE, which\nis the rate of increase of output per man in the machine sector. At this new\nhigher relative wage rate the real wage is given by the reciprocal of OX,\nwhere QX is parallel to \u00ab and tangent to F' at Q. Expressed in percentage\nterms, the rate of increase of the real wage is given by XG/OX. The rate of\nincrease of output per man in the machine sector is approximately EG/OX,\nand in the other sector is approximately SG/OX 3? Therefore the rate of in-\ncrease in the real wage is a weighted average of the rates of increase of out-\nput per man in the machine sector and in the consumption (F) sector, the\nweights given by XS/ES and EX/ES, respectively. These weights represent\nthe capital and labor distributive shares in the consumption sector.!\n\nIt may prove useful to conclude by summarizing these results: (1) Harrod\nneutrality in the one-sector model, and *own neutrality\" in the multisector\nmodel, lead to a change in the production function represented only by intro-\nducing a multiplicative factor for labor (the production function in\n\n? For small changes OE, OX, and OS are approximately equal. The formulae become\nexact for infinitesimal changes.\n\n?\" XS/ES is approximately equal to .NS/DS, capital's share in the F-industry.

Call this a case of \"own\" neutrality, a definition with the advantage\nthat it is symmetrical as between sectors and requires only information as to\nthe nature of the change in the production function in that sector.\n\nOnly in special cases will *own\" neutrality and Harrod neutrality coin-\ncide. Harrod neutrality in the F-sector obtains if the value of the capital-\noutput ratio in that sector [(Pu/Pr) * axr] remains constant at a constant rate\nof profit (7/py). It is clear from the definitions that the two versions would\ncoincide if the relative commodity price ratio (P./5r) were to remain con-\nstant at a constant rate of profit. Otherwise it is impossible to state whether\nthe technological change occurring in the F-industry is Harrod-neutral with-\nout knowing the extent of technological progress in the M-industry.\n\nThe concept of Harrod neutrality in the consumption-goods sector (F) of a\ntwo-sector model can be illustrated in Figures 4 and 5. Let physical units be\nchosen so that initially both commodity prices are unity. I choose M as nu-\nmeraire so that 5, is identically unity. The price of F may change as a conse-\nquence of technological progress. Assume, for convenience, that 74 is capital-\nintensive? The unit isoquants M and F in Figure 4 are then unit-value iso-\nquants in the initial situation, with the factor price ratio shown by the slope\nof DG, and the rate of profit by 1/0D.\n\nSuppose technological progress takes place in the M-industry\u2014shifting the\nunit isoquant to M\". As illustrated in Figure 4 progress is of the Harrod cap-\nital-saving variety in the M-industry. As we shall see, this is immaterial to\nthe question of whether technological change is Harrod-neutral in the F-in-\ndustry. What is relevant to that question is the extent of technological prog-\nress in M\u2014the increase in output/man at a constant capital-output ratio.\nThis is given by EG/OE.\n\nSuppose technical improvement also takes place in the F-industry. The new\nunit F-isoquant may (1) still lie outside line a, (2) be tangent to line a, or\n(3) cut line a. In case (1) the rate of increase in output/man (at a constant\ncapital-output ratio) in the F-industry falls short of the improvement in the\nM-industry. In case (2) they are equivalent and in case (3) the extent of\ntechnological progress (in Harrod's sense) in the F-industry exceeds that in\nthe M-industry. Clearly it is only in case (2) that both goods can continue\nto be produced in a competitive equilibrium at the same rate of profit with-\nout a change in the commodity price ratio. In the case illustrated, where F^\nshows a smaller improvement in output per man than does M\", the price of F\nmust rise if both commodities are to be produced with 1/OD the rate of\nprofit.\n\nThe argument shifts now to Figure 5. The a-line is given as in Figure 4,\nand is determined by the extent of the improvement in the M-industry. For F\nto be produced the price of F must rise. Consider deflating ax\u00bb and arp by\nDr. As py rises, this would have the effect of shifting the F\" curve radially to-\nwards the origin; \u00bb must rise until such a shifted F^ curve becomes tangent\nto the a-line (shown by F\"). Alternatively phrased, as 5\u00bb rises, the F-isoquant\nshowing unit-va/ue becomes a radial shrinking of F'. The F\" curve in Figure\n\n? Absolutely nothing in the subsequent argument depends on this.\n", "852\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "4": ["which, as is well known, is characterized by unit elasticity of substitution.\n(The constant-savings assumption often made in growth theories is equivalent\nto Graham demand functions for consumption and investment.)\n\nIn the one-sector model just described the capital-output ratio in physical\nterms is the same as the ratio in value terms. And the rate of profit is the\nratio between the rental on machines and the price of the good produced in\nthat one sector. Now consider the addition of a sector producing, say, food\n(the consumption good). Suppose the original isoquant for food and the\nnature of technological change are as shown in Figure 2, with ax, and ary\nreplaced by ax\u00bb and a;;.

In\nFigure 3 envisage a series of isoquants representing successive degrees of\nHarrod-neutral improvements. The *price consumption\" curve would be the\nhorizontal line 4C, representing demand for labor per unit of output that\nwould be of unit price elasticity.

A\nuniform expansion of the a7, axis would put M\" into M. This feature of Har-\nrod-neutral change was noted by Joan Robinson [11] and proved by Uzawa\n[13]. If before technological change the production function is M \u2014 F(K,L),\nit can be represented, after the change, by M \u2014 F(K;AL). In the case shown\nin Figure 2, the multiplicative factor 4 is AC/EC \u2014 1 -- (AE/EC), or one\nplus the rate of improvement of output per man.\n\nIt is well known that Hicks neutrality is shown by a radial shrinking of the\nunit isoquant towards the origin. The slope of the isoquant is preserved\nalong any ray from the origin. Figure 3 illustrates the case in which technolo-\ngical change is both Hicks- and Harrod-neutral.

According to this view technological progress is neutral if it leaves the\ncapital-output ratio unaltered at a given rate of profit. In principle this differs\nfrom the concept of neutrality offered by Hicks [5, p. 121], in which the cap-\nital-labor ratio remains unaltered at a constant ratio of factor prices.\n\nSince each classification has been widely used, it is only natural that the\nconnection between the two has been analyzed. The basic result for one-sec-\ntor models in which capital goods are produced is that Hicks and Harrod\nneutrality come to the same thing only if the elasticity of substitution be-\ntween capital and labor is unity. The situation is slightly more complicated in\nmultisector models, as the value of the capital-output ratio in sectors not pro-\nducing the capital good depends in part on the price ratio between the output\nof that sector and machines.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to show how relationships involving Harrod\nneutrality can be illustrated and proved by use of the isoquant diagram. Al-\nthough such a diagram offers a natural means of illustrating the Hicksian\nclassification of technological change, it does not seem to have been used here-\ntofore to discuss the Harrod definition.? It turns out to be surprisingly\nsimple to employ the isoquant map to illustrate Harrod neutrality in single\nand multisector models and thus also to illustrate certain key relationships in\na neoclassical model in which growth proceeds at a constant rate of profit.\n\nAs a preliminary step I demonstrate how it is possible to calculate the\nelasticity of substitution of an isoquant diagrammatically.? Consider Figure 1,\nwhere K and L represent quantities of capital and labor. The initial equilib-\nrium is at A with the ratio of wages to rents given by the (absolute value of\nthe) slope of line (1) and the capital-labor ratio by the slope of (3).

Joan Robinson [11] used the average and marginal product\ncurves of capital in discussing the definitions. This is the kind of diagram also used by\nAsimakopulos [3]. In more recent work [12, p. 419], Mrs. Robinson employs a diagram\nshowing output/man against the real capital ratio (capital in wage units).

Conclusions\n\nWhat significance does the unseen hand in government, and its imperfec-\ntion, have for us? First of all, just as background in thinking about govern-\nment activities, we ought to keep in mind the existence of this invisible hand\nand the way it works. It tends to harness individual interests within govern-\nment to carry out broader objectives. It keeps parochial viewpoints from\nyielding exclusively parochial policies. But we must keep in mind the formi-\ndable imperfections of the mechanism\u2014the fact that there are major spill-\novers affecting parties who have inadequate voices in the bargaining process.\nMoreover, we should recognize that many questionable policies or choices are\n", "ternatives and acquiring information are costly activities [3]. But they are\nthere, and in that sense governments can be said to \"satisfice\" rather than\nmaximize. Uncertainty, too, causes the same complications in the public sec-\ntor that have been discussed so much with reference to the private sector.\nEven advertising is present in government, as agencies seek to hold or expand\ntheir clienteles [12, pp. 120-21].\n\nRestrictions on tradeoffs, another point sometimes mentioned in connection\nwith the private sector, pervade the government sphere. In order to control\nwhat is actually done in this environment, Congress must authorize appropri-\nations for specified categories and prohibit significant transfers of resources\nwithout requests for reprogramming permission. Moreover reprogramming re-\nquests are not only an inconvenience; they are often frowned upon by Con-\ngress. Furthermore, the Departments, in order to control what is actually\ndone, must \"shred out\" narrower categories and discourage transfers of re-\nsources among them. This means that substitution possibilities must often be\nneglected. As noted before, it may be better to have such rules of thumb or\nrestrictions than not to have them, but their existence, like any similar phe-\nnomena in private industry, is a departure from the ideal.\n\n\"There are other obstacles to the consideration of alternatives and tradeofts\nin government. Small jurisdictions elect representatives at large, and there the\nwishes of minority groups, i.e., certain sets of alternatives, tend to be neglect-\ned. If a metropolitan government consisted of councilmen elected at large, or\na state legislature consisted of assemblymen elected at large, the majority\nmight well ignore the \"needs\" of minorities or local areas and the costs thrust\nupon them. The actual outcomes would depend upon the kind of behind-the-\nscenes logrolling mechanism that developed.\n\nFinally, when we turn to the public sector, we do not escape the interde-\npendence of utility functions or the troublesome implications of the theory of\nsecond-best. The success of Administrator Jones affects my utility function,\nand either deliberate or by-product favors to some voters affect the satisfac-\ntion of others. As for second-best, it is omnipresent. The full conditions for\noptimality in the public sector are definitely not fulfilled. We are destined to\nlive in a world of Nth best and to wonder at times if apparent improvements\nreally make us better off.\n", "504\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "8": ["feel in reaching these decisions.\" Federal officials, in setting tariffs or price\nsupports, are inflicting costs that the bargaining process does not make them\nfeel very keenly.\n\nIt is difficult to assess the size of these externalities because officials feel\ncosts and gains attributable to their choices mostly through bargaining pres-\nsures, and these are hard to measure. Parochial outlooks as such do not reveal\nwhat costs or gains are felt. In the private sector, a businessman does not say\n*T want to be sure and take into account a// the costs to the nation,\" and an\nuncritical observer might conclude that there must therefore be tremendous\nexternalities. But the price system compels the businessman to consider (most\nof) the costs he causes. In the public sector, similarly, a government official\ndoes not say, I want to be sure and count all the costs to the nation.\" Again\na naive observer might conclude that there must therefore be great externali-\nties. But the bargaining process compels the official to take at least many of\nthe costs into account.\n\nStill, while the net externalities are hard to assess, they appear to be wide-\nspread in government. Third parties who have little or no bargaining power\nare often affected. Or, another way to put the matter is to point out the pecu-\nliar, sometimes indeterminate, nature of property rights within government.\n(Who has the right to do what with various assets in the public sector has\nimportant implications just as it does in the private sector.) The common\npool problem\u2014the resource that is treated as though it is a free good\u2014in the\nprivate sector is still more in evidence in the governmental sector. This is not\nto say that there should be a massive shift of activities from the government\nto the private sphere. It is simply to say that in terms of the \"welfare equa-\ntion\" and Pareto optimality, the public sector too is in plenty of trouble.\n\nAs far as the concentration of power is concerned, utility-maximization in\ngovernment surely generates this spillover to a greater extent than in the pri-\nvate sector. The ultimate possibilities of discretionary authority in govern-\nment surely loom larger than those in the world of giant corporations. In one\nfamous Jules Feiffer cartoon, an employee of the telephone company says: If\nyou don't like our service, why don't you try one of our competitors?? This\nmay appear to be a devastating thrust at the concentration of power in the\nprivate sector, but the same sort of cartoon could apply to many services pro-\nvided by government.\n\nOther. Imperfections\n\nAs for \"satisficing\" rather than maximizing, this is surely as applicable in\ngovernment as it is in business. There are standards of performance, stand-\nards of water quality and housing, rules regarding the use of government\ncars, and rules of thumb regarding all manner of things. As in the private sec-\ntor, rules of thumb are often better than not having them, since reviewing al-\n\n\"For a provocative case study and discussion of spillovers in education, see [7].\n\n*From The Explainers by Jules Feiffer. 1960.

Authorities who approve a new irrigation project can impose\ncosts they do not feel on firms, individuals, and other government agencies.\nThis can happen, for example, because irrigation introduces additional salts\nor pesticides into downstream or underground water supplies. Some projects\neven affect the porosity of soils and the underground flows of water. Sewage\ndisposal may impose costs on others and education may bestow benefits on\nothers that the bargaining process does not always cause local governments to\n", "monopolies in the private sector implies a good deal of emphasis on obtaining\nhigher profits, while in the public sector it implies a good deal of attention to\nobtaining higher budgets. Nonetheless there are somewhat analogous resource\nmisallocations. An agency with strong bargaining power may not restrict its\noutput inefficiently, but it will tend to seek approval of below-cost pricing\nand expand its output inefficiently. An agency with weak bargaining power is\nlikely to find its activities curbed even if it would be economic to expand\nthem. Pressure by voters and the unseen hand may tend to correct these situa-\ntions, but in a slow and exceedingly imprecise fashion.\n\nAnother way in which the imperfect bargaining process in government dis-\ntorts output is through the **holdout.\" Sometimes a project affecting several\nStates or counties or other governmental units would be economic from the\nstandpoint of total benefits and costs, yet uneconomic from the standpoint of\nany one of the governmental units. A deal would be mutually advantageous,\nand sometimes this happens. (In 1964 one city in Los Angeles County decid-\ned not to have its annual fireworks display, but an adjoining city said that it\nreaped benefits too, so after some bargaining, compensation was arranged,\nand the fireworks display was presented.) Yet often the last State or county\nrefuses to bargain, hoping for a \"free ride.\" Similar phenomena occur with\nrespect to agencies within a single jurisdictional authority such as the federal\ngovernment. Centralization, incidentally, may reduce the problem of the hold-\nout, but impairs the functioning of the bargaining mechanism in other ways.\n\nEntry of new agencies to replace obsolete ones is probably more difficult\nthan the entry of new firms with new ideas in private industries. Reservoir-\nbuilding agencies are ardent spokesmen for conventional methods of produc-\ning water. There are relatively few spokesmen for certain alternative methods\nof increasing water supplies, such as shifting water from lower-valued uses to\nhigher-valued uses, reclaiming waste water, or reducing losses from seepage,\nevaporation, and vegetation. For new methods or products to be seriously\nconsidered, it often requires entry by a new branch or agency and a chance\nfor it to build up a clientele. But entry in the public sector is difficult, and it\noften takes a long time to drive obsolete activities into \"bankruptcy.\"\n\nSo much for examples of the effects of \"imperfect competition\" in govern-\nment. The point is merely that the counterparts of oligopoly and monopoly\ndistort prices and outputs in the public as well as in the private sectors.\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "502\n"], "6": ["Counterpart of Monopoly\n\nThe bargaining process is extremely imperfect in government. Monopoly\nmodels do not fit precisely, of course; for one thing utility-maximization by\n", "sponds to prospective profits. These legislators will feel\" many of the expect-\ned benefits and (probably to a lesser extent) the expected costs. The benefits\nare likely to be concentrated on a smaller group and be larger per-person-\naffected than are the costs (mainly taxes), but legislators will feel some pres-\nsure from both groups and will anticipate some reaction at election time from\nboth groups.\n\nSecond, consider the allocation of resources within the public sector among\nprograms and activities (comparable to the allocation of resources among in-\ndustries). Officials can take home no profits, and they are spending other peo-\nple's money; yet they may \"feel\" the major gains and costs because some\ntradeoffs are possible and crude *shadow prices\" emerge from the bargaining\nprocess. An official finds that it does cost him something to expand his pro-\ngram\u2014as well as bring rewards. Resources tend to be shifted toward pro-\ngrams in which marginal individual benefit (M1B) is greater than marginal\nindividual cost (MIC), and bargaining helps make M1B equal to MTB and\nMIC equal to MTC. The hidden hand harnesses individual decisions so that\nthey come a little closer to satisfying the welfare equation than they would if\nno such mechanism existed.\n\nFinally, consider the utilization of resources within a program by lower-\nlevel officials (comparable to the allocation of resources by firms within an\nindustry). The alternative methods of production that are considered depend\nupon constraints that proscribe certain of the alternatives and pressures that\ninduce personnel to examine more or fewer alternatives. The costs and gains\nfrom each alternative, as perceived by government personnel, depend upon\nthe criteria in terms of which personnel are judged, the importance of\nefficiency to survival of the agency or branch, and so on. Again the gears of\nthe mechanism may appear to clank quite a bit; but rivalry and the bargain-\ning process still work to internalize what would otherwise be externalities,\nand make gross inefficiency somewhat costly to government personnel. To\nsome extent, flagrant inefficiency impairs an official's ability to bargain for\npromotion, larger budgets, freedom from investigation, and other desiderata.\nCompared with discretionary authority, then, the bargaining mechanism is\nagain a valuable and unseen hand guiding resource utilization.\n\nIn the public sector too, however, we find that there are numerous limita-\ntions. We tend to blame faulty outcomes in government upon individuals,\nperhaps because some of them are in the limelight. We are prone to say that\nthings go wrong because of stupidity, sloth, weak character, or some other\npersonal inadequacy in particular government officials. Yet to a great extent,\nas in the private sector, there are limitations on the system that should make\nus expect faulty outcomes. We should understand these limitations better in\ntrying to appraise alternative arrangements and devise improvements.\n", "501\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "5": ["'The fact that individual decision-makers have parochial viewpoints does\nnot mean that the pattern of decisions will inevitably be stupid or vicious.\n'The right kind of barganing process can make special interests and parochial\nviewpoints, which one might think would produce chaotic decisions, lead to\nan orderly and sensible pattern of choices. If well designed, the invisible hand\ncan go a long way toward turning private \"vice\" into public virtue, in gov-\nernment as well as in the private sector.\n\nThe mechanism may seem like a Rube Goldberg device in comparison with\na mathematical model of optimality, since government decision-making ap-\npears to cater to majorities of large groups rather than to fine differences in\nindividual preferences, and it appears to respond to voters! views on packages\nof issues rather than on each individual issue. But the mechanism is not quite\nas imprecise as that. As for voters, minority views on particular issues carry\nsome weight, because there is the threat that those voters, when considering\nthe larger package of issues at election time, may shift their votes and in\neffect form a new coalition that has real power. Differential intensity of feel-\nings or different values attached to particular policies can carry weight for\nessentially the same reason. If a minority attaches a high value to a particu-\nlar policy, it can sacrifice its feelings about other issues and join the coalition\nof its choice. Others react, as they see the \"prices\" being paid for various de-\ncisions, by accepting a little less of those items that are becoming relatively\nexpensive and a little more of those items that are becoming relatively cheap.\nIn legislative bodies, similarly, views on individual issues as opposed to a\npackage, the views of minorities, and differences in the values attached to\nparticular policies do help shape decisions, because some tradeoffs\u2014giving up\na vote on this issue for someone else's vote on that one, giving up some of one\npolicy for more of another \u2014are possible, and *shadow prices,\" so to speak,\ngradually emerge to reveal the costs and gains from various actions. With\nchecks and balances, a multiplicity of interests represented in the bargaining\nprocess, and some possibilities for voluntary \"exchange,\" the pattern of\nchoices can cater to individual preferences better than may be suggested by\nthe words \"majority rule.\"5\n\nThis mechanism has some influence on most choices, though the extent of\nthis influence varies greatly with circumstances. In the aggregate these\nchoices and decisions shape the allocation of resources at various levels. Con-\nsider first the allocation of resources between the private and public sectors.\nSuppose a larger share for government is under consideration. Senators and\ncongressmen will become aware of constituents' views on this and other issues\nand will respond to prospective votes almost the way a board of directors re-\n\n*For some provocative contributions to the development of a theory of government to\nsupplement the theory of the firm, see the work of Buchanan, Downs, Olson, Tullock,\nand Williams [4] [6] [10] [11] [13].\n\n*For example, such influence is much smaller wherever decision-makers are partially\nsheltered from the necessity of bargaining, e.g., the Supreme Court or agencies that are\nrelatively independent. Such independent checks and balances, however, can often play a\nbeneficial role in the over-all bargaining network.\n", "500\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "4": ["of the compensations for both costs inflicted and gains bestowed depend upon\nbargaining strengths and circumstances (as they do in the private economy).\nAnd agair the greater the extent to which these compensations are made, the\nless the extent to which the costs and gains felt by an official will diverge\nfrom total costs and gains.\n\nEvery decision or action, it might be noted, involves bargaining, tacit or\nexplicit. When a senator considers voting to censure Senator McCarthy, he\nasks himself, ^what will be the consequences?\" If he decides to accept the\nreactions of others to a yes vote, Aat is his bargain. If he decides to refrain\nfrom voting or to vote \"no,\" he accepts a different set of reactions, and \u00a3kat\nis his bargain.\n\nAs in the private sector, shi\u00edts in costs or gains (i.e., prices paid or re-\nceived) cause shifts in behavior. As conditions change, the price of apples\nsometimes goes up and the price of oranges down. Consumers alter their be-\nhavior (though not necessarily their nature). Similarly, if a senator from\nTexas becomes President of the United States, the price or cost of some ac-\ntions goes up and the cost of other actions goes down. For example, the cost\nof closing down a base in New York goes up, the cost of closing an installa-\ntion in Texas goes down. The structure of rewards also alters. The rewards\nfor a war on poverty in the entire United States go up, those for aid to con-\nstituents in a particular State go down. Thus a man who becomes President\nwill take more nearly a national viewpoint\u2014i.e., will acquire a greater \"sense\nof responsibility\"\u2014though his nature need not change at all. The altered\ncost-reward structures are bound to affect his behavior. And, like the price\nSystem, this bargaining mechanism has many desirable e\u00edfects. It might be\ncalled the *unseen hand in government.\"*\n\nFor these reasons, while the particular values, principles, or even whims of\na government official occasionally play roles in his decisions, they do not usu-\nally play major roles in democratic governments. The bargaining mechanisms\nlimit the discretion of decision-makers. Let us look at this side of the coin\u2014\nthe constraints on the authority of individual officials. Again the forces at\nwork are akin to those that operate in the private sector. In a highly competi-\ntive industry, a business firm must give much attention to avoiding losses and\nincreasing profits or it will fail. In these circumstances employees find that\nthey must devote most of their efforts to achieving the firm's goals or be fired.\nIn a public utility or nonprofit corporation, both managers and employees\nhave greater leeway, but they too are limited in the extent to which altruistic,\nevil, or personal aims can guide their actions. In government also, while man-\nagers and other personnel have some discretion, they cannot flout the wishes\nof voters, superiors, and colleagues and hope to survive long. They certainly\ncannot do just whatever they wish. They must compromise with their princi-\nples, whether good or evil, and accept a great deal of guidance from the un-\nseen hand.\n\n*C. E. Lindblom has presented closely related arguments and has referred to \"the hid-\nden hand in government\" [8]. For additional thoughts about the unseen hand and gov-\nernment spending, see [9].\n", "499\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["?One of the best presentations of the utility-maximization hypothesis is by Armen A.\nAlchian and William R. Allen [1, Ch. 2].\n", "sector too, choices are made by individuals. Politicians, executives, and agen-\nCy heads are similar to managers of businesses; other personnel are laborers;\nand voters can perhaps be viewed as boards of directors. Inevitably each per-\nson has a separate utility function, a '\"parochial\" viewpoint so to speak.\nThese individuals do not arise each morning and ask, \"what can I do today\nfor Pareto optimality?\" Like the rest of us, they are surely utility-maxim-\nizers.\n\nThis does not mean that they are selfish, brutish, or motivated solely by\nself-interest narrowly conceived. It simply means that individuals get satis-\nfaction from a variety of things\u2014material goods, play, helping others, per-\nforming tasks well, and so on\u2014and that these things are to some extent sub-\nstitutes for each other. As a consequence, if the cost to a person of one item\nincreases, he will demand less of it and more of other items. If the benefit he\nfeels from an item increases, he will demand more of it and less of other\nthings. In government, if the cost to an official of one action increases, he will\ntake less of it. If the gains that he feels increase, he will take more action of\nthat sort.?\n\nAlso, in government as well as in the private sector, there is a mechanism\nthat leads utility-maximizers to a pattern of decisions that is somewhat order-\nly and sensible. This mechanism is the bargaining process and, at least in\nWestern nations where many interests are represented, it has some similarities\nto the price mechanism in the private sector of the economy. The price sys-\ntem makes individuals feel many of the relevant costs and gains produced by\ntheir decisions. When a business firm takes action, it has to bargain with and\ncompensate numerous persons who supply buildings, labor services, and other\ninputs. That is, if the firm's action uses up or damages property, the firm or-\ndinarily has to buy the consent of the owners. Whenever the firm's action\nproduces beneficial effects, the management tries to charge the beneficiaries.\nIf all compensations are made and the firm still makes a profit, some persons\nare made better off without making others worse off. The greater the extent to\nwhich all these compensations are made, the less the extent to which the\nfirm's costs and gains will diverge from total costs and gains.\n\nIn government the bargaining mechanism produces some of the same\neffects. If a public official's action will use up someone's property or damage\ncertain interests, he will probably find a cost associated with that action. He\nwill feel the complaints of those damaged or the inconvenience of trying to\nmollify them. Or, he may suffer embarrassing or expensive enmities among his\ncolleagues or retaliation by other officials. He has to bargain with many peo-\nple who are affected and, in one way or another, encounter costs if he makes\ndecisions that impose sacrifices on others. From those who are benefited, on\nthe other hand, he can bargain for compensation. The reward may be support\nin connection with other matters, reduced enmity, increased friendship or\nconvenience, or some other kind of quid pro quo.

A degree of monopoly power leads to\ninequalities in the welfare equation.\"  Externalities lead to other\ninequalities.? Vaccinations bestow benefits on nonusers of this service, and\nvapors emitted by vehicles inflict costs on others that are not felt by those\nwho take the actions. These spillover effects arise because it is sometimes une-\nconomical, or even impossible, to define and enforce property rights in an ap-\npropriate fashion, e.g., so that people could charge automobile drivers for\ndamaging their rights to smog-free and noise-free air. (In the long run, one of\nthe most important externalities may be the discrepancy between the private\nand total costs of having additional children. As a consequence, if we solve\nenough technological problems, we may ultimately have population conges-\ntion that rivals automobile congestion.) Also, it is often said that the actions\nof firms to increase profits leads to the concentration of power in great corpo-\nrations, yielding a spillover impairment of freedom.\n\nAnother point that is sometimes raised is that firms really engage in\nsatisficing rather than utility-maximizing, producing different outcomes from\nthose corresponding to the welfare equation. (Actually, satisficing and utility-\nmaximizing may turn out to be identical as soon as one recognizes that there\nis uncertainty, that acquiring information is costly, and that re-examining all\nthe alternatives every five minutes would be expensive.) Another limitation\nfrequently cited is that there is not perfect knowledge and that misinforma-\ntion or lack of information leads us far from economic efficiency (as it might\nbe conceived, in these circumstances, by some omniscient observer).\n\nIn certain kinds of advertising, firms devote resources to nullifying the\nefforts of other firms, much as people at parades stand on tiptoe to nullify the\neffects of others standing on tiptoe; and, especially if we ignore any stimuli to\nthe introduction of new products, this type of advertising appears to yield\nsomething less than optimality. In addition, due to a variety of institutional\nconstraints, there are restrictions on the ability of people to consider tradeoffs\n\u2014there are tie-in sales, restrictions on entry into occupations, *throwaway\nTV\" programs instead of pay-TV. Another troublesome blemish on the un-\nseen hand is a special type of spillover\u2014the fact that utility functions are not\nreally independent. What Jones buys does affect my utility. As some see it, a\nfinal crushing blow is dealt by the theory of second-best. If all conditions for\noptimality are not fulfilled, we cannot always be certain that progress toward\nfulfilling particular conditions is truly desirable.

In-\ndeed, this rise in the rate on long-term governments is the very result which\nhad traditionally been relied upon in attempts to demonstrate that the mone-\ntary effect of long-term debt finance must be contractionary. This, as Tobin\ncorrectly points out, reflected the incorrect implicit identification of the supply\nprice of capital with the rate on long-term governments.\n\nWhile it must be admitted that the increase in the quantity of government\ndebt may reduce the supply price of capital by increasing the demand for\ncapital, Tobin's model also includes private debts. These are presumably good\nsubstitutes, in lender portfolios, both for government debt and for equity cap-\nital. Therefore, will not an increase in government debt raise interest rates on\nprivate debts? Given the importance of private debt in corporate finance, this\nwill discourage demand for capital and offset in part, in whole, or more than\nfully the favorable effects of increased liquidity in the form of government\ndebt.\n\nThe resulting monetary effect of an increase in long-term government debt\nhinges, therefore, upon the relative substitutability of private debts for gov-\nernment debt as opposed to equity capital. If private debts are better substi-\ntutes for government debt, then the rates on these two assets will move to-\ngether, both rising. If, on the other hand, private debts are better substitutes\nfor equities, then \u00a3ese two rates will move together, both falling. In the ap-\npendix to his essay, Tobin implicitly assumes the latter to the case.* He thus\nconcludes that increases in long-term government debt will unambiguously\nincrease investment.\n\nWe believe, however, that the analytical approach used by Tobin to fix\nlong-term government debt as a better substitute for other government debt\nthan for corporate equities [1., pp. 162-67], leads one to conclude, as well,\nthat private debts are better substitutes for government debt than for equi-\nties. They possess the purchasing-power risk and the same market risks as\ngovernment bonds. They also do not share the capital-gains possibilities of\nequities. While they do share the default risk with equities, this does not\nseem to offset the above factors which operate in the opposite direction, espe-\ncially since private debts possess prior claim to earnings and assets.\n\nIn terms of Tobin's model, our contention is that, in equation (P6) of the\nAppendix, i.e., the public demand for capital, C \u2014 c; (rs, rs, 74, rs) W, it is\nmore likely that 7, (Tobin's rate on private debts) will rise as M; (long-term\ngovernment debt) is increased. The higher is 7,, the lower will be the demand\nfor capital, and r; (the supply price of capital) may even have to rise to\nrestore equilibrium. In this case, the sign of 37,/3M; is positive, and long-\nterm debt finance is contractionary. The result can go either way, and\ndepends upon the magnitude of 37,/2M;, or how closely private debts and\n\n''This explanation for the difference between his results and ours was given to us by\nTobin as one of his comments addressed to an earlier draft of this note.

As they themselves ac-\nknowledge, there would always be other and more direct implications by\nwhich to distinguish the two models (in particular, by reference to the behav-\nlor of total market value in response to differences in capital structure). Even\nin terms of the yield curves, there would be no very serious difficulties, in\nprinciple, in distinguishing between their curves MA and ML'/G (particularly\nsince the slope and curvature of MA can be directly predicted, as they show,\nfrom MI'G and an estimate of o). Whether, in practice, the two\ncurves could be distinguished by simple regressions of yield on leverage, is, of\ncourse, another matter. But the uncertainties surrounding the usefulness of\nthis particular type of test have nothing much to do with the sorts of ques-\ntions raised by Brewer and Michaelsen.\n\nTurning next to the issue of the proper measure of the value of the tax sav-\ning on debt, we fear that their proposed new expressions are based on a mis-\n", "525\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "1": ["The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance, and the\nTheory of Investment: Reply\n\nAlthough we can appreciate the ingenuity with which Messrs. Brewer and\nMichaelsen have developed parts of their argument, we fear that they have\nunderestimated the limitations of their theoretical analysis and overestimated\nthe significance of even their valid results for empirical applications.\n\n15 We abstract from the unsettled questions of how expected yields are to be measured or\nwhether they exist in the sense used by MM. In much of the traditional literature expected\nand promised yields on bonds are not carefully distinguished. This might be the source of some\nof the current controversy, since the weighted average of expected yields on shares and\npromised yields on bonds will be a U-shaped curve under both hypotheses.\n", "Turning now to the second and more intractable difficulty noted above,\nit would appear that firms in a given risk class would have utilized debt\nup to the limits of the institutional constraints facing them or up to the\noptimum amount, if such exists, to maximize Vr. Under both hypotheses,\nthen, firms in a given class will tend to have the same debt-equity ratios.\nConsequently, a scatter diagram of either expected yields on shares or\nweighted averages of expected yields on bonds and shares plotted against\ndebt-equity ratios should form a tight cluster (ideally a point).'^ The inter-\npretation to be given the slope of a line fitted to such a scatter, such as the\nregression coefficients reported by MM [3, p. 281-87] for the oil and utility\nindustries, is far from clear. Apart from measurement error, wide disper-\nsion probably indicates the inclusion in the sample of firms from different\nrisk classes. It may, therefore, be necessary to expand both hypotheses to\ninclude the effects of variation of institutional constraints and of optimal\ndebt-equity ratios among risk classes to determine which of them describes\nthe effects of leverage on market value in the real world. In the absence of\nsuch an undertaking it appears likely that tests quite different from those\ndiscussed here will be necessary to distinguish between the two hypotheses.\n\nDaAwsoN E.

In a few cases, the rule of strict liability or liability without fault applies.\nNegligence need not be shown, and the exercise of reasonable or diligent care\nis not a sufficient defense. It suffices that harm was done by the activity to\nrequire that compensation be given. Strict liability has been construed to cover,\nfor example, cases in which the probability of damage to others is very high;\nwhen many suffer, if harm is done; when the return on the activity which\ncauses harm is high for those who engage in it, relative to the loss of those\nwho suffer damage; or when a danger is introduced into the community that\nis not common to the community. Strict liability has been held to flow from\nthe keeping of wild animals, the manufacture and storage of high explosives,\nthe trespass of domestic animals upon the property of another, the spread of\nfire, and the dusting of crops with chemical sprays.\n\nThe instance of injuries from accidents at work is, in one sense, analogous\nto that of strict liability. Compensation is given willy-nilly and without regard\nto fault. Workmen's compensation statutes have been enacted in all of the\nstates and, in addition, for some classes of employment, by the Congress. In\nall of them, the principle of liability without fault rules. No attention is given\nto the question of negligence, either on the part of employer or worker. It is\nenough to establish that the injury is work-connected and to define the injury.\n\n3. In other cases, the doctrine of \"assumption or risk\" applies, and those\n\n?

Conclusions\n\nThe application of the above empirical magnitudes to formula (7) indi-\ncates an overvaluation of the dollar of 4$ per cent, not counting the effects\nof product differentiation. Had we utilized the ratios of foreign to U.S. pro-\nduction which are available, rather than assuming these equal to unity, and\nhad we not reduced the ratios 2^; W,;K,; and 9; Z9. by one-half, the\ndegree of overvaluation would have been only half as large. The use of\ndemand and supply elasticities closer to available statistical estimates would\nhave reduced the estimated overvaluation even further. The downward\nadjustment of the ratios was made to allow for the fact that all world pro-\nduction may not be in the same market as U.S. import and export goods.\nWe have assumed that for the typical commodity one-half of world produc-\ntion is outside the market for U.S. exports and imports. The expansion or\ncontraction of the size of the market as prices vary will tend to make the\ndemand and supply elasticities of import and export goods higher than\nwould be indicated by available statistical studies. On the other hand, the\nfact that the prices of all import and export goods move simultaneously in\nthe same direction removes some of the substitution effects which are in-\ncluded in the statistical estimates. Inclusion of the allowance for product\ndifferentiation will raise the estimated overvaluation to about 7 per cent.\nIt seems inconceivable that the long-run elasticities of demand and supply\nfor traded goods could be less than .3 and .5 respectively. However, for\nthose who might disagree with this judgment, the results are calculated\nfor selected alternative values of the elasticities in Table 1. In the case\nwhere product differentiation is included, 0 is assumed equal to .5.\n\nThe assumption that no changes in capital flows would result from a\ndecline in the external value of the dollar must now be qualified. A continua-\ntion of the present commitment of the U.S. government to achieve full\nemployment by fiscal policy could lead to a rise in domestic interest rates.\nIt is also possible, of course, that the improvement in the trade balance\nwould give license for an easing of monetary policy. Even if the depressing\neffects of the devaluation on aggregate demand abroad were eliminated by\nfiscal policy alone, a rise in foreign interest rates would be unlikely. The\nuse of monetary policy would certainly reduce them. Thus there is no good\nreason to assume that a large capital outflow from the United States would\nresult, making the required devaluation greater.\n\nIn our judgment the evidence strongly suggests that the dollar is over-\nvalued by not more than 10 per cent. Indeed, quite plausible values of the\nparameters imply that the overvaluation is substantially less. This conclu-\nsion and the method by which it is derived might be criticized on the ground\nthat too little weight is given to available econometric estimates of the\ndemand elasticities of exports and imports. However, while subjective\nguesses about the parameters are admittedly imprecise, the econometric\nestimates have long been regarded as downward-biased.

The poorer the substitutability of the ith\nU.S. good for ith good abroad, the lower will be the demand elasticity for\nexports and/or imports of this good.!? A fall in the price of U.S. exports rela-\ntive to the prices of these commodities abroad will cause foreign demand to\nshift from foreign output to domestic production. The foreign supply price\nof the export goods will fall. If the goods are perfect substitutes, the shift in\nconsumption will occur until the domestic and foreign prices are equal.\nWhere they are not perfect substitutes, the shift in demand will stop before\nprices are equalized.\n\nThe excess-demand formulation can be modified to allow for imperfect\nsubstitutability of domestic and foreign goods by dividing the importing\ncountry's consumption into imports and domestic goods.

If the domestic and foreign versions of the good are perfect\nsubstitutes, the price ultimately falls by the same amount at home and\nabroad, 6; equals unity, and (15) becomes identical with (8).

Summing over i and assuming\nthat 5, \u2014 3, 0;\u2014 0, and 0;\u2014 0 for all i, (15) becomes an empirically manageable\nrelationship. The extent of product differentiation can be allowed for by an\nappropriate assumption about 0. It would seem reasonable to regard 0 as\nequal, on the average, to no less than one-half. This means, for example,\nthat, if the U.S. price of export goods falls by 10 per cent, equilibrium will\nbe re-established when the foreign price has fallen by no less than 5 per cent.\n\nY?

The evidence suggests that, if long-run adjustment is considered, most\nnonagricultural goods will have price elasticities of demand close to unity or\nabove. The demand elasticities for farm products appear to be substantially\nlower. These estimates will be overstatements of the price elasticities to be\nused here in that they include a wider range of substitution effects. Another\nbias, however, will work in the opposite direction. Consumption which was\nnot part of the same market as U.S. output may enter as export prices fall.\nAnd consumption which is initially in the same market as imports may\nleave as import prices rise.\n\nA number of economists, beginning with Nerlove [7], have calculated\nlong-run supply elasticities for individual farm products substantially in\nexcess of unity. For nonfarm commodities the elasticities are undoubtedly\nmuch higher since a smaller proportion of the inputs are dependent upon\nnatural resources. Again, however, these estimates will overvalue the sup-\nply elasticities we wish to obtain, in that the production of all export and\nimport goods will change. And they will tend to undervalue the elasticities\nbecause no allowance is made for increases or decreases in the size of the\nmarket as prices vary. The parameters \u00f3, and 0, represent the abilities of\nthe U.S. and foreign economies to shift resources between the production of\ndomestic and international goods. The domestic supply elasticity of a\ncountry's import goods will be greater, the smaller the share of international\ngoods in total output. The supply elasticity of U.S. exports will be larger,\nthe greater the initial degree of unemployment.\n\nIf available statistical estimates of the demand and supply elasticities are\nused, there is some chance that the degree of overvaluation will be under-\n\n(10)\n"], "6": ["Of4  Ous Ofz\u00e1\n\nXi Xi; Ou\n\nwhere Ow,; and Of,; are the domestic and foreign outputs of the ith good.\nThe data sources give the ratios by commodity of U.S. production to ex-\nports for about 60 per cent of the value of goods exported.

The\nratios of free-world value added, again excluding the United States, to value\nadded in the United States by broad industrial classification were obtained\nfrom the same source. For about 90 per cent of the value of exports these\nratios exceed unity.\n\nA problem arises with respect to the empirical application of these ratios.\nProduction in certain areas of the world may not be in the same market as\nU.S. output. That is, transportation costs may exceed the price difference\nbetween the United States and other areas. A small variation in export\nprices may not affect prices in these separated areas.

Similarly, an im-\nprovement in the terms of trade abroad may increase the fraction of money\nincome saved and reduce aggregate demand.* Of the three influences out-\nlined above, the trade-balance effect is likely to dominate in the present\nproblem. Because of the unimportance of the international sectors in the\nUnited States and the rest of the world as a whole, the effect of a devalua-\ntion on real money balances would be small. Since imports are a small frac-\ntion of domestic income and exports a small fraction of foreign income, the\neffects of changes in the terms of trade are also likely to be small. On the\nother hand, as this paper will show, the effects of a devaluation on the trade\nbalance will be substantial.\n\nThe ultimate change in aggregate demand and its effect on the balance\nof trade will depend on two circumstances: the presence or absence of full\nemployment and price flexibility, and the monetary and fiscal policies of\nthe governments involved. Assuming less than full employment and no ofi-\nsetting government policy in the United States, the rise in aggregate demand\nwill increase both real output and interest rates.5 In the absence of price\nflexibility and offsetting monetary and fiscal policy abroad, interest rates\nand real output will decline. The demand for U.S. imports will increase and\nthe demand for exports will decline, moderating the effect of the devalua-\ntion. Full employment can be established at home and maintained abroad\nby alternative combinations of monetary and fiscal policy. The greater the\nU.S. government's reliance on fiscal policy and the foreign reliance on mone-\ntary policy, the greater will be the rise in domestic relative to foreign in-\nterest rates. A rise in interest rates at home relative to abroad would bring\nabout a capital inflow into the United States.\n\nFor purposes of subsequent analysis two working assumptions are\nadopted: (1) the U.S. government applies a combination of monetary and\nfiscal policy which will bring about full employment, maintain interest\nrates at their initial level, and finance any change in demand for nominal\nmoney balances resulting from the rise in the prices of import and export\ngoods; and (2) foreign governments offset the balance-of-trade and terms-\nof-trade effects on aggregate demand by fiscal policy, reduce the money sup-\nply sufficiently to eliminate the excess demand or supply of real money\nbalances resulting from the declines in export and import goods prices,\nand thereby maintain the initial level of interest rates. Foreign incomes and\ninterest rates are thus unaffected by the supposed devaluation. In the\nUnited States, interest rates remain unchanged and output increases until\nall resources are fully employed. Since under these assumptions capital flows\n\n* Much will depend upon whether the community views the real income effect of changes in\nthe terms of trade as permanent or temporary.

Existing\nstatistical studies will be drawn upon in estimating the demand and supply\nelasticities for export and import goods. The ratios of domestic and foreign\nconsumption and production to exports and imports will be calculated from\ndata provided by the World Trade Information Service. At every juncture\nan attempt will be made to ensure that the errors are in the direction of\noverstating the degree of overvaluation.\n\nI. Analytical Framework\n\nThe effects of a devaluation on the balance of payments can be divided\ninto two parts: its effects on capital flows and on the balance of trade. The\nformer will arise from changes in expectations and in domestic interest\nrates relative to foreign interest rates. A devaluation may affect the values\nof exports and imports in three ways: by raising the prices of foreign goods\nrelative to domestic goods, by changing domestic and foreign real incomes,\nand by stimulating capital flows. Real incomes will be altered by movements\nin the terms of trade and changes in the level of output and employment.\nRelative prices will be changed by variation of the exchange rate and\nmovements in domestic and foreign price levels. The trade balance will be\naffected by a capital flow to the extent that the transfer is financed partly\nout of imports in the country losing capital and spent partly on imports\nin the recipient country.\n\nAt constant aggregate demand, the demand function for exports and\nsupply function for imports in domestic currency will shift upward by the\namount of the devaluation. The higher the elasticities of demand for exports\nand imports, the more favorable will be the effect of the devaluation on the\ntrade balance? Lower supply elasticities imply a less favorable effect on the\ntrade balance when the elasticities of demand exceed unity.\n\nAggregate demand may be affected by a devaluation in three ways. First,\nthe rise in the domestic prices of import and export goods will reduce the\nreal money balances of the public. Assuming that the public's desired level\nof real cash balances has not changed, this will lead to an attempted conver-\nsion of real and financial assets into money. Interest rates will rise and\naggregate demand will fall. Similarly, the fall in the prices of internationally\ntraded goods abroad will result in an excess of actual over desired real\nmoney holdings, reducing interest rates and increasing aggregate demand.\nA rise (or fall) in the prices of internationally traded goods may also have\na wealth effect on the demand for money in that the real value of the com-\nmunities! holdings of government bonds and note issue has fallen (or risen).\nSecond, there will be an increase in domestic aggregate demand and a fall\nin foreign aggregate demand as a direct consequence of an improvement in\nthe trade balance. Later empirical evidence will justify an assumption at\nthis point that a devaluation of the dollar will improve the trade balance.\nFinally, a deterioration of the terms of trade of the United States and the\n\n3 The demand elasticities include the real income effects of changes in the terms of trade at\nconstant output and employment.\n"], "1": ["The Overvaluation of the Dollar: A Note on the\nInternational Price Mechanism\n\nDuring the past few years it has become clear that the U.S. dollar is over-\nvalued. The extent of the resulting deficit is indicated by average annual\nincreases in foreign holdings of liquid dollar assets and sales of monetary\ngold of between $3 and $3.5 billion over the period 1958-62. An estimate\nof the degree of overvaluation using the purchasing-power-parity approach\nhas been constructed by H. S. Houthakker [5], who concludes that the dol-\nlar is overvalued with respect to the major European currencies by 20 per\ncent. This paper presents an alternative upper-limit estimate of the magni-\ntude of the existing exchange-rate disequilibrium and concludes that an\novervaluation of more than 10 per cent is highly implausible. It also pro-\nvides evidence that, aside from speculative forces, the foreign exchange\nmarket will be highly stable.\n\nOur procedure will be to construct a model of the effects of a devaluation\non the balance of payments and to develop estimates of the parameters in\nthis model. An estimate of the overvaluation, or the magnitude of devalua-\ntion which would be required to close the apparent deficit, can then be calcu-\nlated. The major problem is that of obtaining estimates of the demand and\nsupply elasticities of exports and imports. Most of the existing statistical\nestimates of the demand elasticities for imports and exports are subject to\nsevere downward bias, and estimates of the elasticities of supply of exports\nand imports are, as far as I know, nonexistent.? There are, however, more\nreliable estimates of the domestic supply and demand elasticities of particu-\nlar goods. This paper will make use of the fact that a country's elasticities\nof demand for imports and supply of exports depend upon the domestic sup-\nply and demand elasticities for the goods in question and upon the ratios of\n\n1 Kenen [6] presents an excellent discussion of the problems involved in estimating the de-\ngree of disequilibrium.\n\n? The downward bias in the demand elasticities stems from two main sources. First, since\nthe demand for imports is the excess of the domestic demand over the domestic supply of im-\nport goods, the quantity demanded will be a function of the domestic supply conditions as\nwell as relative prices and incomes. Failure to take shifts of the supply function into considera-\ntion results in statistical estimates of the price elasticity of demand for imports which are too\nlow. Second, in the great majority of the estimates, no attempts were made to incorporate long-\nrun adjustment into the statistical models. Since domestic supply of import goods is likely to\nrespond fully to price changes only after a considerable lag, the omission of long-run adjust-\nment is likely to result in a substantial downward bias of the price elasticity of demand for im-\nports. Estimates which used data for the interwar period were further hampered by lack of\nvariability of prices relative to incomes. More detailed discussion of these issues is given by\nOrcutt [8] and Harberger [2] [3]. More recently a study by Ball and Mavwah [1] of the\nU. S. demand for imports has incorporated long-run adjustment and utilized data for the\npostwar period.\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["John E.

In Canada the median ratio is 100 per cent, indicating equal effec-\ntiveness of labor. That the median is a good representative of all responses is\nshown by the fact that 93 per cent of the 71 observations fall within 15 per-\ncentage points (i.e., between 85 and 115 per cent) of the median. For Europe\nthe labor input ratio is 120 per cent,5 with 88 per cent of all observations fall-\ning within 20 percentage points of the median. The Latin American median\nof 130 per cent is also a fairly good representative of all responses. But in the\nunderdeveloped countries of Africa and Asia, the ratio varies between 115 and\n500 per cent, and the median of 175 is not representative. Also, the number of\nobservations there is quite small.\n\nLack of education and inadequate skill and experience appear to be the\npredominant reasons for the differential in most underdeveloped areas, followed\nclosely by lack of motivation and drive. In most European countries, the\ntraining, motivation and \"union rules\" factors play an important role, while\nin Germany the most frequent reason offered is mental inflexibility and desire\nto achieve perfection beyond what is required.\n\nThis comparison applies to a composite of the labor skills employed by the\nresponding companies, and no attempt was made to classify workers into the\nbroad categories suggested in Leontief's second article [5, table 2]. It should\nbe noted in this connection that such a breakdown cannot be dissociated from\nthe amount and intensity of the capital used. The number of engineers relative\nto that of unskilled workers employed by a company is often a function of the\nlevel of sophistication of its capital equipment.\n\nIV.

Main Results\n\nTable 1 presents the results of the survey, pertaining to all countries. It\nshows that U.S. labor is indeed superior to its foreign counterpart, but the\nsuperiority is nowhere near the level suggested by Leontief. Neither is it suffi-\ncient to \"convert\" the United States into a labor-abundant country. A realistic\nfactor by which to multiply the number of U.S. workers in order to allow for\nthe difference in effectiveness is 114 or at most 114, but not 2 or 3.\n\nTable 2 presents a frequency distribution of the reasons offered by the re-\nspondents for the differences. The total number of reasons does not coincide\nwith the number of observations because the companies indicating a labor\ninput ratio of 100 per cent did not give any reasons, while many other firms\noffered several reasons. The most common explanations for the relative in-\nferiority of foreign labor are inadequate training and skill (code number 2),\nlack of proper motivation and drive (number 4), and low level of education\n(1). Also important are lack of discipline (number 5), union work rules (8),\nexcessive job security (9), and inflexible attitude (3).\n\nThere are significant variations between countries and regions in the foreign/\nU.S. labor input ratio, and in the reasons advanced by responding firms (Tables\n\n*Some respondents in Europe indicated a reverse attitude on the part of managerial per-\nsonnel who prefer indigenous over foreign companies.\n", "Many of the 244 firms which supplied usable data had plants in two or\nmore countries, yielding a total of 367 observations. A wide array of products\nand industries is covered in the comparison, and the number of countries repre-\nsented exceeds 30. Canada, Europe, and Latin America are the areas appear-\ning in the greatest frequency.\n\n(Three points must be made before presenting the results. First, inter-\ncountries comparisons are sometimes overshadowed by the large differences in\nlabor effectiveness within countries. The great variations between northern and\nsouthern Italy illustrate the point. Nevertheless, this reservation does not pre-\nclude the use of some representative figure for the country. Second, the labor\nemployed in U.S. subsidiaries abroad may not be representative of the general\nlabor force of a nation. Particularly in underdeveloped areas it may be above\naverage, either because labor is attracted to U.S. firms* or because these firms\nare more selective in their recruitment practices and spend more time and\nmoney on the initial training. Since the questionnaire specifically inquired\nabout such cases, and also gathered data on recruitment and training, it was\npossible to allow for this factor in the analysis. In tabulating the results, the\ncomparison of the general labor forces was used when it deviated from the one\npertaining to the individual company because of the reasons stated above.\nThirdly, it was not always possible to isolate out the management factor. In\n$5 observations (7 per cent of the cases) ability of management and the effec-\ntiveness of the organization was given as one of the reasons for the differences\nin labor effectiveness. Interestingly enough, some of these firms indicated that\nthis reason accounts for half the differences between the American and the\nforeign labor, while the characteristics of the workers are responsible for the\nother half.\n", "134\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "3": ["Number of Firms\n", "Reason: Number of Firms\n\nHave no overseas production facilities 446\nManufacture only abroad and not in the U.S. 15\nHave no direct control over foreign operations (e.g., produce only on a\nlicense or contract basis) 76\nOperations not comparable (either product line or productive process) 37\nInformation not available 45\nCompany has a standing policy against responding to such requests; has no\nstaff to fill questionnaire 26\nProducing abroad for too short a period to draw conclusions 24\nTOTAL 669\n\n?'The survey thus demonstrates a method of obtaining directly from business firms in-\nformation relevant to economic problems. I suspect that one reason for the relatively high\nresponse rate was business interest in the results, as evidenced by the large number of\nrespondents who requested a copy of the findings.\n\n* Most firms find it easier to recruit workers in the United States than in Europe be-\ncause of the labor shortage prevailing there. It is also easier to recruit skilled workers in\nthe United States than in Latin America, but the reverse is true for unskilled labor. In\nCanada, conditions are similar to those prevailing in the United States.\n\nWith respect to the duration and the cost on training workers, the responses varied a\ngreat deal within each geographical area, and no consistent trend could be established.\n", "on time-motion studies (made for the purpose of establishing wage-incentive\nsystems), such responses cannot be taken lightly.? Moreover, only a fair degree\nof accuracy may suffice to establish or reject Leontief's contention, and the\nfigures would be revealing even if subject to a high margin of error.\n\nIL. The Survey\n\nA directory of U.S. firms operating abroad [1] was used to identify names\nand addresses of possible respondents. After excluding all nonproducing or-\nganizations, such as advertising agencies, law and accounting firms, brokers,\nand insurance and finance companies, questionnaires were sent to about 2000\ncompanies. An individually typed, personally signed cover letter accompanied\neach questionnaire, explaining in detail the intent of the inquiry and assuring\nconfidential handling of the material. Firms were requested to compare the\nlabor time required per unit of output in their operations here and abroad\nunder similar organization and degree of mechanization, and to state the rea-\nsons for any differences. They were then asked whether the comparison applied\nto the labor force in general or only to their particular firm. If the latter was\nthe case, they were asked to supply the reasons for the difference. Finally, they\nwere requested to compare the general labor forces in the United States and\nthe foreign country. These questions were supplemented by inquiries concern-\ning the relative ease of recruiting employees and of training them here and\nabroad. Part of the questionnaire is reproduced in the Appendix.\n\nAltogether, 913 replies were received. Evidently, the Directory used con-\ntained many companies which merely do business, but have no production\nfacilities, abroad. Consequently, 669 of the respondents did not supply the\nnecessary information, for the following reasons:\n", "133\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "2": ["I. Comparative Labor Effectiveness\n\nThis paper is devoted to an empirical examination of Leontief's hypothesis\nconcerning the superiority of U.S. labor. The problem does not easily lend\nitself to statistical measurement because of the difficulty of isolating the\nquality of labor from other factors a\u00edfecting productivity. The degree of\nmechanization, the volume of production, and the length of the production\nruns must be held constant. (The last two factors are important in determining\nproductivity [9, chap. 10] [8], but they have a strong influence on the degree\nof mechanization [9, p. 56].) And the alleged superiority of U.S. manage-\nment and organization, which Leontief emphasized, is admissible only if it\nincreases the productivity of U.S. labor much more than it raises the efficiency\nof U.S. capital. Since no such a priori assumption can be made, this factor\nshould also be kept equal.\n\nThus, it is necessary to compare labor effectiveness here and abroad under\nrestrictive ceteris paribus assumptions. Leontief's contention *could be proved,\nif it could be shown that there are cases where the amount of capital employed\nper unit of a product is the same in America and some representative country\nabroad, and that that of labor is three times as much in the latter than in the\nformer.\" [2, p. 41]. In addition to testing this proposition, the labor-effective-\nness comparison would be of general interest to business and academic econo-\nmists. However, one reservation must be borne in mind. Even the \"isolated\"\nlabor-effectiveness factor does not have a \"neat\" bearing on the Leontief ex-\nplanation because the shortage of skilled workers sometimes forces the use of\nless sophisticated machinery.\n\nFor the purpose of making the comparison it was decided to rely on the\ninformed judgment of managers and engineers who are familiar with produc-\ntion conditons here and abroad. A wealth of information is available to com-\npanies operating subsidiaries in one or more foreign countries. Although their\nU.S. and foreign plants (producing similar products) often vary in organization\nand degree of mechanization, firms can be asked to **hold these factors con-\nstant\" and concentrate on the characteristics of the labor force. This point is\nillustrated in the following quotations from one respondent:\n\nDue to the fact that the equipment used in our overseas plants is on a\nless sophisticated basis than that used in our Stateside plants, it is a bit\ndifficult to eliminate this difference and end up, as you state, with just the\nqualities of the labor force. I shall attempt to evaluate this to the best of\nmy ability, and I do feel that from my travels and knowledge of the\nworking forces of our various plants that I do have a good basis for\nevaluation.\n\nTo be sure such an evaluation can provide only a rough order of magnitude.\nBut if many managers and engineers of companies producing diverse products\nprovide consistent answers, and when a fair proportion of the replies is based\n\n*Although aggregate production functions can embody a variable representing labor\neffectiveness, outside information is necessary to establish the reasons for variations in that\nfactor.

Since the United States is\nknown to have a far higher capital/labor ratio than its trading partners, this\nfinding contradicts the basic Ohlin model which explains international trade\nin terms of relative factor endowments. Under it a country would export those\nproducts which are intensive in its relatively abundant resource and import\nthose which are intensive in its relatively scarce resource.\n\nA wealth of statistical and theoretical material has been published in the\npast decade in an attempt to reconcile the empirical finding with the Heck-\nScher-Ohlin theorem. Leontief himself maintained that the explanation lies in\nthe superiority of U.S. labor. If with a given quantity of capital, one man-year\nof U.S. labor is equivalent to, say, three man-years of foreign labor, then the\nU.S. labor force must be multiplied by three in comparing the relative amounts\nof labor and capital with that of foreign countries. That would mean that in\n1960 the U.S. labor force numbered not 70 but 210 million of \"equivalent\"\nforeign man-years, making it a relatively labor-abundant country.

Staller defined planned economies as\nthose *whose means of production are owned predominantly by the state and\nwhose economic activities are directed pursuant to an over-all plan?

It is certainly agreed by them that at least in 1958 (it\nnot today) coverage was suboptimal. A fortiori, from Lees and Rice's figures,\nthere was a large welfare loss in 1948. It follows that the institution of uni-\nversal health insurance in 1948 would have led to a considerable increase in\nwelfare over the subsequent decade, as compared with the alternative actually\nfollowed. Given some discounting of the future, acceleration of insurance dif-\nfusion through government intervention would appear justified on welfare\ngrounds.? To paraphrase the authors! last sentence, the relevant criticism of\ngovernment health insurance would seem to be not that it would not accom-\nplish its purposes, but that its success is incompatible with the attainment of\nsome other objectives.\n\nTn any case, policy determination ought not to be replaced by trend extrap-\nolations. The present coverage, more or less satisfactory as it may be, was\nachieved not as the spontaneous resultant of many individual self-seeking\ndecisions in the classical picture of the competitive market, but by the de-\nliberate large-scale institutional innovations of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield\nplans, motivated, at least in part, by the desire to head off government in-\nsurance. One might indeed expect, on the basis of the Lees-Rice analysis,\nthat the asymptotic coverage will vary among different elements of the popu-\nlation according to the administrative costs of arranging for the insurance;\nand the group arrangements needed for economical administration under the\nexisting system must surely militate against those elements, such as migratory\nworkers or the aged, less capable of being formed into administratively con-\nvenient groups.

But this solution is possible only\nif the road-provision firms each take in a larger territory (this is analogous\nto the economies of group insurance contracts and the resulting diminution of\nchoice by the individual insured). It may finally be realized that considerable\neconomy can be effected by charging each car according to its mileage (meas-\nured, perhaps, by gasoline purchases or tire wear), but the economy can only\nbe achieved by complete financial unification of the road system. The operat-\ning institution could be an unregulated private monopoly, but the resulting\nallocative inefficiency and power concentration may be felt to be intolerable;\nit could be a regulated monopoly; it could be a voluntary association of road\nusers; or it could be the government. The coercive powers of government per-\nmit certain economies in the collection process, which might weigh strongly\nin the final choice. But in any case the existence of transaction costs totally\nor partially eliminable by consolidation of firms works against the preserva-\ntion of the usual competitive market.\n", "157\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["But a system of reimbursement for the costs of specific treatments to specific\nindividuals requires a great deal more record-keeping than the British system\nof unlimited coverage of the patient and er caput payment to physicians.\n\nQuantitatively even more significant are selling costs. In this context, it is\nnoteworthy that Lees and Rice make no reference to the observation [1,\np. 963] that expenses constitute more than 50 per cent of total premium in-\ncome for individual policies, and less than 10 per cent for group policies. Here\nis a most remarkable direct measure of the variation of transaction costs at-\ntributable to changes in the method of payment.\n\nThe authors may object to my equating group policies with governmentally\noperated health insurance. They could properly argue that group policies are\nin fact the optimum response of the market to the presence of increasing re-\nturns in selling insurance. But I think the force of this point is seriously\nweakened by two considerations. The first simply meets the argument on its\nown level; since it is clear that the economies of scale to group policies can\nbe at least equaled by a universal system, the presence of any individual\npolicies points to some degree of nonoptimality in the system.\n\nThe second leads into deeper problems and perhaps to a clarification of the\nclassical welfare economics case for government intervention. The very exist-\nence of group contracts represents a restriction on the freedom of the market;\nthe individual employee (if the group is composed of the employees of a firm)\nis essentially faced with a monopoly. Even on a larger scale, the Blue Cross-\nBlue Shield network is by no stretch of the imagination an example of a com-\npetitive market in health insurance. On the other hand, it would clearly be\nincorrect to regard it as a profit-maximizing monopoly. What has happened is\nthat a voluntary association has essentially played the role of a surrogate\ngovernment. Just as urged by classical welfare economics, the failure of the\nmarket has been met by the development of an organization which departs\nsignificantly from the competitive system; but what has not usually been\nrecognized is that other organizations than the state may fill the optimality\ngap. (This point, as applied to the medical profession itself rather than to\nhealth insurance, is, after all, the main thesis of my paper.)\n\n\"These remarks may be clarified by considering an analogous problem. Sup-\npose the provision of roads is left strictly to private enterprise. Consider in\nparticular a system of local roads, each having many intersections with other\nroads in the system. Since each stretch of road between intersections is a\nseparate service, the road providers might logically think of charging a sepa-\nrate price for each. But there is a transaction cost; the collection of tolls\nrequires a man with a booth, or at least a mechanical device of some sort. To\nearn normal profits, the price charged to the consumer must exceed that re-\nceived by the seller. It can happen that the individual consumer will find it\ncheaper to build his own roads across his property, especially since he also\nsaves the buyer's cost of delay at the toll booths. Just as in Lees and Rice's\ncomments, this is a rational response on the part of individuals, but it does\nnot follow in any way that it is a socially optimal outcome (in the usual\nPareto sense). The road providers may seek to economize on toll collection\ncosts by having the booths more widely separated, at the expense of some\n", "156\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "2": ["I\n\nIn stressing the importance of transaction costs, the authors have per-\nformed a great service by stressing a difficult and neglected area in welfare\n(and for that matter in descriptive) economics. It is somewhat surprising,\nhowever, that the explicit recognition of the costs of private marketing should\nbe regarded as an argument against alternative modes of resource allocation.\n\nWhat is clearly needed is a deeper analysis of the causes of transaction\ncosts. It is not only their existence but their escapability under alternative\ninstitutional arrangements that is crucial to the normative discussion. Lees\nand Rice's discussion of buyers! costs [2, Sec. I] brings out the issue clearly;\nthe costs are those '*of completing and filing applications and claims, paying\npremiums, keeping records, etc., as well as possible costs of obtaining informa-\ntion.\" Unless one knew the context, he might be forgiven for supposing this\nwas an argument for the British national health system, in which all these\ncosts disappear.\n\nWhy should a household engage in the production of a commodity which\nis also available from a firm specializing in its production? The household\nmight, of course, be simply more efficient in production; but for risk-averters,\nthis reason is hardly applicable to the present case, since an insurance carrier,\nwhich pools many risks, is necessarily more efficient than any individual\nhousehold bearing only its own risks. The alternative explanation is that there\nis a gap between the price received by the producer and that paid by the\nhousehold for the product, with the marginal cost of production to the house-\nhold lying somewhere in between. It is this gap which constitutes the transac-\ntion costs (sum of seller's and buyer's costs), and which must be studied more\nclosely.\n\nThe transaction cost may represent a real cost independent of the method\nof market organization, for example, transportation cost. The washing of the\nfamily dishes is likely to be specialized to the household; a professional dish-\nwasher may well be more efficient, but his superior efficiency is outweighed\nby the cost of transporting either him to the dishes or the dishes to him. Al-\nternatively, transaction costs may inhere in a particular mode of economic\norganization, and may be avoided by switching to a different system. In the\npresent case, doubtless some part of the administrative costs of a health in-\nsurance system are unavoidable under any mode of payment and ownership.\n", "position, it is clear that their proposition is broadly true, and will be accepted\nfor the purposes of this discussion; as they make clear, it is certainly con-\nsistent with, and to some extent implied by, my paper [1].\n\nThe issue between us concerns the normative implications of this proposi-\ntion. As against a presumption on my part that the failure of health insurance\nto reach a virtually complete coverage is an indication of nonoptimality, they\npresent two significant arguments: (1) because of the presence of sellers! and\nbuyers! costs, optimal allocation would call for less than universal coverage;\n(2) in any case, the coverage is in fact increasing rapidly, so that the welfare\nlosses are in fact transitory, an inevitable lag in response to product innova-\ntions.

Jerome L.

For an economy with idle resources, he\nconcludes, a free exchange market is more efficient than a stabilized exchange\nmarket if the balance of payments tends towards deficits in periods of output\ncontraction and surpluses in periods of output expansion; on the other hand,\na stabilized exchange market is more efficient than a free exchange market, if\nthe balance of payments tends towards surpluses in periods of output con-\ntraction and deficits in periods of output expansion.

The explanation lies in the change in composition of\nGroup III. No data on fluctuations of adjusted \"material\" output are available for Norway\nand Sweden. Thus Ross's Group III consists of only three countries: France, Netherlands,\nand Yugoslavia. If we make any reasonable estimate of fluctuations in the adjusted *ma-\nterial\" outputs of Norway and Sweden (based on the known fluctuations of unadjusted\noutputs), the means for Group III drop below the corresponding means in Group IV (they\nare about 4.8 for Method 1 and 4.4 for Method 2).\n", "A report submitted in 1957 to the Congress of Workers' Councils stated\n\n.. . freedom for each undertaking on the market in no way means that it\ncan act in isolation or arbitrarily, nor does society waive its right to di-\nrect production according to a plan in order to meet such needs as have\narisen. Freedom for the undertaking consists in the statutory definition\nof its rights as regards production, trade, and distribution. . . . But this\nmarket is subject to conscientious social direction [5, p. 36].*\n\nThus the Yugoslav economy should be looked upon as either sui generis and\nleft out of consideration or classified in the planned group. But no matter how\nwe classify Yugoslavia, Ross's Table 2 does not present \"far less conclusive\nsupport\" of my findings. The fluctuations means of his Group IV, with or\nwithout Yugoslavia, turn out in all eight \"tests\" markedly higher than the\nmeans of other groups.? The question of stability within Groups I to III (my\nfree-market group) present a separate problem which, perhaps, should be in-\nvestigated. If one accepted Ross's approach, the results of his questionnaire\nwould suggest that *for the countries in Groups I, II, and III, there is no\ncorrelation between the degree of central planning and the degree of fluctua-\ntion\"; I never said there was.

What is the difference between *no,\" *low,\" and *mod-\nerate\" degree of central planning? What time period does Ross refer to? This\nwas not specified in his questionnaire. The modus operandi of each of the two\neconomies Ross chose to discuss, Yugoslavia and France, was significantly\ndifferent in the \"fifties compared to the fall of 1964, when the questionnaires\nreached the respondents. In 1955 Yugoslavia was just completing a program of\nreforms leading to freer markets? while France was extending its planning\nactivities.\n\nProfessor Ross's handling of statistical results derived from his question-\nnaires is as puzzling as the questionnaire itself. He does not specify his\nmethod of using the scores to divide the countries into groups. Yugoslavia is\nclassified in Group III because *'it scored 3.22\u2014 closer to three than to four.\"\nBy the same token, Group I should be composed of only Ireland and Canada,\nthe only two countries whose scores are closer to one than to two (see Table\n1). When equal-size intervals are used for classification, Group III ranges\nfrom 2.51 to 3.25; four countries cluster at the lower end of the interval\n(Sweden 2.55, Netherlands 2.57, Norway 2.57, and France 2.59), while\nYugoslavia stands alone at the upper end (3.22). Little support can be found\nin Table 1 for Ross's claim that there is general agreement\" that Yugoslavia\nshould be included in Group III with the other four countries? The Table\ndoes show, however, that the scores representing the \"degree of central plan-\nning\" exhibit, except for Yugoslavia, only one important discontinuity: be-\ntween France (2.59) and Poland (3.86). This points to the advisability of\nclassifying the countries in Ross's Groups I, II, and III in one group, and\nthe countries in Group IV in another group. Such classification is identical with\nthe one I used in my paper.\n\nYugoslavia deserves further consideration. There is no doubt that the coun-\ntry moved away from the Soviet planning model during the first half of the\n\"\u00fcifties. But when the Yugoslavs themselves wrote about their *free Socialist\nmarket,\" they described a market which was freer than during the First Five\nYear Plan (1947-51), or freer than the markets in Soviet-bloc economies.\nDuring the 1950 to 1960 period, the Yugoslav government maintained a de-\ngree of control over the economy never exercised by the governments of the\n\"free market\" economies. As Vice-President Kardelj put it:\n\nOur free market is a conditional term . . . it must be understood that the\nfree formation of prices under our conditions means forming them on the\nbasis of supply and demand within the general proportions of the plan\n[6, pp. 147-48].\n", "162\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "1": ["Fluctuations in Economic Activity: Planned and\nFree-Market Economies, 1950-60: Reply\n\nThe multidimensional character of such concepts as \"free market\" and\n\"economic planning\" and the classificational difficulties connected with them\nhave been thoroughly discussed in the literature.

That, in essence, is the\nbasis of the criterion used for evaluating the relative desirability of fixed and\nfreely flexible exchange rates.\n\nThe rest follows readily. Since, by assumption, no adjustment in the time\npath of absorption takes place under a fixed exchange-rate system, the relative\ndesirability of the fixed and the flexible exchange-rate systems depends en-\ntirely on how exchange fluctuations in the latter system affect the time path\nof absorption.

Now, the three\n\"types\" of economy considered by Stein are distinguished from one another\nby the way output fluctuations are associated with exchange fluctuations in a\nflexible exchange-rate system.

Comments on Stein's \"Specific Model\"\n\nAs indicated earlier, Stein uses his general model\" (which considers an z-\nperiod horizon and assumes no specific form for the functional relationships\npostulated in the model) to outline his approach to the problem of the op-\ntimum foreign exchange market, but relies on a \"specific model\" (assuming a\ntwo-period horizon and specific functional relationships) to derive his con-\nclusions. At the core of the \"specific model\" is a social-utility function as-\nsumed to be of the following form:\n\nV \u2014 ln 2105,\n\nwhich states that the index of social utility (4) is measured by the natural\nlogarithm of the product of the real absorptions in periods one and two (a;\nand a;).\n\nIt is easy to see that the function is characterized by a unitary elasticity of\nsubstitution between the absorptions in the two periods; that is to say, the\nsociety's time preference for absorption in the two periods is assumed to be\nsuch that the marginal rate of substitution is always equal to the ratio of the\nabsorptions in the two periods. On the other hand, the structural equations (in-\ncluding the balance-of-payments constraint) imply that the marginal rate of\ntransformation\" between the absorptions in the two periods is unity.* Given\nthese characteristics of the social-utility function and the structural equations,\n\n*Solution of the system of the structual equations gives a; J- a; \u2014 k(yi* -- y;*), where\na; and a; are the real absorptions, y;* and y;* the real outputs, in the two periods, and k a\nfunction of the parameters in the structural equations.\n\nThis reduced form of the structural equations also shows that, in attempting to simplify\nthe \"ideal price line\" and plot it on two-dimensional diagrams, Stein has made an inad-\nmissible assumption that the mean value of y;* and y;* be zero (p. 392). As the reduced\nform shows, the assumption implies that the sum of the absorptions in the two periods must\nalso be zero, which clearly contradicts the logarithmic form of the postulated social-utility\nfunction. As will become clear in a moment, the assumption also makes it impossible to\nfulfill the necessary condition for a maximum, except when the absorptions in both periods\nare equal to zero.\n", "rate as the only policy instrument, makes it difficult to reconcile the payments\nconstraint with the objective of welfare maximization. The payments con-\nstraint is a meaningful postulate, calling attention to the often-neglected fact\nthat no nation could indefinitely spend beyond what it can produce with its\nown resources. It should definitely be retained as an integral part of the\ntheory. On the other hand, in order to preserve the internal consistency of the\ntheory, I would suggest an expansion of the model to bring in policy instru-\nments other than the exchange rate, such that a reduction in gold reserve will\nbe shown as always resulting in an improvement, never a deterioration, in\nthe national welfare. Thus expanded\u2014 perhaps also to take into account mul-\ntiple policy objectives\u2014the analysis will no doubt become more complex, and\nthe conclusions less clear-cut, than what has been presented. However, my\nhunch is that the task should not be unmanageable. In any case, I cannot see\nany real alternative to it.\n", "168\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "4": ["and other policy measures may vitiate a judgment on the relative desirability\nof alternative exchange markets based on a consideration of the exchange-rate\npolicy alone.\n\nFor instance, for a *Keynesian conflict economy,\" a flexible exchange rate\nis found to be more efficient than a fixed exchange rate, because the former\ntends to stabilize the level of absorption, thus more closely fulfilling the nec-\nessary condition for an optimum than the latter. However, in a broader frame-\nwork of analysis, it is quite possible that the same objective may be more\nefficiently attained by a combination of monetary and fiscal measures which\nwill stabilize the level of absorption without the countervailing *terms-of-trade\neffect\" of exchange-rate fluctuations. Furthermore, it is also likely that the\ncountercyclical fiscal and monetary policy may be more effective under a\nfixed exchange-rate system than under a flexible exchange-rate system, when,\nfor instance, the effect of exchange-rate fluctuation on domestic price stability\nis also taken into consideration. In that case, Stein's conclusion, based on a\npartial theory of economic policy, will have to be reversed.?\n\nThirdly, the balance-of-payments constraint postulated in the theory needs\nscrutiny. Stein explains that, since all foreign assets are assumed to consist\nof monetary gold yielding no interest, balance of payments equilibrium\" re-\nquires that there is no net accumulation or decumulation of gold over the\nentire time horizon. But, that is a 0n sequitur. Holding gold may yield no\nrevenue to the nation; it does not follow that gold must be disposed of at any\ncost. That in his theory a disposal of gold may involve a cost to the nation\nis explicitly recognized by Stein himself. He shows (p. 390) that, since the\nexchange rate is the only policy instrument under consideration, a decumula-\ntion of previously accumulated gold must be effected through an exchange ap-\npreciation, which in the Keynesian case of underemployment will result in a\nreduction in output, absorption, and hence in total social utility. In this case,\nthe nation would obviously be better off retaining the accumulated gold, and\nan exact fulfillment of the constraint would mean a failure to maximize na-\ntional welfare. That is, the assumption of the payments constraint is in an\nimportant instance inconsistent with the fundamental postulate of utility\nmaximization.*\n\nMy demur rests not with the rationale of the payments constraint, but with\nthe restrictiveness of the structural model, which, by considering the exchange\n\n? Stein is not unaware of the pitfalls of a truncated approach to rational decision-making.\nIn a section on \"the global maximum social utility,\" he considers the case in which both the\nreal output and the exchange rate are subject to policy control. He shows convincingly that\nthe optimum exchange rate and the optimum output must be simultaneously determined,\nand that the \"global maximum\" cannot be attained by arbitrarily fixing the exchange rate\nand adjusting the real output. By the same reasoning, it may be argued, adjusting the ex-\nchange rate to a given output would bring about the \"global maximum\" only if the given\noutput happened to be the *optimum output.\"\n\n* This may be constrasted to the budget constraint postulated in the Hicksian theory of\nconsumer demand. The consumer in the Hicksian theory will maximize utility only by\ncarrying his spending to the limit of the constraint, ie., by spending his entire income.\nFor, by assumption, spending involves no cost; it can only augment but never diminish\ntotal satisfaction. In contrast, as shown above, getting rid of gold reserve may be costly\nto the nation's welfare in Stein's theory.\n", "167\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["tion is given to the costs of international trade and investment under the two\ntypes of exchange-rate systems. And, since it assumes no international lending\nand borrowing, the crucial question of the behavior of international capital\nmovement under the alternative exchange-rate systems is also ignored.\n\nOne must concede, however, that a theory may be perfectly meaningful\neven though it explores only one particular aspect of a complex problem. To\nthe extent that it succeeds in throwing a new light on that aspect, it enhances\nour understanding of the problem. Perhaps intertemporal resource allocation\nis an aspect that has not received sufficient attention from the participants to\nthe controversy. Let us then start from Stein's own ground and examine\nwhether his model is appropriate or adequate for analyzing that problem.\n\nFirst, it may be observed that, whereas the *'time path of absorption\" sug-\ngests an essentially dynamic problem, the theory that Stein has proposed to\ntackle it is a purely static one. Despite the explicit recognition of z discrete\ntime periods, it assumes that the variables pertaining to one period are func-\ntionally related only to the variables in the same period. The only thread that\nstrings the 2 time periods together is the balance-of-payments constraint, re-\nquiring that the payments deficit (or surplus) in one period be exactly off-\nset by payments surpluses (or deficits) in other periods. Besides that, the in-\nsulation between time periods is complete. The model recognizes z time pe-\nriods, but the analysis is timeless.\n\nThere is, of course, nothing wrong with using a static model to analyze an\nallocation problem involving different periods over time. Irving Fisher's theory\nof interest is static, yet eminently useful in analyzing the motivations behind\nthe individual demand and supply of capital. However, there is a vital differ-\nence between the Fisherian theory of interest and Stein's theory of the op-\ntimum foreign exchange market: the viewpoint of analysis has shifted from\nthat of individual decision-makers to that of an analyst on behalf of the so-\nCiety as a whole. For an individual saver, Fisher is on solid ground to assume\na given income stream, unaffected by the individual's own decision regarding\nits disposition or by the borrower's decision to invest in the production proc-\ness. On the other hand, in a macroeconomic analysis, especially in a situation\nwhere there are idle resources, it is no longer warranted to assume that the\ntime shape of the output stream is given, that decisions to raise or lower the\nlevel of present absorption or to change its composition between consumption\nor investment will have no effect on the course of the output stream in future\nperiods. In making these assumptions Stein has deprived the problem of its\nessential macrodynamic character.\n\nSecondly, the ceteris paribus assumption of a given output stream also reflects\na piecemeal approach to the formulation of economic policies, unsuitable in a\nnormative theory of decision-making. To assume a given time path of output\nis to say that all the monetary, fiscal, and commercial policies have somehow\nbeen determined outside of the theory, leaving the exchange rate as the only\npolicy instrument for adjusting absorptions to their optimum levels. However,\ncompared with other policy instruments, the exchange rate may not be the\nmost efficient one for adjusting the level of national absorption; moreover, it\nis likely that a consideration of the interactions between exchange-rate policy\n", "166\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "2": ["Ssiders none of the major issues in the current controversy over the relative\ndesirability of freely flexible and fixed exchange rates; (2) that, even for the\nspecial problem with which the theory is concerned, the model presented is\ntoo restrictive to be of much use as an aid to analysis; and (3) that, given the\nspecific forms of the functional relationships postulated in the model, the con-\nclusions derived by Stein can all be readily obtained by the application of a\nsimple theorem in elementary economics, without ever having to resort to the\nsophisticated mathematical and graphical tools he employs. In short, Stein's\ntheory of the optimum foreign exchange market is disappointing both in its\ncontent and in its derivation.\n\nMy comments will follow the dichotomy Stein uses in presenting his theory:\na \"general model\" to set forth his approach to the problem, and a \"specific\nmodel\" to derive his conclusions. Section I below will deal with his general\nmodel, Section II his specific model.\n\nI. Comments on Stein's \"General Model\"\n\nStein takes it for granted that the problem of the optimum foreign exchange\nmarket is \"to find the time path of absorption which will maximize social util-\nity, subject to a constraint,\" and characterizes it as an Irving Fisher problem\napplied to international finance.\" Immediately, he lays out the standard tools\nof optimization theories\u2014a utility function, a set of structural equations, a con-\nstraint to maximization\u2014and starts to solve for the necessary conditions for a\nmaximum. From the latter, he derives the characteristic of the optimum for-\neign exchange market\" as a functional relationship defining the \"optimum\"\nresponses in the exchange rate to given fluctuations in the nation's real out-\nput, which is then used as the criterion for evaluating the relative desirability\nof fixed and freely flexible exchange rates. While impressed by the rigor and\ningenuity with which the conclusions are derived, the reader may be harassed\nby a nibbling doubt over the soundness of the very basis of the theory: Why\nshould the problem of the optimum foreign exchange market be viewed as\n*an Irving Fisher problem applied to international finance\"? Is it the func-\ntion of the foreign exchange market to facilitate intertemporal, rather than\ninternational, resource allocation? What about some other considerations\nwhich might also be relevant to the evaluation of the relative efficiency of al-\nternative exchange-rate systems? He will look in vain in Stein's article for an\nanswer to these fundamental questions.\n\nIn fact, by assuming that the only function of the foreign exchange market\nis to facilitate intertemporal resource allocation, the theory leaves aside all\nthe major issues in the still-continuing controversy over the relative desirabil-\nity of fixed and flexible exchange rates. For instance, the theory is mum about\nobjectives of national economic policy other than the \"optimum time path of\nabsorption,\" nor is there any discussion of the constraints on the choice of\neconomic policies imposed by either type of exchange-rate system. The theory\nneglects the current discussion on the relative effectiveness of economic poli-\ncies under the two types of exchange-rate system in the pursuit of given policy\nobjectives. By assuming a constant over-all price index, it by-passes the prob-\nlem of domestic price stability in relation to exchange stability.

For an economy with idle resources, he\nconcludes, a free exchange market is more efficient than a stabilized exchange\nmarket if the balance of payments tends towards deficits in periods of output\ncontraction and surpluses in periods of output expansion; on the other hand,\na stabilized exchange market is more efficient than a free exchange market, if\nthe balance of payments tends towards surpluses in periods of output con-\ntraction and deficits in periods of output expansion.

Capital investment as such must in-\ncrease employment in a system with an infinitely elastic supply of\nlabor, since it cannot pay in such a system to increase the ratio of cap-\nital to labor. Just as important as capital investment, however, is the\nintroduction of new technology. This may operate in either direction,\nbut on balance tends to be laborsaving. Karl Marx asserted that the\nemployment-destroying effects of new technology must more than\noffset the employment-creating effects of capital investment, but he\nproduced no arguments in favor of this proposition, and proved to be\nwrong in the nineteenth century. It does not follow that he must be\nwrong in the twentieth century. The underdeveloped economies lag so\nfar behind in technology, that the opportunities for introducing labor-\nsaving methods are immense, and it could well happen that the new\nemployment created in the factories, in modern forms of transporta-\ntion, and in modern services could be more than offset by the employ-\nment destroyed in handicrafts, traditional forms of transportation, and\nold-fashioned types of personal service.\n\nThis possibility is heightened by the tendency of wages to rise sharp-\nly in the modern sector. The higher wages are, the more it pays to im-\nport cheap machinery from the developed countries, and therefore the\nless employment investment creates. Not only are the newest indus-\ntries highly capital intensive, but some of the well-established older\nexport industries, such as mines and plantations, are finding them-\nselves squeezed by their inability to pay the wages that are being de-\nmanded and offered by more profitable enterprises; and the opportu-\nnities for import substitution are also diminished.

The high wages in\nthe modern sector also attract people out of the countryside into the\ntowns, where they manage to live by doing a few hours occasional\nwork per week.\n\nImbalance between the modern and the traditional sectors is not\nconfined to wages. An important factor in Africa is the rapid accelera-\ntion in the output of rural schools, which are now producing more pri-\nmary school graduates than the rural economy is able to absorb at the\nwages they expect. So young people are flooding into African towns.\nThe excessive rate of growth of a few towns is a problem throughout\nthe underdeveloped world. This is compounded by errors of policy in\nindustrial location and by concentrating development expenditures on\nthese few large towns, making them much more attractive than the vil-\nlages and the small country towns in terms of water supplies, transpor-\ntation, schools, hospitals, electric light, and opportunities for unem-\nployment relief. Holding the surplus in the countryside until required\nhas always been a problem in developing economies. The British poor\nrelief authorities gave it much attention at the end of the eighteenth\ncentury and the beginning of the nineteenth, and tried to prevent peo-\nple from coming into the towns if work was not available.\n\nThe other aspect of this problem is the high capital intensity of the\nnew investment, not in the sense of the ratio of capital to output,\nwhich we have seen is low, but in the sense of the proportion of the na-\ntional income invested which is required to provide additional employ-\nment for one more man. Most of these countries are surprised at how\nfew people have found employment in the growing sectors of the econ-\nomy, especially manufacturing, mining, and transportation, despite the\nhigh investment which has been taking place.\n\nHigh capital intensity is appropriate when it embodies greatly supe-\nrior technology, without demanding very high skills. The Ohlin ap-\nproach to comparative costs puts us against high-capital intensities,\nbut Ohlin's model assumes that countries have the same technology\nand differ only in the relative scarcity of resources. In comparing de-\nveloping with underdeveloped countries, it is more appropriate to use\nthe Ricardian version of the law of comparative costs, which stresses\ninstead relative differences in productive efficiency. Now there is no a\npriori reason for developed countries to have a comparative efficiency\nadvantage in capital intensive industries, and one can easily construct\ncases where the comparative advantage remains with the underdevel-\noped country, even when the relatively higher cost of capital is taken\ninto account.

Unemployment\n\nOne disturbing factor must be set against the high rates of growth of\noutput and investment on which we have been congratulating our-\nselves; namely, the rising levels of unemployment in the underdevel-\noped countries*. This cannot be documented because there are no reli-\nable statistics of unemployment, but it is everywhere a cause of con-\ncern. The phenomenon is unexpected, since rapid growth and high in-\nvestment ought not to increase unemployment but to reduce it.\n\nThis unemployment is not due in the first instance to rising popula-\ntions. In a well-organized society, surplus population shows itself in\ndisguised unemployment on family farms and in other traditional\nplaces, whereas what we are now talking about is unemployment of\npeople working for wages and living in big towns.\n\nThe simplest approach to understanding the causes of unemploy-\nment is through the model which divides the economy into a growing\nmodern capitalist sector and a traditional subsistence sector which\nfeeds labor to it as required. Unemployment is growing rapidly for two\nreasons: first, because the traditional sector is expelling labor too rap-\nidly; and, second, because the modern sector is taking in too few be-\ncause it is too highly capital intensive.\n\nOne reason why the traditional sector is discharging labor too rapid-\nly is the unusually large differential between wages in the modern sec-\ntor and earnings in the traditional sector. We are used to assuming a\ndifferential of about 50 percent, and to assuming that the modern sec-\ntor can grow at a constant wage level. This seems to have happened in\nthe nineteenth century, but in the twentieth century trade-union pres-\nsure, nationalistic governmental pressure on foreign enterprises, and\nthe new social conscience of big entrepreneurs are combining to raise\nwages very sharply in the modern sectors of the developing economies,\nand it is now not unusual to find some unskilled workers in the modern\nsector earning three or four times as much as the average small farm-\ner.

We can call this the\nBritish solution, since this is what Britain has done regularly over the\npast fifteen years; it is also what Latin-American economists accuse\nthe International Monetary Fund, rightly or wrongly, of wanting them\nto do. The second solution would be to go out into the world market\nand sell more motor cars. This is the Japanese solution. The rate of\ngrowth of the economy is then set by the degree of success in export-\ning. The third solution would be to break the agricultural bottleneck\nand have balanced growth in the narrow sense of patterning domestic\nproduction on domestic demand. This is the Mexican solution. The\nfourth solution would be to force the public to consume what is being\nproduced; namely, more cars rather than more wheat, whether by sub-\nsidizing cars, or by taxing wheat, or by some system of rationing. This\nwas the old Russian solution.\n\nOnly two of these solutions appeal to economists; namely, either to\nsell more exports or to break the bottleneck. Nothing in economic\nscience can tell us a priori which is preferable, but great passions have\nbeen aroused by our prejudices. Economists reared in the free-trade\ntradition tend to look first for the opportunities for increasing trade;\nwhereas a later generation, which learnt in the interwar years to be\nwary of dependence on exports, prefers to explore first the opportuni-\nties for increasing the productivity of home supplies. Inefficient gov-\nernments chose neither of these solutions. They either damp down\ngrowth or try to push ahead despite imbalances. The latter policy has\nproduced its full crop of foreign exchange shortages, devaluations, and\ninflations. The process is cumulative; persistent cost-inflation discour-\nages both exports and import substitution, so aggravating the foreign\nexchange shortage, and giving the spiral another push. Whatever mer-\nits a policy of persistent inflation may or may not have in a closed\neconomy, in an open economy it can work havoc with employment and\ngrowth, by causing a country to price itself persistently out of world\nmarkets. A perpetually overvalued currency can be the chief cause of\neconomic stagnation.\n\nOne of the advantages of input-output analysis is that it puts these\nproblems into their proper framework. A projected increase in national\nincome results in projected increases in final demands. In balancing\ndemand and supply for each commodity separately, the law of compar-\native costs is invoked (perhaps in the form of linear or preferably\nnonlinear programming) to decide the appropriate balance between\nimports, exports, and production for the home market.

Some production can take place in advance of de-\nmand; innovating suppliers create demands which did not previously\nexist; in other sectors it is safe for capacity to lag behind demand; the\navailability of entrepreneurial talents will decide where demand may\nlag, and where it may go in advance; inventions usually bunch in a few\nindustries, in response to shortages, rather than spread all over the\neconomy; and so on. Much controversy has raged around such prop-\nositions, not because they are controversial, but because economists\nlike to be controversial.\n\nMaintaining a proper balance between production for the home mar-\nket and production for export is a much more important subject, be-\ncause failure to do this has serious consequences for the balance of\npayments, for prices, and for the growth rate of the economy. At-\ntempts to increase output faster than the growth rate of exports will\nsupport give rise to what the Latin Americans now call \"structural\ninflation.\" This literature, too, is much obscured by irrelevancies. Struc-\ntural inflation is not due to being underdeveloped, to having a high\nrate of population growth, to exporting mainly primary products, or to\nhaving difficulty in raising taxes; the British economy is the clearest\ncontemporary example of structural inflation, and it has none of these\ncharacteristics. Neither is structural inflation due to investing more\nthan is saved, or to running a budget deficit; these cause demand-pull\ninflations, whereas structural inflation is a cost-push phenomenon.\n\nA simple example illustrates the species. Suppose that a country pro-\nduces only two commodities, motor cars and wheat, and consumes only\nthese two commodities. Suppose also that through technological prog-\nress the output of cars is increased, but structural barriers hold down\nthe output of wheat. The increase in real income increases the demand\nfor wheat. This is met by importing wheat. Thus income generated in\nthe production of cars is used to buy imports; there is a deficit in the\nbalance of payments, and deflation in the home market, represented by\na surplus of cars. This structural deflation is turned into structural\ninflation by the measures taken to right the balance of payments. De-\nvaluation or tariffs or import controls will raise the price of wheat and\ntherefore the cost of living, and so a cost-push inflation spiral will\nstart. Four solutions are possible.

It is better that they\nshould not be forced into autarky since comparative advantage de-\nmands that, even if net imports be low, this be only because large im-\nports of some manufactures are matched by large exports of others.\nRecent international discussion has focused rightly on the market for\nthe manufactures of underdeveloped in developed countries; this is\nlikely to be much more important in future than the never ending talks\non primary products. Some of us believe even that the time is not far\noff when the underdeveloped will be net importers of primary products\nand net exporters of manufactures. This is not only because of high\npopulation growth, which the new techniques of family limitation will\nsoon begin to control. More fundamentally, it is arguable that the real\ncompetitive advantage of temperate countries is in agriculture, since\ntheir temperate climates are more favorable to the retention of soil fer-\ntility than the harsher climates of the tropics.\n\nTo the individual underdeveloped country, import substitution offers\nless opportunity for growth with diminishing trade than it does to the\ngroup taken as a whole. Only the largest countries (possibly China,\nIndia, the U.S.S.R. and the United States) have that wide variety of\nclimates and minerals which is a necessary condition for development\nas a closed economy. Everywhere else a rise in real income must in-\ncrease the imports of some commodities. These imports have to be\npaid for either by expanding exports or by releasing foreign exchange\nthrough import substitution. In the nineteenth century, growth was\nsparked by exports, which generated incomes and so also stimulated\nproduction for the home market. In the second half of the twentieth cen-\ntury, import substitution has offered some countries an easy path to\ngrowth, without dependence on increasing exports. However, once the\nlimits to import substitution are reached, the rate of increase of exports\nsets a ceiling to the rate of growth of output, since natural resource lim-\nitations make it impossible to have balanced growth for the home market\nonly.\n\nEconomists have produced a turgid literature on balanced growth.\nMost writers do not make clear whether they are concerned with the\nbalance between production for the home market and production for\nexport or are concerned only with production for the home market.\n\nIf one assumes a closed economy, the pattern of production must\nobviously be related to the pattern of domestic demand. The original\nRosenstein-Rodan proposition was to the effect that in a closed econo-\nmy with unemployment, an entrepreneur could employ some of the un-\nemployed with greater confidence if he knew that other employers\nwere simultaneously offering employment in other industries; for his\nworkers would spend some of his outlays on buying their goods, but\n"], "8": ["IV.

Both the terms of trade and\nthe rate of growth of trade have been high by comparison with prewar\nstatistics.\n\nThe terms of trade for primary as against manufactured products\naveraged higher in the 1950's than at any time in the preceding eighty\nyears. The first half of the 1950's was especially good because of the\nKorean war and heavy stock-piling in the United States and elsewhere.\nThe terms of trade deteriorated in the second half of the decade and\non till 1962, since when they have moved upwards. However, even in\n1962 they were 5 percent above 1929, which preceded the Great De-\npression.\n\nThe volume of exports from underdeveloped countries increased at\nan annual rate of 3.6 percent, which is also much higher than before.\nBut this rate is lower than the growth of national income because of\nthe important part played by import substitution, especially in Latin\nAmerica.\n\nWe are being deluged with literature arguing that the underdevel-\noped countries cannot grow at an adequate rate if the developed coun-\ntries increase their demands for the exports of underdeveloped coun-\ntries at an annual rate as low as 377 percent. Such literature ignores\nthe important part played by import substitution in economic develop-\nment. Most of the calculations assume rates of growth of national in-\ncome, consumption, industrial production, and imports which are not\nmutually consistent. A little arithmetic shows that if one assumes con-\ntinuance of the current rate of growth of industrial production, the un-\nderdeveloved countries must soon be supplying themselves with nearly\nall the manufactures they need. They have the necessary minerals\n\n5 Currently these countries use manufactures equal to about 30 percent (including raw\nmaterials) of national income, of which about one-third are imported. If national income\ngrew at 5 percent per annum, use at 6 percent, and production of manufactures at 8 per-\n\ncent, net imports of manufactures would fall to zero in twenty-two years. If the growth\nrate of production of manufactures is assumed to be lower, so must the growth rate of\nnational income, and therefore of use of manufactures.

This situation is now changing rap-\nidly since these countries have become independent and have made\neducation a first priority.\n\n\"There is no evidence to suggest that economic development is accel-\nerated by supplying more educated people than the market can absorb.\nIndia is one of the best educated underdeveloped countries, but not\nconspicuously the most successful in economic development. An over-\nsupply of educated people creates great frustrations, stimulates exces-\nsive migrations to the towns, and results in political turbulence. All\nthis makes the political situation more exciting; but though the long-\nrun effects of political excitement on development may be positive, the\nshort-term effects seem to be zero, or even negative.\n\nThe biggest problem in education is the relation of schooling to agri-\ncultural improvement. The problem does not arise in plantation agri-\nculture, since the planters, who are the decision-makers, can adopt the\nlatest techniques whether their workers are literate or not. We cannot\ndoubt that literate farmers are likely to absorb new technology more\nrapidly than illiterate farmers. Illiterate farmers can be taught the\nmost obvious things and have made important decisions, such as\nchanging from subsistence to commercial crops. But it must be a goal\nto have as soon as feasible an agricultural system in which every farm-\ner is literate.\n\nThe problem is the transition. Putting the children into school,\nwhich costs a great deal of money (as much as 3 or 4 percent of na-\ntional income) does not guarantee that one will have literate farmers.\nMuch depends on the speed with which one moves from 10 percent of\nrural children in school towards 100 percent, for when the figure is\nonly 10 percent, that 10 percent knows that it will get jobs off the\nfarms, at wages from two to three times as high as the average\nfarmer's income. If one raises the proportion to 60 percent within ten\nyears, as some West African countries have done, the 60 percent also\nexpect to get jobs off the farms at high incomes. They cannot be at-\ntracted by three acres and a hoe; only a modernized agriculture capa-\nble of high yields per man could hope to hold them. Hence the only\nway to effect a smooth transition is to keep the rate of modernization\nof agriculture and the rate of expansion of rural schooling in step with\neach other.

For it is easy to show that national income cannot\nattain a rate of growth of 5 percent in Asian and A\u00edfrican conditions.\nAt present none of these countries is able to increase agricultural out-\nput faster than 3 percent per annum.

Output of services grows slightly faster than output of com-\nmodities; so gross domestic product as a whole would grow at a maxi-\nmum rate of 4.6 percent.

ELY LECTURE 3\n\nWe do not have enough evidence to test theories of how income dis-\ntribution and the propensity to save change as per capita income in-\ncreases. The fall in export prices relatively to domestic costs was im-\nportant, since the export sector saves more and is more highly taxed\nthan the rest of the economy. ECLA estimates that adverse terms of\ntrade cost Latin America 3.6 percent of national income, comparing\n1960 with 1950, but one would still have expected the savings ratio at\nleast to be maintained, since per capita real output increased by 19\npercent. Presumably significant changes in private saving require long-\ner periods and bigger per capita changes.\n\nThe slow rate of change of private savings is one reason why more\nimportance is now attached to increasing public saving. This, however,\nis not easy. First, the marginal rate of taxation is lower than the aver-\nage in most of these countries; so the percentage share of public reve-\nnue falls as national income increases. Radical reforms are required in\ntax structures if public revenue is even to keep up with public expendi-\nture. Second, where public services are rudimentary, rapidly increasing\nexpenditures on these services are just as important as increased sav-\nings and will for some time absorb most of the increase in revenues.\nThird, the rate of change must inevitably be slow. Attaining self-sus-\ntaining growth means reducing the ratio of private consumption to\ngross domestic product from around 80 to say around 70 percent. Any\nattempt to reduce the ratio of consumption faster than by about one-\nhalf-of-one percent of gross domestic product per year will defeat it-\nself, and also create political unrest. It defeats itself because output\ncannot be increased without increasing consumption, since growth re-\nquires incentives. And it creates unrest because rapid economic growth\nproduces social turbulence, which can be contained only by devoting\nincreased resources to welfare and consumption. My limit of one-hal\u00ed-\nof-one percent assumes that per capita consumption must grow at least\n60 percent as fast as per capita output, in the relevant ranges.

The question whether in some other countries,\nsuch as India or Egypt, the marginal productivity of labor in agricul-\nture is zero seems to arouse fierce passions, though the answer does not\nseem to be relevant to any practical problem.\n\nWhen we turn to the transfer of capital from the developed to the\nunderdeveloped world, we are on firmer ground. The United Nations?\nestimates that the net flow increased from about 2 billion dollars in\n1950 to about 6 billion dollars in 1960. Six billion dollars was about\n375 percent of the national incomes of the underdeveloped world and\nwas therefore associated with about a quarter of their rate of growth\nat the end of the decade.

The best documentation is for Latin America, where if the Eco-\nnomic Commission for Latin America? is right, the ratio of gross do-\nmestic savings to gross domestic product fell, for the continent as a\nwhole, from 16.8 percent in 1950-54 to 15.6 percent in 1955-61, or 15.2\npercent in 1960. Fragmentary evidence suggests that the rest of the\nunderdeveloped world did not do much more than maintain domestic\nsavings ratios (e.g., Philippines from 9.0 percent in 1950 to 9.5 percent\nin 1960; Nigeria from 8.3 in 1951 to 8.6 in 1957) but there were also\nspectacular exceptions, such as India, from about 6 percent (net) in\n1950 to about 8 percent in 1960, and Jamaica, from 12.2 (gross) in\n1950 to 16.1 percent in 1960.\n\nSome of the countries which failed to improve their savings ratios\nnevertheless increased the take of public expenditure, which can be\njust as important for growth. The 1950's were a good decade for edu-\ncation, for public health, and for roads.

Conclusions\n\nThe performance of China's economy\u2014and particularly her in-\ndustrial growth rate vis-\u00e0-vis that of India since 1950\u2014has been gross-\nly exaggerated. This is as true of 1957 and earlier years as it is of\n*'The Great Leap Forward\" and the subsequent period of distress. The\nextent of the exaggeration over the last fourteen years and the extent\nof whatever differences in performance may actually exist are impossi-\nble to determine, at present, given the statistical impasse which pre-\nvails. What can be substantiated now, directly or indirectly, is that in\nboth nations the industrialization plans formulated depended to a con-\nsiderable extent on external financial and material assistance; and that\nwith the passage of time and the accumulation of experience, this de-\npendence increased rather than decreased.\n\nIn both cases, the statistical association between the amount and\nkind of foreign aid received on one hand and the industrial progress\nregistered on the other was self-evidently very high. Moreover, this\nwriter would suggest that we may have cases of concealed\nclassification and downward biases in the correlation coefficients with\nrespect to the statistical problems being considered.

Be-\ncause of the Sino-Soviet rift which developed in mid-1960, 1960, 1961,\n1962, and 1963, Soviet exports to China were 84.8, 38.1, 24.1, and 19.6\npercent, respectively, of the 1959 level. In 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963,\nRussia shipped U.S. $500, $100, $27, and $42 million worth of ma-\nchinery, respectively, to China. It is not mere fost koc propter hoc rea-\nsoning to say that as Russian aid to China flowed and ebbed, so did the\nrate of industrialization in China. Indisputably in the FFYP and the\nfirst half of the SFYP, China xeceived capital goods which she did not\nhave and could not have made in so short a period of time. Without\nRussian assistance, the FFYP would have failed and there could not\nhave been an SFYP. Without substantial assistance from Russia up to\nthe break in mid-1960, the SFYP would have been more of a failure\nthan it was and economic conditions would have been even more seri-\nous from 1960 on than they were.\n\nIn India the situation was roughly the same. For the relatively\nsmall-scale FFYP, external financial assistance accounted for only 10\npercent of total outlay on the Plan; however, for the industrially more\nambitious and financially far more costly SFYP, it was budgeted at 24\npercent and in fact was actually a good deal higher. This was due to\nclassification of large loans to the government by the State Bank in-\nvolving US PL 480 deposits as internal rather than external financing.\nFor the Third Plan, foreign financial assistance was budgeted at 29\npercent of the total outlay on the Plan including such use of PL 480\nfunds. For the years 1950-57, the comparison with China seems close,\nfor in this period the direct aid extended by the U.S.S.R. to China\namounted to 12 percent of the amount reported invested in capital\nconstruction. For 1958 and 1959, the Russian aid apparently amount-\ned to only 4 percent. However, this observer attributes the unusually\nlow proportion to an upward bias in the capital construction data and\nwould hazard the guess that the actual proportion was at least 6 per-\ncent.\n\nIn India as in China, these percentages based on the official data do\nnot impart a sense of the full value of the foreign assistance extended\nto the industrialization program undertaken.

With respect to China,\nduring the years 1950-57, inclusive, the total value of Russian exports\nwas U.S. $4.9 billion, while the total value of the loans extended was\nU.S. $2.8 billion plus the costs incurred in sending up to 10,800 Rus-\nsian technicians to work in China, 1949-57, and the cost of trans-\nporting and maintaining 13,600 Chinese students and workers in Rus-\nsia, 1951-57. If one arbitrarily assumes an average cost of U.S. $1,200\nper person per year, then the entire cost of the technical services and\ntraining involved was no more than U.S. $230 million.\n\nThe Russian exports consisted of equipment vital to China's in-\ndustrialization program. In 1957, for example, 50 percent of the Soviet\nexports consisted of industrial machinery and equipment, with the re-\nmainder being fuels, lubricants, and related products, ferrous and non-\nferrous metals, and miscellaneous other items relatively scarce in\nChina, such as chemical fertilizer and drugs. In return for such criti-\ncally scarce capital goods and related items, China exported hair nets,\nknitted goods, and a whole host of other innocuous consumer-type\ngoods plus industrial raw materials relatively more abundant in China.\nEspecially significant is that the Russians shipped to China not only\nmachinery and equipment per se but complete plants. In most of the\nyears of the FFYP, the ratio of the value of complete plants to the\ntotal value of machinery and equipment imported from Russia was 60\npercent or higher; in 1957 it was 77 percent. By the end of 1957,\nabout 57 percent of China's steel production and 50 percent of her coal\nproduction were coming from Soviet-constructed enterprises\u2014this de-\nspite the fact that the Russians had built only 3 of the 15 iron and\nsteel plants planned for the period and only 27 of the 194 installations\nplanned for the coal industry. The conclusion is inescapable that the\nRussian plants were the larger, more efficient production units as com-\npared to the plants built by the Chinese and that without such\nsignificant external aid, as a minimum, the industrial aspects of the\nFFYP would have been a failure. This conclusion is reinforced by con-\nsideration of the role of the East European satellite nations.

Still other evidence of food shortages in this period were occa-\nsional pillaging of rice stores, increased flaunting of authority in re-\nmote places, and the development of illegal markets. The food situa-\ntion was reportedly so critical in China that between December, 1960,\nand the end of 1963, it was necessary to import 16 million metric tons\nof grain; and, as of mid-1964, an additional 5.45 million metric tons\nwere scheduled for delivery prior to the end of this year. Thus, by De-\ncember 31, 1964, China will have imported nearly 2177 million tons of\ngrain over a forty-nine month period, or about 5.3 million metric tons\nper year on the average. While the agricultural crisis in China did not\nnecessitate large-scale imports of industrial raw materials of agricul-\ntural origin, it did require sharp reductions in the exports of these\ngoods.\n\nIn India, the agricultural situation was roughly the same despite the\ntenor of many of the official data. Despite increases in aggregate and\nper capita food production between 1957 and 1962, it was necessary\nfor India to import 23.2 million metric tons of food grains or an aver-\nage of 3.9 million metric tons per year. Assuming an average popula-\ntion of 432 million for India during the period and an average popula-\ntion for China of 714 million for the years 1961 through 1964, inclu-\nsive, then grain imports per capita on the average for each of the\nyears in these different but partially overlapping periods were .00895\nmetric tons for India and .00736 metric tons for China. Although\u2014or\nperhaps because\u2014larger grain imports per capita occurred in India\nthan in China, there were not the same reports of desperate acts or\ndesperate situations within India that emanated from China. Also, al-\nthough it was necessary for India to import more food per capita than\nChina, unlike China it was both necessary and possible for India to\nimport relatively larger quantities of capital goods and industrial raw\nmaterials as well. This will be discussed in greater detail below. Suffice\nto note now that as in China, the food imports required consumed\nsome foreign exchange which otherwise would have been used to un-\nderwrite India's industrial efforts. Were it not for US PL 480 which\npermitted successively larger food purchases by India from 1956 on\nwith Indian currency, the foreign exchange drain attributable to food\nand other agricultural products would have been considerably larger.\nAid from the U.S. and other friendly nations permitted and sustained\nindustrial growth in India which otherwise would have been severely\ninhibited, as in fact it was inhibited in China for lack of the same ex-\nternal assistance.

In the years\n1959 through 1962, machinery and equipment in a number of indus-\ntries had to lie idle for long periods because the industries had so ex-\npanded that they were able to produce more output than the inputs re-\nquired for them which were available. In various industries, wide-\nspread attempts to economize on the use of critically important raw\nmaterials (e.g., coke and silicon in the production of steel) resulted in\nlarge quantities of substandard output. Continued misuse of and fail-\nure to maintain adequately machinery and equipment in 1959 and sub-\nsequent years resulted in increasingly numerous reports of breakdowns\nof industrial equipment and transportation facilities; and their contin-\nued inoperability for long periods of time. The few data available indi-\ncate that in 1960, 1961, and 1962, industrial production declined by at\nleast 10 percent in each year and more probably closer to 15 percent.\nIn September, 1962, the C.C.P. was forced to recognize its inability to\ncontinue its industrialization drive and it directed that henceforth, for\nan unstated period of time, the limited resources at its disposal were to\nbe invested in agriculture rather than heavy industry. For 1963 and\n1964, the C.C.P. claimed substantial improvements in percentage or\nqualitative terms in the output of agriculture-related industries, such\nas chemical fertilizer and simple agricultural machinery, and only mod-\nest increases in others.\n\nIn statistically more *open\" India, roughly comparable industrial\nfailures took place. Between 1956 and 1961, serious production fail-\nures occurred in thirteen industrial lines, some of which warrant de-\nscription as being of crucial importance to India's industrialization\nefforts. The outright failures in these lines and failure to maximize\nproduction in others were due to a wide variety of specific reasons sim-\nilar to those which operated as development drags in China. Essen-\ntially, these drags were technical and administrative inexperience or in-\ncompetence in the construction and operation of the plants. The inex-\nperience and incompetence resulted in not only lower production levels\nbut considerably higher production costs than originally anticipated.\nIndicative of how poorly executed the industrial effort was is that in\nspite of a monetary investment approximately 30 percent above the\nPlan estimates, the physical targets attained in industry were only 85\npercent to 90 percent of Plan.\n\n2. Major Failures in Agriculture. In China, despite grain production\nhaving increased from 108 million metric tons to reportedly successive\nall-time highs of 250 and 270 million metric tons in 1958 and 1959,\nrespectively, in the years 1959 through 1963 there were numerous\nwidespread reports of severe food shortages.

Perhaps the most\nconclusive proof of the inadequacies of the official data for this pur-\npose and the folly of accepting any more than their general tenor, if\nindeed even that, are the major developments which have occurred\nsince 1957.\n"], "2": ["32 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nreached down to the county much less the town and village level; and\nin late 1957, the director of the State Statistical Bureau had been\nforced to admit that they were not even clear about such basic agricul-\ntural data as the size of the territorial area of and the amount of culti-\nvated land in China. In the study, the conclusion was reached that for\nthe first five years, i.e., from 1949 to 1954, the official statistics are\npoor estimates, with the exception of those for state and joint indus-\ntrial enterprises, which had higher but widely varying degrees of re-\nliability.\n\nAnother study which dealt exclusively with industrial enterprises\nfound upward biases due to the concept of the gross value of output\nused, pricing practices, and changing coverage. While unable to deter-\nmine the exact magnitude of the identified biases for any one year, the\nresearcher was able to state that their impact on the official indexes op-\nerated throughout the whole period and, becoming more pronounced\nafter 1958, exerted a greater upward influence on the official data\nthereafter. Still other studies of China's national income completed\nsince 1959 have yielded estimates for one or more of the years between\n1952 and 1959 which, to varying degrees, have been below those\nclaimed in the official data.\n\nOn the Indian side, it has been observed by students of that nation's\nstatistics that, similarly to China's, they have required and still require\ninvocation of the doctrine of caveat emptor.

No mystery surrounds the transaction. The conditions and terms\nwhich characterize the engagement and payment of top executives of\nAmerican corporations, on the other hand, are complex, mysterious\nand, one has reason to believe, highly personal to the participants.\nThrough the medium of the corporation, corporate executives are the\nemployees of the owners of the corporation\u2014the stockholders. It is a\nrare stockholder, however, who can work his way through the melange\nof straight salary, bonuses, options, pensions, expense allowances, pay-\nments in kind, vacations, and privileges that make up the executives'\ncompensation package, to a confident conclusion on how much his ex-\necutives are costing him.

Through its control of the proxy machinery, top management\ndetermines the selection of the board which selects top management;\ntop management sits across from itself at the bargaining table, hiring\nitself and setting the terms of its own employment. Top management is\na vitally important factor of production, but operating in the context\nof the corporation its precise functional character has never been thor-\noughly examined or buttoned down. It can be hired on a fixed-dollar\ncontract, and in this sense is a labor service; it can \"invest\" itself for a\npossible return in profit (just as ownership capital can be invested),\nand in this sense its provision partakes of entrepreneurship. In the lat-\nter case, the risk component may or may not be present. Irrespective\nof their designation and whether their remuneration be termed\n\"wages\" or \"profit\" or both in uncertain proportions, the services ren-\ndered by top management to a private corporation are unstandardized,\nand the measure of their productivity is, at best, imprecise.

This permits us anoth-\ner look at the American scene. The look is conclusive, but the conclu-\nsion is not that which the analogy was intended to establish.\n\nThe idealized version of the management of the giant American cor-\nporation places it amidst and slightly above the other claimants to cor-\nporate bounty\u2014consumers, labor, creditors, suppliers, the public and,\noh yes, the owners\u2014dispensing economic justice among them, inspired,\nrestrained, and guided by its social conscience and its deep sense of so-\ncial responsibility. This version is overdone, but it is still quite true\nthat American corporate management does occupy a unique position.\nIts four freedoms\u2014\u00edfrom government, from competition, from stock-\nholders, and from want\u2014are not absolute, but they are substantial and\nsignificant. Of these, the one that most concerns us here is freedom\nfrom competition. To the extent that the corporate undertaking is free\nfrom competition as an economizing force, it is, in the logic of Ameri-\ncan capitalism, irresponsible. In that logic, market competition both\ndefines and enforces economic responsibility; there are no free agents.\nThere is nothing startling in this\u2014the very purpose of any economy is\nto bend the will of individuals to the will of society in economic mat-\nters, whether the determination and enforcement of society's will are\nfunctions of the market or of society organized in government. If com-\npetition is ineffective and government is remote, there is a void that\nmust be filled either by the restoration of competition or the introduc-\ntion of government. It cannot be filled by an infusion into enterprise\nmanagements of a sense of social responsibility. No matter how sincere\nthey are or may become and no matter how ardently as individuals they\nmay seek the good life for all of society, there is still lacking what is lack-\ning in Britain if individual nationalized basic industries are left as free\nagents: direction and coordination. To the extent that giant corpora-\ntions in the United States are in fact free to dispense economic justice,\nthey are a problem for us; they certainly are no model for British na-\ntionalization.\n\nLet me turn finally to a type of problem which I suggest is spawned\nin the semidarkness of private industry, but from which nationalized\nindustry, in its simple innocence and because of the light of publicity\nwhich everlastingly shines upon it, is relatively free. Top-management\ncompensation presents little difficulty for Britain's nationalized indus-\ntries, but if I read the signs correctly, it threatens a real blowup one of\nthese days in American private industry.

We live in political econo-\nmies, and only the government elected by the people can speak for the\npeople where the market has been silenced. Further, economizing in-\nvolves overall coordination, and only the government\u2014-certainly not\neach individual undertaking\u2014is in a position to coordinate and to ac-\ncept, for society, the responsibility of coordination. If we are to forego\nthe soothing, anesthetizing processes of the market and face the prob-\nlems of economizing squarely and head on, the government must take\ncharge as the overall directing, coordinating, responsible agent.\n\nI stand on this conclusion despite my unhappiness with the pricing\ndecisions which the British government has made. But I hasten to offer\ntwo caveats. First, a sensible government will not forget that the func-\ntion of management is to manage; it will delegate large authority to\nthe management of the industry and will spell out and publicize the\nlimits of that authority. It will give great weight to managerial judg-\nment and will encourage imaginative experimentation as a value par-\nticularly to be sought in a nationalized industry\u2014even, say, a spot of\nmarginal cost pricing, when no one is looking.\n\nSecond, and on the matter of coordination: a nationalized industry\nis part of a total economy, and its policies and program must dovetail\nwith the overall policies and programs\u2014macro, micro, and so-\ncial\u2014established by the government. This relates to situations in\nwhich the industry is peculiarly involved, where, for instance, the in-\ndustry is tempted to cross-subsidize to assist a derelict area, or where\nthe industry is caught up in a price dispute with another nationalized\nindustry; and also to economy-wide matters as broad as inflation or\naggregate unemployment. Industries, acting alone, can deal only par-\ntially and fleetingly, and in many cases only harm\u00edully, with these\nmatters, but directed and coordinated they can be employed to achieve\na national purpose. The other, and equally important, side of this coin\nis that the government itself must have an economy-wide view and a\ntotal set of positive policies and programs into which the af\u00edairs of the\nindustry can be purposefully drawn and firmly fitted. Much of the\ncomplaint that British nationalized undertakings have leveled against\noverriding governments might have been precluded if it could have\nbeen made to appear that government decisions were called for by\nbasic policies and overall plans and were not the reflection merely of\narbitrary and piecemeal judgments.\n\nThe argument has been made that managements of British national-\nized industries should be free to run their undertakings and to indulge\n"], "11": ["60 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nflesh and blood nationalized undertakings would mesh \"naturally\"\nwith the allocation of resources produced by the forces actually at\nwork in the free enterprise markets of the real world.

Fur-\nther, the processes available to nationalized industries provide a mech-\nanism for taking into account\u2014openly and responsibly\u2014 considerations\nwhich society wants taken into account outside the strict rule of price\nand cost, and which private industries operating in the market either\ncannot accommodate or are not suited to accommodate in their econ-\nomizing decisions.

In the Yugoslav enterprise this conflict is probably somewhat\nmuted by the profit sharing scheme which provides some generalized\nincentive toward the making of profitable choices by the workers\u2014a\npoint which has recently been illustrated in a model of group decision\nmaking [11, Chap. 9]. A practical example was the already men-\ntioned case of a workers! council wanting to pay an exceptionally high\nsalary to the enterprise manager in order to attract an outstanding\nperson. The other side of the coin is suggested by one of the questions\nin the VaraZdin study. Workers were asked whether they thought\nprofits should be shared equally among all workers or in proportion to\nregular earnings; they divided almost equally in their answers [6, p. 89].\n\nThere is another area in which the Yugoslav power structure seems\nto differ substantially from that of the typical nationalized (or large-\nscale private) firm in the West: the absence of a strong trade-union in\nthe traditional sense of the term.

This is even true of the manag-\ner, though the local government is represented on the appointing com-\nmittee, and is concerned in dismissal procedures.\n\nA second area in which workers! council authority has been greatly\nstrengthened is in fixing wages. Both local governments and unions\nwere previously involved with the workers! council in this decision, but\nnow competence is entirely in the council's hands. Of course the watch-\ndog agencies are concerned about inequities and may intervene, as the\nabove-cited story about a manager's salary testifies; but this is now\nexceptional rather than regular practice. And it may well be true that\nwhere a strong workers' council exists it is in a position to resist such\npressures. An implication of this increased authority has been that\ncontrol by external agencies of the allocation of funds within the firm\nhas been greatly weakened. This is partly the result of a deliberate\npolicy of relaxing control of internal enterprise decisions and partly a\nconsequence of the difficulty in determining the size of the \"surplus\"\nwhen national wage standards are no longer available for estimating\nlabor costs. There is very wide variation in the ratio of funds at the\nfree disposal of firms to personal incomes, which reflects the state of\nthe market, the quality and size of the capital stock, and the wage\nrates fixed by the workers! councils\u2014all in unknown proportions. In\nrecent times, successful firms (in 1962, 355 of 2,684 industrial enter-\nprises operated at a loss) have been passing out 75-80 percent of these\nfunds as additional wages [5, pp. 76-79]. But when the figure rises\nabove this level or falls below it, the union, for example, finds it\ndifficult to decide whether there is a question of social responsibility or\nwhether the deviation is a result of arbitrary setting of wage levels by\nthe workers! councils.\n\nIn fifteen years of experience with the institutions of workers! man-\nagement quite a substantial fraction of the workers (in most places\nranging from a quarter to a third of the current staff) have participa-\nted as council or board members. Both the formal legislation and the\ntrend of changes in that legislation are evidence of governmental and\nLeague interest in strengthening the institutions.

The really distinctive feature of the Vugoslav case\nis the use of workers! management as an important element in the in-\nternal decision process of nationalized firms. One might anticipate that\nthis would lead to strikingly different enterprise decision patterns and\nwould also strongly influence the kinds of problems already mentioned.\n\nThe introduction of workers! management in industrial factories was\na revolution from above and from the beginning was rather carefully\ncontrolled by the instruments for exerting political influence. Else-\nwhere I have argued that in the early years the manager generally ran\nthe firm, though the workers! councils often did manage to make their\nvoices heard on questions of wages and hours [10]. In searching the\nYugoslav press, it is not difficult to find evidence that director domi-\nnance is still a factor in enterprise decision making. For instance, a re-\ncent spate of articles in the League of Communists! newspaper show,\ndisapprovingly, managers ignoring the rights of workers and their\ncouncils [1, Jan. 6, 9, 28 and Feb. 7, 1964]. Three of these dealt\nwith the unjustified firing of workers and technicians by managers; the\nfourth with a manager who reportedly never consulted his workers'\ncouncil, merely seeking their approval of his decisions after the fact.\n'The cases appear to have come to light mainly because illegal acts\nwere also involved; in each case it seems clear, however, that the\nworkers! councils were not acting effectively to control the managers'\nactions.\n\nEven instances which are cited to illustrate the power of the councils\nare not always convincing. The story was recently told of a Serbian\ntextile factory in which the management entirely ignored the workers'\ncouncil. When finally a meeting was called to go through the formality\nof approving the annual plan, the entire council was silent, refusing to\nvote on the ground that they were not prepared. A League official was\npresent, supported the workers and brought the issue to the attention\nof *union, party and government circles\" [8]. If it takes action by\nan official of the League of Communists to bring council members to\nthe exercise of their formal rights, the council's power base must be\nrather insecure:\n\nDespite the continued appearance in the press of anecdotal material\nof this kind, there is strong evidence that the workers' councils gener-\nally are functioning more effectively today than a decade ago both as\nrepresentatives of worker interests and as an effective influence on en-\nterprise decision making.

Until the foreign trade reform of 1961, the allocation of\nforeign exchange among firms by economic associations was a major\ninstrument of informal agreement. Since that time the movement to-\nward economic integration of firms has no doubt provided a convenient\ndevice.\n\nNationalized firms almost by definition are easier for the state to\nreorganize than private firms; so that it should be relatively easy to\nbreak up nationalized firms in order to stimulate competition. Howev-\ner, in a small economy domestic competition is inevitably relatively\nless viable. In Yugoslavia perhaps the major gain from this sort of\ncontrol has come from regulation of the size of urban wholesale trad-\ning establishments. A series of reorganizations in the early days of the\nnew economic system has led to the development of a comparatively\nef\u00fccient and reasonably competitive distribution system\u2014a sector\nwhich in developing economies is generally notorious for its inefficiency.\n\nVariations in state policy toward firm size and cooperation among\nfirms suggest the difficulties that must be faced. A set of syndicalist\nindustrial associations was a part of the original worker management\nlegislation of 1950, but these were abolished in 1952 when it became\napparent that they were being used to circumvent market competition.\nThen in the mid-fifties a new set of associations was established to\nserve research and informational functions and which in fact were a\nbasis for more cooperation. More recently, concern over export mar-\nkets and substantial excess capacities in some industries has led to new\nstimulation for association. Shipbuilding represents one instance in\nwhich common export effort seems to provide a major stimulus, where-\nas in steel and textiles economies of integrated operation seem to be\nthe dominant consideration [3, Mar. 30, 1963] [1, Feb. 13, 1964].\nThe dangers in this movement toward cooperation and merger can be\nillustrated by the newly integrated firm Makedonka which will process\nover 80 percent of its region's textiles, or from the expansion of Zeni-\nca, already the nation's largest steel producer, by integration with a\nmine and two existing mills [1, Feb. 17, 1964]. A variety of forms of\nintegration have been concocted but none as yet that will in themselves\nprevent the firm from profiting in socially harmful ways from market\ncontroi. For example, the chocolate firm mentioned above decided to\ntry to get an agreement in its industrial association to prevent further\nprice competition.\n"], "3": ["COMPARATIVE SYSTEMS: NATIONALIZED INDUSTRY 67\n\nregulations set minimum qualifications. In addition to the director,\nboth the League of Communists and the trade-unions are expected to\nexhort participants to appropriate levels of performance and to serve\nas watchdogs of that performance. For example, a union is said recent-\nly to have stepped in to prevent salaries being set for managers at a\nlevel deemed too high in relation to other salaries within the firm.\"\nLocal governments have been known to put pressure on firms for addi-\ntional income for local purposes and have attempted to influence price\npolicies as well. However, legislation has now somewhat restricted the\npower of local governments to act in this way. Despite such restric-\ntions, it is obvious that the power of government over nationalized\nfirms is very great, so that such informal influences are likely to re-\nmain an important feature of the system.\n\nThough the forms and perhaps the extent are novel, the fact of in-\nvolvement in both market and political pressures is a common feature\nof operation of nationalized firms in the West. Novel also is the extent\nof nationalization, which in Yugoslavia includes all industrial firms of\nsignificant size. As a consequence, a rather large fraction of the deal-\nings of these firms is with other nationalized firms. Both the market\nand the state in its interventions serve to define the nature of these in-\nteractions. Competition is one manifestation of this interaction, and\nobservers are agreed that quality improvement has been one of the\nproducts. The administrative decentralization, which has provided\nsome autonomy to both republican and local governments, has also\nbeen a factor promoting competition as territorial units vie, among\nother things, to expand their tax bases. That this interfirm competition\ncan be quite keen is testified by a recent anecdote concerning the com-\npetitive granting of price rebates by chocolate firms; a firm which was\napparently losing out in the struggle complained of its intensity and\ndenounced this price shading as *unfair competition\" [1, Feb. 19,\n1964].\n\nHowever, a very serious problem has arisen in the form of collabo-\nration among firms in nationalized industry. The extreme version of\nthis\u2014monopoly\u2014is of frequent occurrence in the sense that in a small\nand developing economy like that of Yugoslavia there are very many\nproducts having only a single producer. Since many internal markets\nare still well isolated from world market trends, this offers opportuni-\nties to firms which have often not been resisted and which account in\npart for the growth of price regulation. Instances of price fixing and\nmarket sharing agreements are reported rather frequently in the press.\n\"Though there are antitrust regulations against this, the state neverthe-\nless has often provided a good deal of indirect assistance to attempts at\n\nThis story was told to the author by a Yugoslav management expert.\n"], "2": ["66 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nHowever, this need not be the case; in fact I think it is easy to exag-\ngerate the necessary causal impact of the market environment on firms\nin general. The point is that there are a wide variety of circumstances\nin which market pressures are scarcely felt. This is not just a matter of\nmonopoly position or the absence of close substitutes. It is also\u2014and\nperhaps even more importantly\u2014the nature of the goals which govern\ndecision making. A nationalized firm need not seek profits or strive to\nsatisfy consumers in order to survive. A government need not and in-\ndeed may not be capable of generating appropriate goals in the enter-\nprises it owns or controls.\n\n'The market does put the making of deals at the center of enterprise\noperation and as a consequence develops more or less naturally money\nmeasures of performance which are likely to be adopted simply because\nof their convenience and regardless of goals. This in itself may tend to\ncreate pressures toward more conventional orientation both by govern-\nment and by firm managements; but the point is that it need not, for\nthe pressures of the market are in keen competition with political pres-\nsures in influencing nationalized firm decisions.\n\nNaturally the state in Yugoslavia plays a considerable role in\ndefining the framework in which nationalized firms operate and in con-\ntrolling their decision processes. Firms are subject to very heavy taxa-\ntion, their contributions covering about half of governmental budget\nexpenditures in recent years, with excise taxes covering an additional\nsixth [5, pp. 46-49] [9, p. 124]. In principle, the policy has been to\nestablish regular and anonymous tax forms rather than making arbi-\ntrary deductions from the incomes of individual enterprises. In prac-\ntice, however, the tax system has been sharply overhauled about every\nother year, and a variety of discriminatory penalties and favors have\nproliferated. Control of depreciation allowances and also of expendi-\ntures for capital maintenance has been maintained from the beginning,\nthough recently there has been some discussion about ending the lat-\nter. Over the last ten years there has been a rather steady growth in\nthe scope of price controls until by 1962 about two-thirds of the value\nof industrial goods was subject to this control [3, Dec. 21, 1963]. On\nthe other hand, governmental participation in the setting of wage\ndifferentials\u2014a feature of the early operation of the system\u2014no long-\ner has any legal basis.\n\nAs might be expected, the Yugoslav firm is subject to political pres-\nsure from several sources. Because it is often exercised informally, this\nkind of pressure is very difficult to evaluate, but it is clearly substan-\ntial.

As long as there existed both a rent on land\nand a rent on slaves\u2014that is, the price of slaves was above the real re-\nproduction costs of slaves\u2014any short-run unprofitability of slaves as a\nresult of their price being bid up for noneconomic reasons would sim-\nply result in a readjustment, either in land rents or ultimately in slave\nprices, so that the equilibrium rate would again prevail. Only if the\nwages of free labor fell to the subsistence level, so that in fact the\nprices of slaves fell to below their reproduction cost, would the institu-\ntion become nonviable.^ And since no such consideration was in-\nvolved, there never was any real issue about the viability of slavery.\nWhile one might well make the argument that slave prices might be\nmaintained at a higher level than would be justified by the rate of re-\nturn in cotton production because of their use for conspicuous con-\nsumption or noneconomic reasons, then the answer simply would be\nthat in that case land rents would fall so as to adjust to an equilibrium\nsolution. In short, the Conrad and Meyer article has perpetuated an\nissue which is really no issue at all.\n\nIn summary, it is my convinction that we need to sweep out the door\na good deal of the old economic history, to improve the quality of the\nnew economic history, and it is incumbent upon economists to cast a\nskeptical eye upon the research produced by their economic history\ncolleagues to see that it lives up to standards which they would expect\nin other areas of economics.\n\nThis criticism of the state of economic history is not based on some\nutopian notion that we can achieve a scientific consensus on interpret-\ning the past, but rather on the wide gap that exists between contempo-\nrary practice and the potential which could vastly enrich our knowl-\nedge of the past and reduce the range of uncertainty and disagreement\nover our economic heritage.\n\nU For the two most recent illustrations, see Edward Saraydar, *A Note on the Profita-\nbility of Ante-Bellum Slavery,\" S.

I ask my students to take leading interpretive arti-\ncles in American economic history and to make explicit models of the\narticles? Even by plugging into each model the most favorable possi-\nble implicit assumptions, most of the resultant models turn out either\nto be internally inconsistent or to run counter to the most fundamental\npropositions in economics.\n\nLet me turn now to the new economic history. There has been some\nvaluable work\u2014particularly in the gathering of statistics\u2014to provide\nus with some solid footing for analysis, and there have been a few\nfirst-rate articles and books, yet the results have been generally disap-\npointing. Too much of it has been dull and unimaginative, and there\nseems to be a widespread conviction that econometric techniques, the\ncomputer, and running a few regressions can substitute for theory and\nimagination. Some of the new economic history written by economists\nis of distressingly poor quality. Some of it is so imprecise and fuzzy as\nto make it difficult, if not impossible, to make any model at all. A good\ndeal of it includes partial-equilibrium analysis of problems with broad\ngeneralequilibrium or disequilibrium implications. Too much of it\nshows that the writer clearly had no fundamental understanding of the\nway by which an economy operates. In particular, a lot of it shows\nthat the role of prices in resource allocations and the implications of\nprice behavior have completely eluded the writer.\n\nThe inadequacy of the new economic history is nowhere more evi-\ndent than in its failure to nail down and to refute the shoddy argu-\nments and propositions that riddle the literature. Let me illustrate my\npoint by discussing at some length an article in the new economic his-\ntory. In fact, it is one of the classics. I refer to the article by Conrad\nand Meyer on \"The Economics of Slavery in the Ante-Bellum\nSouth.\" The Conrad and Meyer article is frequently taken as the\nepitome of the way in which the new economic history should be writ-\nten, indicating the sophisticated use of economic theory and statistics\nto nail down a long-debated issue of American economic history. It\ndoes deserve a special place in the literature as a pioneering piece of\nwork. The article pinpointed and clarified a number of issues which\nhave been muddied in the history of the controversy. In particular, it\ndemonstrated that resources in the South were allocated efficiently and\nthat the market for slaves operated in a fashion that was compatible\nwith a profit maximizing economy.

Yet absolutely no\nevidence exists that warrants such a conclusion. While the work of\nCarter Goodrich and his students has made an important contribution\nin showing that the government did, in fact, intervene in canal invest-\nments, railroad investments, etc., neither Goodrich nor his students,\nnor anyone else, has shown that this actually accelerated tbe rate of\ngrowth of the economy.

While\nit is true that we have no overall theory of economic growth worth the\nname and that therefore the grand theme of the economic rise and fall\nof nations cannot be treated in a formal fashion, we still know a good\ndeal about productivity change and its sources; but little of the litera-\nture in economic history reflects any awareness of this fact.

In good part it consists of\na mishmash of quotations and oddly assorted statistics which do not\nprovide any support or test for the propositions developed. (4) A good\ndeal of economic history draws broad welfare conclusions which are by\nno stretch of the imagination warranted from the evidence cited. In\nfact, a general characteristic of economic history is that the treatment\nof propositions with broad welfare implications is typically undertaken\nwithout even a token acquaintance with welfare economics.

Rather it is\nthe logical consequence of their desire to quantify the contribution of\nvarious changes in economic institutions, in factor supplies, and in\ntechnology to the rate and direction of economic growth.*\n\nIt is probably too soon to attempt a generalized evaluation of the\nquality of the output of the new economic history and of its contribu-\ntion to our knowledge of the economic past. Much of this output is still\nin the prepublication stage or has only recently been published. And\nmany of the debates it has touched off are in full flush.\n\nYet I cannot resist making one observation. N. S. B. Gras concluded\nhis 1930 survey of the status of economic history in the United States\non a gloomy note. \"The universities,\" he wrote, *have generally neg-\nlected the study of economic history, apparently regarding it as a\nvery special subject. There has been a lack of controversy, even of in-\ntellectual resilience, in the field\" [23, p. 327].\n\nThe situation today is quite different. Controversy abounds; and the\nlevel of the debate is, in my opinion, quite high. Imaginative applica-\ntions of theory and statistics have brought to the fore evidence which\nuntil recently was considered unobtainable. Moreover, the hiatus in\nrecruitment into the field appears to have come to an end. Meetings of\n\nthe Economic History Association which just a few years ago were\npeopled almost exclusively by scholars who received their training be-\nfore or during World War II are now marked by the attendance of a\nlarge corps of young people who entered economic history during the\nlast half-dozen years or so. And the rate of entry seems to be rising. At\nthe same time several leading departments of economics have for the\n\n\"In this connection mention should be made of the Purdue Seminar on Quantitative\nMethods in Economic History.

N. Keynes's contention that \"familiarity with economic theory is es-\nsential to the interpretation of industrial phenomena such as it \u00edalls\nwithin the province of the historian to give\" [27, p. 271], Ashley re-\nplied: economic theory revealed little about the connections of eco-\nnomic phenomena that could not be understood through the application\nof plain common sense\" [2, p. 127].\n\nThe truce for which Ashley called lasted for more than a half a cen-\ntury. During this time intellectual enmity abated. Within economic\nhistory, scholars such as Callender, Heckscher, Cole, Hamilton, and\nRostow effectively applied economic theory and statistics to the study\nof history. Within economics proper, empirically- and historically-or-\niented analysis developed far more extensively than Ashley foresaw.\nOne of the centers of such work, although not the only one, was the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research where Wesley Mitchell, Simon\nKuznets, and others applied theory and statistics in massive empirical\nstudies of the development of the American economy.\n\nStill, as late as 1941, the relationship between economic history and\neconomics proper was essentially one of truce. In that year Edwin F.\nGay, on the occasion of his election as the first president of the Eco-\nnomic History Association, both gave recognition to the breach that\nremained and called for its elimination. \"Full cooperation,\" he said,\n\"js not yet easy or intimate and one of the first tasks of the economic\nhistorian today is to open the way to a more complete connection of\nthe two disciplines\" [21, p. 412].\n\nIn the years following World War II, the movement toward the\nreunification of economic history with economic theory accelerated.\nAmong the factors that led to the quickened pace, two may be singled\nout. One was the substantial increase in the range and subtlety of the\nmodels encompassed by economic theory. The other was the wide-\nspread experimentation, in many fields of economics, with the adapta-\ntion of general models to specific (historical) situations\u2014an experi-\nmentation stimulated by the upsurge in econometrics and other forms\nof applied mathematics.\" With such developments Heckscher's isolat-\ned plea of the 1920's for a greater use of theory in the study of eco-\nnomic history [24] became a relative commonplace in the 1950's.\nPost-World War II texts announced their reliance on the \"framework\nof economic analysis to elucidate the historical narrative\" and treated\ntheir \"emphasis on economic principles\" as a mark of distinction [37,\np.xi].*\n\nHowever, the reunification of economic history with economic theo-\n\n^An experimentation, it might be pointed out, that has increased awareness, not only\nof the usefulness, but also of the limitations of existing models in the explanation of eco-\nnomic growth.\n\n* See also the prefaces to [10] [25] [28].\n"], "3": ["94 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\ninclude the hypothesis that railroads were built ahead of demand\n[14], the view that the lag of wages behind prices during the Civil\nWar led to unusually great prosperity for northern manufacturing in-\nterests [5] [26], and the proposition that the development of the\nBessemer process was of transcending significance for the rapid emer-\ngence of a modern iron and steel industry in the United States [18]\n[40]?\n\nMy second proposition is that the new economic history represents a\nreunification of economic history with economic theory and thus brings\nto an end the century-old split between these two branches of econom-\nics.\n\nEconomic history emerged as a distinct discipline during the course\nof the mid- and late-nineteenth-century revolt against the deductive\ntheories of classical economics. Led by Roscher, Knies, Hildebrand,\nand Schmoller in Germany and by Leslie, Ingram, and Ashley in Eng-\nland, the original aim of the historical school (or schools) was to re-\nplace what they believed to be the unrealistic theories of deductive\neconomics by theories developed inductively through the study of his-\ntory. Yet despite a half century of progammatic proclamations and de-\nspite the many fine historical monographs produced by the school(s),\nno alternative theory emerged.\n\nIn a 1901 review of the accomplishments of the historical school(s),\nThorstein Veblen called their effort to supplant classical theory a\n\"failure.\" There seems,\" he continued, \"no reason to regard this fail-\nure as less than definitive\" [41, p. 71]. Veblen's judgment was reaffirmed\nthree decades later by J. H. Clapham who wrote, *Most scholars are now\nagreed that such an attempt failed even in the hands of Schmoller\" [4,\np. 329].\n\nRecognition of this failure led neither to the disappearance of eco-\nnomic history nor to its reunification with economics proper. When\nAshley ascended to the first chair of economic history at Harvard\nshortly before the turn of the century, he called for a truce between\nthe warring factions. He disclaimed any desire to compete with deduc-\ntive economics in the formulation of rival theories of value and distri-\nbution, asking only that economic history \"be let alone.\"* Ashley be-\nlieved that conflict was avoidable because in his view economics proper\nand economic history focused on different problems: the former on the\nstatic properties of modern economies; the latter on the evolution of\neconomic societies or\u2014as we now call it\u2014economic growth [2].

The\nnew generation has not turned away from the traditional theme of its\ndiscipline. The central interest of the new economic historians is still\nthe description and explanation of economic growth. This continuity\nwith the past holds in the small as well as in the large. The specific re-\nsearch projects of the new generation focus on such familiar issues as\nthe developmental impact of railroads and canals [14] [17] [22]\n[36], the effect of changes in supply and demand on the growth of the\niron industry [40] [12], the profitability of slavery [6] [13] [39]\n[44], the factors affecting the growth of productivity in agriculture\n[35], the effect of federal land policy on the distribution of income\n[3] [16], the influence of foreign trade on the creation of a market\neconomy [33], the sources of the capital required for industrialization\n[9] [43], the explanation of urbanization [8] [38], and the causes\nof economic fluctuations [43].\n\nThe novel element in the work of the new economic historians is\ntheir approach to measurement and theory.

And this, in turn, has led\nto a fruitful rephrasing of the approach to such topics as the extent of\nthe discontinuity in economic trends, the role of increased investment,\nthe importance of working as against fixed capital, the significance of\napparent \"leading sectors,\" and the interplay between economic prog-\nress and demographic change. Obviously it would be ludicrous to argue\nthat the results of this work provide a precise guide to the process of\nindustrialization in the mid-twentieth century. But as long as they are\nappraised with a reasonable degree of intellectual awareness, there is\nevery reason to expect that they may provide very useful first steps\ntowards an understanding of modern situations and potentialities. And\nif this is true for a case study of a single country, the attainment of\nthat higher degree of generality implied by comparative studies must\nsurely be even more useful.\n\nThat this sort of study is concerned with the growth of presently in-\ndustrialized societies (which, i?so facto, are different from presently\nbackward economies) does not, to my mind, reduce the usefulness of\nhistorical work. And this is so for two reasons. First, as an Englishman\nknows only too well, it is not only preindustrial societies which have\neconomic problems in the 1960's. And the economic history of\n\"advanced\" lands is surely not irrelevant to their economic present.\nSecond, even were we to decide, in Professor Gerschenkron's terminol-\nogy, that discontinuities in the historical scale of economic backward-\nness mean that we cannot assimilate modern Eastern problems to eigh-\nteenth- and nineteenth-century Western problems, it is still likely that\nour approach to the former can benefit\u2014-and benefit considera-\nbly\u2014\u00edrom our conclusions about the latter.\n\nMoreover, it is not only the economic history of industrializing\ncountries which is involved in this sort of argument.

More particularly, they tend to criticize historians for not\nachieving something that most historians very rarely set out to do. And\nthey are naturally disappointed when, looking for universal hypotheses,\nthey find that economic history does not yield what it cannot produce.\n\nBut, since this is ostensibly a discussion of economic history and I\nam a historian, my task ought to be to confess rather than to accuse.\nAnd in this respect it is obvious that economic historians frequently\nfail to aim for that degree of analytical sophistication which would\nmake for better history\u2014let alone a more fruitful relevance to current\nproblems. As Professor North suggests, one of the most serious weak-\nnesses of much (although by no means all) economic history has been\nthe tendency to use implicit or rank bad theorizing, the implications of\nwhich are ignored. That is, historians too often make use of explanato-\nry frameworks in which the analytical relationships are confused or\nunexplored; which lack explicit conceptual definition; and which oscil-\nlate violently between, on the one hand, desperate and unstructured\nhypotheses to the effect that *Tife is complicated and everything affects\neverything else,\" and, on the other hand, simplistic, unicausal hypo-\ntheses which tell us little if anything about dynamic processes.

I should like now to balance its pessimistic exaggerations by using\nthe power of more positive thinking.\n\nFirst, I should emphasize an important methodological implication\nof what I have been saying. If the worth of economic history is severe-\nly limited insofar as it eschews explicit \"theorizing,\" and if the rele-\nvance of history to current problems in part depends upon the nature\nof its application, then in fact the distinction between economics and\neconomic history is far less precise than many traditionalists would\nhave us believe. History (that is, worthwhile history) becomes a dia-\nlogue between certain types of facts and certain types of conceptual ap-\nproaches; and this is a broad definition which applies equally to eco-\nnomics, with the proviso that the facts may be different and that the\noperational usefulness of the concepts may vary. In this sense, eco-\nnomic history as a continuing discourse between the past stream of\nevents and theory becomes merely a variation of economics as a dis-\ncourse between the present stream of facts and theory.\n\nSecond, however, one is bound to ask whether the concrete results of\nattempts to understand such processes in the past are sufficiently illu-\n"], "2": ["100 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nno a priori reason to expect that historical study and observation will\nbe substantially less fruitful than any other ritual for the generation of\nconcepts and hypotheses potentially useful in our approach to current\neconomic problems.\n\nHaving, then, like a good historian, spent some time dealing with a\nquestion I said I would ignore, what about those questions we have\nleft?\n\nIn general, my answer to the main question is that history is, or can\nbe, very relevant to the contemporary economic scene. And I would\nargue (along with other and better men before me) that this relevance\nlies less in the provision of timeless examples of socioeconomic pro-\ncesses than in the use of economic history as a source of expectation\nabout such processes. From time to time, no doubt, the direct parallels\nbetween past and present will be both clear and significant. Far more\noften, however, the nature of change will preclude history repeating\nitself in any useful way. And, as a result, the most we can expect is\nthat our systematic study of the past will yield an approach to rather\nthan a set of conclusions about our own world. That the expectations\nand analytical framework which we derive from, say, the study of\npreindustrial Europe could be of considerable use as shaping and guid-\ning influences for research into current economic problems seems to me\nto be a significant fact. And this remains true (indeed, its significance\nis, if anything, enhanced) even if these expectations are frustrated or\nhave to be modified in the course of their application. I hope it is not\nnecessary for me to emphasize that the past is not a unique avenue for\nunderstanding the present; and certainly history itself is not a substi-\ntute for research or ratiocination. But I fail to see why a historical\nperspective could not be a powerful weapon in the armory of economic\nresearch\u2014at least as long as we remember its limitations as well as its\npotentialities.

However, if this were done, I believe one would typi-\ncally find that the fit of the regression line based on the much longer\nspan is poor, and that the number of observations available in the\nshorter span for fitting a new line is very limited.\n\nOne naturally turns therefore to time series. Here, one finds a sec-\nond body of evidence commonly used in the testing of growth models;\nnamely, the experience of individual underdeveloped countries. This is\nobviously relevant, and such studies are desirable. There is sometimes\na tendency to treat a given case as unique, but I am sure most scholars\nwould strongly advocate attempts at comparative study. The only\nquestion is: Should one confine oneself to presently underdeveloped\ncountries? What of the early experience of Japan? Of Argentina and\nChile? Of Southern and Eastern European nations such as Spain,\nItaly, Bulgaria, Poland, and Finland, not to mention the experience at\nstill earlier dates of nations in Northern and Western Europe?\n\nIn this way we return to the question with which we started: Has the\nearly history of developed nations any relevance to currently underde-\nveloped areas? When one approaches it in this manner, however, the\nburden of proof would seem to be on he who would prejudge the ques-\ntion in the negative; on the person who would arbitrarily draw a line\nand say the experience of all these earlier countries is sui generis. At\nthe very least, one can say: it seems premature to exclude from study\nany potentially relevant experience; there is precious little to go by as\nit is.\n"], "2": ["Push Factors\n\nTo dispose first of purely deductive models, such as those of the\nJoan Robinson or Kaldor type, certainly no one denies the importance\nand necessity of theory.

Another source of error is to confuse target variables with deci-\nsion variables, in the terminology of decision theory, and to try to op-\nerate directly on the target variables. Experiments with price control\nand exchange control are familiar examples of this kind of error. His-\ntorical experience, by demonstrating the long-run effects of such er-\nrors, can powerfully supplement the didactic warning of the theorist.\nHowever relevant and important historical experience may be for\nproblems of short-run policy, by far the most interesting cases intellec-\ntually are those which arise from long-run problems, defined as prob-\nlems of structural change. It is significant that the last twenty years,\nduring which economists have once more become increasingly con-\ncerned with problems of economic growth and development, have also\nwitnessed a marked revival of economists! interest in economic history.\nSince the essence of economic development is fundamental structural\nchange, one might say that the business of policy-makers in underde-\nveloped countries is to promote, encourage, or otherwise bring about\nfavorable structural change. The characteristic business of the eco-\nnomic historian, on the other hand, is to describe, analyze, and explain\nstructural change. Moreover, any theory of structural change must, in\norder to command respect, be tested against historical or long-term\ndata.

Second,\nsince all empirical work is by its very definition economic history, the sequence [of\ncourses] introduces the student to the techniques of empirical testing of economic hypoth-\neses.

Most graduate students in their ad-\nvanced research and subsequently in their careers specialize in partic-\nular sectors or aspects of the economy; typically, also, they employ\npredominantly the method of static or comparative-statics partial\nequilibrium analysis in dealing with short-run problems. The study of\neconomic history forces them to look at whole economies in their geo-\ngraphic, political, social, and cultural setting; to explore the interac-\ntions between different sectors of the economy and between the econo-\nmy and its environment; to observe the variety of responses to eco-\nnomic problems in human history; and most important, it forces them\nto contemplate the problems and processes of economic change\nthrough time.

But I know no reason to sup-\npose that the study should or will disappear. Why then does it appear\nto be declining?

If because of our insecurity we look upon the history\nof economic analysis largely as a method of teaching economic theory,\nwe are very likely to view that history as an accumulation of present\ntruth, as was the tendency in traditional histories of science. It is cer-\ntainly desirable that we have as accurate a record as possible of the\nsources of modern theory, but exclusive concentration upon this has\nsome serious drawbacks. Historical distortions are created when, for\nexample, Quesnay's significance is viewed as the discoverer of input-\noutput; when Ricardo's value theory is viewed as an explanation of\nrelative prices; or when Viner's theory of the firm is identified as\nMarshall's. It also neglects some fascinating intellectual puzzles. In\nthe history of science, scholars have recently tended to look upon past\nscientific concepts, not so much as \"false,\" but rather as impressive\nscientific accomplishments for their time, which were accepted for\ngood reasons, although they were later rejected for good reasons. More\nserious efforts to see logical coherence in past theoretical con-\ncepts\u2014productive and unproductive labor, Mill's propositions on capi-\ntal, or the wages fund\u2014might lead us to find some logical validity even\n\n* As quoted by M.

For the acceptance of Veblen's thoroughgoing\nalternative paradigm would have meant the abolition of economics as\nit was known, as alchemy was abolished by chemistry; or the\nindefinite establishment of two separate disciplines, as astrology was\nseparated from astronomy. Again the consensus is illustrated by the\nfact that economic history (so often in the past a source of subversive\nmovements and at best maintaining a cold war status relative to\ntheory) shows signs in the *new\" economic history of coming into the\nfold. Needless to say, this is no guarantee that a major revolution will\nnever occur. While I think the consensus may be broader and deeper\nthan it has ever been, it is not universal, and some, like Herbert Simon,\ncall for a major reorientation of economics along psychological lines\u2014as\ndid Veblen.\n\nIt might be argued that the consensus of which I speak follows tau-\ntologically from the definitions of \"economists\" and economic\ntheory\" which I am using. In a trivial sense this is, of course, true; but\nit is also an empirical proposition.

If asked, according to\nSchumpeter, the Saracen might spontaneously reply, \u00abThe Word of the\nProphet\"; but if he had a philosophical bent, he might after a\nmoment's reflection reply, *Because I am a man.\" To ask why aca-\ndemic institutions study historical origins is to question a major part\nof academic activity; and among those historical origins is the history\n\nof economics.

The establishment of utility theory on the one hand and its over-\nthrow (despite the retention of the term) by Pareto and his followers\nmay be others.

Just where the dividing line\nlies between a major further extension of the basic model and the revo-\nlutionary overthrow of a submodel may involve an arbitrary element,\nand this arbitrariness may have its source in a certain ambiguity in\nKuhn's conception of the paradigm.* But economics has never had a\nmajor revolution; its basic maximizing model has never been replaced.\nWhether this is good or bad (and the fact is the despair of some), it is,\nI think, remarkable when compared to the physical sciences that an\neconomist's fundamental way of viewing the world has remained un-\nchanged since the eighteenth century. Since economic theory has ob-\nvious connections with economic policies over which economists! pas-\nsions are so easily aroused and considering that these policies have been\nso vigorously debated by economists past and present, it is a tribute to\nthe supremacy of purely positivistic intellectual forces that such has\nbeen the case.\n\nOn the other hand, lacking basic revolutions, we have had major, if\nunsuccessful, rebellions. Certainly the historicists of the nineteenth\nand the institutionalists of the early twentieth centuries were a (not\nso) \"narrow subdivision of the scientific community\" who had a \"sense\n. .. that an existing paradigm\" had \"ceased to function adequately in\nthe exploration of . . . nature.\" As in science, \"competing articulations\n.. . explicit discontent, and the recourse to philosophy and to debate\nover fundamentals\" were all symptoms of a crisis.

Thus from basic models \"spring particu-\nlar coherent traditions of scientific research\" (p. 10) which develop\nthe promise inherent in the basic model *by extending the knowledge\nof these facts that the paradigm displays as particularly revealing, by\nincreasing the extent of the match between those facts and the para-\ndigm's predictions, and by further articulation of the paradigm itself?\n(p. 24).\n\nResearch, which consists in the further development of such basic\nmodels, and which defines scientific communities, has both strengths\nand weaknesses. It has a criterion for choosing problems \"that .. . can\nbe assumed to have solutions\" (p. 37) and for gathering data which\nare relevant; for these reasons, normal research can be highly produc-\ntive, but it is essentially *mopping up operations\" (p. 24). On the\nother hand, normal research does not \"test\" the basic model, the\nsoundness of which is taken for granted. Normal research \"seems an\nattempt to force nature into the preformed and relatively inflexible box\nthat the paradigm supplies\" (p. 24). Phenomena \"that will not fit are\noften not seen at all\" (ibid.) or at least are put aside for future prob-\nlem solving. *Nor do scientists normally aim to invent new theories,\nand they are often intolerant of those invented by others\" (ibid.).\n\nOccasionally, revolutions occur. In the further development of a\nbasic model, empirical anomalies appear, the resolution of which can\nnormally be postponed. But if enough such anomalies occur, or if they\nare particularly critical, a crisis emerges which may shatter the tradi-\ntion:\n\nConfronted with anomaly or with crisis, scientists take a different attitude toward\nexisting paradigms, and the nature of their research changes accordingly. The proliferation\nof competing articulations, the willingness to try anything, the expression of explicit dis-\ncontent, the recourse to philosophy and to debate over fundamentals, all these are\nsymptoms of a transition from normal to extraordinary research (p. 90).\n\nScientific revolutions are inaugurated by a growing sense . . . that an existing paradigm\nhas ceased to function adequately in the exploration of an aspect of nature to which that\nparadigm itself had previously led the way (p. 91).\n\n\"They are:\n\n. . . those non-cumulative developmental episodes in which an older paradigm is replaced\nin whole or in part by an incompatible new one (p. 91).\n\nSmith's postulate of the maximizing individual in a relatively free\nmarket and the successful application of this postulate to a wide varie-\nty of specific questions is our basic paradigm.

Both common sense and a decent\nhumility suggest the opposite answer.\n\nSome perspective may be gained on the place of the history of anal-\nysis in training professional economists by asking under what condi-\ntions, in time or cross-sectionally, is the history of a discipline consid-\nered an essential part of professional training in that field. Impression-\nistic answers are easier to gain cross-sectionally, and it may be useful\nto rephrase the question: In what contemporary fields will the study of\n*original sources\" be deemed important? In literature and the creative\narts, the professional gains his education by exposure to the works of\nother writers or artists, principally from earlier periods. Textbooks\nother than collections or reader guides are deemphasized. In many of\nthe social sciences\u2014and perhaps in philosophy\u2014textbooks play a larg-\ner role. But in many of these areas parallel readings from original\nsources and from the \"classics\" of the field are an essential part of\nlearning the discipline. So far as I can gather, the training of natural\nscientists relies almost exclusively on textbooks until, in his third or\nfourth year of graduate work, the student begins his own research.\n\nEconomics lies somewhere between the extremes but surely closer to\nthe natural sciences than to the humanities, and perhaps further in\nthat direction than any other social science. Consider the subjects,\nphysical theory, economic theory, and political theory. The first two\nare largely learned from textbooks; the latter is virtually defined as\nthe history of the subject.\n\nWe do not have to be so arrogant as to insist that we, like the natu-\nral scientists, have seen the basic truth and that we do not need to\nknow from whence it came. It is true, however, that to an extent that I\ndo not think economists fully comprehend, we have in economic theory\na degree of consensus around a basic model, which makes us closer to\nthe natural sciences than to some other fields. This can be put in per-\nspective by a comparison of the history of economics with the history\nof the natural sciences.\n\nAccording to a recent interpretation of the history of science by T.\nS. Kuhn;? a \"normal science\" emerges historically when a \"universally\nrecognized scientific achievement\" provides *model problems and solu-\ntions to a community of practitioners\" (p. x). These achievements or\nparadigms, as Kuhn calls them, attract \"an enduring group of\nadherents\" away from random fact gathering and competing models.\n\n*'T. S.

This appears\nto be an increasingly common distinction, and without denying or\naffirming any causal connections running either way, I think it logical-\nly valid and useful.\n\nIs a knowledge of the history of economic analysis a necessary con-\ndition for understanding current conventional economic theory?

When Cairnes denounced the Victorians for believing in laissez\nfaire, we may infer that he did not believe in it but not that they did.\n\nWhat the economists have written needs to be supplemented by\nother information. The work of economic historians is especially help-\nful.

The failing is noticeable when the historians have related meas-\nures, such as child labor laws, to what they took to be the policy of the\neconomists of the time, such as the supposed laissez faire of the Vic-\ntorians.

Such details, so I sense from listening in on the spokesmen for\n*new economic history,\" can be left to the political historians, or to the\ndying race of \"old economic historians.\" A primary task of the new\neconomic history, as I gather it, is to measure and to interpret\nmeasurements. To do that it is important, not to know what men\nthought about such relations in 1750, 1810, 1876, or 1929, but what\nmodern economic analysis tells us about such relations. If David\nHume conceived of international adjustment primarily in terms of\nprice changes brought about by exports and imports of specie, that\ndoes not mean that income changes, structural changes, or cost-push\ninflation may not be useful, even essential, concepts in explaining bal-\nance-of-payments adjustment in the age of Hume.\n\nThe views of Hume, Smith, Ricardo, Torrens, Bagehot, Marshall, or\nKeynes may be essential to explaining why policies were adapted that\naffected the course of economic history; but the assumption that their\ntheory explains events that followed is a quite different matter. Hume's\nfailure to give weight to income changes; Marshall's assumption that,\nfor all practical purposes, savings would be automatically transmuted\ninto investment; and Keynes's failure to develop a permanent income\nhypothesis or to recognize adequately the role of expenditures on con-\nsumer durables, do not mean that relationships envisaged by these con-\ncepts were not at work, even though nobody at the time knew that\nthey were. To draw an analogy from medicine: contemporary medical\nbelief that a disastrous epidemic was caused or cured by particular\nconditions may be very important in explaining its history; but if\ntoday we want to have the full story of that epidemic, it is necessary to\ndraw upon ideas unknown to men when the disease was raging.\n\nAII this is tricky business: to know on what points a knowledge of\nhistory of economic throught is essential in explaining events; on what\npoints the relevant economic thought is that of today. But writing his-\ntory of any sort, if well done, is tricky business. The increasing sophis-\ntication of economic theory on the relationship of economic variables\nand the miracles of modern computers have opened new horizons to\neconomic historians.

The same may be true of\ntransfer in space, as when the French economist, J. B. Courcelle Sen-\nuiel, came to Chile as economic adviser in the 1850's and gave Chilean\neconomic theory for several decades a laissez faire tone that exceeded\nthat prevailing in England and the Continent. However, in the present\nera of almost pathological nationalism and anticolonialism in many\nsmaller countries the reverse may be true: a theory developed in a\nmore industrialized country of higher incomes, no matter how relevant\nit may be to other situations, is likely to face conditioned opposition on\nthe ground that, at best, it does not apply to local conditions; at worst,\nthat it is an imperialistic snare. There is no neat formula to give the\nright judgment in such cases, but those who are trying to record and\nevaluate the economic thought of the past and those who are trying to\nrecord and interpret economic history must be alert to the possibility\nthat the causal sequence may be in either or in both directions.\n\nClosely allied to the impact of economic thought upon economic his-\ntory is a different concept: the use that the economic historian of\ntoday should make of economic theory\u2014old or new\u2014in interpreting\nthe past. There are two aspects of this problem. The first is to explain\nlegislation or other decisions of economic importance: the English\nBank Act of 1844, the Federal Reserve Act, the Hawley-Smoot Tariff,\nor the Employment Act of 1946. 'To do this it is important to grasp the\neconomic thought of the time insofar as it was a causal influence on\npolicy. In the case of the Bank Act of 1844 the body of doctrine, com-\nmonly known as the currency principle, was the result partly of eco-\nnomic developments from 1825 on: bank runs by noteholders and the\nfeeling that it was particularly important to put the Bank of England\nin a position to withstand such runs; and partly of the rising tide of\nfree-trade philosophy that made an increasing proportion of the articu-\nlate public feel that, on general grounds, the less discretion the Bank\nof England had, the better. And I would suggest that an important rea-\nson, rarely mentioned by historians, economic or political, for the refus-\nal of Parliament to repeal the Bank Act after the crisis of 1847 was\nthe failure in that crisis of the Governor of the Bank of England and\ntwo other directors of the Bank. Regardless of the weakness of the theo-\nry of the Bank Act, a move to restore greater discretion over monetary\nand banking affairs to a group whose own members had not been able\nto manage their own finances faced a heavy emotional handicap. To\nshift to the American scene a century later: we cannot explain the\nwording of the Employment Act of 1946, that if read literally was a\nmandate for inflation, no matter how great, if that inflation would re-\nduce unemployment by one person, except as against the background\nof a body of theory, born of the Great Depression, that proclaimed that\n"], "4": ["HISTORY OF ECONOMIC THOUGHT 139\n\nAgainst the background of the economic history of England from\nthe early 1820's until 1914\u2014and particularly until the 1880's\u2014I find\nno such curiosity or mystery as Keynes felt that he had found for the\nvirtual disappearance of the theory of effective demand from English\neconomics. But it would have been a curiosity and a mystery had Eng-\nlish economists, no matter how welfare-minded or how brilliant their\nintellectual equipment, given much thought to problems of aggregate\ndemand and full employment when so many other problems had a\nhigher priority on the agenda of challenging ideas and of social and\neconomic betterment: adequate wages when employed, repeal of corn\nlaws, regulating working conditions of women and children, abolition\nof tithes, controlling the abuses of banking, increasing educational op-\nportunities, abolishing the sinecures of a government of the aristocra-\ncy, widening the political franchise. I find it hard to believe that the\nEnglish handloom weaver barely able to survive on the earnings of a\ntwelve-hour day, the English woman on hands and knees toiling in the\nmines, the child chimney sweep, or the domestic servant on a seven-\nday week, felt that the major shortcoming of economists was their fail-\nure to grapple with the problem of unemployment. In the early weeks\nof the beginning course in economics we tell our students that econom-\nics deals with the choices involved in making effective use of scarce re-\nsources, and that human time and energy are scarce resources. To have\nexpected economists between 1820 and 1914 to have given a high\npriority to full employment is to deny our own teachings and to miss\nentirely the economic and political setting of the times.\n\nIn the same vein, the development of banking theory in the United\nStates for some fifteen years before 1913 reflected concern with the\nneed for short-run flexibility in the monetary supply, and particularly\nin currency, to take care of seasonal movements and panics. In the\nlight of the banking problems that the country had faced and the\nbanking practices of the time, the idea of tying Federal Reserve ad-\nvances to short dated paper was not as foolish as it appears when we\nsee what such a commercial loan theory of the proper quantity of\nmoney did to inhibit the Federal Reserve System from dealing more\neffectively with the tragic years from 1929 to 1933.\n\nMy remarks so far have stressed the impact of history upon\nthought, and the need to interpret the economic thought of the past in\nthe light both of the problems of the time and of the institutional set-\nting in which economic life was carried on.

For a number of reasons, both political and eco-\nnomic, there are objections to abandoning a truly multilateral frame-\nwork for dealing with world liquidity problems and confining such a\nScheme to the ten leading industrial nations. Leaving aside the political\nproblems, a number of thorny questions would need to be resolved\nconcerning the economic relationships between the in-group and the\nrest of the world.\n\nThe main alternatives to the CRU proposal would work through the\nInternational Monetary Fund, and would involve the creation of an\ninternational reserve asset in the form of gold tranche or other claims\non the Fund. The IMF gold tranche\u2014or, more broadly, that part of\nthe quota which is available on a virtually automatic basis\u2014is an im-\nportant example of the evolutionary possibilities that exist in the pres-\nent international monetary system. For years, people tended to think\nof the gold tranche as fixed in amount without paying much, if any,\nattention to the rising gold tranche positions of countries whose cur-\nrencies were being drawn by other countries. These positions are re-\nserve assets in a very real sense; since 1957 the United States has been\nable, in financing its own balance-of-payments deficit, to utilize rough-\nly $1.7 billion of its gold tranche. Most of the amount so used originat-\ned in previous dollar drawings by other countries, not in the U.S. gold\nsubscription.

It is widely\nrecognized and was emphasized in the Group of Ten report, that there\nis a close, two-way connection between the adjustment process and the\namount of international liquidity needed. The trick, of course, is to in-\nsure that the international financial system can and will provide indi-\nvidual countries with enough liquidity to facilitate an orderly process\nof adjustment, without recourse to undesirable deflationary actions or\n\"beggar-my-neighbor\" policies, but not so much as to enable countries\nto ignore the need for internal adjustments to restore equilibrium.\n\nRecognizing these interconnections, the Group of Ten report recom-\nmended that Working Party-3 of OECD undertake a study of the\nprocess of adjustment involved in correcting imbalances in interna-\ntional payments, with a view to determining appropriate policies for\navoiding or minimizing such imbalances.

Such coop-\neration reflects the close consultation and mutual appraisal of financial\npolicies impinging on international payments flows in Working Party-3\nof OECD, in meetings of the Ministers and Governors of the Group of\nTen, and in monthly meetings at Basle of the Central Bank Governors.\n\nThe results of this increased financial cooperation are apparent in\nthe agreement among the Group of Ten to participate in the General\nArrangements to Borrow,\" providing a sizable addition to Fund re-\nsources; in the ad Aoc, Basle type, arrangements in which central\nbanks have provided assistance bilaterally; in the network of Federal\nReserve swaps and stand-by swap arrangements, now totaling over $2\nbillion; in the investment of over $1 billion in Roosa-bonds; and, most\nrecently and dramatically, in the $3 billion of credit to the United\nKingdom arranged by eleven countries.\n\nMultilateral surveillance adds to and strengthens this cooperative\nprocess; in a sense we have substituted for the sometimes harsh and\ndisruptive discipline of the gold standard a process of multilateral re-\nview and cooperative assistance that assures possible further elabora-\ntion and use of the new types of bilateral and other credit facilities\nthat have been developed in recent years.

The Deputies of the Ten examined the principal rele-\nvant considerations and in their own discussions reiterated the need for\nboth. As to the gold price, they concluded that changing it would be a\ncrude and arbitrary way of trying to increase liquidity, would run the\nclear risk of reducing liquidity, and would be definitely damaging to\nthe present monetary system.\n\nAs to a system of fluctuating exchange rates, the Deputies agreed it\nwould be undesirable for a number of reasons. In their view it would\nadversely affect internal monetary stability because of the absence of\nbalance-of-payments discipline and the effects on the general price\nlevel when the exchange rate changes. They also felt that such a sys-\ntem would introduce an additional element of uncertainty (and cost)\ninto international trade and investment; in practice, would stimulate\nspeculation and disequilibrating capital flows; and would seriously en-\nlarge the risks inherent in foreign trade. Its broad effect, they agreed,\nwould be to restrict rather than to expand international transactions,\nand to encourage national isolation rather than increased economic in-\ntegration internationally.\n\nFunctioning of the Present System and Present\nAdequacy of Liquidity\n\nSecond, as to the functioning of the present system, the G-10 report\nemphasizes that it \"has shown a great capacity for adapting itself to\ngrowth and change, has facilitated the remarkable economic progress\nachieved since the war, and has withstood with success periods of po-\nlitical and other strain although many countries are still faced with\ninflationary pressures and others still have unemployed resources.\"\nThe report points up how the reserve currencies have, in an evolu-\ntionary way, become an important supplement to gold, not as a result\n"], "1": ["The general topic for this panel, The Evolving International Mone-\ntary Mechanism,\" itself suggests what is to me the essential achieve-\nment of the Report of the Group of Ten.

The truth is, as the Fund\nhas pointed out for years in its annual report and in public speeches,\nthat the theory of domestic money has only a quite limited validity as\na model for a theory of international liquidity. Domestically the regu-\nlation of the money supply is a means by which central authorities act\nto induce a desired reaction in the economy. They expect the millions\nof firms and households to respond to the tightening and loosening of\nmonetary conditions, influencing them in this manner rather than by\ndirect controls or by fiscal action. The control that can be exercised\ndomestically by monetary action is by no means perfect, but it works\ntolerably well.\n\nThe management of international liquidity is different in many rele-\nvant aspects.\n\nFirst, there is not the same distinction between the authority that\ndetermines the amount of liquidity and those that are to respond to\nthis decision. Any decisions on liquidity will be taken jointly by the\nsame small group of people who then, in their national capacities, are\nexpected to adjust policies in the light of the amount of liquidity at\ntheir disposal.\n\nSecond, it is by no means obvious that the regulation of internation-\nal liquidity will be the most effective instrument to induce countries to\nfollow policies that are considered desirable from an international\npoint of view. There is no lack of examples of countries which, even\nthough they have no reserves left and no access to credit except per-\nhaps on frankly political grounds, continue the most crudely\ninflationary policies. And one further point that is of general validity\nbut has perhaps been most vividly brought home by recent develop-\nments: liquidity measures can change the degree of ease felt by\na country, but it requires a great deal of further understanding among\ncountries\u2014be it by general rules or by ad Aoc negotiation\u2014to ensure\nthat financial tightness leads to corrective action that is of a generally\ndesired character.\n"], "3": ["160 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nOne evidence of this is a far more sophisticated terminology. Thus,\nliquidity is clearly seen as a broad spectrum of resources available to\nmeet balance-of-payments deficits, ranging from readily available as-\nsets to resources that may be available only after extensive negotia-\ntion. Within this spectrum, a distinction is now generally made be-\ntween, on the one hand, liquidity in the form of reserves, or *uncondi-\ntional liquidity,\" and, on the other hand, that part of international li-\nquidity that consists of countries! access to credit facilities, the latter\nusually of a \"conditional\" character. Not only is the distinction made,\nbut views are also increasingly cryptallizing as to the relative merits\nand roles of the two types of liquidity. Possession of an adequate\namount of unconditional liquidity allows countries to engage in policies\nthat may entail balance-of-payments difficulties with the knowledge\nthat they will be able to meet such difficulties should they material-\nize\u2014but, of course, with the concomitant risk for the world at large\nthat policies may be pursued with too little regard for the possible\ninflationary effects on others. Conditional liquidity is better able to en-\nsure that the international point of view will be brought to bear on the\naction of countries with respect to their balance-of-payments policies;\nbut this may entail the risk that countries may needlessly restrain ex-\npansionary policies for fear of having to submit to the views of inter-\nnational agencies or of other countries when they may need balance-of-\npayments assistance. The discussion on this point would appear to have\nproduced a certain measure of agreement that there is a need, and,\nwith an expanding world economy, a growing need for both types of\nliquidity in some balanced way\u2014which does not necessarily mean that\nthe present proportions between the two should be preserved.\n\nFurther along the same line, a consensus appears to have arisen to\nthe effect that the level of reserves (as well as their composition and\ndistribution) is a matter of importance to the world economy even\nthough there remains considerable disagreement or uncertainty as to\nhow the need for reserves should be measured and whether the present\nlevel of reserves is too large or too small. This consensus then leads to\nthe next step; namely, a tentative, but probably an irreversible, recog-\nnition that if the \"natural forces\" on which the world has so far relied\nfor its supply of international liquidity do not produce an adequate\nsupply of such liquidity in the future, it would be proper and neces-\nsary, in some appropriate way, deliberately to proceed to the man-\nmade provision of reserves.

First, it created a new international asset, in the form of a loan\nclaim on the Fund, which eight countries now hold as part of their re-\nserves for a total amount of U.S. $405 million. Similar in most liquidi-\nty respects to the \"gold tranche positions\" in the Fund (of which over\nseventy countries hold a total of about U.S. $4 billion in their re-\nserves), these new reserve assets may point the way towards further\nmeans of liquidity creation by the Fund. Second, and perhaps of larger\nimmediate importance, the first actual operation of the arrangement\nproved that it could be worked and thus raised by a number of notches\nthe liquidity value of this U.S. $6 billion arrangement. The size and\nthe rapidity of the U.S. $3 billion central bank support operation for\nsterling staged just a month ago proved once more the cohesion that\nhas been created among the monetary authorities of the industrial\ncountries.

The work done during that year was published,\nin August, 1964, as Chapters 3 and 4 of the Fund's Annual Report.\nChapter 3 gives a broad analysis of the general issues of international\nliquidity; Chapter 4 analyses the Fund as a source of liquidity and in-\ndicates the further contributions that the Fund can make towards the\nprovision of international liquidity: in the immediate future by an in-\ncrease in quotas and, potentially, by a variety of new techniques that\nare briefly sketched at the end of this chapter. These two chapters of\nthe Fund's Annual Report and the liquidity report of the Ten? are in\nmany respects related documents. Not only were they, by design, re-\nleased to the public on the same day, but there had also been close\nlinks between those who participated in the writing of these two docu-\nments. There are, to be sure, important differences between the two\nreports. The report of the Ten is a document written by high officials\nof ten governments.

Both represent important steps towards a fuller\nunderstanding of the problem of international liquidity and towards\nconstructive action with respect to this problem.\n\nThese two reports do not represent the final stage of the intensive\nwork on international liquidity; the subject has been carried consid-\nerably further by what happened since their release.

To solve this problem is the\nchief concern of those who advocate a semiautomatic gold standard or\nflexible exchange rates. With such differences in their functions, the\ndifferent proposals need not be incompatible with one another, and\nvarious combinations seem possible. Thus, certain features of the semi-\nautomatic gold standard, promoting \"adjustment,\" may well be com-\nbined with multiple currency-reserve holding as a means toward in-\ncreasing the growth of \"liquidity.\" Similarly, centralized reserve crea-\ntion, to increase \"liquidity,\" may go together with limited exchange\nrate flexibility, securing faster adjustment.\"\n\nThe possibility of such combinations may lead to unexpected coali-\ntions and alliances in the debates about improved international ar-\nrangements. Since it is almost inconceivable that any one group or\ncountry will get its favorite plan accepted, the recognition that various\nproposals are not genuine alternatives but are mutually compatible\nmay eventually promote compromises with which all of us can live.\n\nThe Utility of the Exercise\n\nThere are those who cannot see any value in a report about the\nSources of disagreement on economic proposals. They think that econ-\nomists who make conflicting recommendations cancel out one another,\nleaving a sum of zero. And that, furthermore, if we descend to a lower\nlevel of the economists! disagreements, namely, to the underlying argu-\nments, to the factual and normative assumptions, the result is the\nsame: zero. It is sad that economists disagree; to know why they dis-\nagree does not improve matters\u2014in the view of these skeptics.\n\nThis skepticism I regard as unwholesome, as sheer obscurantism.\nThere is a world of difference, I submit, between unreasoned conflict\nand reasoned disagreement. Only by examining the underlying as-\nsumptions can we ever hope to resolve conflicts of opinion. This is not\njust an empty principle or a pious hope. The thirty-two economists\nhave seen the principle in action: they saw how some members of their\ngroup changed their views about certain plans or about certain fea-\ntures of certain plans after they had isolated and dissected the pre-\nviously hidden assumptions that have to be satisfied if these plans are\nto work in the intended fashion.?^ For, while some of the factual as-\n\n? As an illustration, I may explain how I changed my views regarding unlimited, un-\nmanaged flexibility of exchange rates.

In this\ninstance, therefore, I have to explain and defend the inclusion of an\nissue which the government experts apparently did not regard as an\nissue.\n\nThe report of the Thirty-two explains what it means by the prob-\nlem of confidence. Foreign holders of dollars and sterling might, at any\ntime, wish to convert their holdings into gold. This could happen even\nin the absence of basic deficits of the United States and the United\nKingdom, and in the absence of a shortage of \"international liquidity.\"\nWhile such demands for conversion would, of course, create new\nproblems of adjustment and new problems of inadequate liquidity, the\nproblem of confidence in some of the existing reserve assets can arise\nindependently. To say that it can arise is not to say that it is likely to\narise\u2014but some economists would be reassured if the *overhang\" of\ndollars and sterling were somehow funded or consolidated.\n\nOthers deny that this problem is urgent, and as evidence they point\nto the reassuring \"growth of cooperation and consultation among cen-\ntral banks\" (p. 61). As long as this cooperation continues and as long\nas the major countries realize their common interest in the viability\nand stability of the international monetary system, one need not fear\nthat any country will precipitate massive flights out of one or both of\nthe present reserve currencies. Indeed, negotiating an arrangement for\n\"consolidation\" might be riskier than leaving things alone.\n\nIn reply to these objections, those in favor of removing the threats\nof a \"collapsing overhang\" state that consolidation may take forms\nthat would not imply an exchange of liquid funds against less liquid\nclaims. Consolidation through interposition of a guarantor would in-\ncrease the liquidity of the reserve-currency holders as well as of the\nreserve-currency issuers. Even if one argues that the nongovernment\neconomists have exaggerated the urgency of solving the problem of\nconfidence, one can hardly exaggerate the desirability of solving it.\n\nSubstitutes or Complements\nThe four plans, systems, or approaches analyzed by the Group of\nThirty-two are commonly considered as disjunctive alternatives. This\nwas also the presumption in the minds of the economists when they\nbegan their discussions. They soon discovered *a complementarity be-\ntween proposals they had first thought to be rivals\" (p. 105).\n", "INTERNATIONAL MONETARY MECHANISM 175\n\neign funds to countries in deficit, is the original sin of central-banking\ntheory.

I\nhave the impression that some of the disagreements within the Group\nof Ten go back to the uneasy feeling of some central bankers that net\nreserves and borrowing \u00edacilities have rather different functions, and\nthat their fusion in a vague concept of international liquidity serves\nconfusion more than anything else.\n\nI share these apprehensions. To secure the international monetary\nsystem against shocks and disturbances from payments imbalances of\nindividual countries is one thing; it is another thing to secure the sys-\ntem against deflationary pressures due to a failure of international re-\nserves to grow at a rate deemed sufficient to sustain the desired growth\nof national money supplies. Borrowing facilities can serve the first but\nnot the second function. I submit that we are witnessing the recurrence\nof an old misconception, which on the domestic level has perplexed\nstudents of monetary theory and policy for a century and a half: the\nconfusion between the supply of credit to borrowers who lack working\ncapital and the supply of money to an economy confronted with a sec-\nular decline in prices and money rates of earnings. It is true that the\ncommercial-banking system has in fact increased the supply of money\nby lending to those who lacked capital and by increasing, in the pro-\ncess, the total credit outstanding. It is also true that the same interna-\ntional arrangements that provide credit to monetary authorities\nsuffering from payments deficits may, in the process, provide for the\nsecular growth in reserves that may be needed to avoid deflationary\npolicies in most countries. This does not justify, however, our continu-\ning confusion in these matters.\n\nThe failure to separate, at least in theoretical analysis, the creation\nof money and the supply of finance (capital) to individuals, firms, and\ngovernments, may be regarded as the original sin of commercial-bank-\ning theory. Likewise, the failure to separate, at least in theoretical\nanalysis, the creation of international reserves and the supply of for-\n\n*IMF, p. 33.\n"], "8": ["INTERNATIONAL MONETARY MECHANISM 173\n\nmeans. This *wide range of internal and external measures\"* enumer-\nated in a list of instruments of economic policy\" differs in operation\nand in side-effects from the forces of adjustment described in classical\ntheory. To treat them as if they were equivalent or even preferable\nsubstitutes for the classical mechanism can be misleading.\n\nIn my opinion, a basic distinction should be made between \"real\nadjustment\"\u2014which refers only to a reallocation of productive re-\nsources and exchanges of goods and services under the influence of\nchanges in relative prices, incomes, and exchange rates\u2014and *compen-\nsating corrections\"\u2014which may affect the current account or the capi-\ntal account by other means and, if successful, may remove the need for\nreal adjustment. I cannot now elaborate on this distinction, but plan to\ndo so on another occasion.\n\nIn one important respect, the Thirty-two are rather unorthodox:\nwhen they analyze the circumstances in which it might be appropriate\nto delay, retard, or inhibit the working of the classical adjustment mech-\nanism (pp. 43-52). This analysis, I believe, represents an advance in\nthe theory of the balance of payments, even if it is not yet, and may\nnever become, practically operational.\n\nThe Problem of Liquidity\n\nOn the problem of liquidity, no less than on that of adjustment, one\ncan find similarities and differences of opinion in the three reports. The\nsimilarities are greatest with regard to the future provision of liquidi-\nty\u2014all the reports agreeing that something will have to be done to\navoid inadequacies in the growth of liquidity\u2014and with regard to the\ndangers of excessive liquidity. On the latter, the Group of Thirty-two\nhas this to say:\n\n(a) excessive liquidity may inhibit both the natural adjustment processes and the pursuit\nof appropriate policies of accelerating adjustment ;\n\n(b) the use of liquidity involves withdrawing real resources from other countries, or\nacquiring claims on their real resources, and so may be unwelcome to them (p. 30).\nSimilar statements can be quoted from the other reports.*\n\n'The most conspicuous differences concerning the problem of liquidi-\nty relate to the treatment of borrowing facilities. Like the other re-\nports, the Thirty-two make various distinctions, such as between\n\"owned reserves, borrowed reserves, and borrowable reserves\" (p. 30),\nor between various sorts of borrowing arrangements. However:\n\nFor concreteness and precision the conferees agreed to confine the concept of the inter-\nnational liquidity of a country to the sum of owned reserves and unconditional drawing\nrights (p. 31).\n\n*IMF, p. 28.\n\" Group of Ten, p. 5.\n* See especially, IMF, pp. 26 and 33.\n", "173\n"], "7": ["172 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\ncannot help realizing that these arrangements \"are becoming increas-\ningly inadequate\" (p. 68).\n\nOn this point all three reports agree. There is at best a difference in\nlanguage, the two official reports being, quite properly, more politic.\nThe Group of Ten, frankly enough, speak of the \"eines of future devel-\nopment,\" of *having recognized the uncertainties concerning the fu-\nture supplies of monetary reserves,\" of various ways *to supplement\nthe existing system by a new type of reserve asset,\" and of the need\nfor studies of how countries *could in the future preserve a better\nbalance-of-payments equilibrium and achieve a faster and more effec-\ntive adjustment of imbalance. And the IMF report regards it as\n*both desirable and timely to enter upon a broad exploration of the\npossible ways to meet any inadequacies in the supply of international\nliquidity to which the present system might otherwise give rise and to\noffset any undesirable fluctuations in it.\"^\n\nIn other words, the need for changes in the international monetary\nsystem is recognized by the official as well as the private experts who\nproduced the three reports. There are those who think that the nongov-\nernment economists are more impatient and more radical; and there\nis much naive talk about \"revolutionary\" designs by the private econ-\nomists, in contrast to \"evolutionary\" moves contemplated by the\nofficial experts. The fact is that academic economists speak more\nbluntly and are prepared to act their proper roles as gad\u00edlies, while\ngovernment representatives are properly diplomatic and coy, and must\npretend to yield only to necessity. Moreover, the international monetary\nsystem has been changing all along and will continue to change. Its\nevolution will surely include steps which some diehards have decried as\nrevolutionary or, even worse, as impractical. I submit that the buzzing\nof the academic gadflies has been extremely important in promoting\nbetter understanding and official appreciation of the issues in question.\n\nThe Problem of Adjustment\n\nAII three reports have a good deal to say about the problem of ad-\njustment of the balance of payments. There are many similarities in\nthe views expressed, but also some differences. By and large, the non-\ngovernment economists are more orthodox and classical than the\nofficial experts. Their stress is on relative prices, incomes, and ex-\nchange rates\u2014that is, on endogenous market variables\u2014whereas the\ngovernment experts place much emphasis on the use of exogenous vari-\nables, policies designed to affect the flow of goods and funds by other\n\n* Ministerial Statement of the Group of Ten and Annex Prepared by Deputies (Aug. 10,\n\n1964), pp. 8, 10, 5.\n5Tnternational Monetary Fund, Annual Report 1964 (Washington, D.C., 1964), p. 32.\n", "172\n"], "6": ["INTERNATIONAL MONETARY MECHANISM 171\n\nsystem?

This has led some readers to the\nerroneous belief that the Group intended to criticize or oppose any of\nthe four approaches. To be sure, the compilation of the necessary or\nrelevant assumptions furnishes a fine collection of arguments to any-\none who wants to criticize or oppose any of the plans under discussion.\nIn order to demonstrate that a particular plan will not work, he has\nonly to select from the list of required assumptions some that appear\nunrealistic. In addition, he may turn to the propositions in Part A of\nthe lists of assumptions underlying the advocacy of alternative ap-\nproaches. For:\n\nAdvocacy implies criticism. One cannot reasonably recommend a plan or approach\nwithout implying that it is in some respects better than what we now have and what\nothers recommend. Hence, a statement of the assumptions which underlie the recommenda-\n\ntion of any plan or approach must include critical propositions about both the present\nsystem and alternative approaches (p. 66).\n\nThus, the assumptions underlying any one approach include proposi-\ntions critical of the others. In the opinion of an otherwise highly critical\nreviewer of the report, *the criticism of the flexible exchange-rate sys-\ntem included in the analysis of the *centralization of reserves! proposal\nmay be considered the best refutation possible in such narrow space.\"\nThe report, I repeat, was not intended to be more critical of any one\napproach than of any other. Criticism of all was implied in a compara-\ntive analysis that attempted to spell out the propositions on which ad-\nvocacy of any of the systems could rest. Criticism, it seems, is more\npersuasive than advocacy, and thus our study may result in a strength-\nening of the opposition to all four approaches analyzed.\n\nIf this were to reinforce the defense of the status quo, the Thirty-\ntwo would probably regret it as an unintended effect of their work.\n\"They had been quite outspoken about their attitude toward the present\narrangements:\n\nSince none of the conferees preferred the present system to all proposed alternatives,\nno statement of propositions supporting its maintenance was prepared (p. 66).\n\nThey need not worry, though. There is no real danger that the present\nsystem will be maintained, no matter how eloquently it is defended in\nsome quarters.

Turning to the implications for balance-of-payments adjustment\nof a conflict of objectives, experience in Europe has shown wide use of\nspecific measures to help correct the external disequilibrium directly,\nand thereby to relieve the domestic economy of some of the burden of\nadjustment. We have mentioned, in particular, measures taken to\ninfluence the inflow or outflow of capital funds of both domestic and\nforeign ownership. Other measures that have been used for this pur-\npose include government debt prepayment, government current trans-\nactions, and changes in tariff rates.\n\n5. The final implication to which we want to draw attention is, how-\never, that a full reconciliation of objectives has not been found feasi-\nble, so that some adaptation of domestic costs and prices to the exter-\nnal position could not be avoided. This, indeed, has been a basic factor\nin the inflationary tendency in continental Europe in recent years, re-\nluctantly acceded to as inherent in the adjustment process. It is for\nthis reason that we said above that the aim of price stability has not\nbeen held as firmly as the other objectives, for it has been generally\nrecognized that to resist all adaptation of costs and prices would mean\nperpetuating the external imbalance.\n\nTo conclude, it has been by inventing and adapting policy instru-\nments that the European countries have sought workable domestic and\nexternal equilibrium with a minimum of conflict. While this has at\ntimes meant some limitation on the conception of convertibility, it has\nalso meant recognizing that convertibility has its own logic in the use\nof policy tools for domestic objectives. We have not discussed the li-\nquidity aspect of the international payments system as being outside\nour subject. The past few years have shown, however, that the difficult\nproblems lie in the use of policy instruments for adjustment purposes\nand in assessing mutual adjustment responsibilities rather than in mo-\nbilizing liquidity in cases of need.\n", "199\n"], "10": ["198 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nin such a case of inadequate export growth to understand, as Mr.\nLloyd did, what the point of the policy must be; namely, to hold back\nthe tide of the wage round sufficiently so that the normal increase of\nproductivity will lead to a more competitive position of costs and\nprices. Otherwise, there is the onus of wage policy without the benefit.\n\nWe may now come back to the two questions with which we started\nto see what \"implications\" of the recent functioning of the economy\nemerge from European experience. To the extent that they have a\nrather new look, these implications result from the two forces pointed\nout in various cases; namely, the continuous rise in wages that seems\nto be inherent in the present negotiation process and the size and sensi-\ntivity of international capital movements that have been in evidence\nsince the return to convertibility.\n\nWe should say first that in Europe the aim of the authorities has\nbeen to achieve the two goals of full employment and external balance\ntogether, without abandoning either one, though with some shift in\npriorities according to the demands of the situation. With regard to the\nobjective of price stability, however, greater compromise has been nec-\nessary. Thus, it is primarily the use of policy instruments that has\nbeen changing rather than the conception of the basic objectives them-\nselves.\n\nThere seem to us five points that deserve to be emphasized:\n\n1. The first is that there has been growing acceptance of, or groping\ntowards, wages policy as an essential tool of economic management.\nThis has come as a response to the fact of ever rising wages, at a rate\nnot very closely related to the state of demand and not easily subject\nto control via the usual instruments of monetary and fiscal policy.\nWages policy has been found necessary for meeting domestic aims\nalone as well as for minimizing the conflict between domestic and ex-\nternal objectives. Needless to say, effective wages policy must rest\nupon appropriate management of total demand.\n\n2. Second, it has been found necessary to recognize, also with re-\nspect to domestic policy, that the use of monetary measures has had to\nbe limited and adapted to what is consistent with the external position.\nIn practice, this has meant giving a degree of priority in monetary pol-\nicy to the external side and to finding ways of managing the rate of\ncredit expansion without relying wholly on interest rates.\n\n3. This limitation on the range over which monetary measures could\nbe used has itself led to more flexible use of fiscal instruments for do-\nmestic purposes in cases of conflict between internal and external ob-\njectives. Forceful tax measures have been used frequently in this con-\nnection, not only to manage overall demand, but to influence specific\ncategories of demand. Equally important, however, has been direct\n"], "9": ["IMPLICATIONS OF EVOLVING MONETARY MECHANISM 197\n\nmestic expansion was allowed to gain reasonable momentum. In conse-\nquence, a policy of restraint has often been necessary and the average\nrate of growth has been low. Thus, the U.K. dilemma has been how to\nget reasonable growth in the face of external weakness.\n\nThe problem was, therefore, rather similar to that of the United\nStates since 1958, except that the United Kingdom has not had a high\nrate of unemployment. Neither has it had the possibility of financing a\ncontinuing deficit. The United Kingdom differed also in being prepared\nto use monetary and fiscal policy with considerable flexibility; but\nwhile these instruments produced good short-term results, the longer-\nterm dilemma has persisted.\n\nFrom the point of view of a static analysis, one may say that the\ncomparative cost levels gave industry on the Continent a competitive\nedge in international markets that made exports a dynamic factor in\nexpansion, while the United Kingdom had a constant struggle against\nan inadequate growth of exports. Less obvious, however, is why a basic\nadjustment, both of the domestic economic structure and the balance-\nof-payments potential, failed to materialize over so long a period, espe-\ncially as there was inflation on the Continent. Must one conclude that\nthe mechanism of adjustment does not operate sufficiently in a modern\nindustrial economy, or was there an independent factor which inter-\nfered with its functioning?\n\nIn our view there was an impediment to the adjustment process in-\nherent in the practice of wage negotiation and arbitration which tend-\ned to prevent a basic improvement in the external competitive position,\neven in periods of demand restraint. Whereas real output over the past\nten years increased at a rate of under 3 percent, hourly wage rates rose\nby about 4.5 percent, and hourly earnings by about 6 percent. Wages\nincreased every year, even in years of recession, when there was\nsignificant ease in the labor market.\n\nWhile it was soon enough evident that this problem could not be\nmanaged by the usual policy instruments, the politicians had an under-\nstandable reluctance to deal with the matter directly. It is to the credit\nof Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the\nsterling crisis of 1961, that he had the courage to face this issue and to\nintroduce incomes policy by a pause to wage increases. While he be-\ncame a political martyr in the cause of effective policy management, the\nidea of incomes policy could not be brushed aside and has been recent-\nly reaff\u00fcrmed by the new government with a significant agreement\nsigned by labor and industry as well as by the government.\n\nWe have discussed the U.K. experience because it shows clearly\nanother important aspect of the need for keeping the wage round con-\nsistent with the needs of the general economic situation. It is essential\n", "197\n"], "8": ["196 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nshift their tactics so as to deal more positively with excessive demand.\nIn March they decided to restrict the entry of additional foreign labor,\nhoping in this way to curb both investment and consumption outlays.\nThen, in the summer, when interest rates came under some pressure,\nthe National Bank acceded to a rise in the rate on medium-term bank\nbonds, thus signaling further increases in longer-term interest rates.\n\nThe Swiss stabilization efforts reached a climax in March, 1964,\nwith the adoption of legislation designed to increase the government's\nanti-inflationary powers. While in part this legislation merely made\nmandatory previous agreements with respect to domestic credit ceil-\nings and the treatment of foreign funds, it went further by providing\nfor these to apply also to nonbank financial institutions. It also led to\nthe introduction of control over all capital issues and to a new ruling\nthat the countervalue of new inflows of foreign funds, if not reinvested\nabroad, must be placed on special account with the National Bank.\nOther provisions enabled the government to make most new building\nsubject to prior authorization and to retain the existing restrictions on\nthe intake of foreign labor. Subsequently, in the spring and summer,\nthe discount rate was adjusted upwards to market rates, credit ceilings\nwere tightened and hire-purchase regulations made more restrictive.\n\nSince the middle of 1963 longer-term interest yields have risen by\nnearly 1 percent. While giving way to this movement, the authorities?\npolicy strategy, with heavy emphasis on selective restraints on invest-\nment, has sought to moderate it. For despite the steps taken to safe-\nguard against inflows of foreign capital, the dilemma is that nothing\nstands in the way of repatriation of the huge volume of Swiss capital\nheld abroad. The authorities recognize that the only obvious way\naround this difficulty is to obtain greater restraint through fiscal poli-\nCy, where, as so often, there are political factors to be resolved.\n\nUnited Kingdom. 'The United Kingdom is in the midst of balance-\nof-payments difficulties and, since one cannot anticipate how quickly\nthe measures taken will restore balance, the current situation is\ndifficult to talk about. However, as there have been similar episodes in\nthe past decade, there is point in looking at the United Kingdom's ex-\nperience over a longer period.\n\nIt is evident that the difference in the experience of the United\nKingdom from that of the continental countries since, say, 1955 is in-\ndicative of quite different underlying conditions. Besides the present,\nthere have been balance-of-payments troubles on three other occa-\nsions\u2014in 1955, 1957, and 1961. These did not come from a sudden erup-\ntion of wages or highly excessive demand, such as we have seen in\ncontinental examples.

In addition, minimum reserve requirements against bank\nliabilities vis-\u00e0-vis nonresidents were raised to maximum levels, and\nthe banks were forbidden to pay interest on foreign time deposits. To\ndiscourage foreign purchases of securities, the authorities proposed to\nintroduce a 25 percent withholding tax on dividends of German bonds\nheld by nonresidents. Finally, to encourage the flotation of foreign\nloans on the domestic capital market, the existing 2.5 percent tax on\nnew security issues was to be abolished.\n\n\"These measures, as well as the restrictive policies being followed in\nother countries, fairly quickly brought the external surplus to man-\nageable proportions. Thus, the authorities also found themselves with\nsomewhat more scope for a tightening of credit at home. The first step\nin this direction was to raise reserve requirements as from August 1,\n1964, by 10 percent. A complementary step provided that the redis-\ncount ceiling of any bank would be reduced by the same amount as\nany increase in its total foreign liabilities. Main reliance in stabilizing\nthe economy is being placed on fiscal policy, which aims at keeping\npublic expenditure in check.\n\nSwitzerland. Since 1960 Switzerland's continuing overall external\nsurplus has primarily reflected large capital inflows, which contributed\nto the strong domestic demand pressures and to a big current account\ndeficit. In dealing with this situation, the authorities for some time fol-\nlowed largely along their traditional line of policy. Interest rates were\nkept low in an effort to curb net inflows of capital as well as to resist\ncost inflation via higher mortgage rates, which are closely linked with\nrents and farm prices. Moreover, the Confederation continued to real-\nize cash budget surpluses, which were sterilized mostly through the ac-\nquisition of foreign assets. In addition, foreign issues were permitted\non the capital market insofar as these did not place undue upward\npressure on interest rates. Finally, the authorities pursued a liberal\npolicy with respect to the entry of foreign labor.\n\nIt soon became clear, however, that further measures were needed.\nAlready in August, 1960, in order to limit the entry of foreign funds,\nthe authorities concluded a gentleman's agreement with the banks\nwhereby Swiss franc deposits by nonresidents could be accepted only\nat three months! notice or more, without interest, and subject to a\ncommission charge if at less than six months! notice. In April, 1962, by\nwhich time a major investment boom was under way, a new type of do-\nmestic credit agreement was brought into force, requiring the banks to\nrestrict the rise in ordinary and mortgage credits to a certain propor-\ntion of the increase in 1961 or 1960.\n\nIn 1963, as inflationary tensions mounted, the authorities began to\n"], "6": ["194 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\naimed at keeping the growth of internal liquidity at about the same\npace as real output, regardless of the external surplus.\n\nHowever, these monetary measures were not quickly effective\nagainst the kind of inflationary psychology that had developed and by\nthe late summer of 1963 stronger steps were necessary. A wide range\nof new stabilization measures was introduced which laid much empha-\nsis on controlling prices and retail margins, but included also action to\nreduce the budget deficit and to lower the credit ceiling to 10 percent.\n\nIn addition, the Bank of France's discount rate was raised in No-\nvember. It is significant, however, that this step had been preceded by\nmeasures which limited the scope for inflows of short-term capital. In\nApril the banks had been prohibited from paying interest on nonresi-\ndent franc accounts, while in August stricter terms were imposed on\nforeign borrowing by franc-area residents.\n\nIn 1964 the growth of demand and the pressure on prices abated\nand output leveled off. But wages have continued to rise excessively.\nWages policy has up to now been relatively successful only in re-\nstraining the growth of wages in the public sector, though an attempt\nis being made in the Fifth Economic Plan to lay down guidelines for\nincomes generally. Meanwhile, the weight of policy restraint has nec-\nessarily fallen on total demand, backed up by extensive controls on\nprices. The banks! compulsory assets ratio has been kept at 36 percent,\nexcept when eased for seasonal reasons, and bank liquidity has re-\nmained tight. In the first three-quarters of 1964 the banks! monetary\nand quasi-monetary liabilities increased by only 4.8 percent, against 8.9\nand 11.8 percent in the same periods of 1963 and 1962. However, the\nemphasis of restraint is gradually being shifted to the budget.\n\nGermany. After achieving a high degree of domestic and external\nequilibrium in late 1962 and early 1963, economic stability in Germany\nwas increasingly threatened a\u00edter the middle of the year. While this\nwas partly due to a renewed advance in fixed investment, the much\nmore important reason was a rising trend of exports stemming from\ninflation in neighboring countries. Superimposed on the growing export\nsurplus, foreign purchases of German securities began to revive on a\nlarge scale. By the last quarter of 1963 the external surplus had swol-\nlen to major proportions, carrying a definite inflationary threat for the\nmonths ahead.\n\nWhat to do about it was, however, a nice question. The authorities\nwere not anxious to try monetary restraint in the face of the external\nsurplus, as this course had proved abortive in 1959-60. So, apart from\ncomplaining about inflation abroad, they confined their reactions to\nmeasures designed to influence the movement of capital. In March,\n1964, in order to encourage the banks to export short-term funds, the\n"], "5": ["IMPLICATIONS OF EVOLVING MONETARY MECHANISM 193\n\nmeasures taken by the authorities led to a growing tightness of the in-\nternal monetary situation and to a sharp rise in interest rates. As was\nanticipated, the banks were able to ease their liquidity position by\nrepatriating short-term assets from abroad\u2014which, in fact, served to\nfinance the balance-of-payments deficit. To prevent this movement\nfrom going too far, the central bank ruled in July that the banks should\nnot allow their foreign assets to fall significantly below their liabilities.\n\nThe other development was less anticipated: as the yields on long-\nterm securities got up towards 6 percent, they proved to be very at-\ntractive to foreign investors, who bought in such volume as to lower\nthe rate below 5.5 percent. This capital import was not to the liking of\nthe authorities, who felt rather that the Netherlands should be a capi-\ntal-exporting country.\n\nIt is evident that this responsiveness of funds from abroad to inter-\nnal monetary restraint imposes a definite limitation on the use of\nmonetary policy for strictly domestic purposes.\n\nWe now turn to a few cases in which domestic inflationary pressures\nwere accompanied by an external surplus. This was the typical situa-\ntion on the Continent up to 1963.\n\nFrance. In France two main influences led to the development of\ninflationary tensions. One was the ambitious growth target of 5.5 per-\ncent, which was strongly supported by fiscal means and credit facili-\nties. The other was the external surplus, which fed internal liquidity\nand contributed to the build-up of demand forces. The result was a\ntight labor situation and evidence of inflation in wages and prices in\n1962. However, the pressures were greatly intensified by the repatria-\ntion of close to a million persons after the end of the war in Algeria.\nTheir added buying power gave demand a decided jolt, particularly\nfelt on the housing market and on foods and light consumer goods.\n'Thus, by the beginning of 1963, inflation was a quite active force,\nwhich in the course of the year pushed up prices by 6 percent and sub-\nstantially reduced the current account surplus.\n\nWhile some measures were taken in 1962, it was in early 1963 that\nthe authorities turned decisively to a policy of credit restraint. With-\nout increasing the discount rate at this time, they imposed a direct\nceiling of 12 percent on the growth of bank credit for the year ahead.\nIn addition, the banks' compulsory assets ratio (coefficient de\ntr\u00e9sorerie) was further increased from 32 to 36 percent. These com-\npulsory holdings of assets are made up partly of Treasury bills, while\nthe remainder consists mostly of medium-term equipment credits\nwhich would otherwise be automatically rediscountable at the Bank of\nFrance. Finally, for the first time in about five years, the Treasury\nlaunched a long-term loan. These actions initiated a new policy line\n"], "4": ["192 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nhas experienced in the past year have a superficial resemblance to\nthose of Italy; a sudden and substantial rise in wages was followed by\nrising prices and a current account deficit. However, the underlying\nsituation of the two countries was much different.\n\nAs was the case in several other countries, there was a definite eas-\ning of the boom in the Netherlands in 1962 and the restraints on bank\ncredit were taken off early in 1963, though without any positive stimu-\nlating measures being introduced. However, expansionary forces gath-\nered momentum in 1963, with exports being unexpectedly strong be-\ncause of inflation in some other countries and private investment again\naccelerating.\n\nHere was a new demand boom coming on top of an economy already\noperating at full capacity. There was, inevitably, tightness on the\nlabor market. At the end of the summer the dam burst when several\nfirms offered wages above the scales fixed in the general wage agree-\nment. As a result of this break in wage controls, a new wage agreement\nhad to be negotiated in the autumn which provided for increases in pay\nscales averaging about 15 percent. Needless to say, no economy at full\nemployment can take this kind of stimulus without inflation, which\nwas reflected in rising prices and a current account deficit.\n\nIn contrast to the Italian case, the eruption of wages in the Nether-\nlands must be attributed essentially to the market forces generated by\nexcess demand. The Netherlands has well-developed wage-policy ma-\nchinery, which operates with the full cooperation of labor and employ-\ner organizations, but events demonstrated that such machinery cannot\nstand up to excessive demand pressure. Nonetheless, the fact of wage\npolicy had an important bearing on the market reaction to the\ninflationary incident. There was no fear of a continuing wage-price spi-\nral, no suspicion that the guilder was threatened, and no flight of capi-\ntal. Hence, the remedial action by the authorities could aim at slowing\ndown the boom rather than bringing it to an abrupt halt.\n\nAs usual, the authorities were prompt in taking steps to bring order\ninto the situation. In the monetary field, credit ceilings were reimposed\non the banks, the discount rate was raised, consumer credit regulations\nwere tightened, and a government loan in excess of needs was issued to\ndrain funds from the economy. In addition, taxes on cigarettes and\ngasoline were raised to reduce consumer demand, public investment\nplans were reduced, and investment allowances and advanced amorti-\nzation were suspended to dampen private investment. As a result of\nthese measures, the inflationary symptoms eased in the course of 1964.\n\nBut here we must lcok at a further development which has some-\ntimes been conspicuous, sometimes just below the surface in much of\nEuropean experience since convertibility. Both the external deficit and\n"], "3": ["IMPLICATIONS OF EVOLVING MONETARY MECHANISM 191\n\nabout 8 percent. Confidence in the lira was impaired and a flight of\nfunds added to the problem.\n\nThe authorities did not react immediately to these developments.\nFor one thing, the political situation was not one from which a strin-\ngent program of restraining measures could readily emerge and, for\nanother, the problem itself came so suddenly that it took time to size it\nup. Another factor, perhaps, was that the external deficit up to Sep-\ntember, 1963, was largely financed by increased net foreign indebted-\nness of the banks, which had been authorized in November, 1962, to\nhelp ease the internal monetary position. However, effective action\nbegan to take shape just after the summer and rather quickly led to a\ndramatic change in the situation.\n\nThe initiative in the stabilization effort fell to the monetary authori-\nties and, indeed, monetary policy was the decisive factor in the pro-\ngram. Various steps were taken to slow down the expansion of credit\nfrom the supply side, an early measure being to require the banks to\nreduce their net borrowing from abroad, which meant that the external\ndeficit itself contributed to tightening the monetary situation. A very\nforceful tool, however, was the direct control the authorities had over\nall sizable extensions of credit by financial institutions and over new se-\ncurity issues, which was used with telling effect to limit investment\nfrom the demand side. In the first nine months of 1963 bank credit to\nthe private sector had increased by nearly 15 percent, while in the\nsame period a year later it declined by about 5 percent. It is hard to\nimagine what level of interest rates and what lapse of time would have\nbeen needed under Italian conditions to have produced a comparable\nresult by more classic techniques of monetary restraint.\n\nCredit restriction, reinforced later by measures of fiscal restraint,\nbrought quick results. Little more than six months elapsed before the\nsituation had decisively changed. The peak month for the external\ndeficit was actually February, 1964; after April increasing surpluses\nwere shown on both current and capital account. For the year 1964 im-\nports will be no higher than the year before, while exports will have\nincreased by over 15 percent. Thus, it is fortunate that the wage in-\ncrease did not entail a strong cost-push on prices, which could have im-\npaired the competitive position of industry.\n\nThough wages were the key factor in the Italian difficulties, the au-\nthorities were unable to use wage policy to help manage the situation;\ninstead an easier situation in the labor market and in production was\nrequired to dampen the inflationary flames. This worked so quickly on\ndemand and the balance of payments that the first mild steps to ease\nrestraint were started before the middle of 1964.\n\nThe Netherlands.

Faced with a conflict between\npressure on resources and an external surplus, on the other hand, many\ncountries have accepted some price inflation rather than revaluation\nwhen the external surplus was large, but acted fairly strongly against\ninflation when confronted with a moderate surplus or a deficit.\n\nAs we are to discuss Europe's policy experience of a given time and\nsetting, there are two aspects of the recent economic background that\nmust be stressed:\n\n1. The economic climate of Europe has been of a decidedly post-\nKeynesian character. For one thing, public investment demand has\nbeen high and constantly growing, so that there has been little tenden-\ncy for ex ante savings to outrun investment. For another thing, wages\nnot only do not fall but persistently rise in wage round after wage\nround. These two forces, usually augmented by an external surplus,\nhave meant a level of overall demand that has pushed against the ca-\npacity of the economy.\n\n2. On the external side, Europe has been sheltered in a sense by the\nU.S. balance-of-payments deficit. While this has contributed difficulties\nof its own, including that of inflationary pressure, it has made external\ndeficits rare and the result of fairly obvious excesses. This has sim-\nplified the task of full employment policy but raised instead the prob-\nlem of curbing inflation against a balance-of-payments surplus.\n\nWe may now consider recent developments in the countries where\ninternal inflation was accompanied by an external deficit.\n\nItaly. In the Italian inflation of 1963 the authorities had no conflict\nbetween domestic and external stabilization policy; there were both ris-\ning prices and an external deficit.\n\nAfter advancing rapidly from 1959 to 1961, the economy leveled off\nin the first half of 1962. With the external accounts apparently safe\nand reserves ample, the authorities pursued an expansionary policy\nline, particularly by accelerating public-sector investment. Towards\nthe end of the year, however, there was an unexpected burst of wage\nincreases that was to raise total wages by about 15 percent in 1963.\nEven though unemployment had been largely absorbed by this time\nthe wage increases were the result primarily of negotiation rather than\nof free market forces and indeed cannot be understood apart from the\npolitical context of the time.\n\nThese wage increases promptly produced an inflationary upsurge of\nprices and imports. This was due not so much to the direct effect of\nhigher costs on prices as to the sheer impact of increased demand.

In essence, the system is one in which the national currencies used\nto transact international business are normally traded against each\nother in the exchange markets at fixed rates. While the authorities\nhave considerable leeway to support the rate, by allowing fluctuations\nin reserves and by lending or borrowing from each other, they are con-\ntinually forced to give attention to securing external equilibrium.\nHence, our question really is the implications for domestic objectives\nand use of policy instruments of the need to aim simultaneously at ex-\nternal balance. To see both sides of the matter, however, we should\nalso ask the complementary question of what are the implications for\nbalance-of-payments policy of domestic economic objectives.\n\nFirst, a few words about policy objectives in Europe. These are, uni-\nversally, the familiar trio of full employment, price stability, and ex-\nternal equilibrium. Among these objectives, full employment has a\nvery high priority and tends to be defined with really minimum mar-\ngins of unemployment. One could not say, however, that it has an\noverriding priority, since this objective has been relaxed from time to\ntime when needed to assure other aims. Price stability is a more fuzzy\npolicy aim, partly because the variety of price indexes usually show\ndivergent results and partly because of a resigned acceptance that\nsome rise in the cost-of-living index is difficult to avoid in a full em-\nployment economy. External equilibrium is also a rather nebulous ob-\njective, because the concept itself is not clear cut. In fact, it is more\nmeaningful to say that the operating objective is a fixed exchange pari-\nty, with, at least, maintenance of gold and foreign exchange reserves.\n\nThere is no doubt that fixed exchange rates have a high priority.

Britain's creditors lent to her because they feared that\notherwise Britain would have to devalue or give up convertibility. Is it\ncredible that Britain's creditors would not extend credit again if the\nalternative should be the same six months from now, or that the an-\nswer would depend on how many pairs of spectacles the British gov-\nernment had given away free.\n\nBritain will not behave like Brazil. The reason will not be that Brit-\nain's creditors are more powerful or hardhearted than Brazil's. The\nreason will be that the British understand the evils of inflation better\nthan the Brazilians do.\n\n'The present situation among the major countries, as I see it, is that\nsurplus countries will probably extend credit to deficit countries when\nnecessary to prevent the deficit country from imposing exchange con-\ntrols or other severe restrictions on trade and capital movements or de-\nvaluing.

However, they do induce lending as an alternative\nto severe restrictions on trade and capital movements and probably\nespecially as an alternative to devaluation.\n\nThe United States took a few small steps to reduce its balance-of-\npayments deficit by measures restricting international trade beginning\nin 1960. U.S. government foreign aid was tied to purchases of U.S.\ngoods, the government became much stricter in trying to cut its expen-\nditures in foreign currencies, even at the cost of larger expenditures in\ndollars, and permissible duty-free imports by tourists were reduced.\nHowever, these steps only brought the United States closer to the level\nof restrictionism already common in other countries and were not re-\ngarded as a departure from the prevailing international monetary sys-\ntem.\n\nIn 1961, with the advent ofan Administration dedicated to *Getting\nAmerica moving again,\" the United States began actively to seek ar-\nrangements for obtaining more international credit. This effort was\nhighly successful. At the time the arrangements made were character-\nized by some as stop-gap and gadgety. But concentration on the form\nmay have distracted us from the simple and important points. We no\nlonger accepted the existing limits of international credit as a\nbeneficial restraint on us but would try to expand those limits. When\ntested, the elasticity of the international credit supply turned out to be\nlarge.\n\nThe United States made a declaration of independence in 1963 with\nthe proposal of a large tax cut. Reasons were offered for thinking that\nthe tax cut would reduce the balance-of-payments deficit. This was a\npossible result, but a highly uncertain one. What was behind the tax\ncut was not a finding that it would assist the balance of payments but\na decision to try to regain high employment even at a risk to the bal-\nance of payments. If the balance of payments deteriorated, that situa-\ntion would have to be met in some other way than excessive unemploy-\nment. And when the balance of payments turned worse, in the summer\nof 1963 we responded with the interest equalization tax, to restrict the\noutflow of capital, and with the announcement of our willingness, pre-\nviously in doubt, to borrow from the IMF.

In the United States we were being told\nthat we could not have a more expansive fiscal and monetary policy\nbecause of our balance-of-payments deficit, and that we should not try\nto increase the expansibility of the international financial system be-\ncause that might tempt us to have a more expansive fiscal and mone-\ntary policy.\n\nI am not here to criticize this view of the system. I think that a peri-\nod of anti-inflationary policy was good for the United States after\n1957, to increase the possibility of subsequently having high employ-\nment without inflation. I also think it is sometimes useful to impose or\naccept outside limits on ourselves, even artificial ones, in order to save\nourselves from our own folly.\n\nBut this system probably could not last long, and in any event did\nnot. The system assumed that deficit countries, if they could not ob-\ntain credit, would be unwilling to use any alternative other than inter-\nnal disinflationary or restrictive policy.

The potential lenders stand in a number of\ndifferent relations to the deficit country. They sell to the deficit coun-\ntry and compete with it in third markets.

In any case, the surplus countries were not obliged to finance\nthe inflation of the deficit country and could limit its spread to them.\n\nWhen the postwar transition ended\u2014say with the end of exchange\ncontrols in Europe in 1957 or 1958\u2014Aand the time came to live by the\nBretton Woods philosophy, it appeared that we did not intend to do\nthat. Exchange rate devaluation was demoted from its role as the\nstandard adjuster of continuing disequilibrium. Restraint of interna-\ntional capital movements was also moved down in the scale of possible\ncorrections until it also became a measure of nearly last resort. With\ndevaluation and capital controls moved down in the scale of priorities,\nsomething had to come up. There were three general possibilities:\nmore extension of credit, more restriction of international transactions,\nprivate or governmental, and tighter domestic monetary and fiscal pol-\nicies. As it turned out, monetary and fiscal restriction became the chief\ninstrument that deficit countries were expected to use for adaptation.\n\nThe system into which we entered was one where deficit countries\nwere expected not to devalue, not to control capital movements, and\nnot to restrict imports or subsidize exports. At the same time the ex-\ntension of credit\u2014and particularly the assurance of future cred-\nit\u2014was to be limited. This would force the deficit country to get its\nhouse in order, by monetary and fiscal restraint.\n\nThere were undoubtedly many reasons for the difference between\nthe system of the late 1950's and the Bretton Woods philosophy.

Recently, when\nthe pound was under severe pressure, in danger of devaluation, and\nafter British bank rate had been raised from 5 percent to 7 percent,\nother countries announced a $3 billion line of credit for Britain.

Until then, description of the system by an outsider must be spec-\nulative and impressionistic.\n\nWith these warnings, I would suggest that the evolution of the post-\nwar international monetary system can be divided into three stages.\nThe first was the Bretton Woods period. The second, beginning in\nabout 1958 and beginning to fade out in about 1961, may be called the\nperiod of hard money. The third, in which we still are, I would call the\nperiod of credit extension.\n\nBy the Bretton Woods period I mean not the period of the IMF,\nWhich of course still continues, but the period of a certain philosophy\nof the system.

Deficit countries would be given credit\nto avoid the necessity for temporary restrictive measures, except with\nrespect to capital flows, or for short-run changes of exchange rates.\nBut a large and long-continued flow of credit was not contemplated. If\nin the time permitted by moderate, temporary credits, equilibrium was\nnot achieved, exchange rates were to be adjusted. The object of the en-\nterprise was to prevent a spiral of trade restrictions and deflation. But\ninternational extension of credit was not to bear the whole burden of\nachieving this object.

The general reason for extending credit\nis to influence the borrower's behavior in a certain way, presumably in\na way that is to the interest of the lender. The amounts, terms, and\nconditions are set by the lender on his side in a way that he thinks will\ninfluence the borrower to behave in a way that the lender prefers. This\ndoes not mean that the system operates to the disadvantage of the bor-\nrower. The borrower does not have to borrow; he borrows in order to\nbe able to follow a policy that he prefers to any of the options that he\nwould have available if he did not borrow. The borrower may consider\nthat he would be still better off with more credit on longer terms and\neasier conditions, but the lender will not extend such credit if he thinks\nthe result will be borrower policy that he does not prefer.\n\n\"This description of the system may suggest that the lender is in the\ndriver's seat, because he decides whether to lend and on what terms.\nBut this is not necessarily the case. The borrower may get closer to the\nsituation he prefers than the lender does. The lender has the power to\nlend or not. The borrower has the power to choose among a number of\npolicies that have different consequences for the lender, and may con-\nfront the lender with alternatives that force him to lend. For example,\nsuppose that the potential lender says to the potential borrower: \"I\nwould prefer that you cut your foreign aid programs rather than bor-\nrow from me.\" The potential borrower may reply: \"I would prefer to\nborrow from you, but if you will not lend to me I will devalue rather\nthan cut my foreign aid.\" If the potential lender believes this and if he\nprefers to lend rather than see his partner devalue, he will end up ex-\ntending credit, even though he would have preferred something else.\n\nTo describe the system as it exists at any time is difficult. The de-\nscription will not be found written down in the charter of the Interna-\ntional Monetary Fund or anywhere else. The system consists of what\nthe officials of about ten governments will do. They reserve ultimate\ndiscretion to themselves, do not tell anyone how they will use it, and\nperhaps cannot tell anyone how they will use it without giving up their\ndiscretion.\n\nI do not think we can even say how much international credit is\navailable under the present system. We know how much credit govern-\nments have said they will or may make available.

I do not believe any of the pro-\nposed purely financial schemes for providing more reserves can be de-\npended upon to shore up the present system and make it workable.\nThe trouble is that with adjustable parities, the possible size of specu-\nlative runs is so vast\u2014remember that the entire stock of private finan-\ncial claims denominated in a particular currency is potentially availa-\nble to finance a run on that currency\u2014that unlimited, or virtually un-\nlimited, supplies of reserves are needed to provide firm assurance that\na speculative run could not succeed in forcing a devaluation.\n\nWhat is vitally necessary is to introduce into the system some means\nof maintaining or restoring balance-of-payments equilibrium. Possibly\nthis could be done by using monetary and fiscal policies in a flexible\nway to provide for a systematic offset of deficits and surpluses on cur-\nrent account with surpluses and deficits on private capital ac-\ncount\u2014with some limited interim reliance on monetary reserves while\nthe necessary adjustments were being brought about.

Moreover, the prevailing views of important officials and\nmen of affairs are generally so hostile to the idea that I judge its gener-\nal adoption to be impracticable.\n\nC. A Mixed System. 'The two solutions described above\u2014currency\nunification and centralization of responsibility for monetary and fiscal\npolicy on the one hand, and flexible exchange rates on the other\u2014can\nbe combined. According to the recent work on optimum currency\nareas, countries having close trading relations might properly be com-\nbined into blocs within which currencies would be unified.* It should\nbe clearly recognized, in my opinion, that to be workable this would\nrequire the acceptance by the members of each bloc of a common cen-\ntralized monetary and fiscal policy. Then flexible exchange rates could\nbe employed between the blocs\u2014which would constitute areas between\nwhich trading relations were more limited. As an example, the coun-\ntries of Western Europe might constitute one bloc and the United\nStates and the United Kingdom another, with a flexible exchange rate\nbetween the bloc currencies. A solution somewhat along these lines was\nsuggested in the Brookings report on the U.S. balance of payments.\n\nOn the face of it, this sounds like a reasonable solution. However, I\nfind it difficult to believe that, even in such an economically interrelat-\ned area as Western Europe, individual countries would be willing to\ngive up their historic sovereign power to control money, as would, in\nmy judgment, be absolutely vital to the success of monetary\nunification.

Thus, individual countries would no longer be able to choose\ntheir optimal levels of internal demand but would have to accept the\nlevels that were associated with the overall policies judged by the cen-\ntral authorities to be appropriate for the group as a whole. In other\nwords, some countries might find themselves in the position of de-\npressed areas\u2014a position very similar to that of a state like West Vir-\nginia in the U.S. federal system. The central government could, of\ncourse, alleviate localized distress by programs of expenditures and tax\nincentives aimed at the stimulation of production and employment in\ndepressed areas, just as the federal government is able to do in the\nUnited States.\n\n'The above argument needs to be qualified a little. Actually, it would\nbe possible for participating countries to engage to a limited extent in\nfiscal policy to stimulate or retard aggregate demand to influence their\ninternal employment and price levels. However, monetary policy would\nhave to be centralized, and countries would have to finance their\ndeficits by selling their securities at interest rates that would make\nthem acceptable to investors in the financial environment generated by\nthe central monetary authorities. And, since they would not possess the\npower to create money, their securities would not be free of default\nrisk; indeed, like the securities of our state governments, their rating\nwould presumably depend on their financial condition. As a result, per-\nsistent deficit financing might be prohibitively difficult and expensive,\nespecially for those countries in a depressed economic condition, for\nwhich it would be particularly important.

The availability of un-\nlimited credit would eliminate the deflationary bias that has ordinarily\ncharacterized fixed exchange rate systems. However, if each country\nwas left free to pursue an independent monetary and fiscal policy, seri-\nous difficulties might arise as a result of differences in economic struc-\nture or policies among the various participating countries. Suppose, for\nexample, that an important country chose to follow an inflationary do-\nmestic policy\u2014perhaps because cost-push pressures on its price level\nmade such a policy necessary for the achievement of the desired level\nof employment. The inflationary policy would tend to generate a bal-\nance-of-payments deficit, through which the inflationary pressure\nwould be transmitted to other countries. These countries could take\ndomestic action to offset the inflationary pressures, but this would\nmean an enlargement of the inflating country's balance-of-payments\ndeficit, the counterpart of which would be a surplus in the consolidated\nbalance of payments of the other countries. If the other countries did\nnot wish to run surpluses in their balances of payments and thereby\nprovide a flow of goods and services to meet the rapacious demands of\nthe inflating country, their only recourse would be to inflate their own\neconomies in pace. In other words, by following an inflationary policy,\na single major country might be able to force the rest to choose be-\ntween balance-of-payments surpluses in its favor and domestic\ninflation. Thus, a fixed exchange rate system which provided unlimited\nautomatic credits to deficit countries while leaving participants free to\npursue independent national monetary and fiscal policies would proba-\nbly have an immoderate inflationary bias and would certainly be unac-\nceptable.\n\n'The necessary condition for currency unification to be workable is\nthat the participating countries give up their sovereign authority to\nconduct independent monetary and fiscal policies directed at internal\nprice and employment goals. Such policies would have to be conducted\nby a centralized monetary and fiscal authority charged with responsi-\nbility for internal stability for the group of countries as a whole. This\ncentralized authority, in order to carry out its responsibilities effective-\nly, would need to have sole power to regulate the supply of money and\ncredit and to levy certain taxes and control certain categories of gov-\nernment expenditures.

Under modern conditions, the maintenance\nof high levels of employment and capacity utilization requires that\nsuch changes in relative prices as are needed to correct chronic bal-\nance-of-payments disequilibria be accomplished primarily through\nprice increases in surplus countries rather than price declines in deficit\ncountries. In addition, as indicated earlier in this paper, the procedures\nof wage determination are such in most countries as to produce some\ninflationary tendencies at acceptable levels of unemployment. Thus,\nwith fixed exchange rates it is necessary that the international mone-\ntary system have a moderate inflationary bias built into it. However,\nunder fixed exchange rate systems in the past the pressure on deficit\ncountries to eliminate deficits has been much stronger than the pres-\nsure on surplus countries to eliminate surpluses, so that such arrange-\nments have characteristically had a substantial deflationary bias.

If a country\nran a persistent surplus, it could, in principle at least, use tax adjust-\nments to trim its rate of domestic investment so as to achieve the de-\nsired overall division of national resources between consumption and\ncapital formation. Similarly, a country having a persistent deficit could\noffset its adverse growth effects by employing a policy mix that would\nencourage domestic investment. Some inefficiency would nevertheless\nbe present, because if domestic investment was viewed as more condu-\ncive to growth than an equal amount of accumulation of foreign\nclaims, there would be no way to shift resources between the two. The\ncurrent account surplus or deficit would be primarily determined by\nthe level of overall domestic demand and there would be no policy in-\nstrument available to change it.\n\nIII. Approaches to Fundamental Reform of the System\n\nThe arrangements outlined above would be a possible way of mak-\ning the present system work more effectively by means of a much more\nflexible and sophisticated use of monetary and fiscal policies. If such\nan arrangement is unacceptable\u2014-or, after a trial, proved to be unwork-\nable\u2014there are as far as I can see only two approaches to fundamen-\ntal reform: currency unification or the adoption of flexible exchange\nrates. Experience gives us strong reasons for believing that the first of\nthese is definitely workable; however, it would involve a substantial\ncost that countries might well not be willing to pay. The second might\ninvolve a less serious cost but is less certain to work effectively. The\ntwo solutions could be combined in various ways.\n\nA. Currency Unification. One solution to the problem of lack of\nsufficient tools to achieve the desired goals would be through the es-\ntablishment of a unified currency system with absolutely and perman-\nently fixed exchange rates. In this way, the balance-of-payments prob-\nlem could be eliminated entirely, but I shall argue that the price that\nwould have to be paid to make such an arrangement acceptable and\nviable would be the surrender of sovereignty over monetary and fiscal\npolicies by the nations involved to a central body.\n\nUnder a fixed exchange rate system, individual countries would from\n"], "7": ["214 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nwould be highly desirable that steps be taken to increase the freedom\nof capital movements\u2014especially of long-term funds\u2014in order to\nmake capital flows adjust more sensitively to interest rate changes.\n\nUnder such a system, the mix of monetary and fiscal policies would\nbe used to achieve internal and external equilibrium simultaneously.\nIf, for example, it was necessary to raise interest rates for balance-of-\npayments reasons, any undesired restrictive effects on internal demand\nwould be offset by a reduction in taxes. Fairly frequent adjustments in\nboth monetary and fiscal policies would presumably be necessary.\nSince, at best, only an imperfect adjustment could be achieved, mone-\ntary reserves would, of course, continue to be needed to deal with tem-\nporary balance-of-payments deficits. But, hopefully, persistent large\ndeficits resulting in heavy drains on reserves could be avoided more\nand more effectively as accumulating experience led to increased skill\nin the use of the available policy instruments and in the coordination\nof monetary policies.\n\nOn\u00e9 of the objections to such an arrangement is that the use of the\nmonetary-fiscal mix as a means of dealing with the balance of pay-\nments precludes its use to regulate capital formation for economic\ngrowth. To enable the country to regulate capital formation and there-\nby influence growth in the face of the adjustments in interest rates\nthat would be needed to maintain balance-of-payments equilibrium, a\nsecond flexible fiscal instrument could be introduced. The best possibil-\nity for this purpose would probably be an investment tax credit, along\nthe lines of the 7 percent credit introduced in the United States in the\nRevenue Act of 1962. Provision could be made for flexible adjustments\nof the rate of tax credit when such adjustments were deemed desira-\nble\u2014as, for example, to offset the restrictive effect on investment of a\nrise in domestic interest rates called for by balance-of-payments con-\nsiderations. It is in principle possible to have\u2014within limits at\nleast\u2014any desired level of investment in combination with any desired\nlevel of interest rates through appropriate use of fiscal incentives to\nshift the marginal efficiency of investment schedule.\n\nWould such an arrangement be feasible as a means of eliminating\nthe contradictions in the present system? This I find difficult to judge.\nIf price trends among participating countries diverged persistently\nleading to progressively larger current account deficits and surpluses to\nbe covered by interest-induced capital flows, the arrangement would in\ndue time prove to be unworkable. Some supplementary efforts to coor-\ndinate other policies to prevent this would therefore be necessary. The\npossibilities of success seem sufficient to warrant consideration. Of\ncourse, the political difficulties of obtaining greater flexibility of fiscal\npolicy are undoubtedly substantial in some countries. But this problem\nwill almost certainly have to be tackled anyway, because monetary\n"], "6": ["IMPLICATIONS OF EVOLVING MONETARY MECHANISM 213\n\nruns larger than it is at present. But there is no assurance that the fun-\ndamental problem of speculation would be eliminated.\n\nSchemes to reform the financial system and increase the supply of\nmonetary reserves can undoubtedly be of some help. But the more fun-\ndamental need is to introduce some workable mechanism for restoring\nand maintaining balance-of-payments equilibrium. Can this be done\nmore or less within the confines of the present system by making more\nflexible use of traditional policy instruments? Or are some fundamen-\ntal reforms of the system required, and if so, what reforms would be\nappropriate? These are the questions to which I shall devote the re-\nmainder of my paper.\n\nII. More Flexible Use of Monetary and. Fiscal Measures\n\nI believe a considerable improvement in economic performance\ncould be achieved within the framework of the present international\nmonetary system if fiscal policy could be rendered substantially more\nflexible than it now is. For example, in the United States some ar-\nrangement, such as that proposed by the Commission on Money and\nCredit in its 1961 report or that recommended in the January, 1962,\nAnnual Report of the Council of Economic Advisers, giving the Presi-\ndent discretionary authority to change personal income tax rates for\ncountercyclical purposes would be very helpful.\n\nThe idea would be to develop a policy arrangement under which the\nWestern industrial countries would agree to rely on flexible fiscal poli-\ncy, implemented primarily through tax adjustments, to regulate inter-\nnal demand to achieve domestic goals. Monetary policy would then be\nassigned the task of maintaining balance-of-payments equilibrium by\nestablishing interest rates at levels which would induce a sufficient\ninflow or outflow of private capital to cover the deficit or surplus on\ncurrent account (including government military and foreign aid trans-\nactions) that would occur at target levels of income and employment.\nTo be workable, such an arrangement would require that tax policy be\nrendered much more flexible than at present, not only in the United\nStates, but in other countries as well.\n\nMachinery would need to be set up to provide careful international\ncoordination of the monetary policies of participating countries. The\nobjective would be to establish a matrix of interest rate differentials\namong countries which would be suffcient to achieve approximate\noverall equilibrium in the balance of payments of each country. Margi-\nnal adjustments would need to be made in interest rates from time to\ntime to preserve equilibrium in the face of changes in underlying con-\nditions. Strong efforts would be needed in order to avoid competitive\nincreases in interest rates which would raise the general level of rates\nwithout contributing to the maintenance of payments equilibrium. It\n"], "5": ["212 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\n\"swaps\" and intervention in foreign exchange markets to deal with\nminor speculative crises have been progressively developed and\nrefined. To deal with more serious crises\u2014the most dramatic of which,\nto date, is the sterling crisis of recent weeks\u2014massive supplies of for-\neign exchange have been mobilized to support threatened currencies\nand combat the activities of speculators. Up to now, these efforts have\nbeen successful in fending off disaster, but the world lives in dread of a\nforced devaluation of sterling or the dollar, which would in all proba-\nbility create a state of international financial chaos from which recov-\nery would be extremely difficult. Moreover, the present situation gives\nthe opinions of international currency speculators an entirely dispro-\nportionate weight in the determination of economic policy.\n\nIt seems clear that the present international economic arrangements\nare seriously defective. It is doubtful whether they can survive in their\npresent form for very long. The question is: What changes should be\nmade? In the extensive discussions of the international economy that\nhave taken place in the last few years, much energy has been expended\non the formulation of proposals for reform of the world's monetary in-\nstitutions, and many ingenious schemes have been proposed. However,\nit is difficult for me to see how the mere establishment of an improved\ninternational banking arrangement for providing liquidity can be de-\npended upon to yield a satisfactory solution to our problems as long as\nprivate international transactions are conducted by the use of national\ncurrencies whose exchange parities are felt to be subject to change.\nEven if gold were completely demonetized and official settlements be-\ntween countries were carried out by the transfer of credits on the\nbooks of a reformed IMF, the problem would remain. Suppose, for ex-\nample, that under such an arrangement the United States were to run a\nsubstantial balance-of-payments deficit. The dollar would decline in\nforeign exchange markets, and foreign central banks would have to\nbuy dollars to prevent the exchange rate from moving outside the pre-\nscribed limits. The dollars would be deposited with the IMF for credit\nto the other country's account, and they would be debited to the U.S.\naccount. If the latter account were to become exhausted, the United\nStates would presumably have to arrange a loan from the IMF which\nwould replenish its balance. As long as there was felt to be an effective\nlimit to the credit line available, so that eventually devaluation (or di-\nrect controls) might have to be employed to correct the deficit, private\ninvestors would have essentially the same motive to speculate against\nthe dollar as they have under the present system, and the speculation\nitself would help to exhaust the credit line. Since claims against the\nIMF would presumably be subject to an exchange guarantee, countries\nmight be willing to extend sufficiently large credits through the IMF to\nmake the effective supply of reserves available for meeting speculative\n"], "4": ["IMPLICATIONS OF EVOLVING MONETARY MECHANISM 211\n\nit has survived only because its fundamental principles have been vio-\nlated in various ways.\n\n1. The underlying principle of free movement of goods and capital\nhas been compromised through the imposition of trade restrictions for\nbalance-of-payments reasons by Canada in 1962 and the United King-\ndom in recent weeks. The United States has also persistently violated\nthe principle by tying foreign aid, by discriminating in favor of Ameri-\ncan suppliers in its defense procurement policies, and by the recent\nenactment of the so-called *Interest Equalization Tax.\"\n\n2. Minor use has been made of exchange rate adjustments in the\nDutch and German revaluations of March, 1961. Such adjustments,\nhowever, probably do more harm than good by weakening confidence\nin the overall stability of exchange rates and encouraging speculation.\n\n3. In practice, domestic monetary and fiscal policies have not been\nentirely unaffected by the balance-of-payments situation. In part, this\nis because, due to the less than perfect effectiveness of domestic mone-\ntary and fiscal tools, it has not always been feasible to offset complete-\nly the automatic corrective effects of deficits and surpluses on internal\ndemand. But beyond that, deficit countries have found it necessary to\nadapt their domestic policies to the exigencies of the balance of pay-\nments\u2014albeit reluctantly\u2014Nwhen their international reserves have\nbeen seriously threatened. The leading example here is the United\nStates, which has suffered from an unnecessarily high rate of unem-\nployment and a resultant irrecoverable loss of output amounting per-\nhaps to $150 billion in the last five years, partly as a result of its bal-\nance-of-payments deficit. This has not been due, in my opinion, howev-\ner, to the fact that policies to expand aggregate demand have been held\nback by fear that they would worsen the trade balance. Rather it has\nbeen a result of the administrative inflexibility of fiscal policy (as a\nconsequence, in part, of unenlightened views about budget deficits and\ngrowth of the public debt) combined with the fact that the need to\navoid an accentuation of short-term capital outflows has acted as a\nsignificant constraint on monetary policy\u2014the one flexible and accep-\ntable instrument that might in the absence of the balance-of-payments\nconstraint have been used to expand aggregate demand. No doubt sim-\nilar considerations have to some extent operated in European countries\nto limit the use of restrictive monetary policies to check excessive\ninflation in the face of balance-of-payments surpluses. But it is quite\nclear that the system has an inherent deflationary bias. The limited\nsupply of reserves sets some upper bound on the size of a nation's cum-\nulative deficit, whereas there is no equivalent upper bound to the size\nof a cumulative surplus and the associated expansion of monetary re-\nserves.\n\n\"Techniques of central bank cooperation through the use of currency\n"], "3": ["210 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\ntime to time to correct fundamental\" disequilibria in national bal-\nances of payments, seem ideally calculated to encourage speculation.\nSince opportunities for the investment of capital, viewed broadly, do\nnot ordinarily vary widely as between major countries, even a mild\nsuspicion that a country may devalue its currency can cause a specula-\ntive outflow of capital from that country. And, as more and more in-\nvestors become familiar with the possibilities of transferring capital\ninternationally, it seems likely that the potential size of speculative\ncapital flows will become even larger. The result is that most countries\nwill entertain the possibility of devaluation only in the most dire emer-\ngency, but the threat is nevertheless sufficient to induce speculation.\nAnd there is always the possibility that speculation will exhaust a\ncountry's reserves and force the devaluation that the speculators are\nhoping for.\n\nIt does not strain reality very much to describe the world economy\nwe seek to achieve as one in which (1) there is complete freedom in\nthe international movement of goods and capital, (2) exchange rates\nare fixed, and (3) individual countries are free to use monetary and\nfiscal policy\u2014primarily the former\u2014to attain their domestic price\nand employment goals. And the system is subject to the constraint that\neach country possesses a limited supply of reserves with which to cover\ndeficits in its balance of payments.\n\nThe trouble with this system is that it is basically inconsistent.\n\"There are three possible ways of correcting a deficit or surplus through\nadjustment of the current account: through the use of trade or ex-\nchange controls, through an adjustment of exchange rates, and through\ninternal price and income changes. Since all of these violate the princi-\nples of the system, they are ruled out. Consequently, when a country\nexperiences a deficit, there is no assurance that the deficit will be elimi-\nnated before its limited supply of reserves is used up. And the\ndifficulty is further compounded by the nature of the prevailing ex-\nchange rate system under which a persistent deficit creates a fear of\ndevaluation, possibly leading to a speculative outflow of capital and an\nunlimited self-generating expansion of the deficit.\n\nThus, if the underlying principles are adhered to, there is no mecha-\nnism that can be depended upon to eliminate a balance-of-payments\ndisequilibrium brought about by such disruptive forces as changes in\ntastes or technology. Beyond that, even if the system is in equilibrium\nto begin with, the diverse price trends inherent in the independent eco-\nnomic policies of the member countries may themselves in due course\nproduce disequilibrium.\n\nOf course, the system has worked after a fashion\u2014although the\nroad has been pretty rocky, especially in view of the fact that only six\nyears have elapsed since the restoration of convertibility in 1958.

There is no\ncorresponding limit for surpluses.\n\nSome of the features in the above list need to be spelled out a little\nmore fully. First, with regard to the goal of internal stability (item 1\nabove), countries are often said to seek the twin goals of full employ-\nment\" and \"price stability.\" For some time, however, it has been get-\nting increasingly clear that this way of describing the situation is quite\nout of touch with reality. Indeed, the concept of full employment,\nwhile perhaps useful as a slogan, is without precise meaning. \u00c0 more\naccurate way to describe the situation is as follows: There is in each\ncountry a \"trade-off\" between employment (or unemployment) and\nprice stability; that is, over a considerable range the more unemploy-\nment is reduced by policies to expand aggregate demand the higher is\nthe price that must be paid in terms of inflation. This relation holds\nprimarily because of the tendency of money-wage increases to outstrip\nincreases in productivity even under conditions of substantial unem-\nployment. The trade-off varies from country to country, depending on\nthe organization, traditions, and aggressiveness of the labor movement,\nthe price policies followed by industry, and so on, and from time to\ntime depending on the attendant circumstances. The trade-off may be\ninfluenced by policy measures\u2014wage-price guideposts, incomes poli-\ncies, etc.\u2014but I am not aware of any cases in which efforts to change\nit have been notably successful. Not only does the trade-off itself vary\nfrom country to country but so also do the relative weights attached to\nprice stability and employment in the implicit social welfare functions\nthat govern the behavior of the authorities responsible for economic\npolicy in the various countries. As a consequence, to the extent that\neach country is left free to decide what combination of price inflation\nand employment to select from the many choices open to it, price trends\nmay vary considerably from country to country.'\n\nThe other feature that calls for further comment is exchange rate\narrangements (item 4 above). Although, as indicated above, fixed ex-\nchange rates appear to be one of the generally accepted goals of eco-\nnomic policy, we do not now have a system of really fixed rates. In-\ndeed, the most serious difficulty with the present international moneta-\nry system seems to lie in the area of exchange rate policy.

And since it is a practically un-\n\nattainable goal for individual countries, it is obviously an unrealistic objective for the\nworld as a whole.\n"], "1": ["I. Introduction\n\nIf I were asked to sketch the main features of the world economy as\nit exists today, with particular reference to the advanced industrial\ncountries, I would describe the situation in the following way:\n\n1. Each country insists on the free exercise of its sovereign authori-\nty to regulate its level of internal demand for the purpose of maintain-\ning suitable economic conditions at home in terms of employment and\nthe behavior of its internal price level. In addition, the idea of govern-\nmental responsibility for the attainment of a satisfactory rate of long-\nterm economic growth is widely accepted, and some efforts are made to\ninfluence the composition of demand in favor of investment-type activ-\nities as a means of accelerating growth.\n\n2. In many countries, fiscal policy is, as a practical matter, a rela-\ntively inflexible instrument, partly because of unsatisfactory adminis-\ntrative arrangements and in some cases also because of outmoded and\nunenlightened views about budget deficits. Monetary policy is adminis-\ntratively more flexible, but, in practice, freedom to use it for domestic\npurposes has become increasingly limited by balance-of-payments con-\nsiderations.\n\n3. Free international movement of goods and of capital as a means\nof achieving efficient use of resources is generally accepted as a goal,\nand substantial progress has been made in achieving it. In particular,\nsince the advent of general currency convertibility in 1958, controls\nover the international flow of capital have been relaxed and investors\nhave become increasingly inclined to shift funds internationally in re-\nSponse to differential changes in expected rates of return.\n\n4. Subject to some important qualifications to be discussed below,\ntrade is conducted under a system of fixed exchange parities, with ac-\ntual exchange rates fluctuating only within very narrow limits around\nthese parities.\n\n5. Countries hold limited supplies of monetary reserves in the form\nof gold, foreign exchange, and lines of credit at the IMF. The reserves\navailable and potentially obtainable set a limit\u2014albeit a somewhat\nelastic one\u2014on the cumulative size of a country's balance-of-payments\ndeficit.

The increase\nin the proportion of families owning stocks, marketable bonds, and\nother investment assets as portfolio grows is reflected in large 7: com-\nponents at lower portfolio levels.?\n\nAs in the analysis of total net worth, there are differences among the\nage groups which are of interest, particularly with respect to the pro-\nportion of families owning various portfolio components (Table 8).\n\nAt the same portfolio level, ownership rates are generally lower\namong the older families. Or to put it another way, the portfolios of\nthe younger families, at a given wealth level, appear more diversified.\nThe c parameters shown in the lower half of Table 4 are smallest for\nthe families in the 55 and over group, reflecting the tendency for own-\nership rates to move more slowly toward the saturation level.\n\nA summary picture of the effects of age differences on the composi-\ntion of portfolio is given by reweighting the data for the 35 to 54 age\ngroup in accordance with the distribution of families in the 55 and\nover group by size of their portfolio. The result is to remove the effect\n\n*'The marketable bonds component has not been included in the summary since the\nnumber of cases in the youngest age group with marketable bonds was small. For the\nmiddle and oldest groups marketable bonds ranked second and first, respectively.\n\n*Ownership rates of portfolio components by portfolio level were less well behaved\nthan were their net worth counterparts, as may be seen by a comparison of Tables 2\n\nand 8.

While checking accounts at banks is undoubtedly a relatively\nhomogeneous grouping, the other components are combinations of\nmore diverse elements. Even the U.S. savings bonds component, which\nat first might appear to be a homogeneous grouping, contains some\nbonds which pay income currently as well as bonds of the discount va-\nriety which pay income only at time of redemption.\n\nAmong portfolio choices, publicly traded stocks and a group of in-\nvestments that included mortgages, real estate and family corporations\nrank high in consumer preferences, while checking accounts rank low.\nThe share invested in stocks and other investment assets rises and the\nshare devoted to checking accounts declines with an increase in port-\nfolio size (Table 7). The share placed in savings accounts first rises,\nthen declines.\n\nThe elasticities (Estimate A) and their ranking from highest to low-\nest are as follows:\n"], "17": ["RESEARCH;\n\nFINDINGS FOR THEORY AND POLICY\n\nL1] Lz\n9 OcOOr o-e-ro\n\u00f3 MODO, WoOnxm\u00d3no\nz - \u00e1 E\ng\nS\nP\np\n&\nX*|s\ncoco mu romnro\nS -MqS7[| 4 1\nm\no\n\u00ab\nE EE E \u00edgs x\n5 oocooco ooooso\n2 m \u2014\u2014\u2014\u00c1\u2014\u2014\u2014\n&\n1;:'5QOQN O9wmoocr\n8 \" eO OR OOo\n[5] Dl EM M7\n\"clu\n&BRL || e\nBx\nQo85u &\nu\nSET\nP.\n21 y Ovur-cr 00 commos\nBT E LA Oddonu\nB EJ d on YT L0 g\nSg\nB^\ns B d\n4s $\nEu $\ne2 Caco Cost w a\n82 S82528 -s325 8| $8\nS8 sQ| o v\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 coo2o.-| B\nI\" ed\nI| Qouosa IE\nE B 3 16e oun5a $858 & \u00bb\nRsS3ltu T7 a\nRS g\n8 E\n5 3\nE & E\no\n8 |7 s\nE $* rn O MO Oo 50o0258 9 2\nLJ \u20acr-O n0 OOOnm,o bz\n1 :\n&\u00fc\n^ ER\nE-8-]\n- nmm - n 3S9\nES\n9\n$3\n2\nAu\nM\n\" 52\n2 RE\n2 g S89\n8 25\n&. 28\nB dao\nS 28\n\u00bb E HE\n;oBu wBIB\nvugo W03Se9v|Ts\nEEREEREEE 35235\nHEEEI $55 d SB\n\n[25-4\nzui\u00fcdd4i d2456 * A\n\u00c1 &\n", "pO O MOD Ou e\nSESZaT $595.89\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 - I 1 1\n", "I. 06505050 C\n$53332 9859932\n\n-\u2014-- - 4 r6]!\n", "E] mio rcocbmr.oo\nXuBs92 SSERAS\n\n-\u2014q- | \u2014 l\n", "NEN\n398828\n393838\nOQ Coo r\nYvoOneo\n\n325\n", "243\n"], "16": ["AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n", "242\n\nAMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\na\no Fl\nCN CH CL CX].

For example, the data show that for the two older age groups\nthe saturation level for ownership of homes, automobiles, insurance,\nand liquid assets has been reached at mean net worth; that is, there is\nno contribution to the overall elasticity from the \u00bb; component. On\nthe other hand, for assets such as businesses and investment assets,\nthe 7 component is quite large\u2014in some cases, larger than the m;\ncomponent\u2014at lower wealth levels, and continues to make a contribu-\ntion at rather high wealth levels. In particular, at mean net worth there\nis a substantial \u00bb: component; that is, the proportion of families own-\ning these asset types does not reach saturation until a much higher\nwealth level.\n\nThe discussion thus far has been concerned primarily with wealth\nelasticities and their broad similarities across age groups. The data\nalso show differences among age groups, particularly in the frequency\nof ownership of different asset types.\n\nIn general, at the same wealth level, ownership rates of the wealth\ncomponents are highest among the youngest families, home ownership\nbeing the exception (Table 2). The home ownership rate is highest in\nthe middle age group. At wealth levels above $25,000 where the sample\nlimits the comparisons to the two older age groups, the tendency for\nownership rates to be greater for the younger families persists. This\ntendency is reflected in the **c\" parameters of Table 4 which decline\nwith age for all asset types except homes; that is, the higher the ^c\"\nparameter, the more rapidly does the ownership rate approach satura-\ntion level.\n\nFor certain types of assets such as businesses, automobiles, and life\ninsurance, the lower ownership rates among the older families seem a\nreasonable result of the aging process; that is to say, one would expect\nownership rates to decline as families retire from active participation\nin business, as their need for life insurance protection diminishes, and\nas automobile ownership becomes more onerous. The higher ownership\nrates for, say, investment assets among younger families may, however,\nrepresent a preference change compared to young families of a genera-\ntion ago, and could therefore affect wealth composition if it persisted.\n\nConsumer Portfolio Preferences\n\nA concept of wealth limited to liquid and investment assets has been\nselected for study since it seems closer to the concept of consumer\nportfolio\u2014that is, the investments that are not also tied to some par-\nticular consumption use such as a house or an automobile or to engag-\ning in a business or profession.

Two estimates of\nthe overall elasticity 7 and of the \u00bb; component are presented. Esti-\nmate A of the overall elasticity for each asset type is the b parameter\nshown in Table 3 and discussed earlier. It is invariant with level of\nwealth. Estimate A of the \u00bb; component is derived by deducting the\n7 component from the overall elasticity and is therefore a function of\nwealth level.\n\nEstimate B implies that the 7\u00bb; component\u2014the wealth elasticity for\nfamilies holding a particular asset type\u2014can be described as a con-\nstant.? For families who own homes, for example, investment in homes\nincreases about 0.6 percent for every 1 percent increase in wealth,\nregardless of level of wealth. Estimate B of the overall elasticity is\nobtained by summing the zi and the \u00bb; components and is a function\nof wealth level.\n\nCharting the data points suggests that Estimate A is a better de-\nscription of the wealth elasticity of investment assets and possibly\nbusinesses, while Estimate B is a better description for homes. For\nexample, in the two younger age groups the relation between the mean\namount of investment assets and wealth was more clearly a linear\nrelationship than the comparable relation for holders of investment\nassets only. Thus the A estimate which depicts elasticity as invariant\nwith wealth seems a better description than the B estimate which sug-\ngests that the slope is steeper at lower wealth levels than at higher.\n\nOn the other hand, the slope of the relation between mean amount\nof investment in homes and wealth is clearly a function of the level of\nwealth, with elasticities greater than one at low wealth levels and less\nthan one at higher wealth levels. This can be seen from the data on\nshares presented in Table 1 which show that the share of net worth\ninvested in homes first rises then declines with amount of net worth.\nHence the B estimate seems a better description for homes. With re-\nspect to the other asset types, the choice is less clear.\n\nRegardless of which estimate of the overall elasticity one considers,\nthe same general conclusions as to consumer asset preferences emerge.\nFor example, the elasticities (Estimate B) and their ranking at the\npoint of mean net worth are as tabulated at the top of the next page.\n\nAs before, consumer preference for investment and business assets\nis very strong in each age group and that for automobiles very weak.\nMoreover, the role of the 7: component can be described in the same\n\n*'The estimation procedures followed were the same as for the equations shown in Table\n3 except that the x and y values used were confined to the group of families holding the\nparticular asset.

For an\nelasticity to exceed one at any wealth level, the proportion of a dollar\nof additional wealth invested in, say, businesses\u2014that is, the marginal\npropensity to hold that asset type\u2014must exceed the proportion invest-\ned in businesses before the dollar of wealth is added.

The basic\ndata used are shown in Table 1. Thus for the equation relating liquid assets to wealth,\nthe x values were mean amounts of total net worth for all families in the various wealth\ngroups; eg. $2,663 for young families in the $1,000-94,999 net worth group.

A decision to shift wealth from one's own business to another\nform of wealth, for example, may require changes in living patterns or\noccupation. Shifts among portfolio items can presumably be made\nmore freely in response to changes in interest rates and prices. In this\nanalysis of investment preferences, six major components are\ndistinguished: checking accounts at banks; savings accounts; U.S.\nsavings bonds; stocks; marketable bonds; and other investment as-\nsets.\n\nThe analyses are directed towards determining the forms of wealth\nselected as wealth increases, or, in other words, consumer preferences\namong different forms of wealth and investment. The major tool for\nthe analysis of consumer preferences is the elasticity of each compo-\nnent of wealth with respect to the size of net worth. For consumption\ngoods, elasticities are generally computed in relation to income. For\ndetermining consumer preferences among different forms of wealth,\nthe analogous relationship is with total net worth rather than with in-\ncome.* The interpretation is similar: low elasticities are interpreted as\nindicating low preferences, analogous in the classification of consump-\ntion goods to necessities; high elasticities delineate the preferred\nchoices, selected in greater amount as wealth (or income) increases,\nand referred to in describing consumption goods as luxuries. While the\ndistinction between necessities and luxuries does not seem as appropri-\nate in the investment as in the consumption field, differences in elastic-\nities do serve to show the investment choices with high or low order of\npreference.\n\nThe analyses deal with three age groups separately. Because the\nkind and amount of wealth accumulated are related to age, elasticities\nof wealth components without a control on age would reflect the effect\nof both age and wealth. The analyses presented here are based on pre-\nliminary tabulations. Review of the data suggests that for further\nanalysis the 55 and over age group should be divided to show 65 and\nover as the top age group.\n\nComposition of Net Worth\n\nOne way of expressing relationships between total net worth and its\ncomponents is in terms of shares; that is, the proportion of total net\nworth invested in the various components (Table 1).

The first, we believe, is that distributional objectives may be\npursued a long way through progressive income taxation without fear\nof encountering appreciable costs through creating work disincentives.\nSecond, only a very small fraction of the high-income population holds\na vested interest in the continuation of the various so-called *loopholes\"\nother than favorable treatment of capital gains and perhaps the var-\nious means of avoiding wealth-transfer taxation; the loopholes would\nseem, therefore, to be even less supportable than some of us had\nthought. And, third, the single most important tax-induced distortion\nof investment decisions stems from the extremely favorable treatment\naccorded capital gains, where the rate is zero on appreciation that re-\nmains \"*unrealized\" through one's lifetime and rises to a maximum on\nrealized gains of a very modest 25 percent. The findings of our survey\nmake clear the close substitutability between capital gains and other\nforms of income\u2014a substitutability which hardly seems to justify\npresent differential tax treatment.\n"], "12": ["Conclusions and Policy Implications\n\nThe survey of high-income individuals revealed a wide variety of\nmotivations and behavior. One fairly prominent theme, however,\nemerged: the economic activities of most of the group were not domi-\nnated by precise calculations of monetary gain. Most worked long\nhours in the face of high marginal tax rates; the demands of their bus-\niness associates and clients governed many of their activities; sheer\ninertia or traditionalism played a large role; indications of altruism\nwere often present. Since concern with taxes implies a strong commit-\nment to monetary gain, it is hardly surprising that the bulk of the re-\nspondents scarcely mentioned tax considerations at all, despite being\nquestioned for an hour or more about the details of their financial\naffairs. In only a few limited segments of the high-income population\ndid tax considerations explicitly appear to be very influential: one of\nthe most marked influences was on the estate planning of the older\npeople with the highest incomes and the largest wealth holdings.\n\nTax considerations did, however, appear to play a concealed role in\nsome investment decisions. This is suggested by the heavy emphasis\nlaid on capital gains as opposed to the realization of current cash yield,\nparticularly in the case of those in the highest income brackets. People\nneed not be keenly tax conscious to recognize and to act upon the tax\naspects of the opportunity to amass fortunes through the capital appre-\nciation route where that route is income tax free with respect to assets\nheld until death. Our analysis suggests that it is not the level of margi-\nnal tax rates that appears to matter; nor, in the aggregate, is the array\nof sophisticated loopholes or tax havens of much consequence in\ninfluencing investors! decisions. Rather, it is the \"'pie-in-the-sky\" at-\ntractiveness of tax-free capital gains that dominates the tax influences\nto which investors react\u2014when they react to such influences.\n", "RESEARCH: FINDINGS FOR THEORY AND POLICY 263\n\nsurvey results were seriously biased. In particular it was found that\nsingle or widowed women, most of whom were presumably rentiers,\nwere somewhat underrepresented among the interviews finally ob-\ntained. There was also strong evidence that the individuals who were\ninterviewed generally underreported their incomes, even though it was\nnot possible for us to check discrepancies on an individual basis. This\noutcome was not surprising in view of the fact that lengthy questioning\nis usually necessary for obtaining a full report of income, and in the\nsurvey the inquiry into incomes was quite brief. In presenting the sta-\ntistical results, rough adjustments have been made for the underre-\nporting of income.\n\nGenerally speaking, it is felt that the survey is not seriously biased\nfor the results presented here.\n"], "11": ["262 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nWhat may be said in sum about income taxation and work incen-\ntives? If it is provisionally accepted that tax disincentives are negligi-\nble among those with incomes under $10,000, where marginal rates are\nlow; if one accepts our result that only 6 percent of the aggregate in-\ncome of those with higher incomes accrues to persons who really work\nless because of the income tax; and if one accepts the additional\nfinding that three-fourths of these persons are already working more\nthan thirty-four hours per week and more than forty-seven weeks per\nyear despite the disincentive, then it would appear that the loss of\nwork effort in the economy due to the existence of the federal income\ntax instead of some feasible alternative has been small in the extreme.*\nNonpecuniary incentives to work are clearly very powerful. The tax\ncut has probably had little or no effect on willingness to work, even\namong those with the highest incomes.\n\nSocial and Demographic Characteristics\n\nThe median age of the high-income respondents, most of whom were\nmarried males, was fifty-one years. Nearly half of the group were col-\nlege graduates, and nearly half had grown up in a large city or sub-\nurb\u2014a much higher proportion than for the remainder of the popula-\ntion.

Attempts were made to investigate\nthe delicate issue of the effects of progressive income taxation on work\neffort. The technique employed was to ask first some questions which\ndid not directly raise the issue but which allowed the respondents to\nmention tax incentives or disincentives voluntarily; then later the\nquestions became more specific. This procedure made it possible to\ncheck the consistency of the respondents! assertions as well as the sa-\nlience of taxes to them.\n\nThe inquiry began with asking the respondents whether they had\nopportunities to earn additional income by working more. If they re-\nported having such opportunities, they were asked the following\nquestion: *How do you decide how much work to do then?\" Tax con-\nsiderations could properly have been mentioned at this point, but only 1\npercent of the high-income group did so. The most common answer im-\nplicitly referred to physical constraints (e.g., ^I work as hard as I\ncan\"). Some further questions inquired into whether the respondent\nwas working more or less than a few years previously, and the reasons\nfor any change. Again, an opening was created for assertions about tax\nincentives or disincentives, but virtually no such assertions were made.\n\nLater in the interview the following questions were put directly:\n*Has the income tax had any effect on how much work you do? In\nwhat way?\" At this point 12 percent of the high-income group report-\ned a tax disincentive and 1 percent reported a tax incentive.\n\nThere are good reasons, however, for caution in interpreting these\nresults. First, many of the 12 percent claiming to suffer a disincentive\nhad reported earlier that they had no opportunities to work more, and\nso the reality of the disincentive in these cases is in some doubt. Sec-\nond, few in the disincentive group had voluntarily mentioned tax con-\nsiderations in answer to the earlier questions about work effort. Third,\nit was revealed that the 12 percent claiming a disincentive worked on\nthe average as many hours per week and as many weeks per year as\nthose who said that their work effort was unaffected by taxation.\n\nAn attempt was made to sift through the disincentive group to find\nthose cases where the reported disincentive was fairly plausible. From\nthe 12 percent we eliminated those reporting that they had no opportu-\nnities for extra work and those who were already working sixty hours\nor more per week. 'This process left 6 percent of the high-income group\nas having *plausibly\" reported a disincentive.

Most in the high-income group said\nthey worked much longer hours than the standard forty-hour week.\nAmong those with jobs, about half said they worked more than forty-\neight hours per week and about one-fourth reported working sixty\nhours or more. The median length of vacations was only two weeks per\nyear.\n\nRetirement Decisions. Seven percent of the high-income group were\nretired. The main reasons given for the timing of retirement were that\na compulsory retirement age had been reached, that health had been\ndeteriorating, and that others in the business were ready to take over.\nVirtually none said that tax considerations had affected their decision\nto retire. About half of the retirees had been offered work opportuni-\nties after their retirement, and about half of these had accepted the\noffers. The reasons given for accepting offers were usually that the\nwork promised to be interesting or provided an escape from boredom.\nFinancial inducements were scarcely mentioned at all. Where offers\nhad been rejected, most explained simply that they preferred to remain\nmen of leisure. Two persons among the twenty-four retirees rejecting\nwork offers mentioned tax considerations.\n\nThe Employment Experience of Wives. In the high-income families\nabout one-fourth of the wives aged under sixty-five held a job. Middle-\naged wives (aged thirty-five to fifty-four) were more likely to hold a\njob than were those either younger or older. It was found that the like-\nlihood of wives being employed changed markedly at a family income\nlevel of about $30,000. When the family income exceeded that level, it\nwas found that the wives were much less likely to be currently\nemployed; that if they were employed, they were much less likely to\nbe employed full time; and that if they were not currently employed\nthey were much less likely to contemplate going to work at some time\nin the future.*\n\nWhen relevant, questions were asked about the reasons for the\nwife's plans to continue working, the reasons for her having stopped\nworking, and the reasons for her decision about whether or not to go to\nwork in the future.

Here the failure to exploit the tax system more fully is rather\nsurprising, since the great majority of high-income taxpayers routinely\nmake charitable contributions and in high tax brackets there are large\nadvantages to donating appreciated stock or other property instead of\ncash.\n\nThe third approach for the investigation of the effects of taxation\nutilized direct questions about the tax structure. Respondents were\nasked whether they had heard of the special tax advantages of invest-\ning in real estate. (The advantage might consist of being able to con-\nvert ordinary income into capital gains through legitimately claiming\ndepreciations which in the early years may be expected to exceed the\ndecline in market value or being able to keep a personal corporation\nfree of penalty taxes.) Only half of the high-income group had heard\nof these possibilities, and only one-fifth had actually made or thought\nabout making such investments. Respondents were then asked what\nother features of the income tax affected the way they invested their\nmoney. Two-thirds could think of no other features at all. One-fifth\nmentioned the favorable treatment of capital gains income. No other\nfeature was mentioned by as many as 3 percent of the high-income\ngroup. \u00c0 handful cited the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds and\nnext in order came percentage depletion allowances, the tax advan-\ntages relating to investment in timber, livestock, etc., and the offsetting\nof capital losses against capital gains. Although these responses clearly\nunderstated the use actually made of special tax provisions, it is tempt-\ning to conclude that the vociferous defenses which are heard in support\nof tax loopholes often give a misleading notion of the actual numbers\nin the population who are vitally interested in their continuance.\n\nAn inquiry into the effects of state and local taxes on the individ-\nual's place of residence revealed that only 1 percent of the high-income\ngroup was actually thinking of moving their residence in order to save\ntaxes. Next, it was found that one-fifth of the high-income group was\nunable to give even an approximate estimate of their marginal income\ntax rate. Finally, questions were asked about the effects of income tax-\nation on work incentives. The results of this inquiry are reported\nbelow.\n"], "7": ["258 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nteered were as follows: 17 percent of the entire high-income group said\nthat they preferred growth stocks to income stocks because of tax con-\nsiderations (referring here to the favorable tax treatment of capital\ngains income); 13 percent said that taxes (on realized capital gains)\nprevented them from selling appreciated assets; 10 percent said that\ntheir most recent sale for a capital loss had been advantageous because\nof tax considerations; 7 percent had made estate arrangements which\nwere motivated by tax considerations; and 7 percent had been moti-\nvated by tax considerations in their most recent sale of common stock.\nNone of the other thirty-four questions where mentions of tax consid-\nerations could conceivably have been volunteered elicited such men-\ntions from more than 6 percent of the high-income group.\n\nIt was found indeed that more than half of the high-income group\nmade no voluntary mentions of taxes at all. Even among those who did\nreveal some awareness of tax matters, the median number of mentions\nwas only two. The way in which the high-income respondents relegated\ntax considerations to a minor role in explaining their own financial be-\nhavior is rather striking.\n\n'The number of times that an individual voluntarily mentioned tax\nconsiderations was used to define his degree of \"tax consciousness.\" A\nmultivariate analysis of this variable revealed that it was positively\ncorrelated with income and the value of asset holdings and that male\nrentiers and those with large inheritances had especially high levels of\ntax consciousness. Perhaps the rentiers, most of whom were elderly,\nshowed this high degree of consciousness because of their long experi-\nence in financial affairs and because of having the leisure for exploring\ntax matters; perhaps the heirs were highly tax conscious because of\nfeeling some obligation to guard their patrimony with care.\n\nThe second approach involved discovering how common were cer-\ntain forms of behavior which are almost invariably tax motivated. It\nwas found, for example, that one-fifth of the high-income group owned\nmunicipal bonds. This proportion rose dramatically from 5 percent at\nan income level of $12,000 to 67 percent at an income level of $400,-\n000. The absence of municipals from the portfolios of many with the\nhighest incomes may, of course, not imply irrationality or unaware-\nness, but rather that these people had more lucrative tax havens avail-\nable to them or investments profitable enough to yield more even after\ntaxes.\n\nAnother possible example of tax-motivated behavior is the donation\nof appreciated assets to charity. The law permits a taxpayer to deduct\nthe full appreciated value from income subject to tax while paying no\ncapital gains tax on the de facto realization. Only one-seventh of the\nhigh-income group had ever taken advantage of this provision, al-\n"], "6": ["RESEARCH: FINDINGS FOR THEORY AND POLICY 257\n\ntioned above, the differential rates of the federal gift tax and the feder-\nal estate tax, the opportunity to split the wealth transfer tax base, the\nabsence of gift taxes in most states, and the deductibility of charitable\ndonations from income subject to federal income tax).\n\nEstate Planning. Only one-seventh of the high-income group had\nmade changes in their asset holdings with estate considerations in\nmind. As would be expected, changes were reported most frequently by\nthose with the higher incomes, with the larger portfolios, and in the\nolder age groups. The most common arrangement in anticipation of\ndeath was the establishment of a trust for children, followed in fre-\nquency by the distribution of property in the form of gifts, the conver-\nsion of assets into a more liquid form (presumably in anticipation of\ndeath tax liabilities, at least in part), and the purchase of extra insur-\nance. Arrangements to increase liquidity were mentioned by only 2\npercent of the high-income group, and thus the textbook discussions of\nthis particular *economic effect\" of death taxation would appear to be\ndevoting attention to what is in practice a very minor problem.\n\nTax Consciousness\n\nOne of the major objectives of the survey was to investigate the\ne\u00edfects of taxation on investment management and working behavior.\nOur investigation made use of three approaches. The first was to ask\nfor the reasons behind certain selected transactions or preferences,\nwithout explicitly suggesting tax considerations to the individual as a\npossible motivation, and to observe how frequently tax considerations\nwere voluntarily mentioned. The second approach was to inquire about\ncertain types of behavior which are most likely to be tax motivated,\nsuch as the ownership of municipal bonds or the donation of appreciat-\ned assets to charity. The third approach was to ask directly about cer-\ntain features or effects of the tax structure. Since the third approach\ninvolved referring to taxes in the wording of the questions, it was util-\nized only at the end of the questionnaire, and the first approach there-\nfore proceeded without the interviewer ever raising the matter of tax\nconsiderations. We now briefly discuss the results of these three ap-\nproaches in turn.\n\nEach respondent was asked several questions in the areas of invest-\nment management and working behavior where tax considerations\nwere not explicitly mentioned in the question but could conceivably\nhave been part of the answer. (E.g., ^Why is your business still unin-\ncorporated? What particular reasons did you have for making the gifts\nat that time?\") Individuals with complex affairs were asked more than\nthirty questions of this nature.\n\nThe areas where statements about taxes were most frequently volun-\n"], "5": ["256 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nthe sale, but a substantial fraction of the satisfied losers mentioned tax\nconsiderations as a reason for having done well in the sale. These per-\nsons recognized that their capital losses could be used to reduce their\nincome tax liability by being offset against short-term and long-term\ngains (and against ordinary income to a limited extent).\n\nTwo-thirds of the high-income group were in possession of large un-\nrealized capital gains, usually in the form of common stock, and ques-\ntions were asked about the forces inhibiting the sale of such assets or\ncausing the investors to be '\"locked-in.\" One celebrated source of a\nlocked-in effect\u2014the tax on realized capital gains\u2014was mentioned by\nonly one-fifth of those with large unrealized gains. The usual explana-\ntion for not selling was simply that no better investment was available.\n\nGifts and Inheritances Received. A series of questions permits us to\nestimate that for the high-income group about one-fifth of total current\nwealth holdings was derived from gifts and inheritances. This estimate\nallows for appreciation on the original value of the amounts received.\nMoreover, this proportion remained remarkably constant at all income\nlevels above $10,000.\n\nAbout three-fifths of those who had at some time in the past re-\nceived gifts or inheritances had sold part or all of the property re-\nceived. In most cases the proceeds were largely reinvested in other\nearning assets.\n\nThe Making of Gifts. About one-fourth of the high-income group\nhad made large gifts to relatives or charities within the two years\npreceding the survey, and this proportion rose steadily with income,\nreaching nine-tenths at an income level of $400,000. Gifts to relatives\nand to charities were about equal in frequency. Most of the gifts to\nrelatives (usually children) were made outright, although the use of\ntrust arrangements became increasingly frequent as income rose.\nWhen asked why the gifts to relatives had been made at that time,\nabout half of the donors cited tax considerations. These persons were\nreferring in part to the provisions of the federal gift tax which permit\na husband and wife to make tax-free transfers of $6,000 annually to\neach recipient. They may also have had in mind the fact that even\nwhen gift tax rates do apply, there are still large tax advantages in dis-\nposing of estates before death.\n\nA multivariate analysis of the factors behind the making of gifts\nshowed that, in addition to the obvious factors of income and assets,\nthe degree of the individual's tax consciousness was an important\ninfluence both on gifts to relatives and gifts to charities (the \"tax\nconsciousness\" variable is further discussed below).

'The\nhigh-income individuals were asked the following questions: *Have the\nchanges in interest rates on savings accounts had any effect on where\nyou keep your money? In what way?\" Only 22 percent replied to the\nfirst question in the affirmative. About a third of these said they react-\ned by keeping more of their total assets in savings accounts, and this\nresponse was most common at the incomes above $30,000 and below\n$300,000. Most of the other reactions consisted of transferring funds\nfrom one savings bank to another. Interestingly enough, it was those\nresiding in the West, where interest rates on savings accounts have\nbeen at high levels and well advertised, who were the most likely to re-\nport shifting funds between savings accounts to take advantage of rate\ndifferentials.\n\nPlanned. Changes in Portfolio Composition. Individuals were asked\nto view their portfolios as containing three types of assets\u2014common\nStock, fixed-yield securities, and interests in real estate and unincorpo-\nrated businesses\u2014and were then asked whether they were satisfied\nwith the distribution in their present portfolios between the three\ntypes. About one-fourth of the high-income group reported being dis-\nsatisfied. Dissatisfaction was especially pronounced among the young\nand, paradoxically, among those who had been most active in making\nchanges in the distribution of their portfolios in the recent past. These\nresults clearly identify a \"restlessness\" syndrome. Most of those who\nwere dissatisfied expressed intentions to switch from fixed-yield securi-\nties into common stock, but at the highest incomes the most common\nintention was to switch in the opposite direction. Since those intending\nto move into fixed-yield securities usually cited tax advantages, it\nseems clear that they generally had municipal bonds in mind.\n\nExperience with Capital Gains and Losses. About two-fifths of the\nhigh-income group had realized a capital gain in the fifteen months\npreceding the survey, and about one-fourth had realized a capital loss\nin that period. Asked to judge whether they had done well in their\nmost recent sale for a gain, three-fourths expressed themselves as\nsatisfied with their own performance. A similar proportion was\nsatisfied with their most recent sale for a loss. Both losers and gainers\nusually justified their views by citing the behavior of the market after\n"], "3": ["ASimilar findings were reported for a high-income sample in the Midwest \u2014 Katona\nand Lansing (\"The Wealth of the Wealthy,\" Rev. of Econ. and Stat., Feb., 1964, pp.\n1-13).

Of course, the need for current income is also less at\nthe highest income levels. Perhaps surprisingly, however, there was no\ntendency for the investors with the highest incomes to be less con-\ncerned with safety or liquidity.\"\n\nAmong occupation groups, those employed in the financial sector\n(banking, insurance, stockbrokerage, and accountancy) were the most\nlikely to belittle the importance of current yield. Here and consistently\nthroughout the rest of the interview this group showed the greatest so-\nphistication in matters of investment management. This group was\nalso the one laying the greatest stress on liquidity as a desirable invest-\nment characteristic.\n\nPortfolio Composition. Questions about the ownership of different\ntypes of assets revealed that some types were reported with increasing\nfrequency as income rose and ownership of other types became less ex-\ntensive at the highest income levels. Among the first type (\"the assets\nof the rich\") were common stock, real estate, interests in unincorpo-\nrated businesses, preferred stock, corporate bonds, municipals, U.S.\nbonds paying interest currently, and Treasury bills and notes. Among\nthe second type (\"the assets of the not-so-rich\") were savings ac-\ncounts (for which the extent of ownership reached a maximum at an\nincome level of $40,000 and thereafter declined), U.S. savings bonds\n(reaching a maximum at an income of $20,000), credit union deposits\n($20,000), mortgages and land contracts ($100,000), and mutual fund\nshares ($200,000). The assets of the not-so-rich tended to be liquid,\nwhile the assets of the rich tended to consist of business equity.\n\nDelegation of Investment Decisions. Almost all of the high-income\nindividuals managed their investments themselves. Only 8 percent of\nthe group's aggregate income was received by those who had delegated\nsome authority to others (usually to qualified professionals like stock-\nbrokers or bank officers), and only 2 percent had delegated all authori-\nty over their investment decisions. Delegation was most frequent\namong those with the largest portfolios. Of those with common stock\nholdings worth over $500,000, about one-fourth had delegated some or\nall authority. Among occupation groups, female rentiers were the most\nlikely to delegate authority.\n\nInvestment Activity and Information Sources.

In an ordinary representative sample of people,\nthe most commonly expressed reasons for saving are to provide for\nretirement, for the education of children, and for security against fu-\nture emergencies. But among the high-income group, the \"security\"\nmotive was relatively unimportant. While the \"retirement\" and *edu-\ncation\" motives were often mentioned, they declined steadily in impor-\ntance as income rose. At the highest income levels (over $100,000),\nthe motive of saving to make bequests became predominant, being\nmentioned by nearly half of the group.\n\nThe young (aged under 35) saved mainly for the education of their\nchildren, the middle aged for their own retirement, and the elderly for\nthe making of bequests.

One would perhaps be\ninclined to ignore the harmful effects of taxation if it were found, for\nexample, that only 1 percent of all individuals were 'locked-in\" by\ncapital gains taxes and only 1 percent worked less because of progres-\nsive income taxes. But if it was revealed that these small groups ac-\ncounted for, say, 25 percent of aggregate stockholdings and received\n10 percent of aggregate earnings, one might take a different view of\nthe effects of taxation. Thus in our study each individual was weighted\nin accordance with his *economic importance,\" and income was taken\nto be the best available measure of such importance.

We can now summarize the survey evidence by saying\nthat they are both\u2014not in the sense that one can say x percent of\nfunds are meant for discretionary current consumption and y percent\nare long-term reserves, but in the sense that the same funds simulta-\nneously serve both functions. Long-term savings often are used tempo-\nrarily for discretionary consumption but nearly always on the consid-\nered premise that they will be replaced in the account.\n\nThe liquidity of liquid assets has been explored previously by a\nnumber of analysts who introduced liquid asset holdings as one of the\nindependent variables into multivariate cross-sectional consumption or\nsavings functions. The results have generally shown that, except for\npeople with small or declining incomes, liquid asset holdings at the be-\nginning of the year are not negatively correlated with saving during\nthe subsequent twelve months. Morgan and Kosobud have found re-\ncently that the liquid asset-savings relationship is positive among home\nowners, but negative among the smaller group of renters (after allow-\ning for other factors). These findings, though they seem to deny that\noverall the ownership of liquid balances stimulates spending, are not\nunambiguous. For in a cross-section those who have relatively large\nreserve funds have been the more active savers in the past, perhaps as\na result of habit, better methods of handling family finances, personal-\nity factors, or the presence of particular incentives to save.' The\nfinding that these people continue to be large savers may reflect, in\npart at least, our inability to control certain interpersonal differences\nin attitudes toward saving. In view of this qualification, the results of\nthe present study, which approached the problem in an entirely\ndifferent way, are of particular importance. They confirm the earlier\nimpression that liquid reserves\u2014and particularly savings bal-\nances\u2014under ordinary conditions are not dissipated on a longer-term\nbasis for discretionary purposes, even though they often serve as a\nmeans of financing in the short run.\n\n*For example, J.

Emergencies (illness being the major\ncase in point) and retirement follow a predictable pattern for the pop-\nulation as a whole and will not give rise to sudden large liquidations\nof assets among very many people. It is important therefore that only\na minority of savers (23 percent of those with liquid assets of $200 or\nmore) were prepared to say that all their liquid savings are meant for\nlong-term purposes and contingencies, so that they would be unwilling\nto use them for other things. Seven families in ten expressed willing-\nness to make occasional use of their savings account for discretionary\nconsumption purposes: durable goods purchases, home improvements,\nvacations, to pay bills that pile up, or *something extra.\"\n\nExpressed willingness to draw on the savings account for discre-\ntionary purposes increases somewhat with income and the size of the\nsavings accounts, and the kinds of short-run purposes also exhibit\nsome difference (Table 3).\n\nWhat is significant about these replies is that the observed use of\nsavings accounts to finance a variety of consumption expenditures ap-\npears as a stated and accepted policy, subject to defined limits, and not\nas a course of action which people resort to from time to time on im-\npulse and somewhat against their better judgment.\n\nThe role of the savings balance as a revolving fund also emerges\nfrom the patterns of deposit turnover that were reported (Table 4). In\n1963-64, about 55 percent of families with $200 or more in savings ac-\ncounts reported withdrawals during the past year, usually one or two;\nbut nearly six out of every seven families with withdrawals also re-\nported deposits during the same year. Of those whose stated policy was\nnot to use their savings accounts for any of the discretionary consump-\ntion purposes, only 35 percent made withdrawals during the previous\nyear. Among those who checked three or more discretionary purposes\nas admissible, about 75 percent made withdrawals (Table 5). Five out\nof every seven of the \"conservative\" users also made deposits during\nthe same year, and six out of seven of the *liberal\" users did so, under-\nlining the fact that the reduction of balances to finance such consump-\ntion outlays is usually a temporary expedient.

Would they go on a buying spree? Would\nthey switch into marketable securities? Or would massive drafts on\nsavings accounts require a break with observed motivations to save,\nand the rupture of established behavior patterns?\n\nThe answers to these questions probably vary according to the at-\ntendant circumstances. A powerful stimulus to spending, such as oc-\ncurred with the outbreak of the Korean war, might lead an unusually\nlarge proportion of families to make use of their financial latitude at\nthe same time. Under 1963-64 conditions, however, respondents' will-\ningness to draw on the savings account showed no correlation with\ntheir price expectations, their use of installment credit, or the impor-\ntance they ascribed to the rate of return. Only under relatively ex-\ntreme conditions might the findings of this survey imply a threat to\neconomic stability.\n\nA Wave of Discretionary Spending\n\nOne part of the evidence for this conclusion comes from analysis of\nthe circumstances in which people reported having drawn down their\nsavings accounts over a two- or three-year period (Table 2). Around\n200 families in the sample said they had done so, such declines having\noccurred more often in savings account balances than in checking ac-\ncounts, particularly in the upper income groups. (Reductions in bond\nand stock holdings were much less frequent.)\n\nOnly a very small proportion of the families who reduced their sav-\nings accounts shifted the funds into other assets. About 40 percent of\nthem spoke of making nondiscretionary outlays for various contingen-\ncies, or of carrying out such long-run purposes as buying a house or\nchildren's education. Most of another 20 percent who answered that\nthey reduced savings balances for \"no particular purpose\" probably\nutilized the funds to meet living expenses, often during periods of inter-\nrupted income. More than one family in four reported drawing on its\nbalance to buy a car or other durables, take a vacation, pay bills, etc.\nThese data of course represent a distribution of purposes rather than\nof dollars. If the purposes mentioned were weighted by the amounts\ninvolved, contingency and investment reasons might well loom larger.\n\nIt is very important to see how much of this behavior represented\nestablished, recognized policies and customary ways of handling fami-\n"], "4": ["But in addition savings accounts are viewed as revolving balances out\nof which large outlays for durable consumer goods, home improve-\nments, vacation trips, and occasionally *something extra\" can be\nfinanced.\n\nIn the contemporary setting, a dichotomy between current transac-\ntion balances and funds which represent long-term stores of value is\ninadequate.

In particular, it can and will shift them away from the manu-\nfacture of producible sources whose marginal productivity relatively to\ntheir marginal cost has fallen and toward the manufacture of produci-\nble sources where this has risen.\n\nFrom the macroeconomic point of view, the significant distinction is\nnot between services flowing from sources owned and services bought\nfrom others but between sources that are producible and sources that\nare not. Producible sources may then be called \"social capital.\" From\nthe social point of view a technical improvement is capital using if it\ndiverts current services from producing current consumption goods to\nincreasing the stock of producible sources, capital saving if it diverts\ncurrent services in the opposite direction, and neutral if it does neither.\nHarrod's device\u2014his use of the capital-output ratio (for a given 7) as\nan indicator of the bias in technical progress\u2014accurately reflects the\ninitial direction of movement of the marginal productivity of indirect\nrelative to that of direct use of resources.\n", "294\n"], "10": ["FioUzE 3\n", "-\n", "RECENT CAPITAL AND PRODUCTION THEORY 293\n\nsource of that flow, and also reduces the differences between the Hicks\nand Harrod neutrality to a difference between the private and the so-\ncial points of view that lie behind them.\n\nIn microeconomics we consider a producer who buys or hires his\nfactors of production on the market.

(3) It is possible that an identification prob-\nlem exists in all of these relationships and that b or 5' influences p. However, the tests that\nhave been made to determine whether some other variable, like a firm's (or industry's) rate of\ngrowth, is responsible for the variation in both b or b' and p, have not indicated that this is the\ncase. See note 15.\n\n15 Both the ratio of R and D expenditures to sales in 1960 and the rate of growth of sales\nduring 1945-58 were used as additional independent variables in equation (21) and the cor-\nresponding regression in the case of organizational technical change. Neither was statistically\nsignificant. The rate of growth of profits during 1945-58 was used, too, with similar results.\nWhen industry-wide data are used instead of firm data, the results are the same. For some\nrelevant discussion, see [16]. Note that, according to the model, the rate of technical change\ndoes not depend on 4.\n\n15 Of course, this helps to explain our choice of the petroleum and chemical industries, both\nof which direct a great deal of their R and D at new processes.\n\nT  'The sampling errors in the averages reported in the first paragraph of Section VI are much\nsmaller than those in the individual numbers in Table 1.\n", "TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE 321\n\ngrowth of its R and D expenditures, as would be expected on the basis\nof our model. However, there is no evidence that such frequently-used\nvariables as the firm's ratio of R and D expenditures to sales or its\ngrowth rate exert an important influence on its rate of technical change.!5\n\nSeventh, Table 2 provides new estimates of the rate of capital-em-\nbodied technical progress in various manufacturing industries. Accord-\ning to these estimates, technology advanced most rapidly in motor\nvehicles and instruments and least rapidly in machinery, glass, and\nfurniture. As would be expected, the estimated rate of technical change\ngenerally exceeds the estimated rate of organizational technical change.\nHowever, there is relatively little correlation between them.\n\nIn conclusion, these results should be viewed with considerable cau-\ntion, for at least three reasons. First, they are based on a number of\nhighly simplified assumptions: that uncertainty can be ignored, that\ntechnical change is cost-reducing,? that all technical change is neutral,\nthat the production function is Cobb-Douglas, and that, to use Phelps's\nphrase [12], capitalis putty, not hard-baked clay. Second, the estimates\nin Tables 1 and 2 contain substantial sampling errors.!? Third, they are\nincomplete estimates of the social rate of return, since they do not take\naccount of the effects of increased R and D expenditures in one industry\nor firm on productivity in another industry or firm. The social rates of\nreturn may be higher than ours.\n\nNonetheless, I believe that the results represent a useful first step\ntoward the formulation of operational techniques to measure the returns\nfrom R and D, and I hope that others will be encouraged to join in the\nwork toward this end.\n\n"], "11": ["320 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nSecond, comparing these results with the few estimates of this sort\nthat have been published by other economists, it appears that although\nour estimates seem very high they are generally much lower than those\nobtained by others. However, comparing our results with data I ob-\ntained from a number of large chemical and petroleum firms regarding\nthe expected profitability of their current R and D projects, it appears\nthat our estimates are considerably higher than the firms'. To some\nextent, the latter difference is due to differences in concept and to\nsampling errors and other inadequacies in our estimates. But to the ex-\ntent that this difference is real and our estimates are closer to the truth,\nit suggests an underinvestment in R and D, particularly among the\npetroleum firms.?\n\nThird, the estimates in Table 1 suggest that the marginal rate of re-\nturn was directly related to a firm's size in chemicals but inversely re-\nlated to it in petroleum. To the extent that these differences, which\nseem to persist for all values of 4 and e in Table 1 and for capital-em-\nbodied and organizational technical progress, are real, they suggest that\na transfer of R and D inputs from the smaller chemical firms to the\nlargest ones and from the largest petroleum firms to the somewhat\nsmaller ones might be desirable.\n\nFourth, the lower bounds in Table 2 suggest that, even if x is as large\nas .90, the marginal rate of return exceeded 15 percent in the apparel\nindustry, regardless of whether technical change was organizational or\ncapital-embodied. If it was organizational, the same was true for food\nand furniture. Although they are by no means unambiguous, these re-\nsults suggest that there may have been an underinvestment in R and D\nin some of these industries?\n\nFifth, whether technical change is capital-embodied or organizational,\nthere is evidence of diminishing return to scale from cumulated net R\nand D expenditures in chemicals and petroleum. If technical change is\norganizationel, our results, like Minasian's [11], suggest that the aver-\nage effect of a 1 percent increase in cumulated net R and D expendi-\ntures is a .1 percent increase in current output. If technical change is\ncapital-embodied, its effect is a .7 percent increase in current output.\n\nSixth, since the rate of technical change is measured by b if technical\nchange is capital-embodied (and by 0' if it is organizational), Table 1\nprovides the first published estimates of the rates of technical change\nduring the postwar period in particular firms. These estimates indicate\nthat a firm's rate of technical progress is directly related to the rate of\n\n1? For results based on other studies, see [1] (2] [3] and [7]. The data regarding the firms'\nexpectations pertain to eight firms and were obtained by interviews and correspondence.\nThese data, together with similar information collected during the next few months, will be\nused in a paper I am writing with Michael Hamburger on industrial R and D expenditures.\n\n33 Of course, this presumes that x does in fact lie between .25 and .90 in all industries. This\nis reasonable, but by no means indisputable.\n"], "10": ["NI\n-1- e 2,\nRl\n\nI set a; equal to zero, insert the estimates of \u00e0, 7, Re, Q, J, 2, o, and b\ninto equation (22), and obtain the results shown in Table 2. Like the\ncomparable results in Section III, they are lower bounds on the rate of\nreturn rather than estimates of the rate of return. Without data for\nmore industries, we cannot obtain the latter.\n\nVI. Discussion and. Conclusion\n\nIn view of their roughness it would be unwise to read too much into\nthe results in Tables 1 and 2. However, several points are worth noting.\nFirst, like the results of previous studies the estimates in Table 1 tend\nto be very high. Among the petroleum firms, regardless of whether tech-\nnical change was capital-embodied or organizational, the marginal rates\nof return average about 40-60 percent. Among the chemical firms, they\naverage about 30 percent if technical change is capital-embodied, but\nonly about 7 percent if it is organizational. Even if the elasticity of\nsupply to the firm of R and D inputs is less than infinite, as Machlup\nasserts, the rates of return remain high, so long as the elasticity remains\nwithin seemingly reasonable bounds.\n\n3 Tf true, these high marginal rates of return may persist because of the riskiness of R and D\nactivities or because firms are ignorant of the true returns. For further discussion, see below.\nHowever, if there is a lag in the effect of R and D expenditures on the production function,\nour estimates in Tables 1 and 2 overestimate the true rate of returns. If one knows the length\nof the lag, the necessary adjustment can be made quite easily. For example, in the case of\norganizational technical change, it turns out that our estimates in Table 1 (with c and ^ equal\nto .04) are about 20 percent too high if the lag is one year. Obviously, this may be important.\n", "(22)\n", "TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE 319\n\nNext, I estimate a; and as\u00bb, assuming that a; is the same for all firms\nbut that a; may differ between industries. The regression of 5 on p is\n\n(21) b \u2014 \u2014 .0244- .673 p,\n(.242)\n\nthe correlation coefficient (adjusted for degrees of freedom) being .61,\nand there is no evidence that a, differs between the industries. Thus,\nour estimate of a; is .673 and our estimate of a, is \u2014 .0244-.673c. Finally,\ninserting these estimates, together with the estimates of 6, o, p, i, I,\nR,, Q, and J, into equation (19), we obtain estimates of 7*, given as-\nsumed values of c and ^. The results are shown in Table 1.\n\nTurning to the two-digit manufacturing industries, we again reinter-\npret the model in terms of industry-wide aggregates.

Based on this interpretation, estimates of o, p, Q,\nR,, and 5 were obtained for each industry by methods similar to those\nused for the firms. However, since a; would be expected to vary consid-\nerably from one industry to another, I cannot estimate a; and a; in the\nway I did for the firms, unless data are available for a number of rela-\ntively homogeneous industries.

Note two things. First, since the two estimates are largely independent, it would be better\nto average Minasian's estimate of a; and ours rather than to use his alone. However, the two\nestimates are so close that this would make no difference. Second, it may be objected that\nMinasian's estimate of .11 is inappropriate here because it is based on the assumption that ai\nis zero. However, if we use the estimate he obtains when he relaxes this assumption, together\nwith our results, we get almost exactly the same answer.

Organizational Technical Change: Empirical Results\n\nTo illustrate how equation (6) can be used to estimate the marginal\nrate of return from R and D, I did a pilot study of ten chemical and\npetroleum firms and ten manufacturing industries. First, let us consider\nthe case of the ten firms. From correspondence with the firms, annual\nreports, and Moody's, I obtain estimates for each firm of o, R,, p, and\nQ. Assuming that the value of labor's marginal product is set equal to\nits wage, I use labor's average share of value added in the firm (during\n1946-62) as an estimate of o. To estimate Q and R,, I use data regard-\ning the firm's value added and R and D expenditures in 1960. To esti-\nmate p, I use the slope of the regression of the natural logarithm of the\nfirm's R and D expenditures (current dollars) on time during 1945-58.\n\nThe next step is to estimate 5' \u2014 a - as(p\u2014 c). Letting\n\n(0) V/V \u2014 Q/Q \u2014 aL/L \u2014 Q \u2014 o)R/K,\nit follows from equations (1) and (2) that\n(8) in V(t) \u2014 constant 4- 't.\n\nFor each firm, I obtained data regarding Q(i), L(t), and K(t) for 1946-\n627 Letting V\u20141 in 1946, I calculated V(t) for each subsequent year,\nregressed /n V(i) on /, and used the resulting regression coefficient as an\nestimate of /'. Since the model applies only to periods when the firm is\noperating at full capacity, I omitted years when output was less than\nsome previous year.\n\nNext, given an independent estimate of a;, I estimate a, assuming\nthat a; is the same for all of these firms but that a, may differ from in-\ndustry to industry.

By mistake, they are net of R and D expenditures. However, since\nR and D expenditures are a very small and relatively constant percentage of value added in\nthese firms (about 5 percent), their omission is very unlikely to have an important effect on\nthe findings. Note too that our estimate of a is very rough. We assume that labor's marginal\nproduct is set equal to its wage. (Of course, we could assume that physical capital's marginal\nproduct is set equal to its price. The resulting estimate of o would be the same.) However, we\ncannot assume that the marginal products of both labor and capital are set equal to their\nprices, because this would leave nothing as compensation for the investment in R and D.\nOf course, if this assumption seems too unrealistic, there are other ways that o could be esti-\nmated.\n", "where r! is the marginal rate of return from the extra expenditure in\n1960 on R and D.\n", "TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE 313\n\n(6) reap eX En-ME T Do o) al.

According to the available data,\nR and D expenditures in current dollars rose (approximately) ex-\nponentially in most firms during 1927-60.

Second,\nit allows for the possibility that an investment in R and D, like that in\nplant and equipment, depreciates over time, because of the obsolescence\nof research findings and designs.* Third, it makes the usual assumption\nthat holding constant the level of previous R and D expenditures (which\ndetermines the level of technology at a given point in time), there are\nconstant returns to scale with respect to labor and capital. Fourth, A\nand a can vary from firm to firm, and a, and a; can vary from industry\nto industry.5 Fifth, the little evidence that is available seems to support\nequation (1). A study [11] of seventeen chemical firms indicates that\nthis type of production function fits well and that the coefficients are\ngenerally statistically significant and of expected size.

For other papers that assume that current output is a function of cumulated past R and\nD expenditures, see Minasian [10] [11] and Kurz [4]. Apparently, this is the first model that\nuses a depreciation factor and includes \"imported\" technical change.\n\n* One implication of this model, as it stands, is that the firm must do some R and D just to\nmaintain its efficiency at a constant level. Since it takes some R and D simply to move along a\ngiven production function in response to changing factor prices, etc., this may not be too\nunrealistic. If one believes that this is not the case, he can set ^ equal to zero. This makes little\ndifference in the subsequent analysis.\n\n5 We assume that a; and a; are the same for firms within the same industry, but this assump-\ntion can be relaxed if one part of an industry seemed to differ significantly from another part.\nIn Sections III and V, we assume that a; is the same in chemicals as in petroleum. Because the\nindustries are similar in many respects, this seems reasonable. Of course, if more data were\navailable, it would not be necessary to make this assumption.\n\n* Note that Minasian's results [11] are based on the assumption that \u00e0 and e equal zero and\nthat his data on R and D expenditures do not go back very far. Moreover, because of the\ncorrelation between time and the sum of previous R and D expenditures, his estimates are not\nvery precise when both of these variables are included in the production function. Nonetheless,\nhis study, which is the only one of this sort that has been done to date, seems to point toward\nthe use of equation (1) as a first approximation.

Introduction\n\nAlthough recent years have seen a notable increase in the amount of\nattention devoted to the economics of research and development, no\nattempt has been made to use econometric techniques to estimate the\nmarginal rate of return from R and D expenditures in individual firms\nand manufacturing industries. The enormous dif\u00fcculties, both cuo-\nceptual and practical, in making estimates of this sort are all too obvi-\nous. Nonetheless, it is important that the task be begun, since business\nfirms and government agencies badly need better measures of the return\nfrom R and D.\n\nThis paper presents some results which are both preliminary and\ntentative. Having cursed the dark loudly and publicly,? my purpose\nhere is to stimulate discussion of the problem and to light a few candles,\nlimited though their power may be. Section II shows how the marginal\nrate of return from R and D expenditures can be estimated, assuming\nthat a simple model of production holds and that all technical change\nis organizational. Section III presents numerical results for a small\nnumber of manufacturing firms and industries. Section IV shows how\nsuch estimates can be obtained, assuming that all technical change is\ncapital-embodied, and Section V presents numerical results based on\nthis assumption. Section VI discusses the findings and concludes the\n\npaper.\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Edwin Mansfield"], "stable_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1816272"}, "1816273": {"affiliations": {"raw": {"10": ["332 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nance in the same year that the essential feature of our large corpora-\ntions was their failure to engender progress, except in the single case of\nthe household garbage grinder [8].

Horowitz, running similar correlations [2,\npp. 300-01], reached a similar conclusion: a positive but weak corre-\nlation exists between R and D intensity and the level of industrial con-\ncentration.\n\nThe difficulty with such regression analyses as these is not so much\ntheir statistical as their conceptual inconclusiveness. It is clear that ol-\nigopoly theory in its present state is highly inadequate for purposes of\ngeneralizing on such traditional variables as price and output. In a\nCournot model, price and output move monotonically from pure mo-\nnopoly to pure competition equilibrium positions as the number of\nfirms increases. In a Chamberlinian model, at some threshold point\non the spectrum of firm numbers between one and many, the monopoly\nsolution collapses and is replaced by a competitive one. And in game\ntheory models almost anything can happen. Moreover, the facts on oli-\ngopoly lead us to look with considerable pessimism for neat and con-\ntinuous relationships between variables characterized by far less un-\ncertainty than inventive and innovative effort. For example, the syn-\nthetic fibers and cigarette industries both have concentration ratios of\napproximately .80, but over the period 1953-60 synthetic fibers had a\nprice flexibility index of 0.87, cigarettes an index of only 0.02; and pri-\nmary aluminum with a concentration ratio of 1.00 had more flexible\nprices than paperboard boxes with a concentration ratio of only 0.16.\nUntil these diverse patterns of the commonplace variables of oligopoly\nhave themselves been explained more satisfactorily, it is difficult to say\nmuch more about the statistical analysis of R and D than that it re-\nveals far more stable and systematic relationships than those found for\nvariables about which we are supposed to know much more. I, for ex-\nample, would consider a computed correlation coefficient that ex-\nplained one-third of the rate of return variance in American industry a\ncomputation of some significance.\n\nThe recent statistical analysis of inventive activity obviously is not\nwithout policy implications. It is true that it provides no basis for ei-\nther condemning or beating the drums for bigness or for concentration\non the grounds that they either stifle or promote technical progress.\nBut this may be a much more significant contribution than it first ap-\npears. Only a short decade ago one of the nation's most respected pub-\nlic officials, not having the essential facts available, could state without\nfear of committing serious error that *Big Business\" was the nation's\ngreatest spur to technical progress [3].

In his own regressions of pat-\nents (more appropriately regarded as an index of R and D output\nrather than inventive and innovative input) on the three different size\nvariables\u2014assets, sales and employment\u2014for all usable observations\nfor the 500 largest American corporations (ranging from 365 to 448),\nhe obtained values of 5 ranging from .795 to 1.158, depending upon\nwhether the zeros were deleted and upon which size variable was used.\nIn all cases with zeros deleted, intensity of inventive activity as mea-\nsured by patents tended to decline with firm size, and in all cases tend-\ned to increase with firm size when he adopted the convention of count-\ning each zero patent as 0.5 patent to permit its inclusion in the loga-\nrithmic analysis. Also, in all cases, the values of b were higher (showing\ngreater increases in patenting intensity with size) when firm size was\nmeasured in terms of employment. By using alternative regression\nequations Scherer found, as did Mansfield, that R and D employment\ninputs increased with firm size in chemicals, and that in five other two-\ndigit industries R. and D effort increased with size up to about the\n$500 million sales size group and then tended to decline, except in pri-\nmary metals, which U.S. Steel pulled back into a stage of increasing\nreturns.\n\nClearly, any answer to how inventive and innovative efforts are\naffected by firm size hangs on an extraordinarily slender reed that may\nalternatively bend upward or droop downward, depending on the spe-\ncies of statistical zephyrs blowing at the time.\n\nSimilarly, we are equally unsure about the precise relationship be-\ntween market power and inventive and innovative effort. Mansfield has\nfound that in petroleum and coal over the periods 1919-38 and 1939-58\nthe ratio of important innovations to market share for the four larg-\nest firms was high: 1.42 and 1.26 for petroleum and 2.46 and 2.31 for\ncoal [4, p. 561]; on the other hand, the corresponding ratio for steel\nwas very low: 0.48 and 0.68. It would seem from the poor showing of\nsteel and the previously indicated relationship in primary metals be-\ntween size and research and development effort that the principal con-\nclusion on the steel industry is that U.S. Steel tries hard but does not\nmeet with spectacular success.

My own unpublished data on\nthe ethical drug industry (as distinguished from the drug industry) are\nconsistent with Mansfield's findings on the drug industry generally,\nbut they suggest that the ratio of research and development expendi-\ntures to sales increased markedly up to the firm size of $100 million\nannual sales and beyond this point declined slightly. However, between\n1946 and 1958 the differences in the ratios among size classes declined\nsubstantially as firms in the smaller size groups rapidly stepped up\ntheir research activities. In the \"research revolution\" in drugs, the\nlarger firms were the innovators and the smaller firms the imitators.\nWorley found that in six out of eight two-digit industries, research and\ndevelopment personnel per 1,000 employees increased with total com-\npany employment. But in only two industries were the results statisti-\ncally significant enough to warrant rejection of his null hypothesis that\nresearch and development effort increased no more than proportionate-\nly with size. In a more recent study of seventeen two-digit and three-\ndigit industries, Hamberg reached results consistent with Worley's in\nall of the seven industries common to both studies. In twelve indus-\ntries R and D intensity increased with firm size.\n\nBefore the consistency of these general findings be given too much\nemphasis, it should be pointed out that Worley's and Hamberg's re-\nsults, because of differences in data and method, conflict with\nMansfield's in the case of every individual industry common to the\nthree studies: glass, petroleum, and chemicals. These conflicting re-\nsults, however, can be easily reconciled, and this reconciliation points\nup the central finding of the recent statistical studies of market struc-\nture and innovational eifort: up to a certain size, innovational effort\nincreases more than proportional to size; at that size, which varies\nfrom industry to industry, the fitted curve has an inflection point and\namong the largest few firms innovational effort generally does not in-\ncrease and may decline with size. For the three industry groups cited,\nWorley and Hamberg fitted curves to all the available observations\nand found R and D intensity to be an increasing function of size.\nMansfield, on the other hand, confined his analysis to the \"very\" larg-\nest firms: ten large chemical firms, nine large petroleum firms, and\nonly four large glass firms. It is almost certain that Mansfield's petro-\nleum and glass firms fell to the right of the inflection points of curves\nfitted to a wider range of firm sizes.\n\nIn a study soon to appear, Scherer [11] has demonstrated that in\n"], "6": ["II\n\nA summary analysis of the neo-Schumpeterian literature cannot do\nfull justice to its statistical subtleties and refinements.

Hamberg [1], Frederic Scherer [10] [11],\nEdwin Mansfield [4] [5], Jacob Schmookler [12], James Worley\n[15] and others support the generalization that, at least beyond a\ncertain size level, the ratio of research and development expenditures\nto some index of firm size does not increase significantly with size, and\nmay not increase at all. But this, like most generalizations, must be\nqualified. Scherer [10] found that within the 500 largest corpora-\ntions on Fortune's list, the largest 100 accounted for slightly smaller\npercentages of total R and D expenditures and patents than of total\nsales. This suggests that size, at least after a firm has made the list of\n500, has no \u00edavorable effect on innovative or inventive effort.\nMansfield found that the largest firms measured in terms of sales in\n", "328 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nthe presence of large firms having temporary monopoly power, the re-\nstated hypothesis is, give me x innovational activity and I will give you\nbi, 2, .. . b. values showing how much of x can be \"explained\" in terms\nof firm size, the level of concentration, and similar a priori relevant\nvariables. The policy implications of the original and restated versions\nare also different. Schumpeter simply argued that any indiscriminate\nassault on bigness and market power, taken out of their evolutionary\ncontext, would deprive the capitalistic process of its source of progress.\nThe newer version proposes to tell us in quantitative terms, to the ex-\ntent available data permit, how much, where, and up to what point\ninnovative effort (and results) are attributable to such factors as firm\nsize and market structure. Accordingly, it holds out the possibility\nof providing guidelines that can significantly enhance the efficiency\nof public policy toward the private sector. The historic dilemma of\nremedial action under our antitrust policy has been the problem of\nweighing the social benefit of more competition in the classical sense\nagainst the possible loss of scale economies and innovative effort that\nattend firm size and market power. Obviously, if something approach-\ning probability values can be defined linking certain structural and be-\nhavioral attributes of markets with the intensity of innovative effort,\nwe can reduce the risk, to use a favorite expression of Schumpeter's,\nof throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

Three hundred and ninety-one firms having\n5,000 or more employees amounted to only 3 percent of the total number\nof firms performing research and development, and for an insignificant\none-hundredth of 1 percent of all industrial firms, but they accounted\nfor slightly over 80 percent of the total company-financed research and\ndevelopment. In 1958, the 478 firms making up the 5,000 and over em-\nployee group accounted for 29 percent of total industrial employment\nand 26 percent of total sales. Firms having less than 1,000 employees\naccounted for 90 percent of the total number of firms and for 60 per-\ncent of total industrial employment, but for only 5 percent of total\ncompany-financed research.\n\nFive industry groups containing most of the more narrowly defined\nindustries making up the *oligopolistic core\" of American industry ac-\ncounted for nearly 75 percent of all company-financed R and D:\nchemical and allied products (19 percent), electrical equipment and\ncommunications (19 percent), motor vehicles and other transportation\nequipment (14 percent), machinery (13 percent), and aircraft and\nmissiles (8 percent). At the opposite end of the spectrum are such in-\ndustry groups as textiles, lumber, wood products and furniture, and\nother manufacturing and nonmanufacturing industries, which together\naccount for about 5 percent of total company-financed research and\ndevelopment expenditures but for a considerable number of both the\nlow concentration industries and the firms with 1,000 or less employ-\nees. To be sure, there are several spectacular examples of highly con-\ncentrated industries such as tobacco products and steel that rank low\nin research and development. Similarly, some of the firms included on\nFortune's list of the largest 500 corporations spend a relatively small\npercentage of their sales on innovative activities. However, the data,\nnow far more complete than those Schumpeter had before him, clearly\nsupport his hypothesis: the trail of innovative effort leads to the doors\nof the large concerns operating in markets distinctly not characterized\nby all the conditions of free competition.

It is\nvery likely that, as it is frequently contended, a significant portion of\nprivate research and development is imitative and competitive and not\ninnovative in the Schumpeterian sense. This portion may possibly be\ndistributed among firms selling in the same market in rough proportion\nto their size. But oligopolists have other Schumpeterian innovative\nstrategies open to them, and at any given time one firm may easily rea-\nson that the best counter strategy to another's increase in research and\ndevelopment outlays is not greater research and development outlays\nof his own, but the development of a new product line through acquisi-\ntion or an increase in advertising outlays on product lines he currently\nproduces. The Cournot reaction paths among oligopolists with respect\nto research and development outlays could therefore conceivably be\nmultidimensional and could tend toward some rough equilibrium bear-\ning no systematic relationship to firm size.\n\nThe important question, however, is not so much whether the recent\nvoluminous and, on the whole, excellent empirical work constitutes\neffective tests of the Schumpeterian hypothesis. Schumpeter, more\nthan any other economist of his generation, assigned great importance\nto the innovational activities of the business firm and suggested certain\nof their implications for economic welfare and public policy. The hy-\npothesis itself was the product of empirical observation and, by the\ncrude and limited test employed, was of course delivered to us already\npretested by Schumpeter himself. As he put it, speaking of the sources\nof economic progress in a capitalistic society: *As soon as we go into\nthe details and inquire into the individual items in which progress was\nmost conspicuous, the trail leads not to the doors of those firms that\nwork under conditions of comparatively free competition but precisely\nto the doors of the large concerns\" [13, p. 82]. In the context of\nSchumpeter's basic thesis he left no doubt that he viewed the \"large\nfirm\" as synonomous with \"large firm with market power.\"\n\nBy the same crude tests, the hypothesis is as consistent with observ-\nable facts now as it was then. We need only consult any recent Sur-\nvey of the National Science Foundation [6, p. 20] to remove any se-\nrious doubt that company-financed research and development effort is\nhighly concentrated in large firms making up, for the most part, the\neconomy's more highly concentrated industries.

If we can predict cricket\nchirps from the temperature, then we can also predict the temperature\nfrom cricket chirps; so let us take a look at the policy implications of\nthe presumed collinearity between monopoly and research and develop-\nment outlays by interchanging the dependent and independent varia-\nbles. Between 1930 and 1963 the private outlays of firms on research\nand development increased from $116 million to $5 billion\u2014an in-\ncrease of 4,310 percent. No one to my knowledge, even the most lugu-\nbrious observer of our antitrust policy, has estimated anything like a\n43-fold increase in monopoly over this period. It could\u2014and\nshould\u2014hastily be pointed out that these data must be deflated by\nsome general economic indicator such as the gross national product as\nexpressed in current dollars. In 1930 the outlays of private firms on\nresearch and development amounted to 0.1 percent of GNP, and in\n1963 to 1.0 percent of GNP, a relative increase of 1,000 percent. To\nsuggest the possibility that monopoly may have increased even tenfold\nover this period would surely horrify every Assistant Attorney General\nfrom Thurman Arnold to William Orrick. I believe we can rescue our-\nselves from this situation and restore the philosophical calm of our an-\ntitrust crusaders as well by interpreting Schumpeter's theory as a\n\"threshold theory\"; some departure from a state of perfect competi-\ntion (or the presence of some monopoly) is a necessary concomitant of\ninnovation, but it does not follow that twice this volume of departures,\nsomehow measured, should lead to twice the volume of innovations.\n\nMoreover, the number of scientists must surely be an important de-\nterminant of the volume of inventions and, in turn, volume of inno-\nvative activity. As Derek J. Price has pointed out [16, p. 517], for\nthree hundred years now the number of scientists has doubled every\nten years or so; which means that at any point in time in this three-\nhundred-year period it could be said that approximately 80 percent of\nall the scientists that ever existed, currently exist. Again it is difficult\nto equate, or even systematically relate, this apparent law of growth\nof the scientific population with monopoly power in the private sector\nof the economy.\n\nThere is also a good theoretical reason why we should expect at best\na rather weak relationship between either the measurable input or out-\nput of a given innovative effort and firm size in any given industry, or\n"], "2": ["324 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nmitted accumulated surpluses the undertaking of risky and uncertain\ninnovational activities would not occur; and unless the prospective re-\nwards to such innovational activities were high (relative to competitive\nreturns), the incentive to undertake them did not exist. But for several\nimportant reasons this does not imply that the measurable innovation-\nal effort of a firm as expressed, say, in terms of its research and devel-\nopment expenditures should be a continuous and increasing function of\nmarket power, business size, or, for that matter, retained monopoly\nearnings.\n\nFirst, it has not yet been demonstrated that industry concentration\nratios are good surrogates for monopoly power or past or future mo-\nnopoly profits. The lines of demarcation between census classifications\nof industries are drawn often faintly, often heavily, and sometimes ar-\nbitrarily. And the concentration ratio\u2014the measure of market power\nmost frequently used in empirical tests of the restated Schumpeterian\nhypothesis\u2014is after all only one of the many possible points on the cu-\nmulative concentration curve and not a summary index of the entire\ncurve. Accordingly, even if industries identically monopolistic by a\ntrue measure of monopoly always earned identical monopoly profits,\none would surely still expect to find what we in fact find: considerable\nvariation in reported profits among industries having concentration ra-\ntios of roughly the same magnitude.\n\nSecond, and this is much more important, there is no presumption in\nthe Schumpeterian hypothesis as originally stated that innovational\nactivity as measured in terms of research and development expendi-\ntures is the only use to which accumulated uncommitted profits will be\nput, or that any of such profits, simply because they exist, will be put\nto this use in the absence of appropriate opportunities. Schumpeter\ndefined innovations broadly enough to include, among others, mergers,\nnew organization, the new advertising campaign, the new product, and\nthe new process. Only the last two are logical consequences of techni-\ncal research and development activities conducted inside the business\nfirm. What Schumpeter really said was that uncommitted balances\nwere a prerequisite to engaging in highly uncertain commercial activi-\nties. Hence, to run regression analyses of research and development\nexpenditures as reported, say, to the National Science Foundation (the\nmost comprehensive source of research and development expenditures)\nand firm size, concentration ratios, or any other index of market struc-\nture, at best only determines the statistical relationship between a\nfraction of the Schumpeterian variable and some rather imprecise\nmeasures of monopoly.\n\nThird, there is the fundamental question of whether, even if our in-\n"], "1": ["323\n", "I\n\nWe rely heavily on the a priori relationships between market struc-\nture and business conduct and performance for providing meaningful\ninterpretations of the activities of the approximately eleven million\nbusiness enterprises that make up the private sector of the American\neconomy. If firms are numerous and no one of them controls a\nsignificant share of the appropriately defined market, we predict rea-\nsonably competitive pricing; if firms are very few (concentrated oligop-\noly), we predict the contrary. Indeed, it is the assumed validity of\nthese relationships that makes price theory something more than ran-\ndom speculations and public policy toward monopoly something more\nthan the caprice of politicians and bureaucrats. There seems to be a\ngeneral presumption, ceteris paribus and all that, in favor of low con-\ncentration as a structural goal on the grounds that this is more likely\nto assure the attainment of certain performance goals such as price-\ncost relationships compatible with efficient resource allocation.\n\nIt is generally agreed on a priori grounds also that market structure\naffects the level of innovational effort, but there is far less agreement\non the magnitude and direction of the effect. Many economists adhere\nto the traditional view that competition begets technical progress [9,\np. 317]. But the Schumpeterian hypothesis [13, Chap. 7], probably\nthe oldest and most respectable on this subject, asserts that the posses-\nsion of accumulated monopoly rewards, the prospects of additional\nsuch rewards in the future, and the security attending market power\nare prerequisites to undertaking the risks and uncertainties of innova-\ntional activities. Contemporary students of the problem have recently\ninterpreted the hypothesis to state that the greater the profits and the\ndegree of market power (the potential capability to earn monopoly re-\nwards) or firm size, the greater should be the effort to innovate.

In addition, of\ncourse, the pressure for immediate results often necessitates the use of\n\"quick and dirty\" methods, which further deteriorates the scientific\nvalue of the work.

If we do not proceed now\nwith deliberate speed, we shall find ourselves doing so with desperate\nhaste as members of an emergency government task force of one sort\nor other, seeking instant wisdom to palliate some pressing social prob-\nlem, just as we now find our advice sought on the economics of growth,\nautomation, the patent system, the space program, military research,\neducation, manpower retraining, etc. One cannot say with certainty\nthat our advice would now be much better on these matters if our pred-\necessors had possessed a more scientific attitude toward our subject.\nTo make such a statement would require that we guess what, if any-\nthing, that we now know that is also relevant would have gone undiscov-\nered. It is obvious, however, from what has been said above what my\nguess on this question is.\n\nLike the other policy sciences, e.g., medicine and engineering, eco-\nnomics tends to attract into it men with a strong interest in immediate-\nly useful results. Even without a strong predisposition in this direction,\nwe would be less than human not to feel an obligation to assist in the\nsolution of those social problems which may be supposed to lie within\nour professional competence. Moreover, the bracing effect of reality to\nwhich economists are subjected when they try to solve practical prob-\nlems is especially valuable when the conceptual framework of the\nScience is narrow and the scientific interest in widening it is weak.\n\nNonetheless, a strong orientation toward immediate social problems\npresents two obstacles to the development of any science. In the first\nplace, the problems tend to abate before their scientific aspects are\nadequately explored. The patient gets well, or well enough, before the\ncure is discovered. When the disease recurs, as it usually does, the\nprofession has to start over again, often almost from scratch. Scientific\nactivity thus tends to be repetitive instead of cumulative, because we\n"], "6": ["338 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\ntion. The first is that to assert with confidence that a given variable is\nexogenous to the economic system may require that we know what\ndoes influence it. Thus, the grandmothers! tales sometimes found in\neconomic treatises to justify treating technological change as exoge-\nnous reflect not our knowledge but our ignorance. That this assump-\ntion should have gone unchallenged for so long reflects that inadequate\ninterest in the facts to which I referred above.\n\nThe second point is that to the degree that such variables as tech-\nnological change, tastes, resources, etc., prove on examination to be en-\ndogenous, existing economic theory is inaccurate even with respect to\nthe phenomena with which it purports to deal. For example, if recent\nevidence is to be credited, the rate of technological progress tends to\nbe higher in industries with higher rates of investment. If this is cor-\nrect, then an industry in long-run equilibrium in the neoclassical sense\nwill not be in equilibrium at all\u2014not because of external but because\nof internal conditions. The so-called *long-run\" supply curve of the\nindustry will shift, and, other things being equal, the proportional shift\nwill be greater, the greater the initial size of the industry. Whether this\nis indeed so will require further empirical research to determine. No\namount of postulating alternative possibilities will tell us which possi-\nbility nature elects.\n\nThere are other even more interesting problems awaiting investiga-\ntion. The old adage, *Necessity is the mother of invention,\" empha-\nsizes the induced element of invention and suggests that demand tends\nto create its own supply; i.e., a reversal of Say's Law. The general pat-\ntern of development of new consumer goods suggests indeed that to a\nlarge extent new goods are invented in response to changes in income\nand preferences. Similarly, the evidence alluded to previously suggests\nan allocation of inventive effort among existing production processes in\naccord with the prevailing rate of investment in them. If anything like\nsuch forces is operative, then our present dynamic models are seriously\nincomplete. To improve them we have no recourse but to develop solid\nknowledge about relations of the sort suggested and incorporate them\ninto our theory.\n\nA common objection, not to be taken lightly, to undertakings of the\nsort proposed is that we lack the tools to perform them. The answer to\nthis is twofold. First, whether we shall need concepts and research\ntechniques beyond those already at our disposal will not become ap-\nparent until we begin to work on the site. So far work in the field of\ntechnological change has progressed appreciably with only modest\nmodification of preexisting tools. The main problems have been to ask\nthe right questions and get the right data. Second, if we need new\ntools, we can get them in the same way that we got the old tools: by\n"], "5": ["TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE 337\n\nevents which we call economic\u2014-events having to do with the social as-\npects of the satisfaction of wants. We develop a few powerful princi-\nples and then allocate virtually our entire fundamental research effort\nto evolving, refining, and, more recently, testing them. Other than that,\nwith a few notable exceptions, we spend our time putting out\nfires\u2014fires which too often reach inferno dimensions because our fire-\nfighting apparatus is so inadequate.\n\nSuch a research strategy would be entirely appropriate if the theory\nthus developed dealt substantially with the whole range of phenomena\nto be explained. That it does not is perfectly plain. To get something\nempirical out of a theory, you have to put something empirical in.\nWhile more, theoretically-oriented empirical work is being done by the\nprofession now than ever before, not nearly enough is being done in\nthose areas where such knowledge is needed if we are to enlarge the\nrange of economic phenomena that our science explains. A theory\nwhich can tell us what will happen if technology, preferences, re-\nsources, and institutions change can be at best but a stage in the\ngrowth of our science, not its terminus. We also need theories about\nhow these change.*\n\nEven if these variables were in fact exogenous to the economic sys-\ntem as is commonly assumed, we would still need adequate theories of\nthem. Without such theories we will be unable either to explain or con-\ntrol major economic phenomena. What transpires when the state of the\narts, etc., is unchanged or change in an assumed way is hardly cotermi-\nnous with the range of phenomena to be explained. In particular, since\neconomic growth is caused to a large extent by changes in variables\nwith respect to which our existing theory is silent, that theory cannot\nbe expected to yield an adequate theory of growth without substantial\nemendation. What we shall probably need in the end, to repeat, is a\ntheory which explains what our existing theory takes as given.\n\nThere are two further points which need to be made in this connec-\n\n* Cf. Paul A. Samuelson, Foundations of Economics (Harvard Press, 1947) : *However,\nthere is nothing sacred about the conventional boundaries of economics if the cycle were\nmeteorological in origin, economists would branch out in that direction, just as in our\nday of political theory of fiscal policy is necessary if one is to understand empirical eco-\nnomic phenomena.\" P. 316. Cf. also James Tobin, *What is wrong with economics is not\nso much the putting together of the pieces. . . . What is wrong is the poor quality\nof the pieces that we put together in such models. Quoted in T. C. Koopmans, Tree\nEssays on the State of Economic Science (New York, 1957), p. 209.

Until we succeed in specifying fruitful assumptions . . ., we shall con-\ntinue to be groping for the proper tools of reasoning.\" (Ibid., pp. 182-83. Italics sup-\nplied.) Tobin's and Koopmans' complaints relate entirely to the inadequacy of our\ninformation about behavior, especially with respect to decision making.

And of course, out of sight, out of mind. When\nonce again our attention turned to economic growth, too many of us\nfound it natural to suggest as its chief cause capital formation\u2014the\nmain variable internal to our models which could make output per\nhead rise.\n\nThat it was our renewed interest in economic growth that led to the\nrediscovery of the importance of technological progress is significant,\nbecause that renewal of interest primarily reflected developments not\ninternal but external to our science. On the whole, neither our interest\nin growth nor our interest in technological change derives from a\nsteady scientific evolution and a clear scientific vision. Rather our cur-\nrent interest in both phenomena exemplifies the other principal reason\nfor our diminished awareness, until recently, of the significance of\ntechnological progress. The second reason is our concern, in itself ad-\nmirable, with pressing current social problems. More specifically, our\nattention has been turned to technological progress and investment in\nhuman capital, primarily because governments and people generally\ntoday place economic growth and military power high on the agenda\nand toward that end make large public and private outlays on research\nand education. The profession's interest in these matters has fol-\nlowed, not led, informed opinion.\n\nOne can confidently assert that, if the pressing economic problems\nof the interwar years had been not monetary policy, tarif\u00eds, labor, and\nbusiness cycles but the problems of today, then most of what we are\njust beginning to learn about technological progress would have been\nknown long ago. Thus, once again we find ourselves, as we have so\nmany times in the past, running from behind to catch up to the events\nof the day. In the meantime, the world pays, as it did in the big de-\npression, a heavy price for our ignorance.\n\nIn brief, most of us have been preoccupied either with problems of\nimmediate public concern, or with the elucidation of received princi-\nples which do not illuminate economic phenomena of major sig-\nnificance. These endeavors were noble and necessary, but our inabil-\nity to cope first with the big depression and now with the problems of\neconomic growth suggests that they were not enough.\n\nWhat has been lacking is that respect for the facts which character-\nizes the natural sciences?

On the other hand, a perhaps inevi-\ntable by-product was a distinct tendency to forget that the knowledge\ngained in the process was merely a knowledge of the assumptions and\ntheir consequences, and that the precise relation of such knowledge to\nphenomena remained to be discovered. Earlier economists studied the\nworld and knew it was round. Only their maps were flat. Too many\nlater economists studied the maps and mistook them for the world.\n\nProbably the outstanding example of this misplaced *concreteness\"\nis technological change itself, by which I mean in this context the pro-\nduction of new knowledge useful in production. With few exceptions\ngenerations of economists regarded technological change analytically\nas an exogenous variable. Not knowing its precise linkages, they could\nnot make it a dependent variable in their analysis. With the passage of\ntime, however, economists came actually to believe that it really was\nprimarily a noneconomic phenomenon; i.e., that its causes lay in other\ndomains of human behavior and therefore should in principle be treat-\ned in the same way as earthquakes. Now, there undoubtedly is some\nexogenous component in technological change, but there is also an en-\ndogenous one (a fact which was recognized, to cite just a few exam-\nples, by Smith, Marx, Mill, Marshall, and Hicks). What is more, re-\ncent evidence indicates that the endogenous component is usually dom-\ninant, at least in modern economies.\"\n\nWhen this fact also becomes more widely known, we will again be\nsurprised.

In short, in the main the production of new technology is it-\nself an economic activity. It represents in essence the mobilization of\nsociety's creative energies to relieve the scarcities which existing re-\nsources and products cannot. Far from being an exogenous variable, it\nis one of the most interesting endogenous variables of them all.\n\nBe that as it may, the necessarily heavy emphasis in recent decades\non the increasingly complex analytical framework conditioned our\nminds to the view that technological change was exogenous, not only\n"], "2": ["334 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nof the profession understood, but that the troops in the line did, too,\npartly because of their professional education but also simply because\nthey were generally well educated.\n\nAnd of course, I am not trying to say that a decade ago the leading\nmembers of the profession did not equally understand. The basic point\nis that the generality of contemporary economists were surprised by\nthe evidence, and the question is, why? The answer, I think lies essen-\ntially in an inadequate strategy for the advancement of knowledge in\nour field. It lies not in what we have done but in what we have not\ndone. We declined in understanding because we grew without balance.\n\n'Teaching aside, the activities of the overwhelming majority of the\nprofession have been directed toward two entirely proper objectives:\n(a) the further refinement and, more recently, the empirical testing of\nreceived principles, and (5) the solution of pressing social problems.\nThe pursuit of the first of these goals led inevitably to a considerable\ngrowth of the formal apparatus of our science. This, of course, was\nprecisely what was desired and indeed needed. However, since we\nneeded more time to learn and teach it, we had less time than before to\nlearn and teach other knowledge, however vital such other knowledge\nmight be to an understanding of those economic phenomena that the\nformal theory failed to deal with.\n\nAnd so we were forced to rediscover with a worm's-eye view what\nthe birds of earlier generations knew as a familiar feature of the land-\nscape. Lacking time to learn the history of economic thought, we were\ndoomed to repeat it.\n\nObviously, however, there is more to it than that. For the evolution\nof the formal apparatus might have brought technological change to\nthe fore instead of pushing it into the background. That the theoretical\napparatus grew as it did, however, was predestined by the very nature\nof the underlying principles on which that growth fed. On the one\nhand, the law of variable proportions presupposes a given state of the\ntechnical arts. On the other, the law of diminishing marginal utility\n(or its more modern form, the law of diminishing marginal rate of sub-\nstitution) presupposes a given set of preferences. To a large extent, the\ntheoretical apparatus which has evolved consists of the precise formu-\nlation of these principles and their application under various assumed\nconditions. Constructing this theory has preoccupied most of the best\nminds of the profession for generations. The most convenient setting\nfor this purpose was, of course, a static framework. While the results\nderived were readily transferable to comparative statics, and, then, not\nquite so readily, to dynamics, in both the latter changes in technology,\ntastes, etc., are assumed, not explained.

Whole\n\nEven though each individual equation or block of equations looks\nreasonable or statistically good (high correlation, small sampling errors,\nexpected qualitative effects, random residuals, etc.), the whole group of\nequations may or may not function well as a system. It remains for us\nto determine how the complete model extrapolates or generates simu-\nlated time paths of endogenous variables. This system, by its very size,\nhowever, is difficult to treat as a whole.\n\nThe estimation of any single equation, once data were available, was\nnot difficult, because each equation is linear in the parameters. In our\nfinal system, however, there are many nonlinearities in the form of\ncombinations of endogenous variables. This is a major complication at\nthe present stage of testing and applying the whole model. Recursive-\nness was of great assistance in simplifying estimation procedures, and\nwould help a great deal in algebraic solution for endogenous variables.\nUnfortunately, the system is not fully recursive. In a maximum delinea-\ntion of recursive ordering, we are still left with a large simultaneous\nblock.\n\nThe first step in solving the system is to decide what is exogenous or\npredetermined and what is endogenous. We have a large agricultural\nsector and a substantial labor supply sector. More work needs to be\ndone in consolidating and sharpening the equations in these groups.\nFor the present discussion, we shall assume that agricultural income,\nlabor supply, family formation, and government purchases of goods and\nservices are given. This greatly reduces the complexity of the system.\nThe remaining variables to be determined are GN P expenditures (con-\nsisting of several components of consumption, fixed and inventory\ncapital formation, imports, and exports), orders, factor incomes (de-\ncompositions of wages, profits and rentier income for individual sectors),\noutput originating by sector, prices, wage rates, and employment by\nsector, interest rates and currency and demand and time deposits.\n\nA stage below the exogenous category are endogenous variables that\nare functions of predetermined variables alone. An example is housing\nstarts, which depends only on lagged or exogenous variables.

Therefore, only a partial set of\nfunctions for the durable manufacturing sector will be shown.? (See\nTable 1; symbols are listed in Table 2. Summary statistics for the re-\nmaining equations may be found in Table 3.)\n\nGenerally, these functions and those entering into the more aggrega-\ntive results that follow were fitted to quarterly, seasonally adjusted\nannual rate data for the period 1949-60. The initial quarter did vary\nsomewhat from one equation to another and depended upon data\navailability and the lag structure of the included variables.\n\nBecause derivations and explanations for the functions of Table 1\nmay be found in the previously cited volume on the model, only a few\ncomments on their form will be made here. The investment equation\npresented is an alternative to the two-stage process of investment inten-\ntions and realizations that probably will be employed in future simula-\ntions with the model. The alternative equation reflects the intentions-\nappropriation-delivery lag on current expenditures. The coefficients\nand elasticities seem reasonable, except for the positive sign on the\nlong-term interest rate lagged one quarter. The standard error of esti-\nmate (.558) is somewhat high, but acceptable.\n\nThe inventory equation is of a type that has now become standard.\nThe most interesting variable\u2014and one not included in past inventory\nanalyses\u2014is the index of hours worked in manufacturing. This has an\nextremely high elasticity and most likely reflects the change in work-in-\nprocess inventories as production is increased. Unhappily, the coeffi-\ncient of the sales term (GN.P5 \u2014 INV$-- GN P**o) is negative. However,\nit is not significant at the 95 percent confidence level. Also, the variance\nof the residuals is high.\n\nThe changes in hourly compensation of production and other workers\nin manufacturing takes into account the influence of increases in the\ncost of living, unemployment, profits, and past wage changes. As it\nstands, the equation mirrors the impacts cited by writers who have\nstressed the institutional and bargaining determinants of wage deter-\nmination.\n\n? At present, the other production sectors are agriculture, nondurable manufacturing, con-\ntract construction, trade, regulated industries, and residual industries. Within the next year,\nwe hope to disaggregate to the two-digit level for manufacturing industries.\n"], "2": ["Model Structure\n\nAs is now well known, we have constructed a block recursive system;\nthis is, a system in which blocks of simultaneous equations feed into\none another in a recursive causal chain. The endogenous values in\neach block are determined by the equation parameters, predetermined\nvariables from lower order blocks, and exogenous variables.\n\nFrom a block recursive ordering for a modified version of the system,\nit can be seen that investment anticipations, the lowest order block, de-\npend only on lagged values of industry output and capital stocks. Here,\nas in many other sectors, the current endogenous variables also depend\non their own lagged values.\n\nIn turn, investment realizations are a function of current and lagged\nanticipations and lagged investment, output, and profits. Residential\nconstruction also is a function of predetermined variables. Consump-\ntion, on the other hand, is intricately tied into a large simultaneous\nblock of the system, since it depends on current prices and disposable\nincome, as well as lagged values of itself. Inventory change, orders,\nlabor requirements, and factor income formation also make up a large\nsimultaneous block. Finally, we have market determination of prices,\nwages, and interest rates.

Additionally, sometimes there are errors in copying and key-\npunching data and in performing transformations on the variables.\nObviously, such incompatibilities and mistakes can cause coef\u00fccient\nestimates that are biased, inconsistent, and inefficient. Therefore,\nmuch effort was expended recently to minimize these problems in the\npresent version of the model. All equations were refit (by ordinary least\nsquares; simultaneous estimates will be run at a later date) to a com-\npatible set of verifiable data. As might have been expected, when cor-\nrect data were utilized, some of the coefficients and their errors of esti-\nmate changed significantly. Consequently, modifications in a number of\nequation specifications have been made and others may be in order.\nThese will be undertaken in the near future. In spite of the need for\nthese compatibility and specification changes, we think that the fresh\nand original ideas that came from the widespread group of contributors\nwere extremely fruitful.\n\nThe research on the model, of course, is expected to continue over a\nlong period. Thus, the equations will be subjected to periodic review for\nstructural change and agreement with contemporary theory.

A positive merit of simulating large-scale econometric models is\nthat various alternative specifications of a given subsystem can be\nreadily compared, provided th\u00e9 remainder of the system is well\nspecified. For instance, much controversy still exists on the correct\nway to specify investment behavior. It should be possible to gain fur-\nther insight into the plausibility of different investment formulations\nby simulating each under different economic conditions.\n\nOther limitations deserve some discussion as well, but this discus-\nsion will be short, since the economics profession is strongly aware of\nthem. First, the quality of most available statistics is weak. We simply\ndo not possess internally consistent bodies of data with numerous stra-\ntegic cross-classifications of variables by industry, let alone region or\ndemographic categories. In many areas of research, computing capabil-\nity and theory of estimation and behavior have clearly outstripped the\nability of our statistical agencies to produce pertinent data for testing\nand estimation, even though matters are constantly improving.\n\nSecond, there quite likely exist inherent limitations of a random na-\nture, beyond which we cannot penetrate, although we are still far from\nreaching those ultimate limits in most instances. Many economic activ-\nities are fundamentally evolutionary and irreversible; their laws\" of\nbehavior are never likely to be fully understood. Even when fully un-\nderstood, the intrinsic random component of some processes may be\nlarge. Inherent random variation in investment behavior, for instance,\nis likely to remain substantial, even though averaging can improve the\nprediction of average behavior, which is the goal in most problems of\nquantitative economic analysis. It is also true that index number prob-\nlems of aggregation and quality change cannot be easily managed or\ntotally eliminated.\n\nThird, it is trite but true that the limits of theory are great: much\nwork remains to be done. If we experimentally attacked economic enti-\nties with the terrible ferocity that physicists exhibit toward atomic nu-\nclei, it would be considered justifiable grounds for complaint on behalf\nof the injured parties, because we are not yet all that certain about\nwhat to do with the pieces. As long as economics remains fundamental-\nly a nonexperimental science, the unknowable will bulk large.\n\nFourth and finally in conclusion, the dangers of substituting too\nmuch computer brawn for analysis should not be minimized. We may\nbecome overmechanized dinosaurs who ultimately will become extinct\nin an impenetrable underbrush of magnetic tape. But do not despair:\nthere abound many statesmen to warn us lemmings marching to the\ncomputer room that we will drown in a sea of printout.\n"], "6": ["THE NEW NATIONAL ECONOMETRIC MODEL 367\n\nmeaningful structures can be estimated, but it could turn out to be the\nmore realistic.\n\nAs a research device, the Brookings-S.S.R.C. model can provide es-\nsential support for the quantitative study of various subsectors. The\nmonetary sector will serve as an illustration. The core model now has a\ncondensed six-sector monetary set of equations, since for the next year\nor two it is our intention to explore the short-run dynamics of the en-\ntire system, which does not seem to rely critically upon a detailed\nmonetary structure. Yet the opportunity exists for monetary econo-\nmists with econometric interests to weld a more complex structure of\nmonetary equations onto a reasonably complete and tested set of rela-\ntions. The existence and accessibility of the model will avoid a detour\nfrom their central interest in order to construct such a system, which\nmust inevitably be done with some haste and still absorb much time\nand energy. In short, the possibility of expanding Adam Smith's pin\nfactory to the fabrication of economic knowledge becomes a more\ngenuine possibility; as in the manufacture of pinheads, two heads are\nbetter than one (ceteris paribus!). Since the Brookings-S.S.R.C. model\nis not a monolithic fixed construction, it is possible to combine a par-\nticular monetary structure with different investment equations or other\nsectors with which the monetary sector is thought to interact\nsignificantly.\n\nThrough the efforts of Holt and others [5], we now have computer\nprograms that will enable simulation and other (e.g., forecasting) solu-\ntions of large systems. This new capability places us in an intriguing\nsituation\u2014one of promise, but also some uncertainty. On the positive\nside, we shall be able to manipulate large complex dynamic systems in\norder to observe their properties. Much remains to be learned even\nthough some understanding of such systems can be found in the theory\nof differential equations and the literature of control engineering.\nThese techniques have been translated into an economic context by\nPhillips [14], Holt [4], Theil [20], and Tustin [22]. The\nblithe enthusiasm of simulation devotees has yet to be sustained by\nmuch visible evidence. The main benefits of simulation lie in either:\n(1) exploring the properties of systems whose specific operating char-\nacteristics are already well known but for which analytical solutions\nare difficult or impossible; (2) sometimes revealing incongruous sys-\ntems behavior when plausible (equation-by-equation) specification\nproves incompatible with other parts of a larger system.\n\nUnlike some relatively simple, readily observable physical systems,\nwhich have been successfully simulated, seldom are economic systems\nso well specified that great reliance can be put on the first, *solu-\ntion\" category. Problems related to the second category, verification\n"], "5": ["366 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nnomic interdependence. These implications have been effectively sum-\nmarized and presented by Goldberger [3] and Klein [7], who sur-\nveyed the \"state of the arts\" at about the same time. In brief, the most\noutstanding shortcoming is that the models were dominated by con-\nsumer demand relations to the exclusion of at least several important\nsectors. Production was treated in a cursory manner while monetary\nrelations and price-wage behavior were thrust into the background.\nMany equations were so aggregated that any chance of portraying\ngenuine underlying behavior seemed hopeless. While no miracles are\nabout to spring full-blown from the brow of this new model, these ear-\nlier binding restrictions have to some extent been weakened by sub-\nstantial disaggregation so that a more realistic system now exists.\n\nAt the same time that the level of aggregation was diminished, more\nproduction and price-wage behavior has been made explicit. Consumer\nfinal demand aggregation, except for housing, remains at levels similar\nto those of some previous models. The expanded scope of investment\nbehavior represents a major advance in realism, since industry demand\nfor investment is directly geared to industry experience. More detailed\ninventory equations are also tied to industry variables. As a naive phi-\nlosopher, I use the word realism in this context without apology be-\ncause I believe that meaningful economic structures only exist in quite\nfine detail. While fully aware that appropriate levels of aggregation\ndepend upon the objectives of an investigation as well as equation\nproperties, I believe that large aggregates across time, space, and\nequations, typifying most previous models, are unlikely to reveal fur-\nther interesting insights about structure. Increased disaggregation is a\nnecessary but, alas, not a sufficient condition for improved understand-\ning of the economy.\n\nIn this connection, Marc Nerlove's view of econometric models as\neconomic history deserves mention [13]. Estimated equations, in his\nview, have coefficients and a hypothesized structure which provide a\nconvenient summary of events over a historical interval. Thus econo-\nmetric models should be viewed much as raw time series, simple aver-\nages, national income, and product and other descriptive statistics that\nare used to describe economies. The interesting substance of this posi-\ntion is the increased component of theory compared with more conven-\ntional versions of economic history\u2014a methodological point well made\nseveral years ago by Meyer and Conrad [12]. There seems little\ndoubt that this form of history represents an advance beyond less\nstructured approaches to the past. History in this format, of course,\nreflects current fashions in economic theory as much as it does genuine\nsystematic modes of behavior. This perspective is implicitly less op-\ntimistic about the potentialities of econometrics than the belief that\n"], "4": ["\"Karl Fox in an unpublished paper has broken ground on the operational require-\nments for a highly detailed regional agricultural econometric model suitable for policy\npurposes, which could be grafted onto a macro model of the sort envisaged here.\n", "THE NEW NATIONAL ECONOMETRIC MODEL 365\n\nhave given the matter) that at least a dozen business corporations use\nmore sophisticated econometric models than U.S. government econom-\nic policy centers such as the Bureau of the Budget, the Council of Eco-\nnomic Advisers, and the Treasury.

As indicated above, this can be done\nquite effectively with small-scale, casually structured models. Besides,\na few quick telephone calls will reveal the latest ten or fifteen opinions\nabout next year's GNP. At the other extreme, much economic policy is\nconcerned with exceedingly fine-grained problems. For example, most\ncomprehensive econometric models are too coarse to indicate the\neffects of small changes in the parity price of rye or corn. Legislation\ntypically is concerned with highly specific and detailed content, for\nwhich global models, however intricate, are not yet appropriate, al-\nthough grafting finely detailed equations to macro models is one\nsignificant development which will be mentioned later. Another rea-\nson may be ideological: economic models, which smack of planning,\ncould perhaps raise congressional or other politically influential hack-\nles. The reasoning seems to be that policy whose detailed implications\nare unclear is preferable to the same policy whose implications are bet-\nter known: \"Speak no evil, see no evil, compute no evil\" appears to be\nan element of Washington economic thinking on these matters.\n\nBut there is much to be grateful for.

Since quantitative analysis should be judged by its\nresults, am I not tossing in the sponge before the struggle has begun? I\nthink not, and for these reasons. To begin, the Brookings-S.S.R.C.\nventure is intended to model or reflect reality to an order of magnitude\nmore closely than any previous venture of which I am aware; explicit\nambitious attempts to portray behavior econometrically will often fal-\nter. In the interests of cumulative research this is all to the good. By\npushing hard against the limits of knowledge, information about the\nsources of error\u2014equation specification, messy data, or pure random\nnoise\u2014can be most effectively isolated since the detailed structure will\nbe exposed to examination rather than being obscured inside a massive\naggregate. Forecasters quite legitimately can ignore these matters,\nsince the nature of the structure is frequently less essential to forecast-\ning success than its persistence into the future. When the underlying\nstructure is stable, collinearity among the predetermined variables will\nnot damage reasonably accurate prediction and at times negative co-\nvariances among the errors can compress the error variance of an ag-\ngregate. While appropriate prior restrictions lead to most efficient esti-\nmates (Klein [8]), uncertainty about model structure or the validity\nof identifying restrictions (Liu [11]) will inhibit model formulation\nand structural estimation but not the straight forecaster. In the face of\nuncertainties about model structure, the forecaster will choose any and\nall variables which minimize prediction variance\u2014and quite rightly\nSo; while equally correctly, the research economist primarily interest-\ned in structure will be more cautious about accepting variance mini-\nmizing formulations of dubious theoretical worth. In short, the a priori\nbeliefs of structural estimation often entail larger error variances than\na nonstructural, forecasting approach.\n\nFurthermore, the Brookings-S.S.R.C. model is sensitive to dynamic\nspecification, despite strong initial emphasis on the short-run lag struc-\nture. While dynamic theory has existed for quite some time, serious\nefforts to measure short-run dynamic economic reactions are really only\na matter of the past ten years, at most. Again, forecasters can choose\nto avoid these difficulties with impunity by forecasting over annual in-\ntervals instead of facing the more demanding task of predicting a\nquarterly time path. In the short run, at least, it seems that the price\nof efforts to achieve greater structural realism could be larger error\nvariances, although in the long run improved structural knowledge and\ndata will most certainly improve forecasting efficiency.\n\nHow about the next group on our list: the policy-makers?

In its original full generality the multiplier-accelera-\ntor model is a second-order difference equation so that, depending on\nparameter magnitudes, \"anything can happen.\" It is quite remarkable,\nnevertheless, how much of these original propositions still remain basic\nto an understanding of business cycle behavior. Similarly, the main\ntestable proposition from demand theory is that a simple or composite\ncommodity's own compensated price elasticity should be negative and\nthat in principle all relative prices and income determine quantity de-\nmanded (by an individual). Thus theory has provided only the most\ngeneral sort of guidance, which many econometricians (see for in-\nstance Klein and Goldberger [9] and Suits [19]) found insufficient,\nturning instead to a sort of quantitative institutionalism; i.e., modeling\nbehavior equations more and more closely on attributes which theory\noriginally had perceived dimly or not at all.'\n\nEconometrics presently stands at the intersection of theory and ex-\nperience, as a much more sharply defined apparatus for developing and\ntesting relationships than previously had existed, or been part of ac-\ncepted practice.

But so long as there is neither an equally\nstrong demonstration effect between aggregates nor a significant corre-\nlation between income and the strength of internal demonstration\neffects, aggregate data should be clearly superior to single society\ncross-section data as a source of information on the typical response to\nchanging incomes.\n"], "8": ["increased.

Yet relative incomes have not been recognized as a possible\ninfluence on the allocation of effort to income or leisure.\n\nHarrod distinguished between \"growing rich  oligarchically\"\n(through a higher differential income) and \"growing rich democrati-\ncally\" (through higher general incomes) [7]. This is a distinction\nthat is central to analyses of the allocation of effort to income acquisi-\ntion or leisure, for it is the democratic response that is of primary im-\nportance to the aggregate questions of economic development, public\nfinance, and the supply of labor.\n\n(The influence of relative incomes on studies of the allocation of\neffort is evident if we define a demonstration effect as an increase in an\nindividual's valuation of income relative to leisure as his effort-price of\nincome is increasingly different from the mean effort-price of his soci-\nety. All that need be considered, for present purposes, is the increase\nin the relative valuation of income induced by effort-price differentials.\nBut there might also be a consequent welfare effect that would, on an\nindifference map, shift the indifference curves laterally, toward the\naverage income at the average effort-price. Thus the demonstration\neffect would imply that the status component of a lower (higher)\ndifferential effort-price not only changes the relative valuation of in-\ncome and leisure, but also increases (decreases) the total satisfaction\nderived from any given combination of income and leisure. In the pres-\nent context, though, it is enough to say that an individual susceptible\nto a demonstration effect will value income relatively more than leisure\nat any given effort-price if that effort-price is different from the aver-\nage prevailing in his society (to accept Duesenberry's initial standard\nof comparison [5]).\n\n'This definition implies, I think correctly, that the status element of\na differential effort-price does not affect preferences for income and lei-\nsure symmetrically\u2014that it is income rather than leisure through\nwhich the additional satisfactions of status and prestige are manifest-\ned.? But this definition of the demonstration effect breaks with earlier\ndiscussions in attributing additional (or reduced) satisfactions to\ndifferences in effort-prices (i.e., differences in rates of income) rather\nthan differences in income levels. When, as is usual in such discussions\nof the status element of income, only the incomes of individuals within\na given institutional setting are considered, the distinction between a\ndemonstration effect defined on income levels and one defined on\neffort-price of income disappears if the amount of time the individual\nallocates to income acquisition is institutionally determined.

These\npossibilities would give alternative explanations for the observed relationship between\nincome and total work effort only if that relationship were positive. Since all available\nevidence indicates that it is negative [3] [2] [25], the desire for more leisure with higher\nincomes must have dominated these contrary effects.\n\n*Since this paper was written, Harberger has published an analysis of the differential\neffects of income and lump sum taxes on the allocation of time [27] that again points up\nthe need to measure work and leisure in the manner described in this section.

In this case, interdependence means that a society, unlike a sin-\ngle individual, can vary its allocation of effort to income and leisure by\nchanging how much time the \"economically active\" individuals allo-\ncate to income, by changing how many individuals are economically\nactive, allocating any time to income acquisition, or by changing both.\n\nSurprisingly, in previous analyses of the allocation of effort to in-\ncome and leisure, only Douglas [3] recognized (and then only implic-\nitly) that these two dimensions of the allocation of time enter the so-\nciety's response to higher incomes.

If an individual is a rational price-taker, is free to vary his\nallocation of effort, derives all income from the expenditure of effort,\nand if his indifference curves are normally convex and continuous, then\nhe will maximize utility by choosing that combination of income and\nleisure at which the price of income in terms of effort (the inverse of\nthe wage rate) equals the marginal rate of substitution of income for\nleisure.

Summary\n\nWe have introduced an adaptive production function which is useful\nin explaining the observed phenomenon of firm learning and the reasons\nfirms carry on plant activities peripheral to direct production.

In this manner the workers could simultaneously be trained and\nguaranteed a job. Which method is better as far as its effect on em-\nployment and wage rates?\n\nTo answer this question, we first cite Becker's distinction [3] between\n\"firm specific\" and general training. The former refers to training that\nraises a worker's marginal product only in a given firm while the latter\nis defined as training that enhances the worker's marginal product in all\nfirms of a given industry. We next note that under the current federal\nlegislation, workers are given general training for jobs that are poten-\ntially available while subsidization of in-plant training implies that\nworkers will receive both general and firm specific training.\n\n'To motivate our discussion of which is the better method, we assume\nthat there are no economies and diseconomies of scale when the govern-\nment gives general training; that is, the cost per worker of achieving a\ncertain average level efficiency of a labor group is independent of the\nsize of the group. We further assume that the government offers the fol-\nlowing plan to the firms in a given industry. Either the government will\nundertake the general training of potential workers as is now being done\nor it will subsidize individual firms to do their own training. Either\ntraining method would of course shift the labor supply curve to the\nindustry. However, it would seem reasonable to suppose that by letting\nthe firm preselect its workers and give them training on its own equip-\nment, the combination of general and firm specific training would cause\nthe labor supply curve to shift at least as far as any shift in the curve\ncaused by the alternative general training alone. Moreover, we should\nexpect that under firm specific training, the firm's demand curve with\nadaptation should shift further than under general training for at a\nminimum, specific training should enhance the worker's initial efficiency\nmore than general training. Thus, it is easily seen that specific training\ngiven by firms will cause more employment of labor units at a higher\nwage per unit than general training. Further, if this training is selec-\ntively given to the more unskilled workers, employment should increase.\nThus we conclude that the government would be well advised to offer\nthe above option to firms.\n"], "9": ["(15)\n", "p\n\n7 fid \u2014 eco) ' a5)\n\n?\n\nwhere ? is the product price, w is the wage rate, and f; is labor's mar-\nginal product. If the firm continually produces the same product, the\nadaptation term approaches unity, and the demand for labor reduces\nto an expression equivalent to the standard theory. However, if the\nfirms are job shops or firms where product runs have a limited dura-\ntion,? the average rates of adaptation and the initial efficiencies of\nworkers will influence the firm's demand for labor. From (15), we note\nthat in such cases we would expect less employment by the firm than\nthat given by the usual analysis. Moreover, when training is added to\nthe analysis, it will also affect the firm's demand curve in addition to\nthe industry labor supply curve. For if workers receive training that\nincreases their efficiency, assuming complete adaptation, the training\nshould enhance either or both their rates of learning and initial effi-\nciencies. This will cause a rightward shift of the individual firm's de-\nmand curve and thus a similar shift in the industry demand curve.\nCompared to the standard case, more labor units will be employed at a\nhigher wage as long as the labor supply curve is upward sloping. In fact,\nthe newly trained workers might be able to increase their wage rate\nwithout damaging employment as much as predicted by the usual the-\nory.\n\nThe issue of training is quite timely. Faced with widely spread struc-\ntural unemployment, the federal government has enacted the Man-\npower Development and Training Act (MDTA) which directs the gov-\nernment to undertake training of the unemployed. An important ques-\ntion based on this Act is where and by whom should this training be\ngiven. As we shall see, the adaptive function sheds light on this ques-\ntion.\n\nMost of the training of workers carried on thus far under MDTA\nhas been either at private or state supported vocational schools. The\nworker on completion of his course of study is then helped by the U.S.\nEmployment Service to obtain a job in which he can apply his new\ntrade. An obvious alternative to this is the government's subsidizing\nof firms unwilling to train on their own to hire and train unskilled work-\n\n13 These are perhaps the more commonly occurring types of business.

Finally, we note that any capital manufactur-\ner's expenditure on improvements that make its equipment easier to\nlearn to use will enable it to charge a higher price for the equipment\nwithout any loss of sales. This is in contrast to the standard economic\ntheory conclusion that a rise in price of its product (a leftward shift of\nits supply curve) results in less quantity demanded if its demand curve\nis negatively sloped.

We call the improvement\ndue to this on-the-job training or learning of workers \"autonomous\nlearning.\"\n\nDeterminants of autonomous learning may include the employee's\ngeneral experience, specific experience on similar processes, sex, age,\neducation, etc., when the process consists of jobs assigned to single\nworkers or a group of workers in which there is a single key employee.\nIn other group work where the output depends upon joint actions of\nall the people in the group, a weighted index of each person's attributes\nmay be a possible way of measuring the effect of a given attribute on\nthe group's autonomous learning.\n\nA further development along these lines might be used to distinguish\nbetween autonomous and planned learning. However, this distinction\nbecomes quite fine when we consider that the firm may use incentive\nschemes, formal training programs, etc., to influence autonomous learn-\ning. However, the effects of a training program should enhance the em-\nployee's initial efficiency and will generally reduce his rate of learning\n(or at least not affect it). Then the effect is in the same direction as\nposited for preplanned learning, and so we need not be overly concerned\nwith the practical infeasibility of forming all the distinctions our model\nimplies.\n\nWhen the adaptive production function has been fitted with actual\ndata, the above hypotheses about the direction of the effects of the types\nof activities carried out by firms on learning have been shown to be true\nin the situations studied. There should be little argument about the\neffects of industrial engineering and operations research techniques on\n\n?

Types of Firm Learning\n\nIn the last section we postulated some factors denoted by yi, ys, ^ * * ,\ny\u00bb that were supposed to influence both the firm's rate of learning (u)\nand initial efficiency (a) on a new process. To identify these factors we\ndivide firm learning into three classes which we shall call planned or\ninduced learning, random or exogenous learning, and autonomous learn-\ning.\n\nPlanned or induced learning results from the firm's allocating re-\nSources to activities that are designed to increase either a process's ini-\ntial efficiency, its rate of output, or both. Before embarking upon a new\nprocess, a firm may build models or prototypes designed to identify\ndifficulties that may occur during actual production. In doing this, the\nfirm hopes to anticipate these difficulties and either to eliminate them\nor handle them quickly when they occur. The firm may expend re-\nsources for selecting, testing, and training the personnel to be used in\nthe process, writing exact raw material specifications, and doing special\ntooling for the production run. These techniques carried on prior to\nproduction are called preplanning and are used to improve the process's\ninitial efficiency. We should also expect that the less the firm pre-\nplanned, the more opportunity there would be for learning during the\nproduction run. Thus, we suggest that the amount of preplanning done\nby the firm is inversely related to its rate of adaptation and enhances\nits initial efficiency.\n\nPlanned learning also occurs during the production run when the\nfirm undertakes programs consisting of time and motion studies, the\nredesign of raw material specifications, the shuffling of work crews for\nmore efficiency, etc. These activities, designed to speed the flow of\nproduct through the plant, are generally grouped under the title\n\n* For a deviation of the cost function and their properties, see Levy [7].\n", "390 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nthe joint actions of a group of workers, we should expect it to be a\ndecreasing function of the number of workers in the group.\n\nFinally, we note that if we assume the adaptive production function\nto be homogeneous in the factor inputs and to exhibit decreasing re-\nturns to increases in factors beyond a certain point, then expressions\nfor cost functions showing both rate and stock of output can be derived.\nThese functions will show that increasing the rate of output with stock\nof output held constant increases costs at an increasing rate and increas-\ning the stock of output with rate of output constant increases costs at a\ndecreasing rate.5 These results which can be derived from the adaptive\nfunction form the major assumptions of Alchian [1] and Hirshleifer [5]\nin their works on cost functions that exhibit learning, and thus they\nprovide a more fundamental theory for their assumptions.\n"], "4": ["(11)\n", "m\na \u2014 B. 4- 25 By (11)\nd-\u20141l\nSubstituting the expression for y given by (11) in the adaptive produc-\ntion function (8) relates the production rate Q(g) to these factors.

Levy\nRice University\n\nI. Introduction\n\nIt is well known that firms typically undertake a variety of activities,\nsuch as formal training, industrial engineering, and operations research\nprograms, that are peripheral to their direct production processes. In\ngeneral these techniques are used to increase the flow of a process's\nvalue added and thus to make the process **more efficient\" in the eyes\nof the entrepreneur. Without paying any attention to these activities,\nmanagement scientists and economists have reported on the observed\nphenomenon of firm learning or manufacturing progress where the num-\nber of direct labor hours needed to produce a unit of product decreases\npredictably as the firm gains experience in the production of the product.\nThis is equivalent to saying, as before, that the firm's rate of value\nadded increases.\n\nIt would seem reasonable to suppose that firm learning should be re-\nlated to these peripheral activities. If a firm expends resources in select-\ning and training personnel for a given process, the process should be\nmore efficient at the outset than with a lesser or nonexistent effort on\npersonnel selection. Also a firm using operations research and industrial\nengineering methods on a given process would expect the process to\nbecome more efficient or to exhibit a faster rate of learning than without\nthe use of these techniques.\n\nEconomists have overlooked both the phenomenon of firm learning\nand the techniques by which the firm may influence its rate of learning\nin constructing production functions of firms. Typically these functions\nshow the maximum rate of output measured in value-added terms that\ncan be obtained from given rates of inputs. 'The efficiency level of the\ninput factors is assumed to be invariant and their adaptation to one\nanother and the process instantaneous and complete, so that the firm\non selecting the rates of input for the various factors will begin and\nmaintain its production at the maximum rate. This, of course, is at vari-\nance with the phenomenon of learning and the application of techniques\nby firms to enhance production rates.\n\nThe purpose then of this paper is to present a production function\n\n* \"This paper is based on my Ph.D. thesis submitted to Carnegie Institute of Technology.

For this growth\nmodel, the replacement rule was seen to be independent of the invest-\nment-income ratio. A second criterion, profit maximization, was used\nto determine the economic life of capital. These two criteria were seen\nto yield the same life of capital provided the rate of interest is equal to\nthe rate of growth of output which in turn is true if and only if the\ninvestment-income ratio is optimal; i.e., the golden rule of accumulation\nis being followed. The introduction of profit maximization conditions\ninto the macroeconomic growth model clearly establishes the interde-\npendence of the economic life of capital and the investment-income\nratio.\n\n\"This formulation of the problem discussed in this paper suggests two\nrelated questions.

In such cases the problem\nof evaluating intersecting time paths of the variables must be faced\nsquarely.\n\nA second problem suggested by the discussion of this paper is con-\ncerned with the interrelationship of the investment-income ratio and\nthe longevity of capital. Economic policies oriented toward increasing\nthe rate of growth have been concerned with increasing the investment-\nincome ratio. Very little thought has been given to the possibility that\npolicies which attempt to encourage an increase in the level of invest-\nment may be more or less offset by an unforeseen changein thelongevity\nof capital.

Introduction\n\nThe specification of a criterion which may be used to determine the\noptimum longevity of capital in an economy has been the subject of\nsome controversy in the literature. The contributions to the solution of\nthis problem fall into two distinct categories. One approach to the prob-\nlem of determining the optimal longevity of capital emphasizes micro-\neconomic criteria based on profit maximization or cost minimization\n[1] [2] [12] [14]. A second approach emphasizes macroeconomic cri-\nteria based on the impact of changes in the longevity of capital on the\nlevel and rate of growth of aggregate consumption and output [3] [4]\n[8] [9]. To the extent that economic policy is oriented toward the pre-\nvention or elimination of technological obsolescence, it is important to\nknow the relationship between these two criteria. However, these two\napproaches to the problem of determining an optimal longevity of capi-\ntal have been developed more or less independently of one another with\nno consideration having been given to the possibility that these two\napproaches might lead to identical results.\n\nIt is the purpose of this paper to determine within the context of a\nneoclassical growth model the conditions which must be satisfied in\norder for the micro- and macroeconomic criteria to lead to similar re-\nsults. In the next section a macroeconomic growth model is specified\nand the equilibrium properties of this model are described. In Sections\nIII and IV, respectively, the macroeconomic and microeconomic capital\nreplacement criteria are explicitly derived. The implications for the life\nof capital of each of the two criteria are compared in the final section\nand the conditions which must be satisfied for their equivalence are de-\nveloped.\n\n* The study resulting in this paper was supported in part by a fellowship granted by the\nFord Foundation and in part by the National Science Foundation.\n\n1 A related point which will become more apparent below is that it is important to know\nthe relationship among the level and rate of growth of aggregate consumption and output,\nthe longevity of capital, and the share of investment in output. Policies oriented toward the\nprevention or elimination of technological obsolescence may well have an impact on the share\nof investment in output and hence on the level and rate of growth of output.

The real\nargument concerns the degree to which such methods can properly be\napplied. Many senior officers have protested that cost effectiveness\ncomparisons among rival elements (systems) are often invalid because\nthe systems are incomparable for one or more reasons.\n\nFirst, the employment of otherwise comparable weapon systems\nmay be too different for their selection or rejection on the basis of out-\nput per dollar. For example, Polaris-equipped submarines and B-52\nbombers can both attack strategic targets; their system outputs are\nmore or less measurable in targets destroyed, so their effectiveness\nmight seem comparable on the basis of cost. But B-52 bombers are\nvulnerable on their bases to enemy attack in a way that Polaris mis-\nsiles submerged below the water are not; bombers can be recalled prior\nto penetration in a way tbat ballistic missiles cannot; and manned\nbombers may be capable of a limited reconnaissance that intercontinen-\ntal missiles are not. These differences are enough to give each system a\ncomparative advantage against certain targets at certain stages of all-\nout war. Some critics argue that, given these differences, cost effective-\nness comparisons cannot be conclusive. (The rejoinder of course is\nthat cost effectiveness calculations in such a case are only one of many\nconsiderations in making a decision.)\n\nSecond, some systems are multipurpose with more than one military\n*output,\" and customarily these make a poor cost effectiveness show-\ning when compared against a system designed exclusively for one of\nthese purposes. For example, carrier based aircraft can perform many\nlimited war missions that locally land based aircraft can accomplish,\nbut the former can also be used in naval engagement far at sea and for\nblockading distant enemy coastlines. How can a cost effectiveness\nstudy give credit to naval air forces for such by-product outputs? It is\ndifficult. Hence elements having overlapping outputs often cannot be\ncompared according to cost effectiveness with much validity, except in\ncases where incremental units of some one element cause significant\nadditions to only one kind of output.\n\nThird, some program elements have no obviously measurable output,\n\n?'The procedures of the current programming system have been described by Alain C.\nEnthoven, *Economic Analysis in the Department of Defense,\" A.E.R., May, 1963, pp.\n413-23.

Hence these elements can be costed once a DOD system has been\nestablished for reaggregating existing cost data by organization. This\nwas done for most of the military establishment during 1961-62 for the\nfirst time.\n\nWith certain limits, as outlined below, costing most of the military\nestablishment by program elements permits several important ad-\nvances in defense management. Where two elements have roughly the\nsame kind of outputs, they can be compared for cost effectiveness, and\none element (or system) may then show a marked superiority in out-\nput per million dollars. Or economies of scale may dictate the selection\nof one system and rejection of a rival, even though in cost effectiveness\nterms they are equivalent. Of course alternative elements (or systems )\nthat compete in this manner not infrequently belong to different mili-\ntary services, and this explains much of the antipathy towards *whiz\nkid\" economists occasionally exhibited by senior military officers.\n\nPerhaps more important, where different and complementary pro-\ngram elements have measurable outputs that relate to the same nation-\nal objective (e.g., defense of the U.S. from air attack), they can be\ngrouped into a program package. It is then easier for top policy-makers\nto reach major budget reallocations between packages of elements,\nsuch as the packages of Strategic Retaliatory Forces, Continental Air\nand Missile Defense Forces, and Airlift and Sealift Forces.

And yet every study that\nincluded probable losses on the ground from enemy action demon-\nstrated that more targets could be destroyed in the Soviet Union, for a\nhypothetical U.S. budget, if most of these funds were devoted to hard-\nened subterranean silos and only a small fraction of them to ICBM's\nthemselves. After all, given a budget, the job was not to maximize mis-\nsiles deployed but expected targets destroyed.\"\n\nConcern about vulnerability led to examination of dispersal, mobili-\nty, and hardening, as means of preserving most of our strategic missile\nand bomber forces. Both dispersal and mobility, if practiced to any ex-\ntreme, occasion novel and costly logistics problems. It is difficult to\npool maintenance facilities and spare part stocks when missile silos are\nwidely dispersed, for example.\n\nAccordingly, starting in the mid-fifties, cost effectiveness and margi-\nnal analysis were applied to Air Force logistics. It was soon discovered\nthat there were many expenditure alternatives. To attain a given num-\nber of combat ready missiles it was found economical to some extent to\nhave more missiles and a lower in-commission rate. And it was learned\nthat a given in-commission rate could be achieved at minimum cost\nonly by a careful marginal allocation of resources for on-site equip-\nment, technicians, and spares as against centralized stockage and\nmaintenance facilities.\n\nThese and other logistics studies also revealed that the support sys-\ntem for any given weapon had to be examined as a whole. Attempts at\nanalytic factoring, considering ways to minimize transportation cost\nfor instance, almost invariably were found to increase costs elsewhere\nin the system by more than the subsector savings.

This meant costing future B-\n47 systems by B-47 wings for instance.\n\nHowever, the early RAND economists quickly discovered to their\nchagrin that the Air Force did not maintain cost data in such a form\nthat one could readily *cost-out\" a B-47 wing, for example. As in other\nmilitary services at that time, costs were aggregated by object line\nitems, giving actual or predicted disbursements for pay and allow-\nances, ground support equipment, maintenance, POL, etc. Thus de-\ntailed estimates had to be made for instance of how much a B-47 wing\nper se would generate costs for pay and allowances, ground support\nequipment, maintenance, POL, etc. It was also necessary to estimate\nthe cost of land, buildings, and other facilities used by operational Air\nForce units. And last but not least, the initial procurement cost of air-\ncraft and spares had to be estimated, even though not yet in produc-\ntion. Thus most Air Force expenditure data, better to estimate future\nweapon system costs, had to be recast into \"two dimensional\" ac-\ncounts, with object costs shown in rows and Air Force organization\ncosts shown in columns.\n\nThese estimated costs of future weapons systems, aggregated by\nwings, distinguished between initial acquisition costs and annual oper-\nating costs. Originally, the acquisition cost was estimated as though\nthe entire wing, with all it equipment and facilities, were purchased\nnew. No allowance, in other words, was made for base facilities inher-\nited from preceding systems (e.g., B-36 wings) being phased-out, and\nno salvage value was credited a new system for the assets it in turn\nmight bequeath in another ten years perhaps to is successor.

Not very surprisingly, when the absolute assignment of FM. was\nzero for tactical and all for strategic uses, the marginal value of nu-\nclear weapon materials was much higher in the former use than the lat-\nter.

And once the cost of acquiring\nand keeping a bomber was determined (see below), the use value of\nFM was revealed as the delivery costs it \"saved.\" And in the early\n1950's the marginal use value of FM appeared to be several times\nlarger than the AEC's marginal cost of producing them\u2014 suggesting\nfor example that the Oak Ridge gaseous diffusion plant should be oper-\nated more intensively.\n\nObviously the analysis was complicated by future uncertainties.

The\ncomputer has been applied to many aspects of data preparation and\nprocessing. This has furthered orderliness and accuracy in the prep-\naration and updating of basic military data files and has made these\nfiles more accessible to military cost analysts.\n\nAs the military departments extend the application of computers to\ncosting in the programming process, they come closer to comprehen-\nsive force cost models; i.e., systems of relationships and data from\nwhich are computed the time-phased resource and cost requirements\nfor the equipping and operating of a force.\n\nSuch force cost models for programming will be similar to earlier\nforce cost models for the comparative costing of alternative programs\nbut will retain some points of difference:\n\nFirst, whereas the comparative cost model is aimed at the iden-\ntification of the time-phased incremental costs of an alternative pro-\ngram (as compared to the base program), the programming cost model\nwill be aimed at achieving fairly accurate costing of a single official\nprogram.\n\nSecond, whereas in the comparative cost model, any breakdown of\nthe time-phased incremental cost stream into major program and pro-\ngram element costs is for incidental and secondary purposes, such\nbreakdowns are intrinsic to the purposes of the programming cost\nmodel.

As a generalization, the core of the costing problem is the devel-\nopment of the specification of what is to be costed; the actual applica-\ntion of cost factors is the less difficult part of the problem. The mili-\ntary cost analyst plays a useful role in the specifiation process, particu-\nlarly in regard to ferreting out all of the resources to be required by a\nprogram.

An important part of costing is the application of estimating rela-\ntionships to transform the specification of the ingredients of the force\nor system in its proper time-phasing into a cost estimate. Estimating\nrelationships are used in such areas as the development of estimates\nfor maintenance workload or training requirements consequent upon\nthe use of major items of equipment and in the translation of work-\nloads to costs. The cost-quantity curve is a particular kind of estimat-\ning relationship in which hardware production costs are related to\nquantity and rate of production. A specific cost estimate may require\nthe use of many relationships, most of which are developed and accum-\nulated over time to be available when needed. A substantial cost esti-\nmating research investment is required for the maintenance of a cost-\ning capability.\n\nThis brief description of military cost analysis should be sufficient to\nindicate the differences in emphases from the conventional Defense\nbudgeting process. Among the most important differences are: concern\nin military cost analysis with a force or weapon system rather than\nwith a budget category such as aircraft procurement or depot supply;\ncollection of all costs pertaining to the force or weapon for an extended\nperiod of time as against costing for one year; and emphasis on rela-\ntive rather than absolute accuracy. The budget system highlights cate-\ngories useful for control of spending (e.g. a military personnel\nappropriation); administrative aspects receive important attention.\nMilitary cost analysis is aimed at providing insight on cost implica-\ntions of alternative courses of action.\n\nThese differences are of sufficient magnitude to explain why military\ncost analysis developed outside of the Defense Department itself\u00cd\u2014\nprincipally at RAND under the leadership of your chairman, David\nNovick.\n\nMilitary cost analysis has not, however, remained independent of\n", "429\n"], "2": ["428 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nMilitary cost estimates are effected through application of the tech-\nniques of military cost analysis. Why the differentiation between esti-\nmates and analysis? Military cost analysis involves a thorough under-\nstanding of the structuring of systems analyses, the use of appropriate\ncost categories, discrimination between relevant and irrelevant cost\nelements, consideration of uncertainties, and application of cost sensi-\ntivity analyses.\n\nMore broadly, these are the elements of military cost analysis:\n\n1. Emphasis on total program cost, to include the entire stream of\ncost consequences over the life of the program. The costs usually relate\nto peacetime preparation for war rather than to the consumption of\nresources in wartime; but in certain cases, it is reasonable to include\ncosts of wartime consumption for a portion of the life of the system.\nIn general, such wartime costs are excluded for strategic systems but\nare sometimes introduced for limited war and sublimited war systems.\n\n2. Use of cost categories such as research and development, invest-\nment, and operating, which highlight the major phases in the life cycle.\n\n3. Consideration not only of total program cost but also of the tim-\ning of costs. Involved here is the discounting problem and the impor-\ntance in governmental programs of budgetary constraints by year.\n\n4. Exclusion of \"sunk\" costs as a consideration in decision making\nrelative to program choices.\n\n5. Costing in a program only of the net resource requirements (al-\nlowing thereby for inheritances of manpower or equipment or any\nother application of already available resources). A new weapon sys-\ntem can be costed through cost comparisons of two forces: one is the\nforce excluding the weapon system under study, and the other is the\nforce including the weapon system. For use in such comparisons and\nfor use in studies comparing alternative force mixes and deployments,\nforce cost models have been devised. Such models systematically de-\nvelop all categories of cost comprised in a force.\n\n6. Emphasis on costs of relative rather than absolute accuracy, in\nconsonance with the primary utilization of such costs in the compari-\nson of alternatives.\n\n7. Recognition of the uncertainties inherent in the specification and\ncosting of future force mixes and weapon systems, especially in areas\nof advanced technology. To attain the utmost in capability and to\navoid rapid obsolescence, many weapon system programs aim at\nachieving major improvements in key performance characteristics over\ntheir predecessors. Technical risks are taken for which there are few\nparallels in nondefense programs.

This\nexpression may be accomplished in several ways; one or another may\nbe more convenient in a particular problem.\n\nThe most common method is to specify a military task to be accom-\nplished, and then determine alternative forces, weapons, and manpow-\ner of equal capability required to accomplish the task.

On the other hand, if society does not put strong pres-\nsures upon bureaus to produce well-coordinated policies, they may\navoid territorial battles by simply paying no attention to each other\neven though their policies are mutually interdependent.\n\n8. The total amount of government services produced in a democra-\ncy tends to be both smaller in quantity and different in quality from\nwhat it would be if everyone were perfectly informed. However, this\ndoes not necessarily mean that the actual government budget is too\nsmall. That budget measures the amount of government inputs. It\nmight be more than enough to produce the required expansion in out-\nputs if people were perfectly informed, since government bureaus\nwould perform far more efficiently under such conditions.\n\n9. It is easier and less expensive to operate a bureau whose mem-\nbers have a high degree of goal-homogeneity than one whose members\nbave highly divergent goals. Therefore, bureaus use selective recruit-\nment, indoctrination, and ideologies to increase the degree of goal-ho-\nmogeneity among their members. They prefer selective recruitment\nand ideologies to indoctrination, since it is both risky and expensive to\nalter the deep-level goals of members. In fact, indoctrination is so\ndifficult that many bureaus avoid social functions requiring really\ndeep-level consensus among their members. Some such functions are\ntherefore never carried out by any bureaus (such as eliminating the\n\"crime syndicate\" from the U.S.).\n\n10. Top-level officials of bureaus consider personal loyalty to be an\nimportant attribute among their immediate subordinates. Such loyalty\nis important because every top-level official is required to perform acts\nwhich would be extremely embarrassing if made public. Hence he\nneeds subordinates whose discretion he can rely upon.\n\n11. Bureaus have predictable life-cycles, except that once estab-\nlished, they rarely (within a given historical era) die. They come into\nbeing through routinization of charisma, splitting off from an existing\nbureau, entrepreneurial development of a new idea by zealots initially\noutside any bureau, or creation ex nihilo by powerful social agents. As\nthey grow older, they learn to be more efficient, develop more and\nmore extensive rules and regulations, shift their goals from performing\ntheir functions well to maintaining their organizational structures, be-\ncome increasingly subject to inertia, and expand the scope of their\nfunctions.

The internal structure and behavior of every bureau is so closely\nrelated to its interactions with its external environment that neither\ncan be explained without taking account of the other. Hence much of\nmy analysis seeks to show what effects of certain types of social func-\ntions and external environments have upon bureaus! internal opera-\ntions, as well as how their internal operations affect their ability to\nperform their social functions (the usual approach to bureaucracy).\n\nThe Environment\n\nThe world in which the officials in my theory operate is as realistic\nas I can make it. In this respect, it differs sharply from the \"perfectly\ninformed\" world of traditional economic theory, and more closely re-\nsembles the environments assumed by most political and sociological\ntheorists. In particular, the following conditions prevail in this\nenvironment:\n\n1. Information is costly because it takes time, effort, and sometimes\nmoney to obtain data and comprehend their meaning.\n\n2. Decision-makers have only limited capabilities regarding the\namount of time they can spend making decisions, the number of issues\nthey can consider simultaneously, and the amount of data they can ab-\nsorb regarding any one problem.\n\n3. Although some uncertainty can be eliminated by acquiring infor-\nmation, an important degree of ineradicable uncertainty is usually in-\nvolved in making decisions.\n\nInsofar as the basic institutional setting of this theoretical world is\nconcerned, it can be either democratic, totalitarian, monarchical, tradi-\ntionalist, or have any other form in which bureaus are likely to be\nfound. As pointed out by Max Weber, bureaus probably require a\nmoney economy rather than a barter economy, but I place no other\nparticular constraints on the type of society to which the theory ap-\nplies.

Hypotheses\n\nThe theory is based upon the following major hypotheses:\n\n1. Officials (and all other agents in the theory) seek to attain their\ngoals rationally; that is, in the most efficient manner possible, given\ntheir limited capacities and the cost of information. This means that\nall agents in the theory are utility maximizers. In practical terms, this\nimplies that whenever the cost of attaining any given goal rises in\nterms of time, effort, or money, they seek to attain less of that goal,\nceteris paribus; whereas whenever the cost of attaining a goal falls,\nthey seek to attain more of it.\n\n2. Officials in general have a complex set of goals, including the fol-\nlowing elements: power, income, prestige, security, convenience, loyal-\nty (to an idea, an institution, or the nation), pride in excellent work\nand desire to serve the public interest (as the individual official con-\nceives of it). However, different types of officials focus on smaller sets\nof these goals. In particular:\n\nd) Purely self-interested officials are motivated entirely by goals\nwhich benefit themselves rather than their bureaus or society at large.\nThere are two types of such officials: (1) Climbers seek to maximize\ntheir own power, income, and prestige. This can be done either by win-\nning promotion to higher rank, increasing the status of their existing\npositions through aggrandizement, or \"jumping\" to new and better\njobs elsewhere. (2) Conservers seek to maximize their own security\nand convenience. Since \"security\" is defined as maintenance of one's\npresent level of power, income, and prestige, conservers favor the status\nquo. 'They fear change because it might reduce their present\nprerogatives; hence they oppose innovations and change in general.\n\nb) Mixed-motive officials have goals which combine self-interest and\naltruistic loyalty to larger values. The main difference between the\nthree types of mixed-motive officials is the breadth of the larger values\nto which they are loyal. Thus: (1) Zealots are loyal to relatively nar-\nrow policies or concepts, such as the development of military airplanes\nby Billy Mitchell. They seek power both for its own sake and so they\ncan effectuate the sacred policies to which they are loyal. (2) Advo-\ncates are loyal to a broader set of policies or to a broader organization\n(such as naval warfare or Harvard University). They are impartial in\njudging the merits of various proposals within the organization to\nwhich they are loyal but highly partisan in supporting that organiza-\ntion in conflicts with *outsiders.\" The breadth of advocacy can vary\nwidely, from a small section of a bureau (such as the economics de-\npartment of a university) to a very broad bureau (such as the entire\n", "NONMARKET DECISION MAKING\n", "441\n"], "2": ["440 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\ncan be expected to perform their organizational roles rather than upon\neither ascribed characteristics (such as religion, race, or social class)\nor periodic election by some outside constituency.\n\n4. The major portion of its output is not directly or indirectly\nevaluated in any markets external to the organization by means of vol-\nuntary quid pro quo transactions.\n\nEach of these characteristics contributes important elements to the\nparticular nature of bureaus. Large size means that bureaus must de-\nvelop relatively impersonal internal relations and are faced with sub-\nstantial administrative problems. Full-time employment means that\nbureau members are not dilettantes but are seriously committed to\ntheir jobs. It also implies that the bureau must compete for their ser-\nvices in the labor market. Personnel policies based upon role perform-\nance mean bureau members are dependent upon their superiors for\npromotion rather than upon some outside constituency. Such policies\nalso imply that bureau members are motivated to shape their behavior\nSo as to seek promotions because advancement is dependent upon their\nperformance, not upon innate characteristics like sex, religion, or so-\ncial caste. Nonmarket orientation means that bureaus are unable to\nuse the objective monetary measure of profitability to evaluate the\nspecific activities they undertake. It also means that even very large\nprofitmaking organizations (such as General Motors) are not bu-\nreaus, though parts of such organizations (such as the public relations\ndepartment of Chevrolet) can be bureaus if their specific outputs can-\nnot be evaluated in a market. Some more typical examples of bureaus\ncovered by the theory are the Roman Catholic Church (except for the\nPope, who is elected), the University of California, the Soviet central\nplanning agency, the U.S. State Department, the New York Port Au-\nthority, and the Chinese Communist army.\n\nBureaucrats are not simply people who work for bureaus. Rather, I\ndefine a bureaucrat as any person who works for a large organization;\nreceives a money income from that organization which constitutes a\nmajor part of his total income; is hired, promoted, and retained pri-\nmarily on the basis of his role performance; and produces outputs\nwhich cannot be evaluated on a market. This definition implies that a\nman can be a bureaucrat even if he works for a nonbureaucratic organ-\nization (such as Sears, Roebuck and Company) as long as his own out-\nput cannot be evaluated on a market (even though the value of his in-\nputs can be so evaluated). In my analysis, the term *bureaucrat\" is in\nno way derogatory, but because it is so universally regarded as an in-\nsult, I will use the more neutral term \"official\" to describe the type of\nperson defined above.\n"], "1": ["Definitions\n\nSince bureaus are a particular form of organization, the first step is\nto define an organization: An organization is a system of consciously\ncoordinated activities or forces of two or more persons which has been\nexplicitly created to achieve specific ends.\n\nAn organization is a bureau if and only if it possesses the following\nfour primary characteristics:\n\n1l.

In the very direct form\nof the official salary for the leader of the opposition in Britain, this\nprocedure has been rare, but in a more indirect way it is the common\nsystem. If quite a number of offices are put up for vote, it is fairly cer-\ntain, human nature being what it is, that one organized group will not\nget all of them. The occupants of the other offices will receive compen-\nsation! and will also be in positions where they can fairly easily make\ntheir counterproposals to the government's policies known to the vot-\ners.

Whether\nthis is a cheaper way of getting a given quality of entrepreneurial abil-\nity than offering higher rewards to those in power I cannot say, but it\ncertainly works.\n\nLooked at from this standpoint, the purpose of providing offices for\nthe opposition is to effectively lower the entry barrier by paying part\nof the organization costs of the potential entrant.

Many governmental services are natural\nmonopolies, and economists are naturally apt to think of them when\nwe discuss problems in this general area. Our monopoly, however, is\nthe government itself, not its constituent services. It is a monopoly\nsimply because we can have only one cabinet, governor, mayor, presi-\ndent, or majority in a legislature. The scale advantage which acts as a\nbarrier to entry is the majority voting rule* which provides that the\n\"entrepreneurial group\" which obtains half the customers can drive\nthe other entrepreneurial group or groups out of the market. This is\nthe basic reason we must depend upon potential competition rather\nthan upon real competition. This is also the reason why there may well\nbe only two competitors\u2014the present occupant and a potential re-\nplacement\u2014instead of many competing \"firms.\" The problem of pub-\nlic policy we are discussing in this essay is insuring that the entry bar-\nrier is low enough so that this potential competition is a real restriction\non the activities of the present occupant of the monopoly.\n\nThe problem is that there may not be any significant potential com-\npetition. This fact is not very obvious because we normally think of na-\ntional politics, and during our lifetime there has always been an active\nopposition party? If we turn to local politics, however, we will fre-\nquently observe a complete absence of organized opposition. Char-\nlottesville, for example, has normally only one serious set of candidates\nfor the city council. The job of city councilman, of course, is\nunsalaried; so the only attractions are the nonpecuniary rewards of\noffice. I suspect that the pecuniary and nonpecuniary pains of running\nfor office and being beaten are, in net, much greater than the nonpecu-\nniary gains of being a councilman. It is also quite hard for a potential\nopposition individual or slate to even get his name and platform before\nthe voters, let alone persuading them that it is sensible to vote for him\nor them.* Under the circumstances it is not surprising that there are\nfew opposition candidates.\n\nThe obvious way of insuring potential competition in an organized\nform would be to raise the rewards of office to a level where they\nwould be worth more than the organizational costs of an opposition\n\n* If another voting rule is actually used, then analogous problems arise.\n\n\"The United States has had one of the parties disintegrate, with a temporary cessa-\ntion of organized potential competition three times: the \"era of good feeling,\" the period\njust before the foundation of the Republican Party, and 1872 when the Democrats did\nnot nominate an independent presidential candidate.\n\n*It might be argued that the communities\u2014and there are many of them\u2014which are\ngoverned by such a system are not really democratic. The council is not really subject to\nany check unless it does something really awful. The councilmen's principle satisfaction\ncomes from \"doing their duty.\" If this theory is true, they would be compelled to give\ngood government, according to their own lights, in order to get the satisfaction for which\n\nthey hold the office. The system would really be aristocratic government with noblesse\noblige as the operative motive.\n"], "6": ["3]t is not, of course, necessarily impractical for small parts of the government.

Both expedients have\nsevere drawbacks. Since the disadvantages of a civil service system\nare, for some reason, normally not discussed, a few words on them\nmight be helpful. The higher management, being unable to discharge\nthe workers without some sort of elaborate procedure, will be less\neffective. If the civil service system amounts to permanent tenure, as it\ndoes in the United States, then the real control that the higher man-\nagement has over the lower is apt to be much less than optimum. It\nmay, of course, still be better than simply ignoring the problem. The\npurchase of goods for government use raises somewhat the same prob-\nlem, although simply requiring bidding may provide a suitable solu-\ntion.\n\nBut to return to the subject of entry barriers and the economics of\nmonopoly, the company now operating the cement plant would have\none advantage over any group of entrepreneurs contemplating bidding\nagainst them for the next period. They already have a management in\nexistence which has some \"going concern\" value of its own. The poten-\ntial competitors will have to establish such an organization simply for\nthe purpose of making their bid. Thus the potential competitor will\nneed to invest some resources into preparing for the competition which\nwill not be required of the present operators. Although the entry bar-\nrier has been lowered by the public ownership of the plant, it has not\nbeen reduced to zero. This means that the existing management\u2014and\nthe competitors, for that matter\u2014can afford to put their bid somewhat\nabove the *pure competition\" level because of this impediment to com-\npetition. Indeed, if the profits from managing the enterprise are small,\nwhich would be so either if the bid system worked very well or if pay-\nment was by a relatively small fixed fee and side-payments were prohib-\nited, then even a very low entry barrier might be sufficient to keep\nthe effective level of potential competition low. In most modern democ-\nracies the legally available rewards of office are fairly low, considering\nthe size of the enterprise. This prevents large monopoly profits but\nalso eliminates the normal incentives for efficiency. Under these cir-\ncumstances competition is needed, not to prevent exploitation, but to\nkeep the management on its toes. Thus we might find these entry bar-\nriers still too high and look for an expedient to lower them still further.\n\nPerhaps, however, it might be wise to remind ourselves of the exact\n"], "5": ["462 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nRepublicans or the Democrats will serve them best is less accurate\nthan their judgment on the same question about a car they are think-\ning of buying.\n\nThe problems of aggregating preferences simply complicate the situ-\nation further. They make the judgment of the consumers even less\nskillful. The fact that this judgment is a relatively poor one raises\nsome special problems. It is sensible for the entrepreneurs who are bid-\nding for the use of the plant to take the relatively uninformed state of\nthe people who will judge the bids into account. Deception and distor-\ntion will be easier under these circumstances than in the marketplace.\nAs one example, let us consider the so-called \"going concern\" value of\nthe plant. If a new group takes over the plant, it will normally be more\nefficient for them to retain most of the labor force and lower manage-\nment rather than hire and train new personnel. If the bids were sub-\nmitted to highly qualified personnel for judgment, no doubt they would\nbe able to require performance which could only be reached by highly\neffcient operations, and hence the workers and lower management\nwould be taken over by the new group of entrepreneurs. If, however,\nthe people making the judgment as to which bid was best were not\nhighly qualified\u2014and the voters certainly are not\u2014then various rather\ninefficient provisions might be inserted into the bid. The successful en-\ntrepreneurs might, for example, specify that they would work for a fixed\nfee instead of for a residual.\n\nThis procedure might seem silly, but it is a fact that most elected\nofficials do work for fixed fees. This may be simply due to the difficulty\nof computing anything comparable to a profit on the government's op-\nerations, but it may also be because the voters somehow feel that this\nis a better system. In many types of government contracts where profit\nas a residual would seem the obvious choice a fixed fee or contract\nrenegotiation has in fact been adopted, apparently to please the voters.\nBut regardless of the reasons for it, this fixed fee system together with\na system of judging bids which is not highly skilled gives the political\nentrepreneur a motive for behavior which, on the surface, would ap-\npear to be simply inefficient. Putting people on the payroll not in terms\nof their contribution to the enterprise but in terms of their contribu-\ntion to the entrepreneur would be a quite sensible way of capturing\nprofits not available under the fixed fee system.\n\nThe obvious answer to this problem is simply improving the stan-\ndards by which the bids are judged. If the various entrepreneurs must\nsubmit their bids to the scrutiny of real experts (although whether ex-\nperts are actually ever this good is questionable), they would have to\nplan on the most efficient methods of management in order to beat out\ntheir competitors.

Another procedure\nwould be to have the bid include not only the price at which the ce-\nment was to be sold but also statements about maintenance, introduc-\ntion of improvements, etc. The entrepreneurial group who would be\npermitted to operate the plant would be selected on the basis of a judg-\nment as to which of these rather involved bids was, in all-around\nterms, the best. Naturally this complicated type of \"bidding\" raises\ndifficult problems of judgment, but in the governmental case it is hard\nto see any alternative which is superior. This is, in fact, the type of\ncomplex judgment which we normally make in market transactions. In\nbuying a car I cannot simply choose the cheapest; I must balance one\npackage of attributes including a price against another. The choice of\nthe best bidder\" would be similar. The principle difference would be\nthe unenforceable nature of the promises made by the political *entre-\npreneurs.\"\n\nPutting the whole transaction in strictly economic terms, we have an\nindustry with an extremely high entry barrier. Public provision of the\ncapital plant artificially reduces that barrier. With the new lower bar-\nrier, competition and potential competition will enter much more\nstrongly into the calculations of the present management than it would\nwithout this reduction. The small island community could depend upon\nthe cost of its cement being considerably lower than under laissez\nfaire. The problems that would arise would be, essentially, problems of\nconsumer judgment for a complex product and problems of aggregat-\ning preferences. The situation would be one of monopoly only insofar\nas there was a remaining entry barrier even when the plant was pro-\nvided. Ignoring the latter class of problems for the moment, decisions\nas to which of the \"bids\" was best would be similar to ordinary con-\nsumer choice in principle, but more complex in practice. A genuine\ntechnical judgment on the desirability of the replacement of some\ngiven machine in this period or the next would be necessary in some\ncases. Whether replacement of present equipment by new would be\nworthwhile would unfortunately be a decision that the *consumer\"\nwould have to make. In the recent campaign the desirability of certain\ncapital investments for our military machine was an issue. Further,\nthese decisions have to be made prospectively, not retrospectively. If\nI am considering buying a Chrysler with a turbine engine, I can at\nleast look at and try an existing car just like the one I would buy. This\nwould not be so with our cement plant if new equipment were pro-\nposed. Thus we could and should anticipate less successful judgment\nof the bids than we find in more normal market situations.

Sup-\npose we have an industry, say cement manufacturing, in a small, iso-\nlated country in which economies of scale are strong enough so that a\ncompany having more than half of the market could operate on a lower\ncost level than any smaller competitor. Further, to make our analogy\ncomplete, assume that the cost advantage would continue up to full\nmarket control by one company. If the industry is a vital one where we\nfear the results of simply leaving it alone, if regulation is ruled out,\nand if public control is impossible, what can we do?\n\nThe problem, of course, is simply an extreme entry barrier. Presum-\nably a competitor could come in and drive the present occupant of\nthe market into bankruptcy by violent competition, but it would be an\nexpensive and risky thing to do. The competitor would have to build a\nnew plant and invest a good deal of funds in the staying alive through\nthe cutthroat competition phase, and he would have no assurance of\nwinning out, let alone making enough from the ensuing monopoly to\npay him back for his expenditure.

In its simplest form this auction could require\nas a bid simply the price which the entrepreneurial company would\ncharge for cement during the coming year.

This is one area where we all favor unres-\ntrained consumer sovereignty.

The subject of this paper came to me while I was engaged in\njust this exercise (which may or may not be regarded as a recom-\nmendation). One of the conspicious differences is that the department\nstore will normally own its own plant, while the political party does\nnot. The political party may, of course, own some office furniture, but\nthis is only a tiny part of the capital that it will use to serve its cus-\ntomers if it is successful in the competitive struggle. This difference\nbetween the political party and the department store is such an ob-\nvious one that, like the purloined letter, it is almost invisible. We are\nalso so accustomed to it, that a question as to why it should exist may\nseem eccentric, but, as I hope to demonstrate, it has an economically\ninteresting answer. This is one field where an essentially political prob-\nlem can be treated entirely as an economic problem, specifically as an\nexample of the problem of controlling natural monopolies. Looked at\nin this way, we will see that there is a method of controlling natural\nmonopolies which has not been much discussed by economists but\nwhich has been in use by practical men for many years.\n\nThree techniques are normally suggested for dealing with natural\nmonopolies: we can leave them alone, letting their managers do as they\nwish, we can subject them to regulation, or they can be publicly owned\nand operated.

Leaving the monopoly alone,\nwhich if we are talking about government means a despotic state, is\nnot at all impossible. In fact, this has been by far the commonest way\nof handling the problem if we consider the whole of man's history.

Then, by assigning *optimal\" values to\nthose variables (e.g., hospital room rates and lack of insurance cover-\nage) that are indicators of economic disincentive to use hospital facili-\nties, he computes from his demand function and need criterion the\neffective demand for beds that would arise if all states had such low\nhospital charges and extensive insurance coverage as the most fortu-\nnate among them.*\n\nAlthough Rosenthal's work represents an important advance over\n\n!

How-\never, it is widely believed that for many types of diagnoses teaching\nhospitals furnish better care than others; i.e., the higher costs may be\njustified by the superior treatment.\n\nBut who bears the burden of the differential costs of the teaching\nhospitals, under present hospital insurance plans? Essentially the sub-\nScribers who go to \"inferior\" hospitals but pay the same insurance\nrates as others. Moreover, the teaching hospitals disproportionately\nbenefit from the services of interns and residents whose wages are far\n\n? For example, see H. E.

However, P. J. Feldstein, op. cit., Ap-\npendix B, especially pp. 62-64, found in a sample of sixty hospitals of varying sizes that\naverage costs fall with size (and marginal costs are constant) without correcting for size\ncorrelated variations in output mix. Since such variations almost surely raise the marginal\ncost of large hospitals relative to small ones, Feldstein concludes (p. 64) that marginal\n\ncosts would fall with size, product quality\" constant.\n\nZ]t is often alleged that hospitals practice price discrimination, \"undercharging\" for\nroom and board and overcharging for use of complicated medical equipment. (For ex-\nample, McNerney e\u00a3 al., of. cit., pp. 921-24.) However, the allegation will not be proved\nuntil marginal as well as average costs are compared with prices of various services; ie.,\njit is not clear that the relatively high priced services are not also those for which relative\n\ndemand is strongest so that relatively high prices may parallel relatively high ratios of\nmarginal to average costs.\n"], "6": ["Efficiency and Cost Differentials\n\nIn the profit-seeking sector, economy of resource utilization is\nachieved through the elimination of high cost producers by those more\nefficient. Among hospitals this competitive process operates under very\nsevere restraints, if at all. Hospitals cannot be selected on the basis of\ncost by either patient or doctor; a patient must be hospitalized where\nhis doctor is affiliated. While the elasticity of derived demand may\nhave some effect in leading doctors to affiliate with the optimal hospital\n(from the viewpoint of their prospective patients), I doubt that it\nwould be seriously contended that this possibility has had much effect\nupon hospital costs. As a first approximation, I venture the guess that\ndemand for beds in a given hospital is independent of their prices rela-\ntive to those of other hospitals in the same area.\"\n\nSince a large part of the nation's hospital bill is paid through Blue\nCross and other insurers,^ the reimbursement schedules of these\nagencies have considerable impact upon what hospitals can charge\n(and collect) and indirectly upon costs. Therefore these insurers\ncould, conceivably, bring pressure upon hospitals to lower costs; e.g.,\nreimburse hospitals upon a standard cost rather than an actual cost\n\n3 On the question of \"peak-load\" pricing, see P. J. Feldstein, *An Investigation of the\nMarginal Costs of Hospital Services,\" Graduate Program in Hospital Administration, Uni-\nversity of Chicago, Chicago, Ill, 1961, pp. 65-74.

Striking this balance is complicated by the fact that demand is\nnot entirely random but has some price elasticity.\n\nBecause of this price elasticity, some allocative improvements might\nbe achieved by charging higher prices in peak-load periods (e.g., mid-\nweek) than in others or charging lower prices for persons who will\n(and can) \"stand-by\" until space is available. This, in turn, would\naffect hospital insurance rates, etc., and possibly doctors fees as well.\nHowever, the incentive effect upon hospitals of being able to charge\nhigher rates for peak-load periods would be to encourage the creation\nof \"swing\" or convertible facilities which would increase the ease of\nshifting space and related facilities from one use to another, and there-\nby diminish the probability of bottlenecks.'\n"], "5": ["476 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nhospitalization are prepaid and also where the fee of the physician is\npaid by an insurer only if the patient is hospitalized.'?\n\nThe party with the incentive to economize the use of hospital re-\nSources is the insurer who bears the burden of overuse. And insurers\nare extremely alert to the dangers of overuse. On the question of rates,\nthey negotiate quite aggressively with hospitals (see below), but polic-\ning overuse raises some very delicate issues concerning physician auton-\nomy. As matters stand, the judgment of a qualified physician in de-\nciding to hospitalize a patient is subject to question only by his peers\nwithin the hospital who are extremely reluctant to second-guess one\nanother's diagnoses or procedures. Consequently, hospital administra-\ntors cannot bring pressure to bear upon admission policy and, accord-\ningly, third party insurers are unable to press administrators to curb\noveruse, except in flagrant cases.\n\nAchieving optimal use of hospitals is greatly complicated by the pos-\nsibilities of substitution among inputs and outputs. For example, medi-\ncally optimal results might be achieved with less use of hospital facili-\nties if outpatient care were more highly developed, if diagnostic work-\nups could be performed at the clinic or office rather than in the hospi-\ntal, if nursing homes were more adequate, and if patients! families\nwere more knowledgeable, than otherwise. Modes of treatment that\neconomize on hospital care are usually less expensive than alternatives,\nbut are not extensively developed in many places.* Moreover, they\nplace more responsibility on the patient and his family than would be\ninvolved if more intensive use were made of hospital facilities, imply-\ning greater medical risks. ^ Medical optimality probably implies\navoiding the risks and letting the pecuniary costs fall where they may,\nand it is difficult for the layman\u2014\u2014or other physicians\u2014to tell a given\ndoctor how to value life expectancy in pecuniary terms.\n\nYet another problem of achieving optimal use arises from the fact\nthat the demand for hospital facilities is, in part, a random variable.\nTherefore the stock of facilities must serve as an inventory, implying\nthat on some occasions there will be idle facilities and on others, queues.\n(The optimum stock must balance the marginal expected social loss\n\n?

Deciding on what constitutes over and/or under, as\ndistinguished from appropriate, utilization is a difficult matter requir-\ning medical decisions as to the boundaries between appropriate and in-\nappropriate use. Despite the difficulties, a number of studies have been\nmade whose general conclusion is that from 10 to 20 percent of the\nhospital patients on a given day did not need to be there for medical\nreasons.*\n\nThe relevant percentages varied from one study to another for a va-\nriety of reasons. In addition to the possibility of medical incompetence\nand patient chiseling, there is the important element of difference in\nphysician-view as to proper length of stay; this appears to vary con-\nsiderably from one region of the country to another, as well as between\ncountries, for a given diagnosis. There is also reported a tendency for\nhospitals with empty beds to pressure their staf\u00eds to get them more busi-\nness. Another cause of overuse is the tendency for partial shutdown\nof laboratory and surgical facilities over the weekend so that persons\nentering on Friday sometimes are hospitalized for two unnecessary\ndays. Conversely, patients are occasionally retained until the week-\nend so that there will be someone to care for them when they get home.\nHowever, there is evidence of underuse, also. In the Michigan study of\nhospital use it was found that while 9.6 percent of the discharges\nstudied were adjudged to represent overstays, 6.8 percent represented\nunderstays.\"*\n\nOne of the important reasons for the overuse of facilities is the ab-\nsence of financial incentive to avoid it.

The main reason for this is the in-\nterrelation of demand and supply for beds in given communities. It is\nfrequently stated, with considerable supporting evidence, that when\navailable hospital beds increase, ceteris paribus, doctors tend both to\nhospitalize patients more readily and also to keep them in for longer\nperiods.* In its extreme form, this argument amounts to a Say's Law for\nhospital beds; i.e., supply creates its own demand. Rosenthal success-\nfully refutes this version of the argument by showing that when the\nvariables reflecting demand are held constant, a pressure index (on\nhospital facilities) varies inversely with supply (as indicated by beds\nper 1,000 population).* That is, ceteris paribus, an increase in supply\ndoes not create such an increase in demand as to leave the *pressure\nindex\" unchanged. However, this does not cast doubt on the proposi-\ntion that an exogenous increase in supply would lead to some increase\nin demand for beds;* therefore, we do not have a way of deriving the\n\"medical need\" for hospital facilities from observations on their use.\n\nThe ambiguity of \"need for hospital facilities\" stems from the inter-\nrelation of demand for hospital facilities and other goods. Under cer-\ntain circumstances, doctors will prescribe hospital care more readily\nfor poor patients than for rich. One important reason for this is that\nmedical considerations require a higher rate of real per capita con-\nsumption by the sick than society is prepared to guarantee to the eco-\nnomically inept when well. To increase the rate of transfer payments\nto the sick poor, it is frequently necessary to hospitalize them. The ex-\ntent to which doctors can indulge this proclivity to stimulate income\ntransfers is the greater, the greater the availability of beds for non-\nacute conditions; hence the intercorrelation of demand and supply of\nbeds.\n"], "2": ["ECONOMIC THEORY AND NONPROFIT ENTERPRISE 473\n\nlate it to investment in hospital facilities, that task would be far sim-\npler than the one required by the question under discussion (to deter-\nmine the socially optimal stock of hospitals). This is because it is gen-\nerally agreed in the literature that the pattern of utilization of hospital\nfacilities reflects a wide variety of influences other than those normally\nsubsumed under the term \"medical necessity.\" It seems quite clear\nthat whether a person is hospitalized depends upon his economic situa-\ntion, the type of care he can obtain outside the hospital, and the\navailability of a hospital bed, as well as upon the diagnosis. This is not\nnecessarily a bad state of affairs; it reflects the desire of many doctors\nto consider the welfare of the ^whole patient\" and not merely his med-\nical needs\u2014if indeed the two can be effectively separated. But it does\ncreate serious actuarial problems for purveyors of hospital insurance\nand definitional ones for planners seeking a measure of the need for\nhospital facilities.\n\nAs so often happens in matters of serious practical import, lack of a\ndefinition has not precluded measurement. A number of estimates of\nneed for hospital facilities has been made; the most commonly sug-\ngested target for supply of general beds relative to the general popula-\ntion is 4.5 to 5.0 general beds per thousand population. A more sophis-\nticated approach to the problem of measuring bed needs is taken by\nRosenthal who has estimated a demand function for beds from cross-\nsectional regressions of (several aspects of) bed usage among states\nupon corresponding state levels of hospital room rates, hospital insur-\nance coverage, income, age composition, sex composition, education,\npercentage of single persons, etc.\" From this demand function and a\nneed criterion (ie., bed supply is adequate only if the probability of\nall beds being filled on a given day\u2014and presumably of some patients\nbeing forced to queue\u2014does not exceed .01) he deduces an estimate of\nbed demand for each state. Then, by assigning *optimal\" values to\nthose variables (e.g., hospital room rates and lack of insurance cover-\nage) that are indicators of economic disincentive to use hospital facili-\nties, he computes from his demand function and need criterion the\neffective demand for beds that would arise if all states had such low\nhospital charges and extensive insurance coverage as the most fortu-\nnate among them.*\n\nAlthough Rosenthal's work represents an important advance over\n\n!

The movement of such colleges as Wesleyan, Dartmouth, Law-\nrence, and Reed towards full university status may indicate a new\ntrend.\n\nThe evidence of the pressure for vertical integration is that no major\ngraduate school today is without an undergraduate base with the single\nexception of the Rockefeller Institute (which is removed from finan-\ncial constraints with an endowment equal to approximately $1 million\nper student).

Because\nuniversities rely on the largesse of philanthropy or state legislatures\nfor capital needs, not only accounting provisions for replacement needs\nbut the whole concept of depreciation and obsolescence tend to be ab-\nsent. One ironic result is that despite fifteen years of persuasive argu-\nment the universities have never been able to convince the Congress\nthat 20 percent overhead on grants and contracts is not pure profit,\nwhile an identical project with a business firm would safely allow 30\npercent to 50 percent. The Office of Education has collected education-\nal statistics for a century but cannot even provide information on the\nnumber of full-time-student equivalents in higher education today,\nmuch less the kind of cost data which would be of primary use to econ-\nomists. Despite the rapid and continuing expansion of college enroll-\nments, no one has done a real study of incremental costs, comparing,\nsay, expansion of existing institutions versus the founding of new ones.\nOne other example suggests the shocking state of the arts in analyzing\nthe market for academic personnel. Most everyone has been making\ndire predictions about the shortage of faculty trained at the doctorate\nlevel. The N.E.A. studies since 1953 have indicated a sharp reduction\nin the percentage of new faculty with the Ph.D., and the Office of Edu-\ncation, the Fund for the Advancement of Education, the graduate\ndeans, and some of the President's most important advisory groups\nhave estimated the large cumulative deficits in the production of\nPh.D/'s.

In the light of devel-\nopments of the last several years, one qualification should be added:\nwe are at last developing a macroeconomic view of education,? but we\nhave not even begun to develop a counterpart view of education analo-\ngous to the theory of the firm.\n\nBefore examining what it is that an economist might say about his\nown institution, let me suggest why so little has been done in the past.\nFirst, as academicians I think we have always felt that the university\nwas misunderstood and undervalued by the world at large, and conse-\nquently that an uninformed public was safer than an informed one. We\nhave carried this distrust of knowledge and distaste for public debate\nso far that we are content to be uninformed about our own institutions.\nSome professors even today believe that A.A.U.P. Committee Z has\nbeen too zealous (a few presidents think that is what the *Z\" stands\nfor) and has somehow committed a breach of good manners by dis-\ncussing mundane salary matters in public.\n\nSecond, I believe many of us\u2014perhaps less so economists than phi-\nlosophers or classicists\u2014fear that to study the university as an eco-\nnomic institution may ultimately result in the wholesale application of\nbusiness procedures and principles to education. In an age of mass\neducation and the burgeoning *multi-versity\" there is a real danger of\ndeveloping inflexible bureaucratic rules and formulae; and the scholar\nhas some justification in holding to *a little rationality is a dangerous\nthing\" philosophy.\n\nThird, most university administrators in the seventy-five years end-\ning with the recent war\u2014and many even today\u2014feel that matters of\nuniversity finance, salaries, and even teaching loads are none of the fac-\nulty's business. This play-your-cards-close-to-your-chest attitude may\narise for one of two reasons: because the president views himself in the\nrole of employer and the faculty as employees, or because the presi-\ndent sees himself in the role of mediator, and to reveal too much to the\nfaculty will commit him to a similar clean breast with the board of\ncontrol. The latter view is certainly preferable to the former, although\nneither fosters informative research on the institution. It should be\nadded, however, that the president may in effect be right (even if for\nthe wrong reason), for too much information can fan the rivalries and\n\n*[ refer here to the seminal work of Schultz, Harris, and Machlup among the more\nsenior members of the profession, and of Becker, Bowen, and Weisbrod among the younger\nmembers.\n"], "1": ["481\n", "There are few other commodities more eagerly sought, more haphaz-\nardly selected, more irrationally priced, more undervalued in the act of\nconsuming it, more misleadingly represented by some producers, and\nmore enjoyed by the labor force engaged in its production, than higher\neducation.

We refer to wages\npaid performers. In the simple model sketched above, we postulated a\nsituation in which a single, market-clearing wage was paid to all per-\nsons regardless of the industry in which they were employed. In actual\nfact, the live performing arts constitute a rather special labor mar-\nket\u2014a market in which the need for great native ability and extensive\ntraining limits the supply, but in which the psychic returns to those\nwho meet these tests often offers a very substantial inducement to re-\nmain in the field. For these reasons, the performing arts are relatively\ninsensitive to general wage trends, especially in the short run. It is\nlargely for this reason that performing arts organizations in financial\ndifficulty have often managed to shift part of their financial burden\nback to the performers\u2014and to the managements, who also are gener-\nally very poorly paid by commercial standards. The level of the in-\ncomes in this general field must be considered remarkably low by any\nstandards, and particularly so in light of the heavy investment that has\noften been made by the artists in their education, training, and equip-\nment. And it is surely explained at least in part by the willingness of\nthose who work in these fields to sacrifice money income for the less\nmaterial pleasures of their participation in the arts.\n\nHowever, there are limits to the financial sacrifices society can ex-\ntract from the performers in exchange for psychic returns. One may\nreasonably expect that rising incomes in other sectors will ultimately\nproduce untoward e\u00edfects on the supply of talent. At what point this\nwill occur depends partly on the income elasticity of the demand for\npsychic income. As the general level of real income rises, it may well\nbe possible to persuade performers to accept a lower relative position\nin the income hierarchy. However, there are symptoms which suggest\nthat, in some specialized areas, effects involving both quantity and\nquality are already being felt, though, overall, excess supply continues\nto be one of the market's most notable characteristics.\n\nIn sum, the cost structure of the performing arts organizations\npromises them no easier future. One might anticipate, therefore, that\nthis structural problem would produce discernible e\u00ediects on pricing\npolicy. Certainly, in most of the industries in which productivity is sta-\nble, we would expect the price of the product or service to rise relative\nto the general price level. And there is a widespread impression that\nthe arts have indeed behaved in accord with this anticipation\u2014that\nticket prices have been soaring. Yet our preliminary evidence suggests\n"], "6": ["500 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nhour increases more rapidly than the money wage rate and labor costs\nper unit must therefore decline. However, in the sector where produc-\ntivity is stable, there is no offsetting improvement in output per man-\nhour, and so every increase in money wages is translated automatically\ninto an equivalent increase in unit labor costs\u20142 percent per annum in\nour example. It should be noted that the extent of the increase in costs\nin the stable productivity sector varies directly with the economy-wide\nrate of increase in output per man-hour. The faster the general pace of\ntechnological advance, the greater will be the increase in the overall\nwage level and the greater the upward pressure on costs in those indus-\ntries which do not enjoy increased productivity. Faster technological\nprogress is no blessing for the laggards, at least as far as their costs are\nconcerned.\n\nIt is apparent that the live performing arts belong to the stable pro-\nductivity sector of our economy. The legitimate theater, the symphony\norchestra, the chamber group, the opera, the dance\u2014all can serve as\ntextbook illustrations of activities offering little opportunity for major\ntechnological change. The output per man-hour of the violinist playing\na Schubert quartet in a standard concert hall is relatively fixed, and it\nis fairly difficult to reduce the number of actors necessary for a per-\nformance of Henry IV, Part II.\n\nMoreover, from the standpoint of long-term developments, the es-\nsence of the matter is not absolute or relative levels of productivity at\na given date but the rates of change in productivity over time. This\nmeans that even if the arts could somehow manage to effect technologi-\ncal economies, they would not solve their long-term cost problem if\nsuch savings were once-and-for-all in nature. In order to join the ranks\nof the rising productivity industries, the arts would somehow have to\nlearn not only to increase output per man-hour but to continue to do so\ninto the indefinite future. Otherwise, they must at some juncture fall\nbehind the technologically progressive industries and experience in-\ncreases in costs which stem not from their own decisions but from the\ninexorable march of technological change in other parts of the econ-\nomy.\n\nTrue, some inefficiencies of operation are to be found in the field,\nand their elimination can help matters somewhat. Moreover, perform-\ning arts organizations can reduce the rate of increase in their unit costs\nby permitting some deterioration in the quality of their product\u2014by\nfewer rehearsals, the use of more poorly trained performers, shoddy\ncostumes and scenery. But such a course is never popular with organi-\nzations dedicated to quality, and, furthermore, it may lead to loss of\naudience and community support. Nevertheless, it is not an uncommon\n"], "5": ["ECONOMIC THEORY AND NONPROFIT ENTERPRISE 499\n\nobjectives, and, incidentally, it might even produce a loss in private\nand community support.\n\nIII. The Performing Arts in Particular\n\nIt is apparent that all of the standard problems of nonprofit organi-\nzations which have just been discussed beset the performing arts. It is\nnot surprising, therefore, that the survival of the great majority of its\norganizations requires a constant flow of contributions. We can then\neasily understand why the arts find themselves in their present unhap-\npy financial circumstances. But, up to this point, our discussion has\noffered no portents for the future. Here we don the inherited mantle of\nthe dismal scientist and argue that one can read the prospects of the\narts tomorrow in the economic structure which characterizes them\ntoday. The evidence will suggest that the prospects offer no grounds\nfor complacency\u2014that there are fundamental reasons to expect the\nfinancial strains which beset the performing arts organizations to in-\ncrease, chronically, with the passage of time.\n\nTo understand the prospective developments on the cost side, it is\nnecessary to digress briefly and consider in general terms the implica-\ntions of differential rates of growth in productivity within the economy\nfor the relative costs of its various outputs.' Let us think of an econo-\nmy divided into two sectors: one in which productivity is rising and\nanother where productivity is stable. As an illustration, let us suppose\nthat where technological improvements are possible they lead to an in-\ncrease in output per man-hour of 4 percent per annum, but that output\nper man-hour remains absolutely constant in the stable productivity\nsector. If these sectors are assigned equal weights in the construction\nof an economy-wide productivity index, the aggregate rate of increase\nin output per man-hour will be 2 percent per annum. For the moment\nlet us assume that there is only one grade of labor, that labor is free to\nmove back and forth between sectors, and that the real wage rate rises\npari passu with the aggregate rate of change of productivity, at 2 per-\ncent per annum. Finally, let us suppose that the money supply and the\nlevel of aggregate demand are controlled in such a way that the price\nlevel is kept stable. Assuming that there are no changes in the shares\nof capital and labor, this means that money wages will also increase at\nthe rate of 2 percent a year.\n\nThe implications of this simple model for costs in the two sectors\nare straightforward. In the rising productivity sector, output per man-\n\n\"There is, of course, nothing new in the following observations on the effects of dif-\nferential rates of productivity change on costs and prices.

Although workers\nhave been responding to the changes in the market for skills, the econ-\nomy in this respect has been in substantial disequilibrium at many\npoints. The reasons why this is so are fairly obvious; namely, unem-\nployment, the adverse incidences of economic growth on some sectors,\ninadequate information, and a lack of opportunity to invest in acquir-\ning the more valuable skills because of discrimination and the re-\nstraints on the capital market in providing funds for this purpose. Let\nme call attention to three of these disequilibria.\n\n1. The market for the skills that are required in agriculture has\nbeen long depressed. Although the labor force devoted to farming has\ndeclined by one-half since 1940, the market for these skills is still in\nserious disequilibrium. Older members of this labor force have had no\nreal alternative but to settle for the depressed, salvage value of the\nskills they possess. In many farm areas the quality of elementary and\nsecondary schooling has been and continues to be far below par^? and\nthus the oncoming generation from these areas is ill-prepared to take\nadvantage of the strong market in other parts of the economy for high\nskills. It should also be said that the vast expenditures by the federal\ngovernment on behalf of agriculture have not been used to raise the\nlevel of these skills; on the contrary, they have been used in ways that\nenhance the income from some classes of property and that worsen the\npersonal distribution of income among farm families. Thus it should\nnot come as a surprise that although farm families are presently a very\nsmall faction of all U.S. families, they account for much of the ob-\nserved poverty?' and that many of the families in urban areas who are\nbelow the poverty line have recently come from our farms.\n\n2.: The market for the skills of Negroes has also been long depressed\nand the poverty component here is large.

Wealth holdings are\nlarge relative to measured income. My estimate of average net asset position of farmers\nwho are actually farming (3.48 million in 1963) was approximately $35,800 per farmer in\n1963 (from my \"Our Welfare State and the Welfare of Farm People,\" Soc.

True, the relative decline in income from ma-\nterial wealth would undoubtedly have been somewhat less during the\nrecent past had the tax on corporate income remained at the prewar\nlevel. Meanwhile, what has been happening to the personal distribution\nof wealth holdings? It is hard to believe that poor people have been\nacquiring a substantially large share of this wealth and that it is the\nsource of the income that has brought about the observed decline in\npoverty. The stock of wealth represented by houses may be an excep-\ntion, in the sense that it has been an attractive investment for many\nlow-income families while the economy has been adjusting to the fa-\nvorable tax treatment that home ownership has been receiving.

Meanwhile, labor's functional share of national\nincome has been rising. The demand for workers with high skills has\nbeen increasing at a higher rate than that for low skills. Thus the in-\ncentive to increase skills has been strong and the supply of skills has\nbeen responding; for people have been investing much more than\nformerly to increase their skills. But why has the demand for skills\nbeen shifting upward in this manner? In my judgment it has come\nabout mainly as a consequence of the dynamic process in which skills\nalong with new useful knowledge gradually have been increasing na-\ntional income, and at the same time the resulting rise in per capita in-\ncome of consumers has altered the mix of products and services de-\nmanded in such a way that the products and services requiring high\nskills have increased at a higher rate than that of those requiring low\nskills. Another factor of some importance in this process has undoubt-\nedly been the increase in the demand for producer durables and ser-\nvices by the military establishment, which also has been increasing the\ndemand for high skills.\n"], "8": ["THE ECONOMICS OF POVERTY 517\n\npoor people have much at stake in government policy that will main-\ntain full employment.\n\n2.

The adjustment process in which\nthe demand and supply interact is the core of the economic behavior\nunderlying the formulation of the second hypothesis here advanced.\nThe major \"independent\" factors affecting the supply are as follows:\nresearch and development activities and dissemination of the resulting\nuseful knowledge from these activities, the mobility (immobility) of\nparticular sources, predominantly labor, in leaving declining industries\nand occupations, the amount and distribution of public investment in\nSchooling, and, closely related, the discrimination against Negroes,\nrural farm children, and others with respect to schooling.\n\nThus, the analytical task at hand might be to account for the ob-\nserved decline in poverty, or alternatively to account for the poverty\nthat remains.

My attempt to test the second, admittedly a very rough\napproximation of the increases in the latter two of these stocks, indi-\ncates for the period between 1929 and 1957 that the stock of reproduc-\nible tangible wealth increased at an annual rate of about 2 percent\nwhile that of education in the labor force rose at a rate of 4 percent,\nand that of on-the-job training of males in the labor force at over 5\npercent. The marked increase in the proportion of the labor force\nthat has attended high school and college is one of the developments in\nsupport of the third hypothesis.'*\n\nBut this is not the occasion to enter upon a survey of the studies\nthat provide estimates to test these hypotheses. Instead, I want to ex-\nplore the developments that have been altering the underlying supply\nand demand of the major sources of these income streams.\n\nDuring a normal business cycle the supply does not change substan-\ntially. The demand, however, shifts back and forth considerably dur-\ning recessions and booms, and as a consequence the income from cor-\nporate and from some other forms of property fluctuates more over the\ncycle than national income. The fluctuations in income from wages and\nsalaries are largest for unskilled labor, for workers who are least\nspecific in their training in terms of the labor requirement of employ-\ners, and for workers who have the least seniority, with the result that\nthe inequality of the personal distribution of income decreases in years\nof prosperity and increases in years of depression.'\n\nOver the long run, both the demand and supply are subject to shifts\nsome of which are accumulative and become large over time. Among\nthe factors that shift the demand for the sources of income streams in\nthis context, three are of major importance:\n\n1. The aggregate demand for goods and service. Theory here is bet-\nter than the art of fiscal-monetary policy. The aggregate demand was\nobviously far from sufficient during the massive unemployment of the\nearly 1930's. It was more nearly enough during the high employment\nof the mid-fifties. Since then there has been much slack. Idle plants\nand idle men reduce the demand for the sources of income.

As a\nfirst step, I shall present the following hypotheses.\n\nII. Three Hypotheses\n\nMy purpose here is to classify and organize the different sources of\nincome streams and then to show how they are related to the observed\nchanges in poverty. I propose to use the concepts of supply and de-\nmand to determine the changes in the prices of the different sources of\nthese income streams. Income streams can be given quantitative di-\nmensions per unit of time; i.e., a one-dollar-per-year income stream.\nExcept for income transfers, to obtain possession of an income stream\nit is necessary to acquire the source of that stream. These sources are\nvaluable, and each income stream in this sense has a price. The price\nmay be low or high. If a source of a one-dollar-per-year income stream\ncan be acquired for $10, it presumably would be cheap; if it cost $25,\nit would be dear. Thus what we should do is to identify the different\nsources and then proceed to ascertain the price at which each of the\nrespective sources can be acquired. The central economic problem then\nbecomes one of explaining what determines the price of these income\nstreams. In this approach, then, it is meaningful to apply the concepts\nof supply and demand.\n\nThe underlying assumptions, which are quite conventional, are as\nfollows: the sources of income streams are acquired at particular\nprices; these prices change over time, and people respond to changes in\nthese prices subject to the restraints of the capital market, their pref-\nerences and capacity to save, the effects of taxes and subsidies, and of\ndiscrimination with respect to employment and investment. We can\nthen postulate a dynamic process from which we can derive the follow-\ning complementary hypotheses that pertain to the type of economic\ngrowth that we have had during recent decades:\n\n1. The price of the sources of income streams that represent the ac-\nquired human capabilities of value in economic endeavor declined dur-\ning this period relative to the price of material forms.\n\n2. In responding to this change in the relative prices of these two\nsources of income the rate of investment in human sources rose during\nthis period relative to that in material sources.\n\n3. The increase in the investment in human sources relative to the\ninvestment in nonhuman sources has increased earnings relative to\nproperty income and the more equal distribution of investment in men\nhas tended to equalize earnings among human agents.\n\n\"These are testable hypotheses.

The plain fact is that the\nearnings of labor are rising, that these additional earnings account for\nvirtually all of the rise in per capita income, and that they are the pri-\nmary factor in reducing poverty over time. Why are these earnings in-\ncreasing? Why is labor's functional share of national income becoming\nlarger? These questions as already noted have become relevant rather\nrecently in our history. How then are we to approach the dynamics of\nour economy with a view of settling these questions?\n\nBefore turning to them let me mention some well-established\ndifferences among the sources of income and some specialized chains of\neconomic logic to guide particular types of analysis in this field. We\nare accustomed to classifying the functional sources to show whether\nthey are from wages and salaries, from property, or from self-employ-\nment which is as a rule a combination of the two. To these sources in-\ncome transfers are then added in classifying the sources of personal\nincome. Nor is all of it monetary income; for a part of it is in kind and\nin services that are as a rule consumed directly by those who have such\nsources. But these differences are less important for our purpose than\nare the differences with respect to price, marketability, and the time it\ntakes to develop the various sources and to obtain income from them.\nWith regard to economic logic, the movements of the different income\nstreams, i.e., those from profits, property, and labor, associated with\nthe business cycle, undoubtedly have their own internal logic?

I venture that the relevant income elasticity here, although it is\ngradually becoming less elastic as per capita income rises, is\nsufficiently stable to make useful and dependable projections.\n\nThe rise in per capita income also increases the demand for the con-\nvenience of smaller households where young people can move from\ntheir parental household and set up separate households of their own\nand older people can maintain their status as separate families longer\nthan formerly.* The demand here also can be treated as a function of\nthe rise in income, hence as an income elasticity.

The poverty rate has been\nreduced at the rate of one percentage point a year; the poverty income\ngap is now down to 2 percent of GNP.\n\nPreventing and countering the \"events\" which select people for pov-\nerty can help to maintain or accelerate the rate at which we have been\nmaking progress against poverty. For example, by returning to the 4\npercent \"full employment\" rate of unemployment, we would instan-\ntaneously reduce the poverty rate by one percentage point. For anoth-\ner example, we could make a great stride toward early closing of the\npoverty income gap by modifying the income tax to pay out family al-\nlowances.\n\nAnother broad approach to the elimination of poverty is to break\ndown the social barriers which restrict opportunities for the poor. Ex-\namples of this are legislating against practices of discrimination and\nmaking plans to bring the poor into the mainstream of community life.\n\nThe third approach is to make progressively greater investment in\nimproving the abilities and motivations of the poor. Substantial in-\ncrease in outlays for education and training is a promising example of\nthis approach.\n\nReduction of poverty hinges on the attainment of other goals such\nas economic growth, full employment, income security, and equal op-\nportunity. But it also turns upon the reduction of poverty itself since\npoverty to an important degree causes itself. Hence, any favorable\nbreak in the circle makes the next step easier. More nearly full em-\nployment makes barriers less meaningful; lower barriers shrink\ndifferences in motivation. Similarly, higher incomes for the poor work\nto reduce both acquired and at-birth limitations of ability.\n\nBut any one of the approaches will involve costs, and it would be\nvaluable to know their comparative cost-benefit ratios.

Motivations\n\nThe third broad approach to accelerated reduction of poverty relates\nto the basis for selection referred to above as limited ability or motiva-\ntion. The process of economic growth works the poverty line progres-\nsively deeper into the ranks of people who are below average in ability\nor motivation, but meantime it should be possible to raise the ability\nand motivation levels of the lowest. It is interesting that few children,\neven those of below average ability, who are not born and raised in\npoverty, actually end up in poverty as adults. This suggests that poverty\nis to some extent an inherited disease. But it also suggests that if poor\nchildren had the same opportunities, including preschool training and\nremedial health care, as the nonpoor (even assuming no great break-\nthroughs of scientific understanding), the rate of escape from poverty\nwould be higher. Even more fundamentally, we know that mental re-\ntardation as well as infant mortality and morbidity have an important\ncausal connection with inadequate prenatal care, which in turn relates\nto low income of parents.\n\nA belief in the economic responsiveness of poor youngsters to im-\nproved educational opportunities underlies policies advocated by many\neducational theorists from Bentham to Conant. And this widely shared\nbelief no doubt explains the emphasis which the Economic Opportuni-\nty Act places upon education and training. The appropriation under\nthat Act, while it seems small relative to the poverty income gap, is\nlarge relative to present outlays for education of the poor. I would esti-\nmate that the hal\u00ed-billion dollars or so thereby added increases the na-\ntional expenditure for this purpose by about one-seventh. To raise the\nlevel of educational expenditure for poor children\u2014who are one-fifth\nof the nation's children but who consume about a tenth of educational\noutlay\u2014to equal that of the average would cost in the neighborhood of\n$3 billion.

It is curious that medieval cities\nbuilt walls to keep poverty outside. Present arrangements often work\nto bottle it up inside cities or parts of cities and thereby encourage\npoverty to function as its own cause.\n"], "7": ["Breaking Down Barriers\n\n\"The approaches discussed thus far are consistent with the view that\npoverty is the result of events which happen to people. But there are\n\n' Cf. Milton Friedman, Capitalism and Freedom (1962), pp. 192-93.\n", "THE ECONOMICS OF POVERTY 527\n\nof unused exemptions and deductions, most of which relate to families\nwith children. Restricting the plan to such families and applying a neg-\native tax rate of, say, 20 percent, to this amount would \"yield\" an al-\nlowance total of almost $4 billion. This would not in itself take many\npeople out of poverty, but it would go a considerable distance toward\nclosing the poverty income gap, which now aggregates about $12 bil-\nlion.\n\nIt would, of course, be possible to go considerably further by this\ndevice without significantly impairing incentive to work and save.\nFirst, however, let me reject as unworkable any simple plan to assure a\nminimum income of $3,000. To make such an assurance would induce\nmany now earning less than and even some earning slightly more than\n$3,000 to forego earnings opportunities and to accept the grant. Hence\nthe poverty income gap of $12 billion would far understate the cost of\nsuch a minimum income plan. However, it would be practicable to\nenact a system of progressive rates articulated with the present income\ntax schedule. The present rates fall from 70 percent at the top to 14\npercent at income just above $3,700 for a family of five, to zero per-\ncent for income below $3,700. The average negative tax rates could\nmove, then, from zero percent to minus 14 percent for, say, the unused\nexemptions that total $500, to 20 percent for those that total $1,000\nand 40 percent for those that total $3,700. This would amount to a\nminimum income of $1,480 for a family of five; it would retain posi-\ntive incentives through a set of grants that would gradually diminish\nas earned income rose.\n\nThe total amount to be paid out (interestingly, this would be shown\nin the federal budget as a net reduction in tax collections) under such\na program would obviously depend upon the particular rates selected,\nthe definition of income used, the types of income-receiving units de-\nclared eligible, and the offsets made in public assistance payments. But\nit clearly could be more than the $4 billion mentioned in connection\nwith the more limited plan of a standard 20 percent negative tax rate.\nAt the outset it might involve half the poverty income gap and total\nabout $6 billion. This amount is approximately equal to the total fed-\neral, state, and local taxes now paid by the poor. Hence it would\namount to a remission of taxes paid. As the number in poverty fell, the\namount paid out under this plan would in turn diminish.\n"], "6": ["526 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\n\nFurther fall in the poverty rate would follow if\u00c9\u2014by retraining and re-\nlocation of some workers\u2014long-term unemployment could be cut or if\nunemployment could be more widely shared with the nonpoor.\n\nTo the extent that events are beyond prevention, some, e g., disabili-\nty, can be countered by remedial measures. Where neither the preven-\ntive nor the remedial approach is suitable, only the alleviative meas-\nures of social insurance and public assistance remain. And the\nsufficiency of these measures will help determine the poverty rate and\nthe size of the poverty income gap. It is interesting to note that our\nsystem of public income maintenance, which now pays out $35 billion\nin benefits per year, is aimed more at the problem of income insecurity\nof the middle class and at blocking returns to poverty than in facilitat-\ning exits from poverty for those who have never been out of poverty.\nThe nonpoor have the major claim to social insurance benefits, the lev-\nels of which in most cases are not adequate in themselves to keep a\nfamily out of poverty. Assistance payments of $4 billion now go to 8\nmillion persons, all of whom are in the ranks of the poor, but about\nhalf of the 35 million poor receive neither assistance nor social insur-\nance payments. One important step in the campaign against poverty\nwould be to reexamine our insurance and assistance programs to dis-\ncover ways in which they could be more effective in helping people to\nget out of poverty. Among the ideas to be considered along this line are\neasier eligibility for benefits, higher minimum benefits, incentives to\nearn while receiving benefits, ways to combine work-relief, retraining,\nrehabilitation, and relocation with receipt of benefits.\n\nAmong the several events that select people for poverty, the ones\nabout which we have done the least by social policy are family break-\nup by other than death and the event of being born poor. Both of these\ncould be alleviated by a family allowance system, which the U.S., al-\nmost alone among Western nations, lacks. We do, of course, have ar-\nrangements in the federal individual income tax for personal deduc-\ntions and exemptions whereby families of different size and composi-\ntion are ranked for the imposition of progressive rates. However, it is a\nmajor irony of this system that it does not extend the full force of its\nallowances for children to the really poor. In order to do so, the tax\nsystem could be converted to have negative as well as positive rates,\npaying out grants as well as forgiving taxes on the basis of already\nadopted exemptions and rates. At present there are almost $20 billion\n\nployment during the year. (Census Population Reports, P-60, No. 39, Feb. 28, 1963,\nTables 15 and 16.) If half of this group were moved out of poverty by more nearly full\nemployment, then the poverty rate would be one percentage point lower. Another way\nto estimate this is as follows. The national income would be $30 billion higher than it is\nif we had full employment. And a $30 billion increase in recent years has generally meant\na full percentage point drop in the percent of families in poverty.\n"], "5": ["THE ECONOMICS OF POVERTY 525\n\npoor.) Similar types of arbitrary barriers or market imperfections are\nobservable in the case of sex, age, residence, religion, education, and\nseniority. They are formalized in employer hiring procedures, in the\nrules of unions and professional and trade associations, in governmen-\ntal regulations concerning housing and welfare and other programs,\nand are informally expressed in customer preferences. Barriers, once\nestablished, tend to be reinforced from the poverty side by the alienat-\ned themselves. The poor tend to be cut off from not only opportunity\nbut even from information about opportunity. A poverty subculture\ndevelops which sustains attitudes and values that are hostile to escape\nfrom poverty. These barriers combine to make events nonrandom;\ne.g., unemployment is slanted away from those inside the feudalistic\nwalls of collective bargaining, disability more commonly occurs in jobs\nreserved for those outside the barriers, the subculture of poverty in-\nvites or is prone to self-realizing forecasts of disaster.\n\nThe third factor involved in selecting persons out of the affluent so-\nciety to be poor is limited ability or motivation of persons to earn and\nto protect themselves against events and to fight their way over the\nbarriers? To the extent that the market is perfect one can rationalize\nthe selection for poverty (insofar as earnings alone are considered) on\nthe basis of the abilities and skills needed by the market and the dis-\ntribution of those abilities and skills in the population. But we note\nthat ability is to some extent acquired or environmentally determined\nand that poverty tends to create personalities who will be de-selected\nby the market as inadequate on the basis of ability or motivation.\n\nCountering \"Events\"\n\nApproaches to the reduction of poverty can be seen as parallel to the\ncauses or bases for selection recounted above. The first approach, then,\nis to prevent or counter the events or happenings which select some\npersons for poverty status. The poverty rate could be lessened by any\nreduction in early death, disability, family desertion, what Galbraith\nreferred to as excessive procreation by the poor, or by containment of\ninflation and other hazards to financial security. Among the important\nevents in this context the one most relevant to public policy considera-\ntion at this time is excessive unemployment. It would appear that if\nthe recent level of over 5 percent unemployment could be reduced to 4\npercent, the poverty rate would drop by about one percentage point.*\n\n*For an insight into the relative importance of this factor see James M.

But perhaps it is necessary\nfirst to brush aside the idea that there has to be some given amount of\npoverty. Most economists have long since given up the idea that a pro-\ngressive society needs the threat of poverty to induce work and sobrie-\nty in the lower classes. Similarly, one can consign to folklore the ideas\nthat some are rich only because others are poor and exploited, that if\nnone were poor then necessary but unpleasant jobs would go undone,\nthat the middle class has a psychological need to exclude a minority\nfrom above-poverty living standards, and that poverty is a necessary\nconcomitant of the unemployment which necessarily accompanies eco-\nnomic growth.\n\nWhy, then, is it that there remains a minority of persons who are\ninvoluntarily poor in this affluent society? How does our system select\nthe particular members for this minority? To the latter question we\noffer a three-part answer: (1) Events external to individuals select a\nnumber to be poor. (2) Social barriers of caste, class, and custom de-\nnominate persons with certain characteristics to run a high risk of\nbeing poor. (3) 'The market assigns a high risk of being poor to those\nwith limited ability or motivations.\n\nOne cannot look at the data on who are the poor without sensing\nthat many are poor because of events beyond their control. Over a\nthird of the 35 million poor are children whose misfortune arises out of\nthe chance assignment to poor parents. In some cases this poverty\ncomes out of being members of unusually large families. Among the\npoor adults, about a third have either suffered a disability, premature\ndeath of the family breadwinner, or family dissolution. A considerable\nnumber have confronted a declining demand for services in their cho-\nsen occupation, industry, or place of residence. Some have outlived\ntheir savings or have lost them due to inflation or bank failure. For\nmany persons who are otherwise \"normal\" poverty may be said to\narise out of one or a combination of such happenings.\n\nA second factor that operates in the selection of persons to be poor\nis the maintenance of social barriers in the form of caste, class, and\ncustom. The clearest example of this, of course, is racial discrimination\nwith regard to opportunities to qualify for and to obtain work.

The recent av-\nerage rate of change, namely, a fall in the percentage of families in\npoverty by one percentage point per year, suggests that the poverty\nproblem is about twenty years from solution. This rate of reduction\nmay be difficult to maintain as we get down to a hard core of poverty\nand a situation in which further growth will not contribute to the re-\nduction of the poverty rate. My own view is that this rate is still high-\nly responsive to changes in the growth rate and that it will continue to\nbe so for some time ahead. The relationship between the two rates is a\ncomplex one and is influenced by such things as demographic change,\nchanges in labor force participation, occupational shifts in demands\nfor labor, and derived changes in property incomes and social security\nbenefits. Some groups\u2014notably the aged, the disabled, and the broken\nfamilies\u2014have poverty rates that appear to be relatively immune to\ngrowth in average income. One powerful drag on the responsiveness of\nthe poverty rate to growth, which has now about run its course and\nwill shortly reverse, is the aging and reduction in labor force participa-\ntion of family heads.*\n\nWhile the size of the poverty population is dwindling, the size of\nwhat can be called the \"poverty income gap\" is diminishing. This\ngap\u2014the aggregate amount by which the present poor population's in-\ncome falls short of $3,000 per family or $1,500 per unrelated individ-\nual\u2014is now about $12 billion, or 2 percent of GNP. As time goes on\nthis gap will assuredly be less, both because of economic growth and\nbecause of scheduled increases in social insurance benefits. (Transfers\nnow make up about $10 billion of the $25 billion income of the poor.)\nProjecting recent rates of change suggests that by 1975 the poor will\nbe no more than 12 percent of the population and the poverty income\ngap will be as little as 1 percent of that year's GNP.\n\nAs I see it, the goal of eliminating poverty needs to have a time di-\nmension and intermediate targets. I assume we want a rate of progress\nat least as fast as that of recent years. Further, it helps to think of the\ngoal in two parts: the reduction of the poverty rate and the reduction\nof the poverty income gap.

This situation was\nupset by the Great Depression of the 1930's but later restored by the\nbooming economy of World War II. The postwar period has yielded a\nsomewhat above average rate of growth in productivity and a reduc-\ntion in poverty which probably is at least average for recent decades.\nThe number of families in poverty (as marked off from nonpoverty by\na $3,000 income at 1962 prices) fell from 12 million in 1947 to 9 mil-\nlion in 1963. This was a drop from 32 percent to 19 percent of families.\n\nThe rate of reduction one records or predicts will vary somewhat\nwith the definition of poverty which he adopts. The Council of Eco-\nnomic Advisers adopted an income cut-off of $3,000 of total money in-\ncome for families and $1,500 for unrelated individuals.? It is not in-\nconsistent with those guidelines to make further modification for fami-\nly size, using $3,000 as the mark for an urban family of four persons\nwith variations of $500 per person and to set a lower mark for rural\nfamilies. Such a procedure yields a slightly lower rate of reduction in\nthe percentage of all persons in poverty than is suggested by the 32 to\n19 drop shown above.? This discrepancy is due to a shift in family size\nand the rural to urban migration during the postwar years.\n\nIt is possible that consideration of personal income as opposed to\ntotal money income, of average rather than one year's income, of as-\nsets and extraordinary needs as well as income, and of related matters\nwould alter our understanding of how poverty has been reduced. It is\nclear that some of these considerations affect the number and the\ncomposition of the population counted as poor; and it is obvious that\nthe rate of reduction would vary if we varied the poverty line over\ntime.\n\nThese matters of definition are important to a refinement of the gen-\neralized goal of elimination of poverty to which President Johnson has\ncalled us. Economists can assist in reaching a national consensus on\nthe specific nature of the goal, of ways to measure the distance from\nand rate of movement toward the goal. Currently we are in the stage of\ngoalcsetting with poverty that occurred in 1946 with unemployment\nand that we have experienced with respect to other national goals such\nas price stability and economic growth.

This will immediately add a male\nincome earner to the family and will eventually induce male youth to\nlook more ambitiously toward futures in the market economy.\n\nDuring the 1950's, the numbers of men and of women of working\nage grew equally, but the number of jobs for women grew 34.5 percent,\nthe number for men only 7.3 percent [23, pp. 528-31]. This was\nespecially important for Negro women whose income rose relative to\nthat of white women and Negro men [1l, pp. 531-33]. The trend\ncontinues; between 1960 and 1964, the number of jobs for women\ngrew fourteen times as fast as the number of jobs for men [26, p.\n216].\n\nBecause half of southern Negro mothers of preschool children work\n[5, p. 9], mothers and children would benefit from preschool nurser-\nles freeing the mothers for work and preparing the children for school.\nBecause many receive ADC, higher payments or training schools for\nADC mothers would particularly benefit poor Negroes.\n\nSince poor Negro mothers are least informed regarding birth control\n[8, pp. 153-66], their education in this regard would permit great\nimprovements in Negro health, real per capita incomes, and family\nmanageableness.\n\nEach year Negroes have less interest in programs aiding poor farm-\ners, for farmers become more nearly all white each year.

This distinguishes Negro from white\nneed for transfers, but does not distinguish poor Negroes from poor\nwhites.\n\nRespecting government transfers, poor Negroes do differ from poor\nwhites because proportionately more Negro households have feminine\nheads and proportionately fewer Negroes are past sixty-four.\n\nRelatively few Negroes receive OASDI (old age, survivors, and\ndisability insurance). In 1962, 6.7 percent of the 12,500,000 recipients\nwere nonwhite. This low figure was due to the nonwhite's shorter age\nspan and the dissimilar work histories that led 73 percent of elderly\nwhites but only 58 percent of elderly nonwhites to qualify [10, pp. 5\nand 9]. In contrast, old age assistance goes to 38 percent of elderly\nnonwhites, 12 percent of elderly whites [10, p. 11].\n\nOASDI brings elderly Negroes and whites close to income equality.\nFor all persons, Negro income averages half of white income [1].\nYet the average income of nonwhites runs 80 percent the average total\nincome of whites receiving OASDI [10, p. 5]. This happens because\nmany Negroes continue in poverty while many whites sink into pover-\nty after retiring.\n\nBecause Negro fathers so often decamp, Negro children receive a\ndisproportionate share of ADC (aid to families with dependent chil-\ndren). Of 900,000 families (with 2,800,000 children) receiving ADC\nin 1963, 44 percent were Negro [9, pp. 3-4].\n\nPer capita, ADC pays much less than retirement programs. Old age\nassistance meets 94 percent of the needs of the elderly; ADC supplies\n58 percent of children's needs [12, p. 7].

Between 1950 and 1960, male\nemployment rose 6.9 percent; the number of semiskilled jobs in manu-\nfacturing rose only 4.1 percent [23, pp. 528-31].\n\nMost unfavorable for aspiring unskilled poor Negroes, the number\nof men's laboring jobs in manufacturing fell 20 percent (by 200,000)\nbetween 1950 and 1960 [23, p. 533].\n\nThese changes in America's occupational cross-section result from\ntechnological developments that raise society's affluence; but, as pres-\nent trends continue, manufacturing will offer fewer exits from poverty\nfor Negroes handicapped by rural southern origins.\n\nThe Rising Social Minimum Wage and the\nAble-Bodied Unemployed\n\nTwo centuries ago, when sheep began gobbling up the people of\nEngland's countryside, the victims were deposited in cities in much the\nsame condition as the untrained Negro migrants of today. The bold\nEnglish peasantry, dispossessed from Sweet Auburn, could say of the\ncity, \"Thou found'st me poor at first and keep'st me so,\" but they were\nemployed\u2014though oppressively and irregularly.\n\nMany Negroes transplanted to cities are unable to obtain steady\nwork. Long's argument that America's social minimum wage rises\nabove the marginal revenue product of society's least productive mem-\nbers [7, p. 16] applies especially to urban Negroes with rural south-\nern antecedents. Law and respectable custom press upward on the so-\ncial minimum wage. The general welfare benefits as many low-income\npersons receive more money and employers increase efficiency to offset\nhigher costs [29, pp. 1139-40]. But the first increase in the minimum\ncauses the discharge of the least able persons employed. Successive in-\ncreases cause the discharge of successively more able persons among\nthe less able employed [29, p. 1141].\n\nIt is the function of the market to choose technology appropriate to\navailable resources as reflected in flexible resource prices. But the mar-\nket does not operate below the social minimum. Weighed down with\ntheir heritage from the Southern Way of Life, able-bodied Negroes\nwith marginal revenue products below the social minimum wage must\neither find employers paying below the minimum or depend on trans-\nfers.\n\nSo much for forces benefiting the general public but hurting poor\nNegroes.\n"], "6": ["THE ECONOMICS OF POVERTY 535\n\n1950, there were 559,000 (with 3,167,000 residents); in 1959 only\n265,000 (with 1,482,000 residents) [26, p. 618] [21, p. 599] [23,\npp. 359-60].\n\nThe economy benefits as productivity rises. The effect on Negroes is\nless favorable. As whites left, the white farms that averaged 130 acres\nin 1930 grew to average 249 acres in 1959. But Negro farms showed\nlittle growth. They averaged 43 acres in 1930 and 52 acres in 1960\n[34, p. 1035].\n\nChange has not resulted in larger, more prosperous Negro farms.\nChange has expelled from southern farms the most ill-educated Ameri-\ncans.\n\nLooking ahead, the Negro reservoir is nearly exhausted. The num-\nber of rural farm Negroes in 1960 was only 47 percent the number in\n1950 [23, pp. 359-60]. The Negro exodus can never again approach\nthe scale reached during the 1950's. Poor Negroes are already commit-\nted to the city.\n\nManufacturing Migration: Jobs Out of Reach\n\nSince 1950, southern manufacturing has expanded more rapidly\nthan northern. From 1950 to 1960, the number of manufacturing jobs\ngrew 28 percent in the South, only 12 percent in the North [22, pp.\n407-11] [23, pp. 730-32]. Because most poor Negroes live in the\nSouth and because Negroes! wartime income gains were based on\naccession of Negroes to production jobs in manufacturing, Negroes are\nparticularly a\u00edfected by shifts in manufacturing employment.\n\nManufacturing's southern migration to new markets and new\nsources of raw material [15, pp. 46-47] has distributed American re-\nsources more efficiently. It has taken jobs to poor whites but not to\npoor Negro men. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of jobs in south-\nern manufacturing rose by 944,000. Of these 944,000 jobs, 12,000\nwent to Negro women (proportionately fewer than to white women);\nnone went to Negro men [22, p. 410] [23, pp. 728-29].\n\nManufacturing: Technological Change Blocks the Exits\n\nDuring wartime, rural southern Negroes proved themselves in man-\nufacturing and developed vested interests in the growth of unskilled\nand semiskilled manufacturing jobs.\n\nToday, technological change benefits all by raising productivity. It\nalso changes America's occupational cross-section. In 1880 textile\nmechanization replaced skilled workers with unskilled rural immi-\ngrants [6, p. 63].

Average Negroes re-\nmained in the same relative position, but rising educational medians\nincreased the comparative disadvantage of the 2,265,000 nonwhite\nfunctional illiterates (less than five years of school) making up 23.5\npercent of the 1960 nonwhite population past age twenty-four [23, pp.\n420-21].\n\nMany poor whites are illiterate, but figures on school years complet-\ned understate the number of illiterate Negroes and the size of their\neducational disadvantage. Understatements result for Negroes because\nso many attended inefficient segregated southern schools. Testing poor\nNegro literacy, Illinois departments of public aid recently sampled\nable-bodied Negroes aged 16-64 receiving public assistance (not a ran-\ndom sample of all Negroes). Each person was asked his school\nattainment; each took the New Stanford Reading Test. Of persons\neducated in Illinois, 3 percent were functionally illiterate; 35 percent\ntested as illiterate. Of persons educated in Mississippi, 23 percent were\nfunctionally illiterate; 81 percent, four of five adults, tested as illiter-\nate [17, p. 118].\n\nOf nonwhites living North or West in 1960, 41 percent had been\nborn in the South [24, p. 2]. These educationally deprived poor\nsouthern Negroes are increasingly disadvantaged in regions where the\nmedian education of the local labor force and the quality of local\nschools rise each year.\n\nPoor Negro boys are especially disadvantaged because of parental\nlimitations and because their homes and the larger society offer so few\nsuccessful men inspiring academic emulation. Special counseling and\neducational arrangements can offset those conditions and send slum\nboys to college [13, pp. 275-76], but society devotes few resources to\nsuch arrangements.\n\nLeft ever farther behind rising national educational norms, poor\nNegro families are ever less qualified to compete for jobs or to help\ntheir children acquire the education required to escape poverty.\n\nAgriculture: End of an Exodus\n\nSince 1945, the mechanization of cotton culture has revolutionized\nsouthern agriculture [16]. There has also been persistent change in\ncrops grown and livestock raised [15]. These changes raised agricul-\ntural productivity and expelled hand labor from southern farms.

One of these forces is urban re-\nnewal. It replaces slums with aesthetically attractive, commercially\nprofitable structures, some of which provide low-income housing supe-\nrior to that which the private market could provide.\n\nYet urban renewal seems to effect a net reduction in housing supply\nfor poor Negroes. L. K. Northwood found (32, pp. 107-08] \"'the sup-\nply of housing has been reduced in areas formerly occupied by Negro\nfamilies. . . . 115,000 housing units were . . . planned to replace 190,500\n\n.. \u00e0 tet loss of 75,000.\" Because many urban Negroes live in slums,\n60 percent of the persons dispossessed by urban renewal demolition\nhave been Negroes [31, p. 348].\n\nThe long-run tendency to reduce the supply of low-cost housing is\naggravated in the short run because time must elapse between demoli-\ntion of old and dedication of new buildings. During short runs as long\nas five years [8, pp. 132-33] urban renewal reduces housing supply\nby demolition uncompensated by new construction.\n\nPoor whites may move elsewhere; poor Negroes must face reduced\nsupply. Reduced supply should raise prices, and there is evidence that\nNegroes displaced by urban renewal pay rent 10 percent higher after\nrelocation than before [14, pp. 72 and 82].\n\nUntil President Kennedy's November, 1962, executive order, the\nsupply-restriction effect was even greater, for no federal rule prohib-\nited urban redevelopers from practicing racial discrimination [30, p.\n441].

Consequently, per capita real income of poor\nNegroes is even farther below per capita real income of poor whites.\n\nIf, then, $3,000 in Negro money buys only as much as $2,800 or\neven $2,500 in white money and is distributed over more people, one\nshould keep in mind appropriate reservations when comparing percent-\nage of whites with percentage of Negroes below some income level.\n\nDifferences in. Demographic Characteristics\n\n'The Negro poor differ from the white poor in demographic charac-\nteristics. Remembering that Negro numbers will be understated, uni-\nform dollar incomes can be used to identify nonwhite (not Negro) and\nwhite poor. Defining as poor, families with incomes under $3,000 and\nindividuals living independently with incomes under $1,500 in 1959,\nfour social-economic variables distinguish the nonwhite from the white\npoor.\n\nFirst, the nonwhite poor are concentrated in the South. In 1960, 72\npercent (52 percent)! of poor nonwhite families; only four of ten (27\npercent) poor white families lived in the South (unless otherwise\nnoted, all statistics in this section are from reference (25]). The 32\npoint difference in southern concentration resulted because, in 1960,\nthe proportion of nonwhites was double the proportion of whites living\nin the South.\n\nSecond, low income is more of a rural phenomenon for whites than\nfor nonwhites; 18 of every 100 (4 percent) poor white families, 12 of\nevery 100 (3 percent) poor nonwhite families lived on farms in 1960.\nFully 84 percent (79 percent) of nonwhite, only 44 percent (63 per-\ncent) of white farm families were poor in 1959, but nonwhites have\nwithdrawn from farming more completely than have whites.\n\nThird, the aging of husbands is a much more important cause of\nwhite than of nonwhite poverty. Other forces are important in causing\nnonwhite poverty. In 1959, 29 percent of poor white families but only\n13 percent of poor nonwhite families were headed by a man older than\nsixty-four years. Among unrelated individuals, 40 percent of the white\npoor, only 26 percent of the nonwhite poor were past sixty-four.\n\nFourth, nonwhite poverty, far more than white, is associated with\nfamilies headed by women. American Negro women have always borne\nexceptionally heavy family responsibility. In 1910 there were 20 gain-\nfully employed white women for every 100 employed white men; there\nwere 67 employed Negro women for every 100 employed Negro men\n\n[20, pp. 66-67].

When labor markets softened between 1949 and 1959, the in-\ncome position of Negro men relative to that of white men fell in every\nsection of the country [1]. Rising productivity cut the number of\nwhites and Negroes living in poverty, but the incidence of poverty\namong Negroes rose between 1950 and 1962 from 2 to 275 times the\nwhite rate [26, p. 339].\n\nThe past decade's many admonitions and laws opposing discrimina-\ntion could not raise the Negro's relative economic position in the face\nof rising unemployment. If Negroes are to approach economic and\ncivil equality in the future, unemployment rates must fall.\n\nFull employment affects all Negroes. Attention now turns to the\ncharacteristics distinguishing poor Negro from poor white Americans.\n\nThe Negro Dollar: Second-class Money\n\nWhen citing statistics of poverty, the portion of Negro families re-\nceiving incomes below a particular figure, e.g., $3,000, is often com-\npared with the portion of white families receiving incomes below $3,-\n000. Such comparisons implicitly assume the Negro's $3,000 buys as\nmuch as the white's $3,000. It does not.\n\nAmerican cities have two housing markets: the city-wide white mar-\nket and the circumscribed Negro market. Because supply is restricted,\nNegroes [33, p. 36] \"received less housing value for their dollars spent\nthan do whites. . . . Census statistics indicate that . . . non-white ren-\nters and home owners obtain fewer standard quality dwellings and fre-\nquently less space than do whites paying the same amounts.\" A Chi-\ncago welfare department study found [18, p. 13] \"housing defects\nsignificantly greater for Negro than for white families, despite the fact\nthat rents for Negro families are 2896 a month higher than for whites\nin private dwellings.\"\n\nLandlords are sometimes judged greedy extortionists for charging\nNegro tenants higher rents than whites. But they are operating in a\nmarket of restricted supply; high Negro rents reflect supply and de-\nmand relationships, not conspiratorial landlord greed. Since 15 percent\nof the consumption expenditures of urban Negro families is for shelter\n[27], real income is significantly reduced by relatively high rents.\n\nPoor urban Negroes also pay more than whites for identical consum-\ner durables bought on credit [3, pp. 12-20]. (Negroes pay more than\nwhites for residential financing, too [31, p. 344].) The difference\nmay be due to white reluctance to sell to Negroes (Becker's discrimi-\nnation [2]), to Negro immobility, or to the sellers! assumption that\npoor Negroes are poorer risks than poor whites.

They depended on sel\u00ed-learning and on active student par-\nticipation in the learning process. The major concepts and ideas that\nwere developed through the experiments were not complex and in each\ncase could probably be set down in relatively few words. These experi-\nments and others like them involved a substantial investment in stu-\ndent time that could have been used to present additional subject mat-\nter. My view that investments of this type are worthwhile is based on\na judgment that our highest priority task is to increase our impact on\nstudents. We must distinguish between teaching and learning. It may\nwell be that if we taught less, the students would learn more. I feel\nsomewhat timid about exposing this possibility when educational stan-\ndards are accelerating all about me. I am sure that for many the best\npath to learning is through the intellect without the aid of special reen-\nforcement techniques. But I am afraid that if we hope to make our\nsubject matter relevant beyond the final examination, we will have to\naddress ourselves more explicitly to that end. We should judge our\nperformance by whether our students have learned and retained the\nbasic concepts we have to offer, not as an exercise in not too difficult\nmathematics, but as relevant economics.\n\nRole playing and other participative techniques appear to offer the\npossibility of deepening the learning that takes place and of increasing\nthe acceptance of economics. Students seem to remember their role-\nplaying experiences long after they leave the class, and my experience\nindicates that student involvement can improve our teaching through\nbetter comprehension, stronger interest, more self-learning, and im-\nproved student-teacher communication. My modest experiments sug-\ngest only that participative techniques can be used effectively in eco-\nnomic education. Certainly this is one path we should explore in our\nattempts to make economics more meaningful. However, we should ex-\nperiment more systematically to determine the best uses of such tech-\nniques and to discover new ways to reenforce and supplement our\nteaching.\n", "565\n"], "9": ["564 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION\nLabor-Management Disputes\n\nRole playing can be used to help students understand the attitudes\nand perceptions of individuals whose points of view differ substantially\nfrom their own. Students from upper- and middle-class families find it\ndifficult to understand the basis for conflict between union and man-\nagement. There is a tendency to believe that one party (usually the\nunion) does not really understand the situation, and if only the facts\ncould be clarified, most disputes would disappear. I have made use of\ndetailed case material to provide a context for student participation in\ngrievance negotiations in union and management roles.* The case ma-\nterial is distributed and students assigned in groups of six or eight to\nroles as members of a union or management committee. Each group is\nasked to meet for not more than two hours to attempt to resolve the\ndispute described in the background readings. They meet without su-\npervision, and from reports I have received, they seem to throw them-\nselves into the assigned roles with enthusiasm.\n\nAt the next class meeting I ask for an oral report from each group.\nA representative of one of the committees volunteers to summarize the\ndiscussions and whatever partial agreement or definition of the issues\nhis group arrived at. The volunteer is usually chagrined to discover\nthat members of the opposing committee are unwilling to accept his\nsummary and insist on presenting their own view of the negotiations.\nThere are frequent disagreements over the details of settlements and\non some occasions over whether any agreement was actually reached.\nWhen all the groups have reported, but before any general discussion\nof the substantive issues, I ask the students to step out of their roles\nand indicate by secret ballot which side of the dispute they believe was\nright. When the votes are tallied there is some surprise expressed at\nthe substantial vote for the union position. I then ask the students to\nindicate how they voted, and whether they took a union or manage-\nment role in the negotiations. On each occasion that I have used this\nexercise a substantial fraction of the students who took union roles\nvoted for the union position, and almost without exception those who\nplayed management roles voted for management.\n\nThe students learned about the process of negotiation and improved\ntheir understanding of the substantive issues in dispute. But the most\nsignificant impact of the experience on the students was their realiza-\ntion that the role they played affected their perceptions and evalua-\ntions of the situation.\n\n*'There are published cases that can be used for this exercise.

The students within each group were instructed to\nmake their price decisions independently and without any communica-\ntion. After each of the three had selected and noted a price, they were\ntold to reveal the decisions to each other and to record the profits they\nhad earned as indicated by the table on the board. This procedure was\nrepeated until the experiment was concluded.\n\nOne-third of the groups were asked to set the initial price for all\nfirms at the high level, one-third at the low level, and one-third were\nnot given any binding initial conditions. The predominant result was\nthat all three firms were forced into the low-profit alternative. Most of\nthe groups that started selling at the high price fell off the plateau and\nwere unable to return to it. The other groups were rarely able to attain\nthe uniform high price structure. Although the students were asked not\nto communicate there were many audible comments concerning the cu-\npidity, stupidity, and ancestry of the participants. After the students\nhad made about fifteen to twenty price decisions the experiment was\nterminated and the frequency of different price patterns reported to\nthe class. The experiment was then repeated with instructions permit-\nting the students in each group to communicate freely before each\nprice decision. Under these conditions a majority of the groups suc-\nceeded in maintaining a uniform high price level for fourteen of the\nfifteen price decisions. But a substantial number were unable to col-\nlude or found that their agreements broke down after a few decisions.\n\nThese were not controlled experiments, and I make no claim that\nthey shed any light on the behavior of oligopoly price-makers. But\nthey did give the students an intense experience that made the eco-\nnomic analysis of oligopoly behavior more meaningful. The students\nanalyzed the experimental conditions and assessed the importance of\ndemand elasticity, product substitution, communication, the cost func-\ntion, and their motivations in explaining their role behavior. They saw\ncollusive agreements break down and felt the frustration of not being\nable to raise a price when it was clearly in the interest of all firms in\nthe industry to do so. After their experience it was not difficult for\nthem to understand the role of a price leader or the significance of\ntacit collusion. The experiment and the discussions that followed pro-\nvided a dramatic background for the analysis of antitrust policies in a\nlearning context very different from the traditional authoritarian pre-\nsentation of subject matter.

Instead, the trading periods\ncontinued until bids and offers no longer resulted in contracts, and the market was repeated\nwith experimental conditions held constant over several successive trading periods.

There is no problem with the algebra or graphics, but\nstudents perceive a startling difference between the world as they know\nit and the economics text. Everyone knows tbat the seller sets the price\nfor his product; so what sense does it make to assume that the compet-\nitive firm must accept the market price as given. The student can see\nthat market price as we define it equates supply and demand and\nclears the market, in the rather special sense in which we use that\nphrase. But he finds it very difficult to translate the nicely intersecting\ncurves into something that can be applied to the world outside the\nclassroom.

From\ntheir questions and comments it was clear that they did not really be-\nlieve the economy could stand a tax cut in the face of a deficit, or that\nthe government could postpone repaying its debt much longer.\n\nIn his excellent paper' presented at the Association meetings last\nyear, Leonard Silk quoted studies of public attitudes and statements of\ncongressional leaders to show the \"wide disparity between what the\neconomists were teaching and what the public believed\" concerning a\ntax cut. He went on to state his belief that *the same kind of public\neconomic ignorance manifested on fiscal and debt policy could be dem-\nonstrated in many other areas.\" I am sure he is right.\n\nBut I do not have to go so far afield for evidence. My own students\nare extremely reluctant to apply the economic analysis taught in the\nclassroom to problems of any complexity. Recently a relatively new\ninstructor told me how disappointed he was with his students. He had\nbeen sure they were able to handle the theory he had been teaching,\nand they had performed successfully on several homework problems\nand quiz exercises. But when he assigned a policy problem, his stu-\ndents wrote at great length with no evidence that they knew any eco-\nnomics at all. Their performance unhappily resembles the behavior of\nour graduates. They shed with ease the theory we labor so hard to\nteach, and all that remains is a smattering of half-remembered terms.\nOnce again in the real world, they know what is right without the aid\nof economics. My anecdotal evidence and Mr. Silk's conclusions appear\nto be supported by the preliminary results of a nationwide study con-\nducted recently by two of my colleagues, Professors Bach and Saun-\nders. Some preliminary findings of theirs suggest that one or even two\neconomics courses leave little or no trace a few years after students\nhave left the classroom.\n\nIf our graduates do not understand and remember economic analysis\nor accept it as relevant to public policy issues, we have failed. Whatev-\ner the cause, we are not having a strong enough impact on our stu-\ndents. Without ruling out the possibility that the subject matter of our\ncourses may require critical reexamination, I suggest that we should\nfocus more explicitly on the learning process.\n\nIf we are to convince our students that economic analysis will help\nthem understand their environment, we shall have to aim for more\nthan an intellectual understanding of the subject matter. Intellectual\nlearning is not enough; economics must be accepted by students before\nthey will use it outside the classroom.

Inquiries located only\ntwo universities which had attempted this. At one, the lecture section\noutscored the remaining discussion sections by half a point to a point\non about 140 questions in three successive years. At the other, the lec-\nture sections gained 14.8 points, the discussion groups 16.3, on ques-\ntion set A from the March, 1960, A.E.R. The small sections scored\nsignificantly better on all 19 attitudinal questions addressed to the stu-\ndents. This university also tested its history classes: the small groups\nled significantly on 5 of the 19 and were slightly ahead on 12; but they\nprogressed only 36 percent (from about fourteen right at the start)\ntoward answering all thirty multiple-choice questions as against 44\npercent for the lecture group. Covariance analysis, taking account of\nbeginning scores, verbal-mathematical test scores, and the individual\nsection deviations, found these differences nonsignificant. It should be\nnoted that the lectures were still in the experimental stage, and that\ndifferences among the teachers were ruled out in the experiment.\n\nThese data tend on the whole to confirm the conclusions of W. J. Mc-\nKeachie in Nevitt Sanford's The American College (Wiley, 1962).\nEight experiments had shown as much or more information retained\nby lecture students, although four had found better attitudes or superi-\nor problem solving in small groups.
