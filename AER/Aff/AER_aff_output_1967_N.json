This is a state of\ngrowth in observable Harrod-neutrality: a growth path of which it is\npossible to say not only that it is Harrod-neutral in the sense that\nQ/K will remain constant if there takes place just enough investment to\nkeep constant, but also that there does in fact continuously accrue this\nparticular amount of investment. In other words, in a Golden Age we\nactually have simultaneous constancy of r and of Q/\u00c9K, hence also\nof wL/rK.\n\nIf the elasticity of substitution (c) is unitary, then Hicks-neutrality\nof innovations\u2014expressing itself in unchanging post-innovation values\nof the wL/rK ratio for the given pre-innovation macroeconomic inputs\nof L and K?\u2014logically implies Harrod-neutrality in the sense that it\ntakes the same amount of new investment to keep r constant as to\nkeep Q/XK and thus also wL/rK constant.

On the micro-level Hicks-neutrality means that individual firms, to which w and r are\ngiven, adopt innovations that leave the K/L ratio of each firm unchanged. Consequently,\nmacroeconomic adoption leads to no change of wL/rK for the initial K/L ratio.

What can explain the rate of growth?\n\nWe propose to measure different computers by their monthly rentals\nwhich would have been charged if the models had been introduced in\nthe year 1960. This method of measurement requires first establishing a\nrelationship between rental and the computer's basic characteristics for\n1960 models, and then applying the relationship to estimate what each\ncomputer would have cost if it had been introduced in 1960. By this\nmethod, the stock of general-purpose, digital computers has grown from\nan estimated 1960 rental of about $370 thousand per month at the end\nof 1954 to about $194 million at the end of 1965. An average annual\nrate of growth of 78 per cent would have accomplished this.\n\nTo explain this tremendous growth, one has to isolate the natural\ngrowth which would have prevailed had there been no technological\nchange, and the growth induced by technological change. In other\nwords, two elements account for the increase in the use of computers.\nFirst, it takes time for a new product to reach an equilibrium level even\nwithout quality change. Second, in the meantime, the quality of the\nproduct is improving, so that the equilibrium level is being continuously\nraised. An explanation ought to combine these two elements and assess\ntheir roles in the growth process.\n\nFor the natural growth, two differential equations have been popular.\n\"They are the differential equations generating the Gompertz curve and\nthe logistic curve [3, pp. 302-18]. For reasons of empirical validity as\nwell as analytical convenience, we have chosen the former, but a test\nof the latter will also be presented.\n\nA simple way of incorporating the effect of technological change into\nthe natural growth process is to assume that the equilibrium level,\nwhich the growth curve approaches, is a function of price, given quality.\nA price index can be constructed once the quantity of each computer is\nestablished, by its hypothetical 1960 rental as previously indicated.\n\n* 'The author is a research staff member at the IBM Watson Research Center and adjunct\nprofessor of economics at Columbia University.

This paper at-\ntempts to complete these statements for worlds not complicated by\ntransaction or information costs.\n\nTo do this, the paper raises and offers answers to three questions.\nFirst, as regards the effects of debt financing by the government, what\ntax-subsidy policy is equivalent to a policy of replacing current taxes\nwith government debt?

This however, is not the point at issue in this clas-\nsical controversy.\n", "ing that rents are price determining while others argue that they are price de-\ntermined. The multiple rent concepts of Pareto's followers seemingly permit a\nneat compromise which allows one to say that rents are from one stand-point\nprice determined yet from another price determining. The argument proceeds\nsomewhat as follows. Although rents in the sense of payments in excess of the\nminimum amount needed to induce factors to work are a result of the struc-\nture of prices and therefore price determined from the standpoint of the econ-\nomy as a whole, many components of these payments are price determining to\nparticular industries or firms. This is because the competitive bidding of other\nindustries has built the parts of those rents not generated by the specific in-\ndustry itself into opportunity costs which the industry must meet and which\nmust be covered in the price of the product. Hence those components of \"rents\nfrom the standpoint of the economy\" which are embodied in opportunity costs\nare price determining from the standpoint of the industry while rents gener-\nated by the industry itself are price determined. Similarly, payments which\nare rents from the standpoint of the industry are often included in the market\nprice of agents purchased by the firm and are price determining at that level.\n\nThis somewhat persuasive line of reasoning, however, misses the basic\npoint in the entire price-determined price-determining controversy. In essence\nthe controversy arises from a misleading statement of the problem. In fact\nunder properly constructed sets of assumptions it is easy to prove that rent is\neither price determined or price determining. For example, consider a factor\nX, which is used in the manufacture of product A. Let us assume that X\nis used in the production of other products and the manufacture of 4 requires\nother agents. If now the conditions of supply of all of the agents are treated as\ngiven, as well as the technical coefficients and the preference patterns for all\nproducts except 4, a change in the preference pattern concerning 4 will alter\nthe price of 4. This in turn will lead to a change in the demand by the pro-\nducers of A for X and therefore a change in the price of X,\nof which the part in excess of the minimum supply price is rent. Consequently\nthe change in the price of A changes or \"determines\" the rent of X. On the\nother hand, if every basic determinant of the system is treated as given, except\nthe supply of X, a change in the supply of X will alter its price including\nits rent and, in consequence, the price of 4. Here rent might be said to be\nprice determining.\n\nIn reality, of course, economists have long known that rent is neither price\ndetermining nor price determined since neither rent nor price is a basic deter-\nminant of the system. They are co-determined as the result of the interaction\nof more fundamental forces. We know from Cassell's simple general equilibrium\nmodel that these forces are the condition of supply of the agents, the\ntechnical coefficients, and the preference patterns of consumers [2, pp.\n134-55]. Their simultaneous interaction determines the prices of all products\nand factors, as well as the quantities of all goods produced and the allocation\nof resources.

Hence the total individual user rents\nwould in all probability differ greatly from the total rent received by the fac-\ntor. This difference would be especially large where supply is highly inelastic.\nIn addition we must remember that, when any user adds his demand to the\nfactor market, the price rise he produces generates \"rents\" not only for him-\nself but also necessitates additional payments by all other users of the agent.\n\nWe should also point out that the multiple-rent concepts are of no value\nwhatsoever when the theory of distribution is used in applied economics. Cer-\ntainly no moral significance or basis of policy formation can be found in firm\nor industry rents. It should be clear, therefore, that the Pareto approach is a\nmisfit from the standpoint of distribution theory and must justify itself, if at\nall, on other grounds.\n\nWhen the theory of cost is considered, Pareto's approach fares somewhat\nbetter. The traditional concept draws its lines of division between necessary\nand unnecessary payment at the social level. What is necessary or unnecessary\nfor the firm or the industry, however, is far different. Opportunity costs are\nreal and must be met even though from the social point of view most of these\npayments are rent. Nevertheless this does not justify separate rent concepts\nfor industries or firms. All that is required by the theory of cost at either firm\nor industry level is that the conditions of supply of the factor to the firm or\nthe industry be known. Here the concepts of supply curves to industries or\nfirms are entirely sufficient. In situations where a firm or industry can control\nthe market sufficiently to influence costs, the theories of monopsony or oligop-\nsony are adequate. As a result rent concepts at the firm and industry levels\nthat identify and name the income generated by firms or industries are totally\nunnecessary to the theory of cost. They are worse than useless, however, be-\ncause they confuse elements of cost and distribution theory. The distribution\nconcept of rent is needlessly brought into the theory of cost while the cost-ori-\nented user classification complicates the theory of distribution without en-\nhancing our knowledge of factor income determination.\n\nIt should be clear from what has been said that on theoretical grounds the\ntraditional concept is vastly superior. There is also no suggestion that the\nmultiple-rent concepts are of any practical importance for either the business-\nman or the social planner. That they are lacking in moral significance and\nprovide no meaningful policy guides should be evident as well. Consequently,\nthe foregoing analyses suggest that economic rent is best defined as the sur-\nplus over the payment needed to induce a factor to do its work, and best\ndefined in this way alone.*\n\nOne final argument in favor of the Pareto concept merits separate attention.\nEconomists have long debated the role of rents in price making, some contend-\n\n\"'The suggestion that rent be defined as the opportunity cost of land (or for that\nmatter of any other factor) and that any payment in excess of this amount be desig-\nnated \"factor profits\" [9, pp. 269-75] must also be rejected. Under conditions of pure\n\ncompetition such a distinction is unimportant. On the other hand, when individual firms\nplay a significant role in the market it is at least misleading and often clearly incorrect.\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "1224\n"], "3": ["tested by the contributions they make to these theories and their applications.\n\nThe traditional approach which views rent as the excess payment received\nby a factor over the minimum required to induce it to do its work passes the\ndistribution theory test with flying colors. This is not unexpected since the\nconcept had its origin in early formulations of distribution theory and was an\nintegral part thereof. In its early as well as its present form it was designed to\nexplain the income received by factors of production. It was first used in con-\nnection with the return paid to natural resources where no elasticity of supply\nwas believed to exist. Since the compensation of such a factor generated no\nincrease in productive effort it was viewed as a surplus payment. Even when\nthis line of reasoning was later extended to other types of agents, the term\nrent continued to be used to explain all or part of the income shares they re-\nceived. Here the rent or surplus designation was applied to that part of the\ncompensation of the factor in excess of the payment necessary to bring forth\nits services. This was true both of the excess over the minimum necessary to\nget the factor to work at all and the excess over the payment needed to induce\neach additional increment of performance by the factor. In modern terms, of\ncourse, this concept views \"economic rent\" as the part of the compensation of\nthe factor graphically depicted by the area between the supply curve to all\nuses of the factor and the horizontal line representing the rate pay received by\nthe factor.\n\nIn addition to being a clear-cut distribution concept the traditional view of\nrent has the great conceptual merit of being closely related to the basic causes\nof scarcity. Rent in this sense exists because the supplies of the factors are less\nthan perfectly elastic. This in turn is occasioned by those fundamental forces\nwhich cause the services of factors to be available in limited quantities only.\nWhen applied to factors other than land this approach forces us to focus on\nthe behavior of factor suppliers. As a result the study of scarcity must be re-\nlated to and draw upon the findings of other behavioral sciences.\n\nThe traditional rent concept also enables us to divide, conceptually at least,\nfactor compensation into two parts, payments which induce factors to work\nand surplus which only confers a greater reward for work which would have\nbeen done anyway. In classical terms it distinguishes payments made to over-\ncome \"real costs,\" labor pain, abstinence, etc., from unnecessary bounties. Al-\nthough we no longer subscribe closely to a \"real cost\" doctrine, it is still\nworthwhile to have a conceptual separation of those payments which are a\nnecessary condition of production and those which are not. This is particular-\nly important in applied economics where moral judgments are passed and pol-\nicies suggested.\n\nPareto's approach has little to contribute to distribution theory. At best the\nset of concepts which ascribe individual rents to each of the industries or firms\nusing an agent might enable us quantitatively to identify where the compo-\nnents of the total factor rent came from. If available and valid this informa-\ntion might be interesting, but it would contribute nothing that a thorough de-\nmand analysis would not provide. However, this type of compilation would be\nconceptually incorrect. Paretian rent from the point of view of any individual\nuser of a factor is determined by how his demand influences the price of a fac-\n", "1223\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "2": ["any worthwhile advantages from the use of two rent definitions rather than\none.!\n\nThe crux of the definition issue is this. Economic rent is defined by the fol-\nlowers of Ricardo as the excess amount earned by a factor over the sum neces-\nsary to induce it to do its work. The Paretian rent concept is the excess earn-\nings over the amount necessary to keep the factor in its present occupation\n[6, par. 745-55]. Clearly these are very different definitions. In the first the\ntest is whether the factor is supplied at all or not; the second is concerned\nwith where it is supplied. In the latter case it is obvious that opportunity costs\ncreated by the competitive uses must be met as a condition of holding the fac-\ntor in its present use.? Only the surplus over these opportunity costs would be\nrent in this sense.\n\nThe first of these definitions had its origin in Ricardo's concept of\ndifferential surplus. In essence, it is the same as Taussig's \"*producer's sur-\nplus\" [8, p. 63] and Marshall's \"scarcity rents\" [4, pp. 422-30). It is ori-\nented to the motives and behavior of the supplier of resources and presumably\nmay serve as the basis of moral judgments approving or condemning their re-\nwards.\n\nPareto's definition is user oriented. Because of the use of the present occu-\npation test, it differentiates payments generated by the industry or firm em-\nploying productive resources from those imposed in the market by the compe-\ntition of other firms or industries. As a result multiple rent concepts appear.\nFirst is rent from the point of view of the economy, which coincides with the\nRicardian type of definition. Next, however, is rent from the point of view of\nthe industry, which is any payment made by the industry to a factor in excess\nof the opportunity costs created by other industries. These extra payments are\nmade necessary by the industries! contribution to the total demand for the\nfactor. Finally, rents from the standpoint of the firm are payments by the firm\nin excess of what other firms in the same industry would offer the agent for its\nservices.\n\nThe existence of two significantly different but widely used approaches to\nthe concept of economic rent is obviously unfortunate. It is appropriate, there-\nfore, to examine critically the relative merits of the two types of definitions in\norder to determine whether significant simplification is possible and desirable.\n\nThe concept of economic rent is encountered most frequently in two impor-\ntant areas of economics, the theory of distribution and the theory of cost.\nConsequently the merits of the two types of rent concepts can appropriately be\n\n! Even Boulding in his excellent recent revision of Economic Analysis, offers two defini-\ntions, one following Ricardo and the other patterned after Pareto without explicitly\nmentioning that these definitions are different and that they may lend themselves to\ndifferent uses [1, p. 265 and p. 512]. An examination of the latest editions of most\nleading intermediate and advanced texts shows this situation to be quite general [7] [3].\n\n? At times a distinction is made between the payment needed to hold a factor in its\npresent occupation and the return it could earn in other uses [5]. These could, of course,\nbe different because of nonpecuniary elements involved in different lines of work. This\ndistinction is not employed here because it introduces another, and for our purposes\nextraneous, variable into the problem. Although we must admit the validity of this con-\ntention, it should be ruled out by the simplifying assumption that the net nonpecuniary\nadvantages of the occupations in question are the same.\n", "1222\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "1": ["Although the concept of economic rent has been widely used by professional\neconomists for many years, as yet no clear consensus concerning its meaning\nexists.

In his communication\n\"The Foundations of the *War on Poverty \" [2] Lowell Galloway argued\nthat the percentage of families living in poverty would decline to consider-\nably lower levels by 1970 or 1980 than had previously been estimated by\nthe Council of Economic Advisers [8].\n\nGalloway regressed the logarithm of the percentage of families with in-\ncomes below $3,000 in 1963 dollars on median family income and the unem-\nployment rate. From his basic equation, Galloway estimated poverty rates\nin 1970 and 1980 under two assumptions regarding growth of median\nfamily income and unemployment rates. These results are shown in Table 1.\nHis estimates of poverty rates in 1980 were a bit over half of those previ-\nously published in [8]. From these results Galloway concluded [2, p. 130]\n\"In short, the case for substantial anti-poverty programs of a selective\ncharacter is weakened by the findings of this paper. Rather, greater con-\nsideration should be given to the role which economic growth can play\nin eliminating poverty.\" Because Galloway's results have an obvious and\nimportant bearing on matters of considerable economic and political sig-\nnificance, they merit careful scrutiny, which this article attempts to pro-\nvide. The following are the major conclusions.\n\n1. Aggregate poverty statistics are inherently incapable of providing evi-\ndence for or against the backwash thesis\u2014the thesis that poverty will not\nlargely disappear with growth.\n\n2. Galloway's results are sensitive to the functional form of his regres-\nSion, and, in particular, the semilogarithmic transformation tends to over-\nstate the impact of rising incomes on the poverty percentage.\n\n3. Galloway's results are sensitive to the data he uses. Both Galloway\nand the CEA used poverty estimates based on a $3,000 family income\ncutoff. If the semilogarithmic regression is run separately for the percentage\nof white and nonwhite families living in poverty, it appears that white\nfamily poverty is more sensitive to economic growth, but less sensitive to\nthe unemployment rate than is nonwhite family poverty.

He con-\nceded that Oliver's criticism was correct, but of no consequence, since he\ncan afford to throw away (2) and (3). He then went on to demonstrate\nnumerically that his model had performed well.\n\nWe have used the aggregate time series of borrowing, repayment, per-\nsonal income, and disposable personal income! to estimate a few empirical\nrelations between them.

It is obvious from (7a) and (7b) that new bor-\nrowing is 20\u00a3 proportional to income although certainly related linearly.\nThese empirical results do not support Enthoven's postulate (2), B(/)\n\u2014bY(t), in that the constant (i.e., the intercept in billions of dollars) is\ndefinitely not zero. The /-ratio of the estimated intercept to its standard\nerror is either \u2014 11.6 or \u2014 12.8, both of which are highly significant, depend-\ning upon whether personal or disposable income is the regressor.?\nDividing both sides of (7a) by Y(/) gives the following result:\n\n\u00c9(t 19.36\n\n\u2014\u2014 mA \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 - 0473.\n\nY() Y()\nBoth Oliver and Enthoven have observed that the borrowing-income ratio\nhas been rising at a decreasing (\"absolute\") rate since 1946.

The\nrestaurants are of two types: those listed A - M are large, fairly complete,\nfamily-eating establishments, those listed N - V are smaller, quick-snack\nplaces and have correspondingly smaller investment and sales. The company\nis very careful to measure profit in exactly the same way under either type of\nmanagement. Profit is defined as revenue less all relevant expenses except\nmanager's salary and income tax; this means the company-manager figure for\nprofit is identical to the profit earned by the franchisee-owner. The restaurants\nare located in all parts of the United States, and are of varying size and ten-\nure-of-establishment, so even within similar types of restaurant there is con-\nsiderable variation in sales. In some cases, as can be seen from the table, fran-\nchisee-ownership (F.O.) preceded company-manager supervision (C.M.); in\nsome cases F.O. followed C.M.; in some cases there was a sequence of changes\nfrom F.O. to C.M. and back to F.O. In short, the situations cover all condi-\ntions and circumstances faced by the parent comapny.\n\nThose following general conclusions can be drawn from a study of Table 1.\n\n(a) Out of 22 restaurants where the type of management changed, the\nshifts in profit margins were adverse to company managers except in three\ncases.\n\n(b) Considering every case where the C.M. followed an F.O., weekly sales\nwere, on average, 99.6 per cent of the sales rate achieved by the F.O. (If the\nspecial case where a C.M. operated a restaurant for only seven weeks that\nhappened to include a July 4th holiday is eliminated, the ratio is 92.7 per cent\nor sales dropped 7.3 per cent.

Because the management of this company has\nconfidence in its ability to guide the franchisee, and because of the franchi-\nsor's desire to have a uniformly good reputation that will be associated with\nevery eating place despite the fact that each is operated by a different owner,\nthe parent company provides a great deal of direction. The details are too\nlengthy to enumerate but a few examples will suggest the extent of company\nsupervision. The parent company prescribes each item that will be on the\nmenu, and its head chef determines optimum recipes so that each franchisee-\noperator is told exactly how many pounds of coffee to use in the coffee-making\nequipment, how many slices of bacon go with an order of eggs, how many\nounces of meat to put in an entree, etc. Not only are the menus and recipes\nstandardized, all ingredients, down to napkins and tableware, are supplied to\nthe franchisee-operators by the parent company. A service manual used at\neach restaurant standardizes service. For example, when a waitress approaches\nthe table for the first time her introductory remarks are specified exactly.\nEach unit operates from a company-designed restaurant, occupied on a lease\nbasis. The parent company uses electronic computers to record sales and cost\nitems, and relieves the franchisee of practically all bookkeeping details by col-\nlecting weekly all expense and revenue records. The franchisor pays the item-\nized bills for the franchisee so that the franchisee-operator is only required, so\nfar as bookkeeping is concerned, to deposit his cash receipts daily and sign\nthree checks per week\u2014the amount of each check representing the total for\nthree major cost categories, labor, supplies, and taxes. In short, the accounting\nrecords for each restaurant are completely uniform, and so handled as to re-\nlieve the franchisee of almost all detail. The management of the franchising\ncompany believes, in fact, that its operations are so thoroughly supervised and\norganized that a franchisee (who typically pays approximately $30,000 for\nthe privilege of becoming a franchisee in a large restaurant and $10,000 in a\nsnack shop) is selected only from people who have not had experience in the\nrestaurant industry. The operating company has found that those with prior\nrestaurant experience are likely to think they know so much about the busi-\nness that they try to install practices other than those specified by the franchi-\nsor.\n\nThe parent company prefers to have each of its outlets operated by a fran-\nchisee-owner, who is an independent businessman legally as well as in terms of\nhis remuneration. But from time to time the company finds it necessary to op-\nerate a franchise outlet itself. The franchising contract contains a provision\nallowing the franchisee to terminate his franchise and be repaid his original\ninvestment; also the franchisor-parent company has the right to terminate,\nwith a similar repayment clause, if it can be proved that the franchisee has\nnot been living up to food and service standards prescribed in the original\ncontract. As a matter of practice, termination by the franchisor has proved\ndifficult, so most of the situations where a franchisee owner quits arise from\ndeath, illness, or other personal reasons on the part of the franchisee. Until\nsuch time as the company can find a new franchisee who will own and operate\nthe restaurant it is necessary for the company to continue the operation itself.\nFor this purpose it assigns to the restaurant a manager from a group who have\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n", "1254\n"], "2": ["'The purpose of this paper is to report findings that are especially notewor-\nthy because they involve an opportunity to test the '*X-efficiency\" hypothesis\nunder well-controlled conditions involving 22 separate restaurants, and the re-\nsults are determinant and meaningful in reinforcing the evidence cited by Lei-\nbenstein regarding the impact of managerial performance on efficiency of busi-\nness firms.

They include such problems as: How to compare output when the\nproduct mix differs; how to measure the quality of output; how to isolate the\nimpact created by such things as new equipment; how to adjust for the fact\nthat the use of raw materials and fuel per unit of output may not be standard-\nized.\n\nThe authors cited by Leibenstein were certainly aware of the difficulties, so\na sampling of their studies contains such cautionary remarks as: *This meth-\nod gives an essentially crude comparison of output per head\" [4, p. 2]. *The\nresults . . . may be taken as a rough measure of organizational input inasmuch\nas other factors were, to a large degree, constant\" [2, p. 303]. *But the en-\nquiries were handicapped in all cases by the fact that the fundamental\nchanges had been made before any steps could be taken to obtain a first-hand\naccount of the position before incentives were introduced\" [1, p. 88]. *AI-\nthough the choice of industries has been governed by the need to ensure some\ndegree of accuracy for these estimates, there is nevertheless the possibility of\nserious errors.

While estimates obtained for\nthe cost of capital by MM have some intuitive appeal, we conclude, on the\nbasis of the work reported here, that these results are to be attributed more to\ncircumstances prevailing at the time of the MM study than to the theoretical\nconsistency of the model employed.\n\nIn this paper we report the results of an extension of the analysis used by\nMM to the years 1955 and 1958-64 inclusive.

It is also true that for corporations in\ngeneral the expected return on additional assets has some correlation with\nthe return on existing assets. For utilities, regulated as they are to earn a\npredetermined rate of return on assets, the expected rate of return on invest-\nment is exactly the same as the return on assets, if the regulation is per-\nfectly efficient and if the predetermined rate is not expected to change.\nHence, the correlation of (1\u20147) X/A with super growth should compare\nfavorably with that of A4/A.\n\nWith the coefficient of (1\u20147) X/A reflecting the influence of super growth\nas well as current earnings on the value of a firm, its coefficient, a, should\noverestimate the value of 1/p, and the estimate of p should be too low.\nMN's data bear this out. It is generally accepted that when super growth\nopportunities are present, the earnings yield, Y/S, is below p, the cost of\nequity capital, i.e., the return investors require on a company's common\nstock. The striking illustrations are Xerox and IBM. However, in Table 8\nof MM's paper we find that, instead their estimates of p are below Y/S.\nIn 1954, for example, Y/S \u2014.066 and 1/a; \u2014.051.\n\nIn conclusion, to go from either equation (1) or (2) to approximations of\nthe average cost of capital for an industry requires a more effective means\nfor isolating the influence of super growth opportunities on a firm's value\nthan that used by MM in equation (3). If this is not possible, some other\nmeans than equation (3) should be used to estimate p. One alternative is to\nuse the sum of the dividend yield and the expected rate of growth in the\ndividend. As I have shown [6, Ch. 4], under reasonable assumptions this\nquantity is the rate of return investors require on a share, and under MM's\ndividend rate theorem, it is equal to p, the cost of equity capital.\n\nMynon J.

It is possible that for some\npurposes MN''s constant cost of capital might serve as a satisfactory ap-\nproximation\u2014unsatisfactory for a corporation considering a change in its\nfinancing policy or in the level of its investment\u2014but satisfactory for rep-\nresenting the average cost of capital for an entire industry, using equation\n(3) for nonregulated industries and equation (8) for regulated ones.\n\nHowever, the cost of capital approximations in the MM paper cast doubt\non the usefulness of their model even for this limited purpose. Using equa-\ntion (3), MM found that the average tax-adjusted cost of capital for the\nelectric utility industry was .046, .045 and .039 in 1957, 1956 and 1954.\nThese figures were only slightly higher than AAA bond rates for those\nyears, and it is very hard to believe that the cost of capital for the industry\nwas that low. It is possible, but not likely, that using equation (8) would\nresult in higher and more reasonble averages, but it is more likely that the\ntreatment of growth in the MM model is responsible for the substantial\ndownward bias in their cost of capital approximations.\n\nIn deriving equations (1) and (2), MM [13] [14] postulated a corporation\nfor which the expected earnings are the same in every future period. This is\na permissible assumption if the corporation is not expected to invest at a\nrate of return greater than its cost of capital, and if, therefore, its earnings are\nonly expected to grow due to retention. However, it is not a correct assump-\ntion if earnings are expected to grow additionally due to investment op-\nportunities with a rate of return above its cost of capital. To differentiate\nthis additional source of growth from that due merely to retention of earn-\nings, it will be called *super growth\" in the following discussion.\n\nIt is perfectly clear that most corporations\u2014even utilities\u2014 have super\ngrowth investment opportunities and that the extent to which any corpora-\ntion has such opportunities materially influences its market value. Con-\nsequently, to test the theory represented by equation (2), MM were forced\nto add a variable to account for super growth, and they defined this variable\nas follows. If a corporation is expected to make investments in operating\nassets which have a tax-adjusted rate of return of p*, and p* is greater than\nits cost of capital, C, this expectation will raise its market value. To rep-\nresent these growth opportunities, MM suggested the quantity\nAAT (p* \u2014 C)/C(14-C). In other words, the corporation is expected to in-\nvest AA per period for T' years at a rate of return p* and obtain, thereby, a\nperiodic rent of AA(p*\u2014 C). Division by C/(1--C) converts the periodic\nrent to its present value. However, measurement problems forced MM to\nsubstitute growth in assets, A4/A, as a proxy for the above complex of\nvariables that determine supergrowth.\n\nThe rationale for using asset growth as a measure of super growth is the\nfact that a firm's investment rate should be correlated with its opportu-\nnities to invest at a rate of return greater than its cost of capital. However,\nthis correlation may be relatively weak, particularly in the case of utilities,\nwhere investment is governed in part by the public interest.

Assuming that the dividend policy hypoth-\nesis may be tested with V\u20147D and not S the dependent variable, the\ndividend policy variable should be the relation between the dividend and\nwhat the dividend would be if the average fraction of common earnings were\npaid in dividends. However, ((1\u20147)X/4A is not the average fraction of\ncommon earnings paid in dividends. It approximates the average fraction\nof earnings on all assets after taxes paid in dividends.? The result is not\nmerely a poor approximation of the relevant dividend policy variable, but\n\u00e0 biased approximation that reduces the correlation with the dependent\nvariable. To illustrate this bias, consider two firms with the same values\nfor (1\u20147)X and for DIV/Y but with different leverage rates. The difference\nin leverage rates will make their values of Y different, and the firm with\nthe higher leverage rate will have the smaller value for DIV.

True Expected Earnings\n\nBecause the coefficients of their dividend rate variable obtained by 2SLS\nwere all negative and not significant, MM interpreted the data as evidence\nin support of their dividend policy hypothesis and as a further demonstra-\ntion of the advantage of 2SLS.

To avoid error in the reported earnings and to obtain true\nexpected earnings, MM adopted the hypothesis that the latter are a func-\ntion of the variables in equation (4), and so they used, in the second-stage\nregression, the computed value of (1\u20147)X from equation (4) in equation\n(3). However, an inspection of Table 2 in their paper [12, p. 361] reveals\nthat the dominant explanatory variable in equation (4) is the dividend.\nHence, in the second-stage regression their error free value of (1\u20147)X\ndiffers little from a linear function of the dividend.\n\nFurthermore, two other explanatory variables, D/A and P/4A are highly\n"], "7": ["\" Empirical studies by Benishay [2], Durand [5], and Gordon [6, Chs. 11 and 12] are among\nthose which found that the dividend rate influences the market value of a firm's stock.\n\n* This equation still leaves something to be desired for establishing whether or not the rate of\nreturn investors require on a share and the cost of capital are independent of the dividend rate.\nFor a model designed to test these theorems and the results obtained, see Brigham and Gordon\n\n[4].\n", "COMMUNICATIONS 1273\n\nequation (3).

The Dividend Rate Theorem\n\nThe MM position on dividend policy is that Under ideal conditions of\nperfect capital markets, rational investor behavior, and no tax discrimina-\ntion... a firm's... dividend policy will have no effect whatsoever on the\ncurrent market value of its shares or on its cost of capital; and that despite\nthe impressions of some writers to the contrary .. . this conclusion is\nequally valid whether one is considering a world of certainty or of uncer-\ntainty\" [12, p. 345].

The Leverage Theorem\n\nUnder the reasoning that led to equation (3) the subtraction of 7D from\nV completely accounts for the influence of leverage on the value of a\ncorporation. Accordingly, with debt and preferred stock added to the\nequation's independent variables, their coefficients should not differ sig-\nnificantly from zero. This is what MM found with their electric utility\nsample. However, using a utility sample actually gave results that were\nagainst their leverage theorem, since regulatory agencies treat the income\ntax as an expense in determining the income a utility is allowed to earn.\nOnly if their sample had consisted of nonregulated industrial companies\nwould their results have been evidence in support of their theorem.*\n\nTo see this point, recall [14, p. 435] that the proof of MM's leverage\ntheorem under a corporate income tax began with the statement that\n\n(5) X'\u2014(1\u20140)(X\u2014-R)-R\u2014-(\u201472X-r7R,\n\nwith X \u2014 earnings before interest and taxes, R \u2014iD \u2014 interest on outstanding\ndebt, and X*\u2014 earnings after taxes and before interest. Their use of this\nexpression to prove that equation (2) and not equation (1) holds in the\npresence of a corporate income tax presumes that X is an exogenous random\nvariable, independent of the corporation's tax and leverage rates. As a\nresult, since X is independent of 7 and R, and since R increases with leverage\nX' increases with R.\n\nIn contrast, for a regulated utility X* is the exogenous random variable.\nThe regulatory agency sets the rates charged consumers in order to provide\nthe utility with an earnings after taxes and before interest rate of return\nthat the agency considers correct.5 Consequently, the correct expression\nfor X* in the case of a public utility should be\n\n(6) X'zaA,\n\nwhere &' is the expected after tax and before interest rate of return the\nutility is allowed to earn. It follows then that a change in a utility's tax\n\n* There is one slight qualification to this conclusion. Under the traditional view (see Barges\n[1] V rises with leverage up to a leverage rate considered prudent and falls sharply when the\nleverage rate passes this level. Hence, it would be necessary to show that few if any corpora-\ntions in the sample are not prudent.\n\n5 MM recognized this fact [12, fn. 12, pp. 342-43], but its implications for the model they\nshould have used to test their leverage theorem with a utility sample went unrecognized. I\nhave recently become involved in a public utility rate case, and in all the testimony on this and\nother cases I have read, the rate of return in question is earnings with taxes excluded and\ninterest included divided by total assets. See also Bonbright [3, pp. 242-43 and 404].\n\n* The switching or arbitrage operations by which MM proved their leverage theorem as-\nsumes two firms identical in every respect but their leverage rates. In particular two firms in\nthe same risk class have the same X and different leverage rates.

Objectives of the MM Paper\n\nOne objective of the MM paper was to demonstrate the advantage of\ntwo-stage least squares (2SLS) over direct least squares (DLS) as a means\nfor estimating the parameters of equation (3). Using DLS, as proved\nto be significantly positive, as shown in the first panel of Table 1. However,\nin theory ao should be zero, and MM reasoned that a possible explanation\nfor its not being zero is the presence of errors in the observed values of\n(1\u20147)X as measurements of true expected earnings. In the event of such\nerrors, ao would be biased upward and a, would be biased downward. One\nmeans of dealing with the problem, assuming the explanation is correct, is\nto constrain a9\u20140, and the resultant parameter estimates appear in the\nsecond panel of Table 1.\n\nHowever, the best way to eliminate bias in the parameter estimates is to\neliminate errors in the measurement of (1\u20147)X and MM employed 2SLS\nto do this.

The resultant\nparameter estimates for equation (3) appear in the third and fourth panels\nof Table 1.\n\nAs the third panel shows, the 2SLS unconstrained estimates of as are not\nsignificantly different than zero. From this MM inferred that (1\u20147)X is\nsubject to measurement error as true expected earnings and that 2SLS im-\nproves the parameter estimates by reducing this error. My interpretation\nof the data presented in panel three is different: the net effect of the 2SLS\n\n?

The MM Model\n\nIn their classic 1958 paper [13], MM demonstrated that under certain\nassumptions the value of a corporation is independent of its leverage and\ndividend rates. That is, with S \u2014 value of its stock, D \u2014 value of its debt,\nV \u2014 value of its outstanding securities, X \u2014expected earnings before in-\nterest on its assets, and p\u2014 capitalization rate,\n\n(1) Sc DzV-X/p.\n\nThe capitalization rate is a function solely of the corporation's nonfinancial\nrisk, and for each corporation in a risk class, V will be the same multiple,\n1/p, of X regardless of how the corporation is financed. The assumptions on\nwhich this theorem rests are: (1) investors are indifferent between leverage\non personal and on corporate account; (2) there is no corporate income tax;\n(3) stockholders are indifferent as to how a corporation allocates its income\nbetween dividends and retention; and (4) corporations do not have in-\nvestment opportunities with a rate of return greater than p.\n\nIn a subsequent note [14] that corrected the treatment of the corporate\nincome tax in the above paper, MM showed that with corporate income\ntaxes at the rate of r, and with p on an after tax basis, equation (1) becomes\n\n(1\u201427)X\n(2) SHHDzy-\u2014\u2014\u2014r:D\np\n\nX now equals expected earnings before interest and taxes. Given X, V\nincreases with the leverage rate because interest is a tax exempt expense\nand because the government is certain to bear the fraction r of any losses.\n\nTo test this theory, MM employed in [12] the following model!

Theirs may perhaps have the advantage of not requiring a prior\nconfrontation of the leverage and dividend issues; but, if this is an advan-\ntage, it is obtained only at the cost of having a less useful estimate\u2014a single\naverage point estimate rather than the cost of capital function derivable by\nour procedure. In any event, there is no necessity for researchers in this\narea to restrict themselves to any one method. The two approaches are\ncomplementary and anyone undertaking a study along our lines would be\nwell advised to check his results by alternative approaches, including pos-\nsibly that suggested by Crockett-Friend.\n\nAs for the problem of controlling for the measurement errors in earnings,\nthe instrumental variable approach would appear to be a useful tool in\nvaluation studies, though, as the RMH results indicate, there is nothing\nautomatic about it. Those planning to take up where we left off would be\nwise to devote considerable thought to the selection of the instrumental\nvariables and especially to expanding the set of such variables considerably\nbeyond the basic few we used so that adequate tests of specifications can\nbe made (particularly tests involving the value of shares rather than the\nvalue of the firm).\n\nFinally there is the vexing question of growth. Here there would cer-\ntainly be agreement that the particular approximation to growth potential\nthat we used is likely to be of only very limited usefulness as we conceded\nin our original paper. But this is no reason to despair; our variable, after\nall, was about the simplest possible approximation one might make; and it\nis at least encouraging that nature does not seem to be so hostile as to rule\nout simple methods even in easy cases such as ours.

We chose to measure\npast growth by the growth in assets over the previous 4 years or the ratio\n(A,\u2014 A 4)/ (A4), because, as we candidly stated, this particular measure\n\"happens to yield consistently higher gross and net correlations with total\nvalue than other simple smoothings we have tried\" (p. 345). However, we\nwrongly stated that the measure used was (4,\u2014 A. 5)/A4,.,.5 RMH dis-\ncovered our error, and confirmed that the four-year measure actually used\ndid perform a good deal better than the five-year measure. But they then\nproceeded merrily to use the latter, less effective, measure we erroneously\nsaid we had used, labelling it *correct growth,\" as though this particular\napproximation was an essential logical implication of our model. The fact of\nthe matter is that we settled on our various approximations only after facing\na large number of empirical questions. The RMH results suggest that, if we\nhad looked at their data and period rather than ours, then our answers to\nsome of these questions would have been different. But we fail to see how\nthis entitles them to reject the answers we did find for our sample and the\napproximations based on those answers\u2014unless, of course, they are also\nprepared to argue that approximations not valid everywhere are not valid\nanywhere.!5\n\nIt might be useful in closing to attempt to summarize where we think\nmatters now stand. In critical exchanges of this kind, in which so much of\nthe emphasis is inevitably on technical details, it is easy to lose perspective\nand to overlook such progress toward agreement as has been made. In\nterms of substantive findings, for example, we feel there should now be\nagreement, at least, that our estimates of the cost of capital have been con-\nstructed with due care; that the more obvious sources of bias have been\nchecked out; and that the numbers themselves, properly interpreted, are\nneither manifestly inconsistent with a priori expectations nor with the re-\nsults obtained by other estimating techniques.\n\nOn the matter of the leverage and dividend tests, we would certainly\nagree with our critics that our results do not close the issue. The problems\nhere are far too difficult to be settled by any one empirical study. We trust\nthey will equally agree that our results show at least that the issue is still\nopen.\n\n35 Tn the tests actually presented we restated the growth ratio in annual terms; and, misled\nby our notational error we multiplied the four-year growth by 1 instead of 1. This scaling error,\nof cours, is of no great consequence and leaves all the other coefficients, as well as the /-ratio of\nthe growth coefficient itself, unaffected. It does, however, affect the attempted **unscrambling\"\nof the growth term presented in our Table 11 by leading to an overstatement of the implied\nhorizons.\n\n16 That they may very well have some such principle in mind is suggested also by their dis-\ncussion of their experiment\" with the growth variable in their Table 3. They find that split-\nting the sample on the basis of growth makes for no significant difference in any of the coeffi-\ncients for 1957, which is one of our sample years. It does, however, make a considerable differ-\nence in 1961. From this they conclude not that our approximation works better in 1957 than\n1961, or even that it doesn't work at all in 1961; but rather that \"this particular error in speci-\nfication is so fundamental that it calls into question the value of the model itself as an estimat-\ning tool.\"\n"], "11": ["M These estimates which are alluded to in their section Leverage and Value\" were reported\nin a preliminary version of their comment circulated as Research Report 7118R, Graduate\nSchool of Business, Stanford University, Table 6.

It is hard to see how,\nconfronted with these data, any model\u2014as long as it incorporated the view,\nby now widely accepted, that the cost of capital is closely related to the\nway the market capitalizes earnings, with some adjustment for growth\u2014\ncould fail to yield the conclusion that the cost of capital must have fallen\ndramatically over this interval. Indeed, when the authors discarded our\nmodel and tried to estimate directly a capitalization rate for returns to\nequity capital they found a drop in this rate between 1957 and 1964 of some\n36 per cent!!^ This conclusion seems rather unavoidable\u2014unless there is\nsomething wrong with the basic data.\n\nAt least two possible sources of bias come readily to mind. In our study\nin computing V we endeavored to estimate debt at market value. Because\nthis procedure is very time consuming RHM used the book value of the\ndebt. Since long-term interest rates rose between 1957 and 1964 one might\nexpect some tendency for the market value of debt to fall relative to the\nbook value, imparting an upward bias to their estimates of V. But we\ndoubt that this bias could be very significant (especially since the increase\nin the long rate was largely over by 1959).\n\nA potentially far more serious source of trouble is in the treatment of\n\"charges for deferred taxes\" in the measurement of earnings. These charges\nessentially represent the discrepancy between taxes actually paid and the\nhigher taxes that would have been paid in the absence of various incentive\ntax measures permitting a faster depreciation of physical assets. There are\nstrong reasons for holding that these charges should be added back to re-\nported net of tax earnings in measuring the earnings the market capitalizes.\nAs indicated, we experimented with this concept of earnings in our own\nanalysis (see p. 356). But we ended by using the reported profits which gave\na somewhat better fit, on the consideration that the relevant tax provisions\nwere relatively new, and quite possibly, even by 1957, investors had not\nseen through this accounting complexity. But we would rather expect that\nin later years the market would have learned to make the needed adjust-\nment, especially as the size of the adjustment became more important\nwith the revised depreciation guidelines and the investment credit. Thus\nthe measure of earnings which we found adequate for our sample period\nand which was presumably used also by RMH may well have become\nincreasingly downward biased.\n\nThese remarks about the measurement of earnings serve also to point up\nwhat in our view is the fatal shortcoming of the RMH tests, robbing them\nof their potential usefulness. The authors fail to appreciate that the concepts\nof the model\u2014especially such concepts as the market's evaluation of future\nearnings and growth potential\u2014do not have exact observable counterparts.\nThe best that can be done is to approximate them somehow from the data\nat hand. A particularly glaring illustration of this failure is provided by the\n"], "10": ["COMMUNICATIONS 1297\n\nanother sample of public utility data running from 1954 to 1964, in which\ngreat pains were taken to follow slavishly the details of our definitions and\nprocedures.\n\nFor the period where the RMH data overlap ours (1954, 1956, and 1957),\nit turns out that their results are quite close to ours, and much closer still\nfor their special MM test sample in 1957, a sample based on precisely the\nsame firms and definitions we used.\" Naturally, we are grateful for this\nindependent audit and gratified by the closeness of the agreement during\nour sample period. This does at least remove one possible suspicion about\nthe source of our \"peculiar\" results! However, as they extend the tests\nbeyond our sample period, their results change quite substantially. In par-\nticular, the coefficient of the earnings variable keeps rising, implying a drop\nin the cost of capital between 1957 and 1964 by some 25 per cent, to an im-\nplausibly low value.? Unable to offer any explanation for this striking\ndifference in performance before and after 1957, they call a plague on both\nhouses and conclude that *'none of the estimates of the cost of capital re-\nported either by MM or here can be considered reliable estimates of the\ncost of capital to electric utility firms.\"\n\nActually these results hold little surprise to anyone who takes the pain to\ninspect the behavior of the sample means reported in their Appendix B. The\npuzzle is right in these basic data and not in the results one obtains by\napplying our specific approach to them. For the fact of the matter is that\nbetween 1957 and 1964 their measure of market value relative to the book\nvalue of assets rises by a hefty 43 per cent (from .80 to 1.28) while at the\nsame time the measure of the rate of earnings on assets rises a modest 14\nper cent (from .051 to .058).?

Apparently RMH neglected to make the necessary correction for the standard errors ex-\nplained in our footnote 39. If so, all the standard errors and values of R reported in their Tables\n1and 2 are also erroneous and conclusions based on them, e.g., in their first section, are unreli-\nable.\n\n? RMH also find that, when they estimate the equation in nonhomogeneous form, the\nconstant term which was zeroish to slightly positive for our sample period becomes negative\nand very sizably so. The only suggestion they offer for the absurdly large negative intercepts is\nthat they **may be reflecting determinants of corporate value omitted from the MM structural\nequation.\" As far as we can see, however, the major difference between our structural equation\nand anyone else's would be in our omission of leverage and dividends. It seems hard to believe\nthat those omissions could produce anomalies of the order of magnitude found\u2014for despite all\nthe controversy, the various theories are not t/iat different or the issues would have been settled\nlong ago. But RMH didn't even try to eliminate some of these more obvious candidates.\n\nWe suspect that these anomalies might be traced to inadequacies of the instrumental vari-\nables in later years, a suspicion reinforced by the fact that the constant term takes on its\nlargest negative values just when the value of R reported by them for Table 1 is lowest. But\nsince RMH present neither standard errors for the constant term, nor first stage regressions,\nnor direct least square results we have no way of checking out this hunch.\n\n95 \"These figures relate to market value and earnings adjusted for leverage.

His position boils down to the following: the hypothesis\nthat a high payout increases the market value of shares implies that total\nvalue should be favorably affected by the relation of dividends to profits,\nnot to tax-adjusted earnings. If there were no debt or if leverage were\nroughly the same for all firms, then a high level of dividends relative to\nearnings would also imply a high payout. But leverage is not constant and\nsince we fail to control for it (except implicitly via the 7D component of the\ndependent variable) our test will tend to attenuate the coefficient of divi-\ndends, biasing it towards zero and understating its significance.\n\nIn principle, we would accept this argument, but it clearly cannot ac-\ncount for our results. For one thing, it could not explain the consistently\nnegalive signs of the coefficients in the more relevant two-stage test since\nthis type of bias can push an estimated coefficient toward zero, but not\nchange its sign. Moreover we too were concerned about possible downward\nbias in the dividend coefficient for related but somewhat different reasons\n(see our footnote 46). Accordingly, we ran a check test in which we extended\nthe two-stage approach to the dividend variable as well as to the earnings\nvariable. The result was that in all 3 years the dividend coefficients were\nless negative than those of Table 5, and in 1957 the coefficient was actually\npositive though only of the same small order of magnitude as in the direct\nleast squares test. Although these results tend to confirm the existence of\nbias in the coefficients of Table 5 they also show that the bias is not large\nenough to force any modification of our main conclusion, namely that the\ndata show no sign of a strong, positive effect of dividends of the kind\nhypothesized by Gordon.!?\n\nThe RMH Paper\n\nWe now turn briefly to the paper of Robichek, McDonald, and Higgins\n(hereafter RMH). This is basically a replication of some of our tests to\n\n? Another and quite different line of attack on our dividend results is contained in Section V\nof the Gordon paper. That argument, however, despite the very positive tone with which it is\npresented and the frequent use of such terms as \"hence\" and \"consequently,\" is just hand-\nwaving and will not stand up to any serious scrutiny.\n\n1? The reader may wonder why we did not simply present a test in terms of the value of the\nshares, profits, and dividends that would have met Gordon's objection directly. The answer, as\nwe pointed out (see our footnote 48), is that it was not possible to construct such a test given\nthe necessity of using a two-stage instrumental variable approach and given the limited set of\ninstrumental variables we had at hand. For, in an equation with the value of shares as de-\npendent variable it is essential to include both debt and preferred stock as independent vari-\nables in the structural equation. To include dividends as well would mean that the only thing\nkeeping the second-stage computed profits variable from being an exact linear combination of\nthe other independent variables would be the constant term (included in the first stage and\nsuppressed in the second).

Actually the arbitrage argument from which we derived our\nbasic valuation equation for the case of a corporate income tax American-\nstyle does not make explicit reference to just what determines X. What\nwe do need to assume is that the random variable Z\u2014 X/X is the same for\nall firms in a risk class and hence in particular that it is independent of\nleverage (though not necessarily of tax rates). Under this assumption, as\nshown in [2] the distribution of X*/X* will depend on leverage and tax\nrates and in particular its variance will be reduced by leverage. Thus our\ntreatment of electric utilities as a risk class implicitly assumes that the\nrandom variable X/X is independent of leverage, and this assumption may\nappear somewhat questionable in the light of Gordon's observations about\nthe nature of regulation. On the other hand, Gordon's valuation formula is\nat least as doubtful. Indeed, for his reasoning to be valid it is required not\nonly that before-tax earnings X should be a linearly decreasing function of\nleverage, as indicated by his formula (7); it would also have to be true that\nthe distribution of the random variable G2 X7/X* is independent of\nleverage. This property cannot readily be deduced from the nature of\nregulation. In fact, it has some peculiar implications about the modus\noperandi of regulation, e.g., that it would make the uncertainty of before-\ntax earnings an increasing function of leverage.8\n\nOn the whole one might be inclined to conclude that a reasonable approx-\nimation to the applicable valuation formula might lie somewhere between\nours and Gordon's. But there are several pieces of evidence suggesting that\nin fact the relevant approximation is much closer to ours than to his. In\nthe first place, if regulation actually aimed at, and succeeded in, enforcing\nhis equation (6) then X*\u20147R/A would have a strong and stable negative\ncorrelation with D/A. Yet the correlation varies widely from year to year\nbeing noticeably negative only in 1957 and actually being positive, though\nsmall, in 1954. (See our appendix Table B2, p. 389.) Gordon's interpretation\nwould also imply that leverage obtained via non-tax-deductible preferred\nstock would be equivalent from the stockholders' point of view with that\nobtained from debt. Hence if, as Gordon argues, stockholders really do\nprefer leverage per se, over and above any of its tax effects, we should\nexpect to see that preference demonstrated in the case of preferred stock\nas well as debt. Yet, as we noted in connection with our Table 4, the coeffi-\ncients of preferred stock in our test equation were neither significantly\ndifferent from zero nor even consistently of the same sign.

Let us instead turn directly to\nthe results of the calculation on which they base their conclusion that our\nestimates are significantly understated.\n\nAt this point we must call attention to one seemingly small, but actually\nquite important, difference between the two methods of presenting the\nfinal estimates. In constructing their overall weighted average cost of cap-\nital from the separate yields they used market-value weights. Our estimate,\non the other hand, weights the debt component by its book-value. Of the\ntwo weighting schemes, we feel that the book-value weights are the more\nappropriate ones to use when talking about the cost of new financing (as we\nindicated, p. 378); but that is not the issue. The critical point is simply that\nthe weights have to be the same in both estimates so as to permit a meaning-\nful comparison. Adjusting their estimates to ours by using book-value\nweights (and using the actual tax rate of 52 per cent, as we did, rather than\ntheir 50 per cent) we find that their best estimate of the average before-tax\ncost of capital for the years 1954-57 now becomes 9.7 per cent (as against\ntheir original 10.7 per cent); and their lower-bound estimate becomes\n8.9 per cent (as against their original 9.5 per cent). By contrast, our sup-\nposedly *low\" estimates of the before-tax cost of capital were shown to be\n9.8 per cent for 1957, 9.4 per cent for 1956, and 7.9 per cent for 1954.\n\nThat the Crockett-Friend rough estimates do not turn out to be signifi-\ncantly different from ours should not really be surprising. There were a\nnumber of clues in the numbers presented that should have forewarned\nthem.

Consulting our Table 9, they could have seen that the average\nrequired equity yields implicit in our calculation (the sum of the average\nearnings yield and the growth effect, as reported in Table 9) came to 8.4\nper cent for 1957, 7.8 per cent in 1956, and 6.9 per cent in 1954.5 Perhaps\nthey might have wanted to quarrel with our figure for 1954, although we\ncould also point to the fact that our 1954 figure is by no means far out\nof line with interest rates during the period which were also quite low by\nlater standards.

For, it is conceded that the growth com-\nponent arises from an excess of the rate of return on investments over the\ncost of capital. Hence, the presence of important growth opportunities\nwould mean that the rates of return allowed by the regulatory authorities\nwere significantly higher than the cost of capital.

Thus, if we have substantially underestimated the growth\ncomponent as claimed, it is hard to see how the cost of capital could have\nbeen appreciably higher at least in 1956 and 1957 than our estimate of\nabout 4.6 per cent.\n\nSumming up, we feel that Crockett and Friend have not succeeded in\nshowing any fatal flaw in our procedures which would permit our estimates\nto be dismissed out of hand or which would even establish a priori a pre-\nsumption of serious bias. This is not to claim, of course, that our procedures\nare unexceptionable. There may well be more insidious and unsuspected\nmechanisms at work which have led us to underestimate substantially the\ncost of capital to utilities during this period. Before speculating about\nthese, however, it is worthwhile to ask whether there is any evidence that\nour estimates really are so wide of the mark as to have to be explained\naway.\n\nAre Our Estimates Really Far Too Low?\n\nBoth Gordon and Crockett-Friend are convinced that they have such\nevidence. Gordon's is that our estimates of p are consistently below the\nearning-price ratio, whereas \"it is generally accepted that when super\ngrowth opportunities [valuable growth, in our terminology] are present the\nearning yield, Y/S, is below p, the cost of equity capital.\" But this evidence\nis worthless since it compares the required rate of return for a firm financed\nentirely by equity funds with the observed yield on stock, a comparison\nwhich is especially treacherous for a highly levered industry like electric\nutilities. This point is brought out in our Table 9 which was devoted pre-\ncisely to clarifying the relation between the two measures. The presence of\nvaluable growth does of course tend to depress market yields on stock\u2014to\nthe tune of some 20 per cent in 1957\u2014 but this effect is more than offset by\nthe very high leverage which results in the observed average yield on stock\nexceeding p, the yield on an unlevered stock, by some 25 per cent.\n\nA more promising and enlightening way of assessing our estimates is to\ncompare them with the results of other \"sensible\" methods of estimation.\n\"This is the task undertaken by Crockett and Friend in the last half of their\n"], "4": ["3 Our results using a continuous size variable are thus in conflict with some results reported\nby Robichek e al. They find, for 1957 and 1961, significantly lower earnings coefficients for\nfirms above the sample mean in size than for those below the mean (i.e., curvature in the re-\nverse direction from ours and from the direction that would be expected a priori). The fact that\nour continuous size variable shows orthodox curvature would seem to suggest that their\nreverse curvature from splitting the sample, far from providing a more reliable picture of the\nrelation between value and size in the industry as a whole, probably comes from forcing the\nseparate slopes to fit some conspicuous deviants at either extreme.\n\n^ [tis perhaps also worth noting that, if in fact the rate at which the market capitalizes earn-\ning rises with the size of assets, then the yield required of an incremental investment will not\nbe the \"average\" cost of capital. It will be instead a \"marginal\" cost, which is below the\naverage as it reflects the favorable effect that the addition to assets will have on the capitaliza-\ntion of earnings from the initial assets (just as, for a monopolist, the incremental revenue result-\ning from an increase in sales is less than the average revenue). If one is prepared to regard our\nformulation as a bearable approximation to the effect of size in the relevant range, then the\nmarginal capitalization rate is precisely ai, of our equation (14), and therefore the relevant\nmarginal cost of capital is that given in our tables, without any need to correct for size. That is\nwhy we never expressed the capitalization factor itself as a function of size, and only took size\ninto account in the tables showing the components of valuation for the \"average\" firm.\n", "COMMUNICATIONS 1291\n\nleading to any serious distortion we also ran check tests using a continuous\nsize variable (specifically, the log of total assets). As we reported in our paper\n(see footnote 51) neither the relative importance (nor direction) of the size\nterm nor the values of the other coefficients were noticeably affected.?\n\nStill, Crockett and Friend are correct in asserting that the measures given\nin our tables tend to understate the average cost of capital in that they are\nderived from capitalization rates which, as we acknowledged, apply only\nto firms of infinite size. The average cost implied by our results for any\nspecified size of firm can be readily computed from our estimate of ao, the\ncoefficient of the size variable. But since our results indicate that the effect\nof size is rather small and because the firms in our sample are all relatively\nlarge, correction for size cannot affect our estimates materially. In par-\nticular, the difference between the capitalization rate at infinite size and\nthat corresponding to the mean value of the size variable in our sample in\neach of the three years is less than 3 per cent (cf. footnote 2 above). In\nterms of Crockett and Friend's Figure 1b, the difference between the slope\nof the line AB and that of the line OC is quite tiny within the range of\nsizes included in our sample.*\n\nFinally, there is the question of the variable we have used to measure\nvaluable future growth opportunities and which comes in for some criticism\nin each of the three comments. The problem of measuring this important,\nbut not directly observable, quantity is a most complex and vexing one for\nwhich no one to our knowledge has yet been able to offer a completely\nsatisfactory solution. We were the first to point out (cf. n. 17, p. 345) that\nour own approach suffered from shortcomings which would make its general\napplicability very questionable. And while we argued that these short-\ncomings would be at a minimum for our industry over the specific period\nstudied, we would not assert that they are altogether absent. In particular,\nwe would not deny that in principle our approach could produce an upward\nbias in the coefficient of the earning variable, as suggested by Crockett and\nFriend, because the ratio of earnings to assets might be conveying informa-\n"], "3": ["The Supposed Biases in Our Estimating Procedures\n\nLet us first consider Crockett and Friend's list of \"substantial short-\ncomings in the statistical model of which [we] do not appear to be aware\"\nand which, they claim, have led us to underestimate substantially the cost\nof capital. One such is that our use of dividends, along with debt, and pre-\nferred stock as instrumental variables biases the earnings coefficient upward\n(and hence biases downward our estimate of the cost of capital) because of\na supposed \"negative correlation of dividends plus contractual disburse-\nments with risk.\" We fear that this criticism involves a failure to appreciate\nfully the properties of instrumental variables estimation. Furthermore, if it\nwere really true that an above-average pay-out and leverage is significantly\nassociated with below-average risk, leading to a more favorable capitaliza-\ntion of earnings and hence to a higher market value, then the tests of Tables\n4 and 5 in which these variables were introduced explicitly in addition to our\n\"computed earnings\" should have revealed at least some significant positive\neffects for these variables, contrary to what we actually found. However,\nthere is no need to argue the point along these lines. Anticipating that for\nany of a number of reasons some readers would be made uneasy by our\nchoice of instrumental variables and particularly by our use of dividends\nwe took the precaution of providing not one, but two supplementary tests.\nOne consisted of dropping dividends entirely from the list of instrumental\nvariables. As reported in footnote 41 the estimate of the cost of capital\nturned out to be almost identical. The second consisted of direct least\nsquares estimates using what we called the *yield formulation.\" This\nformulation, we showed, can surmount the problem of bias introduced by\nthe measurement error in earnings without recourse to instrumental vari-\nables, but it has other compensating disadvantages that we feel limit its\nusefulness to that of serving as a check test. The results of using this very\ndifferent type of test were quite close to our original estimates (cf. our\nTable 6 and surrounding text discussion) suggesting once again that if our\nestimates of the cost of capital are indeed too low, this cannot be attributed\neither to our instrumental variable approach or to the particular instrumen-\ntal variables we chose to use.\n\nAnother supposed shortcoming is our method of controlling for the\neffect of size on valuation. Crockett and Friend point out that this method\ncould lead to an overstatement of the average earnings coef\u00fccient if p\ndeclined sharply with size; and they recommend the use of an explicit size\nvariable to take this possibility into account. Actually, of course, our choice\nof procedure for controlling for size was not made casually or carelessly.\nWe did look first at the scatters of V on X; we could see no evidence of\nstrong curvature of the kind hypothesized in their Figure 1b. Nor does there\neven exist in this industry a relevant group of small firms lying far below\nthe sample range (i.e., to the left of X in their diagram). In any event, to\nmake doubly sure that our simple method of controlling for size was not\n", "for utilities during this period.

This critique, together with our reply, is in [1, pp. 257-67].\n\n? These figures can be obtained in a variety of ways. The simplest is to start with the cost of\nequity capital (as in Table 8) and make the size correction indicated in Table 9. The results for\nthe three years are .052, .061, and .064 respectively. To obtain the size-adjusted and tax-\nadjusted average cost of capital, multiply these figures by [1\u20147(D/4A)] using the value of \u00ab(D\n/A) already computed in Table 7, row 2. The results are .038, .045, and .047 respectively.\nFinally, dividing these figures, by .48 we arrive at the before-tax required yields given above.\n\nWe should like to take this opportunity to correct a few additional misprints that we have\nuncovered in the meantime. In Table 1, first panel, the entry for the constant term in column 1\nfor 1957 should read .0164 instead of .164. In Table 2, first panel, the entry for the constant\nterm in 1954 in column 1 should be .041 rather than .01; in the same row, next column, the\nparentheses should be removed from the entry (.0090); and in the second panel the debt coeffi-\ncient for 1957 should read \u2014.006 rather than \u2014 .066. Finally, the estimates of the time horizons\nfor growth given in Table II are somewhat too long. In this connection, see footnote 15 below.\n", "COMMUNICATIONS 1289\n\nconcept of income which we have dubbed \"'tax-adjusted earnings.\" This\nconcept is essentially an after-tax measure which also takes into account\nthe tax subsidy to debt, a subsidy which is very substantial indeed in\nthis industry because of the prevailing high levels of debt. Hence, our esti-\nmates are bound to seem low if gauged against other more familiar measures\nof yield which are not or cannot be similarly adjusted. Examples of just this\nsort of improper comparison are found in the present critique by Myron\nGordon (see his Section IV, 2nd par.) as well as in an earlier critique by\nIrwin Friend.!\n\nThe impression that our estimates are low is perhaps also reinforced by\nthe fact that the measure given in Table 10 as well as in other tables was\nnot adjusted for the effect of size of firm and hence applies strictly speaking\nonly to firms of infinite size. In our paper we did make some attempt to\nguard against these misunderstandings by also recasting our results in terms\nof the implied before-tax required yield for a firm of size equal to the \"aver-\nage\" of our sample. But this was done only in a footnote (n. 54, p. 380);\nand to make matters worse, the numbers we actually gave in that footnote\u2014\n.073, .087, and .090 respectively for 1954, 1956, and 1957\u2014are erroneous.\nThat there must have been something wrong with these numbers might\nhave been apparent to the reader since, the before-tax yield should equal\nour tax-adjusted yield of Table 10 divided by one minus the marginal tax\nrate, or .48. Thus, even without correction for the size effect, the figures of\nfootnote 54 should have been more than twice those reported in Table 10.\nHowever, since we failed to spot the error we can hardly blame anybody\nelse for doing the same. In any event, with the additional intended adjust-\nment for the effect of size, the correct estimates of the before-tax required\nyield implied by our results are .079, .094, and .098 for 1954, 1956, and 1957\nrespectively.?\n\nAll this is not to suggest, of course, that the widespread feeling that our\nestimates are unreasonably low, and that therefore something must be\nwrong with our approach, rest entirely on misunderstandings or on the\nmisprint in our footnote.

Particularly striking was the rise in the salary of the highest paid one-\ntenth of the economists who had salaries of $23,000 or more in 1966, which\nwas 15 per cent greater than the $20,000 or more received by the correspond-\ning group in 1964. Thus the lowest salary of the highest paid one-tenth of the\neconomists in 1966 was $14,500 above the highest salary of the lowest paid\none-tenth of them. This inter-decile range of $14,500 in 1966 contrasted with\nthe corresponding range of $12,200 in 1964.5\n\nAcademic Degree. The increasing importance of graduate degrees in the\neconomics profession and the superior salary increase for those with the Ph.D.\ndegree are shown in Table 2.\n\nIn two years, 1964-66, the number of Ph.D.'s in the profession increased by\n10 per cent and the number of master's decreased by 11 per cent, whereas there\nwas practically no change in the numbers of economists with bachelor's degrees.\nThus 85 per cent of the registered economists in 1966 had earned a graduate\ndegree (11,000 of 13,000). The reasons for the relatively low level of salaries\nof those with master's degrees ($12,000 in 1966) and the relatively high salary\nlevels of those with bachelor's degrees or less ($14,700 and $16,500 respectively\nin 1966) have been described in an earlier report [2, pp. 34-38, 46].

When private\ngoods, such as personal favors or money, can be exchanged for a vote commit-\nment, then the problem of paying the cost of a public good arises. For if a\nvote commitment is purchased, to be cast in favor of a collective action, then\nall who favor the action gain, but only the individual who purchases the com-\nmitment pays the cost. As Olson's work implies, this can lead to failure to\npurchase vote commitments which are too costly for one individual to pur-\nchase, but which would provide a benefit to each if costs were appropri-\nately allocated.\n\nIf all the goods used in exchange are votes in actions of collectivity, the\nproblem of paying the cost of obtaining a vote commitment is less serious,\nthough it still exists. If A gives up a vote on one action for a vote on a second,\nhe incurs a utility loss in loss of control of the first votes. He is paying the cost\nof the public good, but it is a public cost, since the vote he gives up is a public\ngood. It is a cost experienced by all those who agree with him on the action\nwhose vote he gave up, just as there is a gain experienced by all those who\nagree with him on the action whose vote he gained. Thus there is a sharing of\ncosts just as there is a sharing of benefits of the exchange. But those who op-\npose him on the first action but agree with him on the second action experi-\nence a gain in both actions, and those who agree with him on the first and op-\npose him on the second experience a loss on both. Thus we cannot say that\nthere is a sharing of costs and benefits, as is necessary in the rational provi-\nsion of a public good.\n\nAltogether, I have no quarrel with Mueller, and fully accept his\nmodification of the theory I proposed in my paper (with the amendment\nabout full negotiability of vote proxies). However, there remain a number of\ndifficult problems that neither he in his comments nor I in my paper have ad-\ndressed, as I have indicated in my comments above.

GonpoN*\n\nThe best-known empirical study of the shifting of the corporation\nincome tax is that of Krzyzaniak and Musgrave [18] (K-M for short),\nwho conclude that in the short run in U.S. manufacturing more than\n100 per cent of the burden of the corporation income tax is shifted for-\nward to consumers. The K-M method is to measure the effect of alterna-\ntive independent variables, including tax liabilities, on the pre-tax rate\nof return in a time series regression covering the years 1935-42 and\n1948-59. A positive coefficient on the tax variable would be evidence\nthat, in response to an increase in the corporation income tax rate,\ncorporations raise prices and increase their pre-tax profits, thus shifting\nto consumers some of the burden of the tax. An insignificant coefficient\non the tax variable would indicate that corporations are unable to\nachieve this discretionary improvement in their pre-tax profits and thus\nsuffer the full burden of the tax.\n\nIn the K-M study the coefficient on the tax variable is positive and\nsignificantly greater than 100 per cent, implying that corporations re-\nspond to an increase in tax liabilities by raising pre-tax profits by more\nthan the tax liability. Following the imposition of a tax of 50 per cent,\nfor instance, the pre-tax rate of return would more than double. If K-M\nare correct, the following is true:\n\n1. The corporation income tax does not reduce the rate of return and\nthus does not reduce investment (to the extent that the rate of return is\nan important determinant of the demand for investment).\n\n2.

DriAMOND*\n\nMoving from the certainty model of general equilibrium to one with\nuncertainty, the constructors of the model! with contingent commodity\nmarkets have given considerable insight into the problems of uncer-\ntainty for an economy. However, the construction of perfect insurance\nmarkets, where all risks are insurable, does not lend itself well to under-\nstanding the economy's imperfect solution of these problems. The model\npresented here is an example of an imperfect solution where a stock\nmarket permits the sharing of risks, but only incompletely. This will\npermit examination of the handling of risks by such an economy, as well\nas the shortcomings of this handling. An important element in any\nmodel involving uncertainty is the source of probabilities used in deci-\nsion making and the ultimate location of risk-bearing. In the contingent\ncommodity model, firms bear no risks in the sense that no probability\ndistributions are needed to calculate firm decision rules or profits accru-\ning to firm owners, and all risks are borne by consumers. With a stock\nmarket, however, where shareholders receive residual profits after the\ncompletion of production under technological uncertainty, firm owners\ndo bear risks and need to use their subjective probabilities in determin-\ning their portfolio structures. Paralleling the contingent commodity\nmodel, however, firms planning production to maximize stock market\nvalue employ no probabilities in their calculations, relying instead on\ndeterminate, concurrent market phenomena, the prices inherent in the\nstock market.\n\nBy means of a one-period one-commodity model it is shown that firm\nbehavior based on this rule, combined with trading in the stock market\nto maximize expected utility, results in a competitive economy's achiev-\ning a constrained Pareto optimum.

If a particular distribution is to be useful in the study\nof concentration, the statistical test of goodness of fit employed must\n\"make do\" with the sparsity of data generally available for most in-\ndustries. Further, the data being fitted must be economically relevant.\nFinally, it must be shown that the distribution in question is appropri-\nate over the broad array of industries to be described, or at least, that\nthe distribution is appropriate for industries with certain readily iden-\ntifiable attributes. The latter finding might allow us to gain some in-\nsights regarding the stochastic process or processes which generate the\ndistribution in particular cases.\n\n* The author is associate professor of banking at New York University.

Considerable atten-\ntion has been given to lags between movements in key monetary variables\nsuch as the money supply or interest rates and movements in national in-\ncome or selected components thereof. Empirical studies suggest that there\nare substantial lags between changes in such variables and changes in ac-\ntivity. These findings have led some to conclude that monetary policy can-\nnot play an effective countercyclical role.\n\nIt has been shown that such a conclusion may be ill founded [6]. None-\ntheless, even if it could be shown further that economic activity responds\npromptly to changes in key monetary variables, the effectiveness of mone-\ntary policy would still remain open to question. If the \"inside lags\" are too\ngreat, policy could be impaired. For example, if it could be demonstrated\nthat the commercial banking system, the chief mechanism through which\nmonetary impulses are transmitted, is slow to respond to disequilibrating\nfactors, serious doubts would be justified concerning the counter-cyclical\nrole of monetary policy. Much recent empirical research makes just such\na showing.\n\nA substantial body of evidence has accumulated suggesting that sluggish\nbehavior pervades commercial bank adjustments. In studies of various\ntypes of portfolio adjustments, lags have been reported ranging from several\nmonths to several years [1] [2] [3] [4].

In a more direct comparison Krause found the U.S. elas-\nticity of demand for imports calculated with respect to the tariff change to\nbe 2-3 times the elasticity calculated with respect to price [6]. This note\nsuggests that the reason for the disparity might lie, at least partly, in the\ndifference between nominal and effective tariff rates.\n\nWhile the nominal tariff refers to the rate published in thecountry's\ntariff schedule, the effective protective rate is defined as **the percentage in-\ncrease in value added per unit in an economic activity which is made pos-\nsible by the tariff structure relative to the situation in the absence of tariffs\nbut with the same exchange rate\" [5, p. 222]. In order to estimate the pro-\ntective effect of the tariff, the rate applied to each product must be related\nto value added rather than to the gross value of output, allowance being\nmade for tariffs on imported materials. For while nominal tariffs apply to\nthe total value of imports, they protect only the portion of that value pro-\nduced in the home country. At the same time, the level of protection ac-\ncorded the production of a final good is also affected by the level of duty on\nimported inputs used in the production process.\n\nIn a simple case where commodity (j) is subject to a nominal import\nduty (Tj, and uses one imported input (i) on which the tariff is (7), the\nvalue added per unit of j in the absence of a tariff is:\n\nv; \u2014 p;(1 \u2014 aij)\nand the value added per unit of made possible by the tariff structure is:\nvj \u2014 p;[(1 - T) \u2014 as 4- 72]\n\nwhere ;is the price of a unit of j in the absence of tariffs and a;; is the share\n\nof i in the cost of j in the absence of tariffs.

Correspondingly the effective rates\non manufactures are considerably higher than their nominal counterparts.\nIndeed, for several countries or country-groups (United States, United\nKingdom, European Economic Community, Sweden, and Japan) the ob-\nserved differences between the two rates are often in the 50-80 per cent\nrange [1 and 3].\n\nIn the course of successive GATT negotiations during the postwar period,\ntariff reductions were concentrated mainly in manufactured products\n(i.e., categories 5-8 SITC).

Thus even under a floating rate,\ndomestic monetary policy is not independent of international disturbances.\nThe Canadian situation in the late 1950s and early 1960s was actually the\nreverse of the illustration just presented.

The indi-\ncated difference between Ry and R;V, the mean ratio for each group, is\nstatistically significant at the one per cent level for the ratios using three-\nyear wage changes and at the 5 per cent level for the others. Thus, when\ncompared with the mid-1950s, wage changes in the mid-1960s have slowed\ndown in the visible industries relative to the invisible ones. Indeed, in in-\nvisible industries, the average annual wage change from 1963 to 1966 was\n3.8 per cent compared with 4.3 per cent from 1954 to 1957; in visible in-\ndustries the comparable figures are 2.9 per cent and 5.0 per cent. The differ-\nential slowdown is 1.6 percentage points. It is stretching casual empiricism\npretty far, but for the period spanned, such a difference between the visible\nand invisible industries looks quite consistent with the residuals for the ag-\ngregate manufacturing equation shown earlier, on the hypothesis that the\ninvisibles were unaffected by guideposts and the visibles affected to the ex-\ntent shown by the larger RV ratios in Table 2 (or the 1.6 percentage point\ndifferential just cited).\n\nNext, it is possible to clear up some misgivings about what else may be\ngoing on to yield these results by looking at employment data in the same\nway the wage data were examined. Employment changes are an imperfect\nsubstitute for detailed analysis of individual industries; but they may serve\nas a proxy for what one would like to know. Many views of aggregate wage\ndetermination, including the one expressed by the equation given earlier in\nthis paper, are consistent with the view that short-run relative wage changes\namong industries can be identified with relative shifts in demand, and\nhence employment, among these industries. Other things being equal, the\nR ratios shown in Table 2 would be positively related to the corresponding\nratios of employment changes. In particular, if higher employment-change\nratios were observed for the visible industries, it would mean the invisibles\nexperienced the relatively larger growth in labor demand in the 1960s com-\npared with the 1950s, and this fact could explain what we have observed\nwithout recourse to guideposts.\n\nTable 3 shows the employment-change ratios, designated by RF, com-\nputed in the same way as the wage-change ratios of Table 2. Employment\nrefers to production workers. For the three-year spans, the rank correlation\nbetween the R;\"s and R;?'s for individual industries in the invisible groups\nis 0.864, significant at the 5 per cent level. This supports the basic presump-\ntion that, in industries unaffected by guideposts, relative wage changes are\npositively related to relative employment changes. Within the visible in-\ndustries subgroup, the rank correlation is only 0.200, an insignificant magni-\ntude and perhaps not unexpected since the basic hypothesis calls for guide-\nposts to interfere with wage changes here. (With ordnance and accessories\nremoved the rank correlation becomes 0.648, significant at the 10 per cent.)\n\nAlongside these results for individual industries, the telling comparison is\nbetween the mean wage-change and employment-change ratios for the two\nindustry groups.

A separation into visible and invisible settlements would thus permit a\nrather strong test of the guideposts.\n\nThe first requirement is to separate the industries according to their\nvisibility or susceptibility to guidepost pressures. An objective measure\nwould be nice to have, but I did not find one. Instead, I consulted some ex-\nperts who presumably have a learned opinion and asked them to separate\nthe two-digit manufacturing industries into two groups. Where my experts\ndisagreed or were uncertain, the industry was left out of both groups.\n\nThe next question was how to compare wage behavior in the two groups.\nIdeally, one would like an equation for each industry like the one above for\nall manufacturing. Then the pattern of recent residuals from the different\nindustries could be compared. For various reasons, it is not as easy to get\nsuch wage equations with disaggregated data, the main problem being the\nirregular timing of wage changes. So I have resorted to a more casual test.\nI have simply taken the ratio of wage changes before guideposts to wage\nchanges after guideposts for each industry.

While residuals show some autocorrelation,? during the 1948 to\n1960 period the longest run of residuals with the same sign was 6 quarters\ncompared with the 15 successive negative quarters shown in Table 1.\nFurthermore, there was no suggestion of a negative trend in the wage\nchange variable; if anything, the contrary might have been suspected. Be-\nfore the run shown in Table 1, the equation had underpredicted wage\nchanges most of the time since 1958 [1, p. 77]. The possibility of a longer\ntrend was checked by using the equation for 1953-1960 to predict the wage\nchanges of the preceding years, 1948 to 1953.* The equation overpredicted\nwage changes by an average of 0.84 percentage points [1, p. 75]; underpredic-\ntion would have been expected if the present results for recent years were\nthe result of a long-term trend.\n\nI find these results highly suggestive.

Thus, V could increase in response to a highly profitable long-range\ncondition despite current losses in output and reductions in capital stock.\n\nTo summarize, it seems doubtful that market value or any other profits\nvariable is a good indicator of desired capital stock or even a good control\nvariable since it reflects such a diverse set of phenomena. Even in those\ncases where a good fit is obtained, we do not know why it is good or how to\ninterpret it.\n"], "3": ["912 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n\nLet there be an unanticipated shift in the demand function from Po(Q)\nto P,(Q). Clearly, V is greater at C, the new price-output equilibrium, than\nit is at B. In turn, B is a more profitable price-output combination than 4\nbecause output is the same at 4 and B but price is greater at B. In this case,\ntherefore, the demand shift permits the firm to decrease output but increase\nV. If the prices of productive factors are fixed, desired capital stock will be\nlower at the lower output.* By similar reasoning it can be shown that there\nare demand shifts for which both V and desired capital stock increase. It\nfollows that desired capital stock can not be treated as a function of market\nvalue since for any given change in V, capital stock may either increase or\ndecrease depending on the shift in demand.\n\nThe foregoing analysis has been restricted to monopoly, dominant price-\nleader oligopoly, and other imperfectly competitive situations where the\nfirm faces a downward sloping demand curve. In the case of pure competi-\ntion with no externalities, the number of firms in the industry will change as\ndemand fluctuates, but each firm will maintain the same output and capital\nstock so that changes in V, if any, will be unrelated to the desired capital\nstock of any firm. If externalities are introduced, equilibrium output and\ncapital stock positions of the firm may be greater than, equal to, or less\nthan their position before a demand shift according to the assumptions\nmade about external technological and pecuniary economies. In the com-\npetitive industry case, moreover, interequilibrium profits or losses will\naffect V while not necessarily implying anything about the movement or\nequilibrium position of capital stock.\n\nThe discussion so far has been cast entirely in terms of the relationship\nbetween market value and desired capital stock but, insofar as V is a gen-\neralized profits variable, the same arguments apply almost directly to the\nsimilar use of current or past profits. Actually, the relationship will be even\nmore tenuous to the extent that past profits are not related to future profits\nin any very simple way. Furthermore, the analysis has dealt only with the\neffects of demand shifts but it is clear that there are many other sources of\nslippage in the chain between capital stock and market value. Two of these\nsources of slippage are perhaps worth explicit mention. First, capital-saving\ntechnological change may occur which will affect the links between profits\nand output and between output and capital stock. Second, there is the\npossibility of changes in investor horizons about the length of time future\ninvestment opportunities will last, affecting the link between profits and\nmarket value. Ancillary to this last point, but nonetheless important, is the\nfact that a given change in market value may be consistent with a change in\n\n* Assuming, of course, that capital is not an inferior input in which case the lower output\nwould be produced with a greater capital stock. Inferiority of capital does not change the basic\npoint of this paper, although it does change the line of analysis slightly. For a discussion of\ninferior inputs see [1].\n\n5 In a competitive industry with no externalities where output changes because firms with\nidentical amounts of capital stock enter and exit, it may be that there is a linear relationship\nbetween the total capital stock held by the industry and aggregate market value of all firms\nin the industry. However, with less restrictive assumptions that allow for differing amounts\nof capital stock among firms, externalities, and changing factor prices a linear model does not\nseem plausible even on the industry level.\n"], "2": ["argue that erratic results are not really surprising since the theory of the\nfirm indicates that desired capital stock can not reasonably be treated as a\nfunction of either market value or profits.\n\nConsider the case of a rationally managed firm acting to maximize the\npresent value of its net cash flows.

CanLsoN*\n\nEvidence has accumulated showing that aggregated forecasts of sales\nby business men have had systematic errors [9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 18, 26,\n21]. In periods of rising sales, business forecasts have tended to under-\nstate actual sales. In periods of falling sales, the forecasts have been too\nhigh. In other words, changes in sales have typically been underesti-\nmated.\n\nSuch empirical findings, however, are incompatible with the hypothe-\nsis of rational expectations recently developed by Mills [24, 25] and\nMuth [28]. The rational-expectations argument follows from the as-\nsumption that businessmen are maximizing creatures. When it costs a\nbusinessman something to make forecasting mistakes, he has reason to\navoid them. Thus, if past forecasts have shown systematic errors that\ncan be corrected in some mechanical way, the rational businessman will\nmake the necessary adjustments, and any bias will disappear from his\nforecasts.!\n\nWhat are we to believe, the empirical results or the logic of the theor-\nists? On the one hand, if the theory of rational expectations is relevant\nto real-world anticipations, then the reported data must have been dis-\ntorted from what businessmen really expected.? On the other hand, if we\naccept as a fact the persistence of systematic errors, then businessmen\nhave been either unwilling or else unable to correct for these errors.\n\nWe shall take the position in this paper that aggregated forecasts of\nsales should tend to underestimate changes, no matter how carefully\nindividual forecasts have been prepared.

Bossons and Modigliani [2, 3] claim that expected\nprofit-maximizing decisions may be perfectly consistent with systematic forecasting errors;\nand as Theil has shown [32, sect. 3.3], an adjustment that removes bias from forecasts can\nincrease the error variance. If these cases hold, the \"rational\" businessman may choose to\nleave his forecasts unadjusted.\n\n? Underestimation of change as revealed by a regression of forecasted levels on actual levels\ncan be reconciled with rational expectations [28]. This particular \"regression bias,\" however,\ndepends upon where one places the assumed error term that links actual and forecasted values.\nFurthermore, if rational expectations are assumed, there is no such bias to account for the\nfindings that forecasted extrapolations of past changes are smaller than actual extrapolations\n[3]. Pashigian [31] finds, on the basis of a statistical test with OBE-SEC data, that he can-\nnot reject the rational expectations hypothesis, but his results suggest that the type II error\n(accept when hypothesis is false) is greater than it would have been had he tested the hypothe-\nsis that changes in sales are underestimated by some moderate percentage.\n"}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["John A.

The study is based upon aggre-\ngate enrollment data and it uses the rather common economic variables\nof income and price (tuition) to explain the movements of demand dur-\ning the period. To anticipate our conclusions, we have found that these\ntwo variables explain some 87 per cent of the variation of demand for\nhigher education as we have measured it. In addition, we have found\nthat demand responds positively to changes in income and negatively\nto changes in price. We believe that these results have important im-\nplications for the theory of educational demand and for the conduct of\nnational educational policy.\n\nI. Theoretical Basis of Demand Estimates\n\nOur results make sense only if we can put then in touch with a reason-\nable theory of educational demand. There are two not necessarily mutu-\nally exclusive approaches to such a theory. One approach views the\ndecision to enroll in an institution of higher education as an investment\ndecision, while the other views it as a current consumption decision.\nBoth of these approaches can be integrated for the purposes of this\npaper.\n\nThe investment approach! to the theory of educational demand as-\nserts that an individual will purchase a college education if the present\nvalue of the expected stream of benefits resulting from the education\nexceeds the present cost of the education. The expected stream of bene-\nfits includes two elements: the additional lifetime money income result-\ning from higher education and the additional social and intellectual\namenities which a person might expect to receive as a result of having\ngone to college. The first benefit makes a college education similar to a\nproducer durable, while the second causes it to resemble a consumer dur-\nable, whose yield is real rather than monetary.\n\nThe cost of a college education must also be viewed rather broadly.\nIt includes direct money outlays in the form of tuition and fees, books,\n\n* Both authors are professors of economics at the University of Oregon.

The model was initially developed to apply to\nwater projects, but it can be generalized to apply to any federal invest-\nment where benefits and costs are tangible and beneficiaries do not bear\nthe full costs of the project.!\n\n\"The basic criterion for evaluating public investment is the change in\nsocial welfare which results. The benefit-cost criterion which is normally\nused is based on the assumption that the change in national income is a\ngood measure of the change in social welfare. When projects are de-\nsigned to maximize net benefits and when all projects with positive net\nbenefits are undertaken, the increase in national income will be at a\nmaximum. But the benefit-cost criterion is sufficient to achieve maxi-\nmum social welfare only if one of two conditions is met.

In particular, this \"bias\" leads to an\nunderstatement of the interest sensitivity of foreign investors and an over-\nstatement of the sensitivity of U.S. investors. The inflow of foreign funds\ngenerated by an interest-induced outflow of U.S. capital will move in a\ndirection counter to that which is dictated by interest rate differentials,\ndiminishing the net movements of foreign funds. Furthermore, this return\ninflow would tend to replenish the uncommitted balances of domestic\narbitrageurs and allow them to place even more funds abroad. The actual\nsensitivity of U.S. capital would then be overstated by the amount of this\nsecondary outflow. If movements of capital from Canada to the United\nStates were induced, the desire of Canadian banks to draw down their New\nYork balances would again generate a flow of capital counter to the direc-\ntion of interest-rate and/or speculative incentives, once more overstating\nthe sensitivity of U.S. investors and understating the sensitivity of foreign\ninvestors.

Because of the im-\nportance of this article and its probable influence on future studies, it seems\nnecessary to raise a point concerning Stein's procedure of disaggregating\ncapital flows into two groups, United States and foreign, using separate re-\ngressions to estimate the sensitivity of each.\n\nStein's rationale for this separation is that '\"There is no a priori reason\nwhy the coefficients of the U.S. capital equation should be the same as those\nof the foreign private capital equation, since different parties are involved\"\n[9, p. 57]. While this is true, the nature of the short-term capital flows dur-\ning the period ... do not solely reflect differences in the responsiveness of these\nparties. Stein's estimating equations (15 and 22) state that U.S. and private\nforeign capital flows are functions of an interest-differential variable (7), a\nvariable measuring speculative influence (AR), and a disturbance term.! The\ncharacteristics of the present international monetary system are such, how-\never, that the independence between U. S. and foreign capital movements\nassumed by Stein's regressions does not hold.\n\nThe flow of private foreign short-term capital between the United States\nand foreign countries is not independent of the flow of U.S. short-term\ncapital. That is, outflows of capital from the United States will in them-\nselves generate a partial offset in the form of induced inflows into the\nUnited States. The widespread practice among American banks of requiring\nborrowers to hold a certain portion of their loans in the lending banks as\ncompensatory balances, as well as the tendency for many foreign borrowers\nto keep a portion of their funds in the United States as working balances,\nmeans that an increase in the foreign assets of U.S. banks will usually\ngenerate a somewhat automatic though smaller increase in the banks liabili-\nties to foreigners.?

It could, however, be highly impor-\ntant in the study of capital flows between the United States and individual countries.\n\n3 See also Oscar Altman [1 pp. 536-37]; and Kenen [7, p. 159].

As Stein notes [9, p. 47] there are substitution\neffects that offsel part of the direct effect of interest rate movements and\nthese might be missed in a disaggregative analysis such as Bells. Similarly,\nStein's speculative variable is designed to separate the speculative and in-\nterest rate effects, both of which would be attributed to interest rate sensi-\ntivity in an analysis such as Bell's. The reason for the difference in the Bell\nand Stein findings is that Stein uses the stock-adjustment formulation\nwhich, when the coefficient on the lagged-stock approximates one, is equiva-\nlent to Kenen's flow theory, rather than to Bell's stock theory.\n\nParnic H.

Total summation nets out substitution effects.\n"], "15": ["II. Stein's Analysis\n\nStein, when attempting to resolve the stock-flow issue, mistakenly\nequated his general stock-adjustment equation [equation (3) above] to\nBell's very restrictive stock (immediate-adjustment) theory. Stein failed to\nrealize that estimation of a general stock-adjustment equation can yield\nempirical results that are consistent with either the stock or flow theories (or\nwith neither). In fact, as was noted above, estimation of the stock-adjust-\nment equation is a means of discriminating between the theories. This\nmisunderstanding caused Stein much misery as he then felt it necessary to\nchoose between his stock-adjustment and flow equations which are ex-\ntremely similar. For example, compare the following equations of Stein [9,\npp. 61, 62], where SY(!) is the current stock of U.S. short-term banking\nclaims of foreigners, Y (/) is the corresponding flow, SY (!\u2014 1) is the lagged\nstock, R(/) is Stein's residual variable, and I(/) is the current U.K.-U.S. 3-\nmonth Treasury bill rate differential:\n\n? Because the flow theory also assumes that an increase in foreign short-run interest rates\nrelative to domestic rates generates a Perpetual increased outflow of capital (assuming the\ndifferential remains unclosed), the long-run impact of an increase in the differential on the\ndesired stock of assets, oj, is infinity. Thus r; is relevant in equation (3), even when \u00a3 is close to\nzero.\n\n* While the lagged stock formulation is an excellent theoretical device, its empirical useful-\nness is somewhat questionable due to the severe constraints imposed on the lag structure. The\nbehavioral economic unit is assumed to adjust its holdings of an asset during a period by a\nconstant fraction of the discrepancy between its long-run desired holdings and its existing\nstock the previous period, and the constant fraction adjustment is assumed to be the same\nregardless of which of a series of variables determining long-term desired holdings changes. For\nan empirical test of the appropriateness of these assumptions with regard to the demand for\nmoney, see Hendershott [4].\n\nAs an alternative to employing the stock-adjustment model one might regress capital flows\non current and lagged changes in interest rate differentials, etc., allowing the data themselves\nto determine the lag structure. (This technique was employed in my test of the assumptions\nunderlying the stock-adjustment model [4].)\n\n* My own limited experimentation also supports the flow theory as an empirical approxima-\ntion. These experiments are to be reported in [6, Ch. 6].\n", "562 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n\nThe flow theory which relates S,\u2014 S, to r, only, assumes that & is equal to\nzero, making 5, irrelevant.? The stock theory, which relates S, to r, only,\nassumes that & is equal to one, again rendering S, irrelevant (adding S&a\nto both sides of equation (3) gives a coefficient of 1\u2014 & for S, on the right\nhand side). An alternative to making either extreme assumption regarding &\nis to estimate equation (3), or its transformed counterpart that has S, as the\ndependent variable.* Stein [9, pp. 60-62] has inadvertently done the latter;\nthe estimated monthly speeds of adjustment in response to changes in the\nU.S.-U.K. differential and his speculative variable are .07 for foreign invest-\nment in U.S. assets and .00 for U.S. investment in foreign assets. These\nresults suggest that the flow theory might be a reasonable empirical approxi-\nmation.5 This is, of course, quite consistent with Kenen's positive findings\nregarding the significance of interest rates and Bell's negative results.\n"], "14": ["Q) Sf \u2014 as d- ofi\nThen by substitution,\n(3) S, \u2014 Sta 7 kao c kar; \u2014 kRSia\n\n1 Tn the only relevant passage in his report Kenen said: \"By correlating these two types of\ndata [capital flows and the level of interest rate differentials], we implicitly assert that a given\ninterest rate difference will cause a given inflow or outflow of cash.

Bell did not discuss his procedure and\nKenen was somewhat cryptic.!\n\nThis issue revolves around the seed at which economic units adjust their\nholdings of foreign assets in response to changes in interest rate differentials.\nBell, by regressing stocks on levels of rate differentials, has implicitly as-\nsumed complete adjustment within a quarter to changes in rate differen-\ntials; if the relevant U.S. bill rate differential fell this quarter, and remained\nat the lower level in the future, it is assumed that U.S. investment in for-\neign assets would rise this quarter, but would not be further affected in fol-\nlowing quarters. In contrast, Kenen's procedure of relating capital flows to\nthelevel of interest rate differentials assumes an extremely slow (technically\nzero) speed of adjustment. A permanent fall in the U.S. bill rate differential\nis expected to generate increases in U.S. investment abroad during this\nquarter and during all future quarters. Put another way, Kenen assumes\n(ignoring the constant term and other explanatory variables) that as long as\nthere is a positive interest differential there will be a capital flow. Bell as-\nsumes that if the differential does not change\u2014even if it is very large\u2014there\nwill not be a capital flow. While neither assumption is very likely correct,\nthe former can be defended as an empirical approximation of a rapid speed\nof adjustment and latter, of a very slow speed of adjustment?\n\nThis discussion of the Bell and Kenen assumptions can be formalized in\nterms of a Koyck-Nerlove distributed lag model as follows. In general,\nholders of an asset can be thought of as changing their stock of holdings\nduring a period in response to the difference between their desired stock, S;*,\nand the stock existing at the beginning of the period, S, ;.\n"], "13": ["I.

(1) The variable R is not\nsolely a speculation variable, but may fluctuate for reasons other than\nspeculation. The use of R in Stein's basic model has no effect on the coeffi-\ncient of the interest differential variable, 7. (2) The variables R and 7 are\nendogenous variables and, therefore, their respective coefficients, as mea-\nsured using Stein's basic model, are biased.

Equation 3, after\nadjustment is made for the degrees of freedom, explains 18 per cent of the\nvariance of U.S. short-term capital movements, three times as much as the\nbasic Stein model, and the interest differential variable no longer seems to\nbe important.\n\nIndeed, the separate test in equation 4, including only M and T, yields\nresults that are as good as those in equation 3. Both variables are significant\nat the 2 per cent level and 18 per cent of the variance is explained, after\nmaking an allowance for the degrees of freedom.

These are: (1) the U.S. trade\nbalance (7), and (2) monthly changes in the U.S. money supply (M).5 A\nlarge portion of U.S. short-term capital flows consists of trade financing.\nAccording to Bell [2, pp. 427, 428], \u00abIt would appear, then, that virtually\nall of the net outflow of U.S. short-term capital outflow before 1960, and\n50\u201460 percent of the much larger outflow of 1960 and 1961 (and indeed the\nfirst half of 1962 as well) consisted of export finance.\" The following empiri-\ncal tests take as the trade variable, the U.S. trade balance; on a priori\ngrounds, the trade balance seems more appropriate than exports, given the\nnet nature of the capital movements being analyzed here. The availability\nof short-term funds is measured as monthly changes in the U.S. money sup-\nply. One may think of banks as having a marginal propensity to invest in\nforeign short-term assets. The extremely high variance of this series pre-\ncludes the possibility of banks lending these funds for longer periods of time.\n\"The results of Stein's basic model were given in equation (1). In all, only 6\nper cent, after adjusting for the degrees of freedom, of the variance in U.S.\nshort-term capital movements is explained\u2014 principally by 7, which was\nsignificant at the 5 per cent level. R was not significant at even the 20 per\ncent level.\n\nWhen T and M are introduced we obtain:\n"], "11": ["Are R and I Exogenous?\n\nStein recognizes [9, p. 43] that the forward premium on the pound is\naffected by capital flows and, hence, is endogenous. This in turn renders the\ncovered interest rate differential an endogenous variable. He concludes that\nthe covered interest rate differential cannot be used as an explanatory vari-\nable without bias. Yet Stein proceeds to use his index of speculative activity,\nR, as an additional explanatory variable. What is R? The nominal label of\nspeculation notwithstanding, R is nothing more than an unusual forward\ndiscount or premium on the pound. It is, indeed, an endogenous variable in\nthe system. The same reasons used by Stein [9, pp. 43, 44] to show that the\ncovered interest differential is not exogenous, apply a fortiori to Stein's R.\n\nStein's own writing is ambivalent as to whether I, the uncovered interest\nrate differential, can be treated as exogenous. He suggests a particular in-\nstance in which it most certainly was not exogenous, vis \u00e0 vis capital flows.\nSpecifically Stein states [9, p. 43], As a result of the capital flow, the U.K.\nauthorities raised interest rates. . . .\" Since the data are generated by two-\nway interaction of interest differentials and capital flows, the estimates of\nthe impact of changes in the interest rate differential provided by Stein's\nmodel are subject to a downward bias.\n\nInlerest Sensitivity in a More General Framework\n\nIn earlier studies of U.S. short-term capital movements, several authors\nhave felt it appropriate to introduce variables representing trade [2][3]\n\nReserve Bulletin, the speculation data from Stein [9, p. 59] and the capital flow data from the\nTreasury Bulletin, Capital Movements.

In his conclusion Stein states:\n\nBell found that the interest rate differential was not a significant vari-\nable. . . . One possible reason for our different results is the level of ag-\ngregation. .. . A more important reason is that he failed to take ac-\ncount of the speculative expectations which I took into account with\nmy R variable [9, pp. 65, 66].\n\nThis \"more important reason\" by Stein's own analysis and description is\ninvalid.\n", "558 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\nUsing 7 as the sole explanatory variable yields:\n\nQ) Y \u2014 12.30 4- 24.19].\n(11.57) P 95\n"], "10": ["?

To\ncontend that R represents only speculative pressure is incorrect: R may\nfluctuate in the absence of speculative pressure. Suppose that there is no\nfear of devaluation (of either the pound or the dollar), but that in a given\nmonth an exogenous increase occurs in the U.S. trade balance with Britain.\nIf exporters are prone to hedge foreign accounts receivable, the demand for\nforward dollars by U.S. exporters will increase relative to the volume of\nforward dollars supplied by British exporters. The premium on the dollar\nwill rise and will be registered as an increase in R. As R increases this should\nelicit a decline in the outflow of U.S. short-term capital because of the in-\ncreased expense for U.S. capital-exporters in hedging their short-term pound\nassets. Thus we would expect to find Y and R negatively correlated, but not\nsolely owing to speculative pressure. Similarly, exogenous changes in capital\nflows could give rise to a positive correlation between Y and R even in the\nabsence of speculative pressure. Joint variation in Y and R has many\nsources, and is not uniquely related to speculative activity.\n\nIt is a requirement of least-squares regression that R and 7 be statistically\nindependent. Stein himself points this out: *By the property of a least-\nsquares regression, X; [which is the variable 7] and the residual R are un-\ncorrelated\" [9, p. 55]. But, that being the case, must one not doubt the\nusefulness of a multiple regression in which R and I appear as the sole inde-\npendent variables? Stein's interest sensitivity coefficient is not different\nfrom the one derived from the simple linear regression of capital movements\non the interest rate differential below.

On. The Interpretation of R\n\n\"The discussion up to this point has been concerned with the problem of\nobtaining consistent estimates of the effects of R on capital movements. The\nlogically prior question of the usefulness of such an estimate has been\nignored. My conclusion is that, even if consistent estimates of K, were\navailable, they would be of little value because R cannot be interpreted as\nrepresenting the effects of any one variable.\n\nApparently, Stein is interested in the effects of R on capital movements\nbecause R is an approximation to the covered interest rate differential.?\nExchange market theorists have traditionally assumed that the size of the\ncovered interest rate differential reflected the degree of speculation in\nforeign exchange markets. Stein, therefore, is interested in R as a proxy for\nspeculation. His model, however, suggests that R-\u2014 4,p*\u2014 As[S(t\u2014 1)\n-FT \u2014w] reveals nothing about speculation until we know something about\nA1, Ao, T, S(L\u20141), and w.

Stein then goes on to estimate the\nsensitivity of capital flows! to uncovered interest rate differentials and to a\nproxy variable which, he claims, reflects the effects of expectations about\nthe future foreign-exchange rate.

The institution of a one per cent differen-\ntial in favor of London yields an estimated inflow of $665 million and an\noutflow of $436 million per annum, and a reduction in the net inflow of $462\nmillion per annum. The possible upward bias has two sources. The first\nsource is the multiplication by twelve of the monthly rate of flow in order to\ncompute an annual rate of flow. This procedure is only consistent with the\nadoption of the flow theory and the constant rate of flow of capital in re-\nsponse to a given differential.\n\nSecondly, the sensitivity of capital flows to an interest differential may be\nexaggerated if the differential changes its sign during the period. A change\nin sign would result in the same capital being counted as it moves in both\ndirections as funds, originally attracted away from Europe by an increase\nin U.S. short-term interest rates, return to Europe as the U.S. rate declines\nrelatively and are then switched back to the United States once more as the\nold differential is reestablished. In the same way, the estimates of response\nto an increase in the differential do not consider the problem of maintaining\nthe new differential over a twelve-month period.\n\nThe possibility of the estimates of the sensitivity of short-term capital\nmovements to the interest differential being biased upward hinges on the ac-\nceptance of a stock adjustment hypothesis according to which a change in\nthe differential will result in a large proportion of the total flow being gener-\nated in the first period. The argument in this note is that the refutation of\nthe stock adjustment theory is insufficient for the possibility of an upward\nbias in the estimates to be eliminated.\n"], "3": ["3 Given bj- 1.\n\n* See footnote 2 above.\n\n5 This is particularly true, for example, in equation (39) where the levels variable, , is not\nsignificantly different from zero and in fact, has a ?\" value of less than that of AI.\n", "550 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n\nof AS(I) to AS(L\u2014 1) is not a necessary feature of a stock adjustment model\nwhen the desired stock is itself changing with each observation, but the\nlack of applicability of a linear relationship in the lagged flow variable must\nimpugn the use of first difference variables as a satisfactory test for the\nstock theory\u2014 particularly so when the original formulation of both models\nwas identical? The consequent rejection of the stock theory on the basis of\nthe statistical insignificance of the two first difference variables in equations\n(39) and (41) does not constitute adequate proof of the superiority of the\nflow theory [9, pp. 63-64]. In fact the relationship between the flow or\nchange in the stock and the interest differential is complex and the volume\nof capital movements may well be a function of both the level and the first\ndifference. A larger differential may not attract a proportionate increase in\ncapital, and the sensitivity to a differential may depend in turn on the levels\nof the interest rates if the average yield of the portfolio affects its distribu-\ntion.\n\nThe rejection of the stock theory can also be questioned on theoretical\ngrounds. A given interest rate differential offers an infinitely elastic demand\ncurve for individual transfers of international capital. The corresponding\nsupply curve is upward sloping denoting increased transfers to be potenti-\nally generated by larger differentials. If the flow theory is held, the supply\ncurve is defined as a flow of capital per period; if the stock theory is held,\nthe supply curve describes the reaction of a given stock of potentially in-\nternationally mobile capital which is extant at any one time: a change in the\ndifferential will induce a redistribution of the stock and, once the redistribu-\ntion of the stock is finished, any further international transfers will com-\nprise the international allocation of accretions to the global stock of inter-\nnational short-term capital. The flow theory contends that a given differen-\ntial will generate capital transfers at a constant rate for an undefined length\nof time.

The ques-\ntion of the extent that Public Assistance programs are self-defeating is still\nan open one and, we believe, an area in which the application of economic\nanalysis has been sorely lacking. Unfortunately, while Stein and Albin have\ndiscovered a problem in the data we used, they have not succeeded in re-\nmoving this flaw. Thus, their results are as open to question as our original\nresults. Moreover, when the problem they are concerned with is properly\ntaken account of, the conclusions we reached in our original paper are sub-\nstantiated.\n\nEssentially, the Stein and Albin argument may be stated in the following\nway. The data we originally used were on a case basis with a case being de-\nfined as a group of people, usually a family, who pool their resources and live\nas a single unit. We then interpreted the case unit as the decision-making\nunit, in general a correct conclusion, and applied the theoretical argument\nwe developed to this unit. However, we did not anticipate that subsequent\ndata on total number of persons in families being assisted (called recipients\nby HEW) would vary by state in such a way that the average assisted\nfamily size would show significant differences from state to state. (As it\nturns out, there is good reason for this. We should have seen this point im-\nmediately.) Of course, if the level of the general assistance payment is in-\ndependent of family size, the differences in average family size would be\nirrelevant. However, this is not the case and, hence, Stein and Albin's sug-\ngestion for expressing everything on a HEW recipient basis is justified.\nStein and Albin then proceed to use data on total persons in assisted families\n(HEW recipient) for the period 1961-1963 and their (*correct\"?) results\nindicate that no relationship exists between \"recipients\" and levels of pay-\nments per recipient.\n\nNow we reach the crux of the problem.

Statement of the Problem\n\n'The concepts of capacity output and rate of capacity utilization have\nbeen prominent in recent discussions of U.S. economic potential. These\nare important descriptive concepts for the economy as a whole and merit\ncareful attention in statistical measurement. They are also very difficult\nconcepts to measure and are not yet well established in our economic\nannals. Capacity variables have been significant ingredients in the\neconometric models constructed at the Wharton School, and a great\ndeal of effort has been devoted to development of a measure which would\nreliably serve a. wide range of uses in applied econometrics [2] [6, pp.\n53-59].\n\n'The Wharton School Index of capacity utilization is constructed by a\nvery simple procedure which enables us to provide quick and frequent\nestimates of this useful economic statistic. Briefly, the method involves\nmarking off cyclical peaks for each of thirty component indexes of the\nFederal Reserve Board's Index of Industrial Production and then\nfitting linear segments between successive peaks. Between the present\ntime period and the last established peak, the previous linear segment is\nextrapolated at its established slope unless the index in the present\nperiod exceeds the extrapolated trend line. In this case a new slope is\ncomputed by fitting a new linear segment from the last cyclical peak to\nthe present value of the index. Revisions will be continuously made in\nthe last linear segments until there is a cyclical downturn in the index of\nindustrial production. This establishes a new peak, and the process thus\nbegins again. The trend lines through peaks, we assume, represent an\nindex of capacity output, on a base of actual output, namely the same\nbase as that used in the F.R.B. index.\n\nIn constructing the Wharton Series our basic data are quarterly\nseries constructed from three-month averages of the F.R.B. seasonally\nadjusted monthly industry indexes [5]. A monthly index is being con-\nstructed and tested, but we shall deal here with the quarterly index.\nNormally, peak values must exceed immediately preceding and follow-\ning quarterly values, but we must deal with some special cases.

Introduction and Summary\n\nThe degree of income concentration varies considerably from state\nto state. The index of concentration for Mississippi, which has the\nmost unequal distribution of income in the nation, is 50 per cent great-\ner than for Utah, the state with the most equal distribution. Within\nthis range, there are marked differences in income concentration\namong states which are systematically related to various factors that\nhave a bearing on income distribution\u2014stage of economic develop-\nment; the degree of industrialization and urbanization; the industrial\nand occupational mix; resource endowments; the size, skill, age, sex,\nand race of the labor force; the rate of unemployment; etc. The prima-\nry purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between these\neconomic variables and the degree of income concentration among\nstates.\n\nThere is a long history of speculation among economists and statisti-\ncians about the reason for the skewness of the income curve which is\noften referred to as income inequality or concentration. The theories\nthat have been developed to explain this phenomenon generally fall\ninto two categories, *natural\" and \"institutional.\"' The former typi-\ncally attempt to explain income distribution in terms of probability\ntheory. In this sense they treat the income curve as a by-product in the\nplay of natural forces like the distribution of ability and chance which\nare independent of the form of social or economic organization. These\ntheorems have ranged from a view of the income curve as a joint prob-\nability distribution of biological traits transmitted by heredity [2] to\nthe analysis of the curve in terms of a game of chance under certain\nspecified conditions [7] [1] [21].\n\n* The authors are, respectively, economist, Center for Economic Projections, National\nPlanning Association, and chief, Population Division, Bureau of the Census.

In other words, if there is to be an increase\nin per capita income, this is so because in the production function a\nfactor reflecting technical change (depending on time or otherwise)\nappears only as a term multiplying the labor input.

At the same time, the theory presented here\nincludes some of the other theories as special cases.\n\nWhile what follows is certainly not an adequate description of the\ninfinitely complex process of growth and development, nonetheless it is\nhoped that it may clarify some aggregative aspects of that process.

At this point I should like to acknowledge an interesting contribution by C. E. Ferguson\n[2], which appeared after this paper was first submitted for publication. Starting from its\ndefinition, Ferguson derives the natural rate of growth of income for the Hicks-neutral growth\nsituation. His result is the same as that obtained in this paper (relation [11]) for the *asymp-\ntotic\" rate of growth of income. Ferguson also derives a number of other interesting expressions\nfor the natural rate of growth which supplement the analysis of this paper.\n\nUnfortunately, the relevance of Ferguson's natural rate for the general Hicks-neutral\ntheory of growth is not made clear in his article. As we show later in this paper, in the general\nHicks-neutral case (excluding that involving a Cobb-Douglas function, which is also Harrod-\nneutral), the actual rate of growth of income cannot be equal to the natural rate except pos-\nsibly in isolated instances of infinitesimal duration. Under such conditions, the natural rate\ncan be of interest to us only if we can learn from it something about the actual growth rates.\n"}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["Jaroslav Vanek"], "stable_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1815606"}, "1815607": {"affiliations": {"found": "Modern welfare economics has established the Pareto optimal prop-\nerties of a competitive economic system which satisfies such customary\nrequirements as convexity and the absence of externalities.

It is\nsignificant to the reliability of these results that there is an overwhelming lack\nof intercorrelation in the independent variables, as seen in Appendix A.\n\nThroughout the six variants, if a 99 per cent confidence level is used, the\nsignificant variables are (1) mean family income and (2) the percentage of\npopulation which is white. In variant (6) the percentage of the population\nemployed in mining and manufacturing is also significant at the 99 per cent\nlevel. With respect to the behavior of net regression coefficients for X, and Xi;\nit is interesting to note that they are very stable over five of six variants,\nwith 5, ranging between .17 and .21 in all but variant (4) and the estimated\ncoefficient for mean income taking on values between .0018 and .0022 except\nin variant (5).\n\nThus it would seem that the Kuznets hypothesis is supported in a situation\nwhere a high degree of control is exercised over other population attributes,\nimplicitly by the basic similarity of political and economic structure through-\nout the United States and explicitly by the other variables employed. The\nsignificance of X, as an explanator of variations in income equality would\nseem to enforce already prominent evidence on the effect of racial differences\non income and its distribution.\n\nOf the \"traditional\" variables other than X,, median age of the population\nis significant at the 95 per cent level in both variants (5) and (6).

Some Final Remarks\n\nThe Kuznets observation is primarily interesting because it suggests that\neconomic development per se may be a harbinger of social justice. The results\nof the present paper support such a hypothesis, and that is a rather comfort-\ning thought. This is not to suggest that social and economic policies designed\nto redistribute resources are useless, but, instead, that time and wealth ac-\ncumulation are on the side of equality.\n\nThat the evidence indicates racial makeup as an important determinant of\nincome inequality is not surprising. And, if the distribution of resources is an\nimportant aspect of overall social justice, then it would seem that recent pub-\n", "Table 2 presents the relevant F-statistics, using variants (2), (3), and (4)\nand variant (6) as bases for the testing of coefficients taking on zero values\nsimultaneously. Seven hypotheses are considered, with primary interest center-\ning on those within variant (6). For this case, each individual qualitative\nattribute of the states as well as the composite political factor (political party\nand/or philosophy) is significant at a 99 per cent level or above.\n", "F2: 6.22\n", "TABLE 2\u2014 STATISTICS FOR TEsTING QUALITATIVE VARIABLES\n\nVe Hypothesis F-statistic nn ed Pieve\n2 Bo 819-0 0.87 2,41 F.593.47 5.17 \u2014\n3 Bu 85-20 2.99 2,41 F95241\u20143.23\n4 Bi Bs\u20140 4.55 2,41 F 903.07 2.44\n6 B:\u20148s\u2014 Bn 815\u20140 4.13 4,34 F.994.347 3.93\nBs 8:970 6.77 2,34\nBi 88-0 8.03 | 2,34 F 992,47 6.22\n\nBu-8:570 6.77 2,34\n\n", "(corresponding to a consistently Republican voting record), and X; in variant\n(3) with a like sign (corresponding to a conservative political and social atti-\ntude).

The Empirical Results\n\nTable 1 contains the results of six alternative configurations of variables,\nwith partial regression coefficients, \u00a3-ratios,* and R?s (unadjusted) noted. It is\nsignificant to the reliability of these results that there is an overwhelming lack\nof intercorrelation in the independent variables, as seen in Appendix A.\n\nThroughout the six variants, if a 99 per cent confidence level is used, the\nsignificant variables are (1) mean family income and (2) the percentage of\npopulation which is white. In variant (6) the percentage of the population\nemployed in mining and manufacturing is also significant at the 99 per cent\nlevel. With respect to the behavior of net regression coefficients for X, and Xi;\nit is interesting to note that they are very stable over five of six variants,\nwith 5, ranging between .17 and .21 in all but variant (4) and the estimated\ncoefficient for mean income taking on values between .0018 and .0022 except\nin variant (5).\n\nThus it would seem that the Kuznets hypothesis is supported in a situation\nwhere a high degree of control is exercised over other population attributes,\nimplicitly by the basic similarity of political and economic structure through-\nout the United States and explicitly by the other variables employed. The\nsignificance of X, as an explanator of variations in income equality would\nseem to enforce already prominent evidence on the effect of racial differences\non income and its distribution.\n\nOf the \"traditional\" variables other than X,, median age of the population\nis significant at the 95 per cent level in both variants (5) and (6). This vari-\nable could be expected to exhibit a negative partial regression coefficient for a\nvariety of reasons? but primarily because an older population would likely\nhave a high degree of rigidity of skills and hence cause enforcement and pro-\nliferation of already established equality barriers. Variable X;, median school\nyears completed, was chosen to describe the basic skill level of each state pop-\nulation and is significant in variant (6) at the 90 per cent level.\n\nThe significance of X; at the 80 per cent level is interesting also in light of\nKuznets! views on income equality in developed versus underdeveloped econo-\nmies. If we adopt the urban center as a focal point for capital formation, then\nthrough Kuznets! eyes we should expect a tendency toward greater inequality\nof income for those states with large urban population concentrations. While\nthis conjecture is partially borne out by the data, the evidence is undoubtedly\nclouded by interactions with racial barriers in the urban center and the occu-\npational mix variable, X;. Such interactions, while expected in general, would\nappear inconsequential for these data as inferred from the values for the ap-\npropriate correlation coefficients.\n\nFor the qualitative variables, in variants (3) and (4) a particular political\naffiliation and *philosophy\" are of significance (95 per cent level) in explaining\nvariations in income equality, X; appearing in variant (4) with a positive sign\n\n* Critical values for \"2\" are approximately --2.70 for 99 per cent, 3-2.02 for 95 per cent,\n21.68 for 90 per cent, and 21.30 for 80 percent.\n\n5See, e.g., Morgan [8].\n"]}}, "content_type": "Article", "authors": ["D.

The essence of the arguments\nseems to be that the accuracy of autonomous expenditures in predicting\nmoney income or consumption depends critically on the definition of autono-\nmous expenditures chosen as a predictor. To a lesser extent this same issue can\nbe raised about the various possible inclusions made in constructing \"the\"\nquantity of money used for testing purposes. Essentially, the question boils\ndown to the *moneyish\" influence time deposits exert on the *narrow\" stock\nof money (currency and demand deposits).\n\nThe analysis presented below purports to develop a pragmatic answer to\nthis question by allowing annual first differences in three diverse stocks of\nmoney to compete at predicting annual changes in money income. In order to\ncheck the results of the simple correlations, annual first differences in the nar-\nrow stock of money and annual first differences in all time deposits are then\nstructured in the form of a multiple correlation to estimate annual changes in\nmoney income. The multiple correlation analysis also tests the data for a\nsignificant coefficient of moneyness in time deposits.\n\nThe raw data for currency, demand deposits, and time deposits may be used\nto construct an infinite number of money stocks. Each stock would include the\nfirst two of these items plus some percentage (weight) of all time deposits. F-\nM chose to include in their money stock the percentage of time deposits in\ncommercial banks. Both expediency and logic recommended this choice. Tt is\nexpedient because reliable estimates for this definitional stock of money can be\nobtained for a much longer time period than can be obtained for other money\nstocks;? and it is logical because of the distinct possibility that time deposits\nand demand deposits may be held as close substitutes for each other when\nthey are claims against the same commercial bank. However, the case can also\nbe made that the narrow stock of money is the only one that can be used for\ntransactions and is, therefore, the only stock that influences spending. Yet\nanother and contrary view sees al] time deposits generating liquidity in the\nmonetary system, and thus making more efficacious the spendability of the\n\n!

In the surplus labor problem, the question is\none of matching gains from added labor inputs in industry against possible\nlosses of agricultural product. In this case only the family labor that can be\nused in industry should be given an imputed wage in agriculture. It would jus-\ntify placing a zero price tag on a significant portion of child and female labor.\nHow would this affect the relative net output figures of small and large farms?\nWomen and children work both in the fields and on maintenance, tending bul-\nlocks, etc. Let us assume that all labor expended on field work and crop pro-\nduction has an imputed value equal to the market wage for male laborers, and\nthat all indirect labor inputs are attributable to women and children with a\nzero opportunity cost. We are now able to compare Bennett's net product\nfigures which are based on a full imputation of family labor expended on bul-\nlocks, capital maintenance, etc. (the depreciation of farm-produced assets in-\ncluded in his *other type A costs\") with the alternative approach. Using data\nfor Uttar Pradesh which initially showed the small farms producing less net\noutput (with more resources) than the largest farms, we now see a significant\nchange (Table 2). Farm business income (the income from all family-owned\n", "208\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "6": ["are a kind of bonus resulting from the greater number of labor hours which\nthen become available in the off-peak months when the alternative use of such\nlabor is limited or nil.\n\nBut there is a much more fundamental point relevant to the question of\nmoving family labor out of agriculture. For a market economy where most of\nthe inputs are purchased (both current and capital goods) and the output is\nsold, the true net output of the farm can be clearly determined. India's farms,\nparticularly the small ones, have a remarkably low level of monetization of\ninputs\u2014in Orissa only 8 per cent of the inputs are cash, in Uttar Pradesh 23\nper cent [3, p. 61] [4, p. 81]. These are averages; the small farms drop\nbelow the stated figures. While Bennett's net revenue would be a close mea-\nsure of net product in a market economy, it significantly understates the true\noutput of family farms in India. The error lies in neglecting to include in total\noutput the value of capital goods (bullocks, fences, buildings, sheds, etc.) that\nare largely produced with family labor (given an imputed value of market\nlabor) but depreciated and charged as a cost against crop production. These\ndepreciation charges are included in type *A\" costs and reduce the net value\nof the farm crops, but in fact are not paid out, and family income is not there-\nby reduced. Hence output is understated if there is no estimate of the value of\ncapital goods produced on the farm. Labor expended on the production of cap-\nital goods must also be added on the input side, but since this is family labor\n\u2014much of it with zero opportunity cost\u2014there is a question as to whether im-\nputed labor inputs should be increased.\n\nThis underestimation of net output is more pronounced on the smaller\nfarms because cost data show that capital maintenance and depreciation\ncharges per acre are higher as the size of farm declines, while the percentage\nof purchased capital assets is lower. This is most apparent in bullock charges\n(a major cost item, second only to labor) and depreciation of farm structures.\nBullocks are bred and raised on the farm and are an important element of\ncapital formation. A detailed breakdown of the cost of raising bullocks shows\na minor cash expenditure for concentrates and medicine, the rest being non-\ncash expenditures of imputed family labor used in tending the animals and\ngathering fodder for them, depreciation of animal sheds, etc. The annual costs\nof bullocks are then converted into daily costs and charged against the various\ncrops as inputs. Regional grain prices determine the gross value of crops.\n\nSince we have no estimates of the total value of capital goods produced on\nthe family farms, we could use the Farm Management depreciation figures as\na measure of such output, but this understates the output in cases where\nnet capital accumulation is taking place\u2014that is, where gross capital forma-\ntion exceeds depreciation. The basic problem here involves imputing value to\ninputs which have little opportunity cost and where the capital goods pro-\nduced have no market price. If we place a zero price tag on the family labor\nunits used in off-peak periods to produce such goods, then the net value of\ncrop production will correspond to the actual net product which the farmer\nretains\u2014his farm business income. As we raise the imputed price of family\nlabor, the net value of crop output drops and the imputed value of capital\n", "207\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "5": ["induced them to give up traditional agricultural techniques [2, p. 114].

I\ndo not think it is necessary to spell out all the consequences this analysis has\nfor Bennett's calculations of adjusted net revenue\" and marginal productivi-\nty\u2014both of which are based on the concept of intrinsic fertility differences.\nThe dire results stemming from \"declining labor-fertility ratios\" would also\nseem to evaporate.\n\nIf then differences in fertility in any one region are less important than in-\ntensity of cultivation as an explanation of output, (and for the other reasons\ncited), it makes sense to look at the total surplus (rent and profit) generated\nby different levels of input. Now for this total we do have reliable figures\n(gross output minus type A\" inputs). These are given in Table 1. Most of\nthe farms previously appearing as economically untenable now are seen to\nearn a surplus. If we set up maximum profit and rent per acre as a test of\nefficiency, then the appropriate procedure is to see how many groups are\nbelow, and how many above, the input level of the optimum group. (This\nwould also be the correct method to use with Bennett's profit figures.) In\nplace of Bennett's conclusion that only two out of 29 factor combinations\ncould improve their position by increasing inputs, we find that 16 out of 29\ncould do so\u2014these are mainly the medium and the larger farms in West Ben-\ngal, Madras, and Madhya Pradesh. Since all labor and capital inputs have\nbeen priced at the market rate, including imputed wages and imputed interest\nwhere necessary, it is reasonable to suggest that these farms are operating\nbelow the optimum level\u2014that is, underutilizing their land. On the other\nhand, 13 groups which are below the profit-rent maximum have higher levels\nof inputs per acre, implying that the marginal productivity of labor has fallen\nbelow the imputed value of labor used in the input data. The last two columns\nof Table 1 show deviations of labor inputs and deviations of net product from\nthe best performing group. They represent revisions of Bennett's adjusted net\nrevenue data in line with the previous argument that varying inputs, not in-\ntrinsic fertility differences account for variations in net product. Given the size\ndistribution of Indian farms, the underutilized large farms include a much\nlarger total acreage than the smaller ones which have exceeded the optimum\npoint [5, p. 48]. This means that a given reduction in labor inputs per acre on\nthe small farms can be absorbed by a lesser increase in labor inputs on the large\nfarms.\n\nI do not share Bennett's belief that the marginal product of capital and\nlabor shifted to these states would be negligible when the data show that in-\ncreasing rents and profits per acre are obtainable with higher inputs. His spec-\nulation about the offsetting effects of a declining \"fertility-labor ratio\" is\nbased on the static and erroneous notion that the imputed rent figures ac-\ncurately measure fertility and that fertility is a fixed inherent quality of the\nsoil that is unrelated to cultivation techniques. He also neglects dynamic fac-\ntors. The Indian experience with movement of populations into new areas\nshowed these populations to be more receptive to improved agricultural prac-\ntices (which shifted the production function upward) than the long-estab-\nlished population in the area\u2014a break with their old environment apparently\n", "205\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "3": ["(typically made up of several scattered fragments) had little in the way of\nmarket guidelines. India, especially since the Zemindari laws, is a nation of\npeasant proprietors, and 80 to 90 per cent of the land is owned by the cultiva-\ntors. Of those who do rent land, only a tiny fraction pay rent on a fixed cash\nbasis. Rather, the wide variety of arrangements commonly used make the\nlandlord a participating entrepreneur who sometimes contributes seed, etc. and\nwho gets a certain percentage of a highly variable pie. Even the rented land\nprovides no adequate sub-sample for imputing specific rent figures by size of\nfarm. Faced with the requirement of imputing rent to each farm, the survey\nworkers in many cases used the land tax as an indicator of rental value. Un-\nfortunately, land assessments in India are frequently 30 and 40 years old, and\nthere is the well-established tendency to underassess larger properties. There\nis also every reason to believe that the Indian tax assessor was not capable of\nsoil analysis but, if anything, based his notion of land value on output per\nacre which would reflect the higher marginal productivity of land due to\nhigher labor inputs on small farms.\n\nI do not think there is any strong reason for believing that in each fairly\nhomogeneous sample area the larger farms would be systematically inferior in\nsoil quality to the smaller ones, especially since small and large holdings are\nthoroughly fragmented and interspersed.? In any case, natural fertility is now\nrightly considered of less importance than it once was. E. Boserup in her ex-\ntensive report of agricultural practices in underdeveloped areas has suggested\nthat fertility in the classical sense as a fixed quality of land should be replaced\nby the concepts of frequency of cropping, long-fallow, etc. [1, p. 13]:\n\nTraditional economic theory . . . regarded as immutable natural condi-\ntions many features [of land] which scientists now consider to be man-\nmade and, in particular, the distinction between naturally fertile land and\nless fertile land was considered a crucial element in the explanation of\nagricultural change. . . . By contrast, when the analysis is based upon\nthe concept of frequency of cropping, there can be no temptation to regard\nsoil fertility exclusively as a gift of nature, bestowed upon certain lands\nonce and for all. Thus, soil fertility, instead of being treated as an exog-\nenous or even unchangeable initial condition of analysis, takes its place\nas a variable, closely associated with changes in population density and\nrelated changes in agricultural methods.\n\nShe then develops the thesis that increases in agricultural density induce a\nshift from a low input, long-fallow technique, to more intensive methods in-\nvolving short-fallow, multiple cropping, and more labor-intensive crops of\nhigher value.

Our analysis below suggests that given a random distribu-\ntion of fertility (re farm size), the families with small farms and higher labor-land ratios\nare induced to shift to more intensive cultivation, making the land appear more \"fertile.\"\nThe data on irrigation-use and double cropping support this position [6, pp. 818, 825n].\n", "204\n", "THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n"], "2": ["If the farmer were to rent his land at the imputed figure, the family labor\nincome would be both precarious and probably smaller. Operation of the farm\nprovides guaranteed employment for the family labor force and the opportuni-\nty to transform some of this labor in off-peak periods into capital through the\ndigging of irrigation channels, the building of farm structures and fences, the\nraising of work animals, etc. There is probably an underestimation of the out-\nput in the subsistence sector by not taking into account the value of the capi-\ntal formation. This phenomenon of direct transformation of labor into capital\nexplains how seemingly overpopulated agricultural areas have been able to ab-\nsorb and support additional workers by the tens of millions. When Bennett\nspeaks of scarce capital yielding a better return outside agriculture, he doesn't\nrealize that the family labor transformed into agricultural capital cannot al-\nternatively be transformed into industrial capital without scarce foreign ex-\nchange and other capital being used in the process.\n\nBennett's first technical error lies in his assumption that the imputed rent\nfigures measure intrinsic soil fertility or permanent improvements on the land\nwhich are independent of the level of inputs used: *We assume that rent\ndifferentials within each district measure . . . differences in returns resulting\nfrom differences in fertility and location between size groups. By deducting\ndifferences in rent from gross output per acre we are eliminating to some ex-\ntent variations in revenue resulting from differences in improvements, fertili-\nty, and location.\" Let us review the evidence on rent insofar as it bears on this\nproblem.\n\nIf we assume that the farms randomly selected in each sample district show\nno correlation between intrinsic fertility and size, then differences in the mar-\nginal productivity of land would still appear if the larger farms using hired\nlabor were applying inputs much less intensively than the small farms using\nmainly family labor, part of which had a lower opportunity cost. The margin-\nal product of land would increase as inputs of labor per acre went up and the\nmarginal product of labor declined. I previously gave evidence that Indian\nfarms in fact correspond to the above hypothesis. The field work of such care-\nful observers as J. W. Mellor and T. V. Moorti, who analyzed sample farms\nin Agra, Uttar Pradesh confirms the judgment that the land of the larger,\nwealthier farmers is not intrinsically inferior to the land of the smaller farmers\nbut that frequently the labor inputs are \"too thinly applied\" on the large hold-\nings\u2014cited in [6, pp. 825, 827n]. Differences in rent would be the result of\nvarying inputs per acre and not an independent causal factor in explaining out-\nput variations as Bennett assumes. It is for this reason that the inclusion of im-\nputed rents in the input data *C\" reduced the percentage of explained vari-\nance in output as compared to results obtained when rent was eliminated from\nthe inputs (^A\" data) [6, p. 819]. If this hypothesis on rent is true even in\npart, then we cannot assume that small farms reorganized and cultivated with\nthe lower inputs now prevailing on the large farms would earn the same rent\ndifferentials as before. Yet this is exactly what Bennett postulates in his Table\n2 (\"adjusted net revenue\") and the discussion connected with it.\n\nThe survey workers in attempting to estimate the rental value of each farm\n", "203\n", "COMMUNICATIONS\n"], "1": ["Reply\n\nDr. Bennett raises some important issues but his attempted resolution of\nthe problem reveals the inadequacy of a mechanical application of the theory\nof the firm to peasant agriculture. Apparently having little knowledge of In-\ndian agriculture, Bennett fails to see which assumptions underlying the mar-\nket economy model of the firm have to be modified for the average Indian\nfarmer who purchases only a small percentage of his inputs, whose capital\nstock and land improvements represent in large part accumulated family labor\nin the classical sense, and whose objective is not just to maximize entrepreneur-\njal profit but to maximize farm business income (the total return to all fac-\ntors owned by the farm family) and yet keep the family functioning as a unit.\nThis latter constraint means that the imputed wage rates for women and\nchildren! applied to part of the family labor inputs, as well as imputed rent and\ninterest used in the input figures, are not always viable economic alternatives\nfor the Indian farmer. From the social point of view it is also questionable\nwhether the entire family labor force used on the farm could be used outside\nagriculture. Legally child labor is prohibited in industry and the part-time\nagricultural labor performed by women with families may have little use in the\nindustrial sector. Thus the opportunity cost of a considerable portion of the\nlabor inputs used on the family farm may be near zero.\n\n!

These comments are\nconstructive in that they require us to be more explicit in specifying our\nmodel than we were in 1964.\n\nWith respect to the first criticism, it is true that our model does call for\nthe firm that strives to maximize shareholder wealth to select a target\naverage rate of return on assets. Since we restricted ourselves to the case of\na one-asset firm? only one rate of return is possible for the firm in any given\nperiod. Our concern over the target average rate was dictated by the share\nprice model itself, for when a person purchases a share of stock, he buys an\nexpected average rate of return over an indefinitely long period. More\nimportantly, the model referred to a firm's equilibrium position; hence it\nwas possible to talk about the unique solution rate of return as if it lasted\nindefinitely into the future.\n\nBoth critics of our paper, however took us to task for not discussing the\nmarginal r (which both believe in equilibrium will be less than &). The issue\nthat must be raised before this problem can be discussed is **with respect\nto what is r marginal?\"\n\nThe traditional capital budgeting approach answers the question by\nstating that r is marginal with respect to additional dollars of investment\noutlays. Since our price model postulates a constant growth rate as a vari-\nable, this approach will not do. Both critics assert that the r in the numera-\ntor of our valuation equation refers to a different time period (namely, his-\ntorical) than the r in the denominator (future growth rate) of the equation.\n\n1 Vickers [6] has also suggested this criticism.\n\n? In 1963, Lintner [1] suggested that for analytical purposes, it was convenient to think of a\nfirm as having a stationary profit opportunities schedule. Miller's discussion [5] of this pioneer-\ning work raised some of the same issues underlying the two comments on our paper.\n\n3 The implicit assumption of a homogeneous asset base, so that investments increase the\nscale rather than the diversity of the firm, is common to many articles in the field.
