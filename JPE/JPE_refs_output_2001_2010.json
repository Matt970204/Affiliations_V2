Second, one could model candidate entry and exit, which we\nhave taken as given in this paper. Candidate exit would presumably\ndepend on the degree of social learning, which may limit the ability of\ntrailing candidates to make up lost ground in late states. A third exten-\nsion would be to examine whether candidates alter their platforms in\nfavor of issues that are most important to voters in early states. Whether\nor not such strategies are effective presumably depends on whether or\nnot voters in later states condition on such candidate behavior when\nanalyzing voting returns from carly states. Finally, one could conduct a\nwelfare analysis of simultaneous versus sequential elections. On the one\nhand, voters in later states have more information under a sequential\nsystem and thus presumably make better choices. On the other hand,\nsignals in early states are overweighted, and state preferences may be\nmisinterpreted as signals of quality; outliers in these early signals or\nearly state. preferences could lead to selection of a lower-quality\ncandidate.\n\nIn summary, we have developed and estimated a simple model of\nvoter behavior under sequential elections. In the model, voters are un-\ncertain about candidate quality, and voters in late states attempt to infer\nprivate information held by early voters from voting returns in early\nstates. Candidates experience momentum effects when their perfor-\nmance in early states exceeds voter expectations. Our empirical appli-\ncation focuses on the 2004 Democratic primary. We find that Kerry\nbenefited substantially from surprising wins in early states and took votes\naway from Dean, who stumbled in early states after holding strong leads\nin polling data prior to the primary season. Early states have up to five\ntimes the influence of late states, and candidates respond to these dif-\nferences by funneling campaign expenditures into early states. Finally,\nwe simulate the election under a number of counterfactual primary\nsystems and show that the race would have been much tighter under a\nsimultaneous system and that electoral outcomes are sensitive to the\norder of voting. While these results are specific to the 2004 primary, we\nfeel that they are informative more generally in the debate over the\ndesign of electoral systems in the United States and elsewhere and also\nhope that the methods developed in this paper will be applied in other\nsettings as well.\n\nReferences\n\nAdkins, Randall, and Andrew Dowdle. 2001. *How Important Are Iowa and New\nHampshire to Winning Post-reform Presidential Nominations?\" Polit.

                    "720 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\ntion, the new wage structure would imply welfare losses, since the poorest\nhouseholds become even poorer.\n\nThe sharp rise in U.S. economic inequality has featured prominently\nin the public policy debate. Contrary to common belief, our study sug-\ngests that policies that offset the rise in earnings inequality would not\nnecessarily be welfare improving since we find the skill-biased demand\nshift to have produced welfare gains. For example, more progressive\ntaxation dissuades individuals from acquiring additional education in\nresponse to a widening skill premium. Offering additional insurance\nagainst increasingly volatile persistent shocks would be a more effective\npolicy. However, in practice, welfare-augmenting and welfare-reducing\ndrivers of inequality cannot be easily unbundled. The policy challenge\nis to design institutions and tax transfer schemes that deliver insurance\nagainst misfortune at birth and later in life while preserving incentives\nfor agents to make efficient human capital investment and labor supply\ndecisions.\n\n",

Additionally, if a race had a dead heat\nfor first, second, or third place, the exacta, quinella, and trifecta payouts may\nnot be accurately recorded, and so we dropped these races. When the odds of\nany horse were reported as zero, we dropped the race. Further, if the odds across\nall runners implied that the track take was less than 15 percent or more than\n22 percent, we dropped the race.

                    "430 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\ntested, whereas the more experienced professors broaden the curricu-\nlum and produce students with a deeper understanding of the material.\nThis deeper understanding results in better achievement in the follow-\non courses. Another potential mechanism is that students may learn\n(good or bad) study habits depending on the manner in which their\nintroductory course is taught. For example, introductory professors who\n\"teach to the test\" may induce students to exert less study effort in follow-\non related courses. This may occur because of a false signal of one's\nown ability or an erroneous expectation of how follow-on courses will\nbe taught by other professors. A final, more cynical, explanation could\nalso relate to student effort. Students of low-valuc-added professors in\nthe introductory course may increase effort in follow-on courses to help\n\"erase\" their lower than expected grade in the introductory course.\n\nRegardless of how these effects may operate, our results show that\nstudent evaluations reward professors who increase achievement in the\ncontemporaneous course being taught, not those who increase deep\nlearning. Using our various measures of teacher quality to rank-order\nteachers leads to profoundly different results. Since many U.S. colleges\nand universities use student evaluations as a measurement of teaching\nquality for academic promotion and tenure decisions, this finding draws\ninto question the value and accuracy of this practice.\n\nReferences\n\nAaronson, Daniel, Lisa Barrow, and William Sander. 2007. \"Teachers and Student\nAchievement in the Chicago Public High Schools.\" J.

At the very least, this\nconstrains the issuer's choice set of underwriters. However, paradoxi-\ncally, the same phenomenon may also act as an aid to entry: An entering\nbank benefits from being unencumbered by existing relationships that\nwould otherwise prejudice a firm's underwriter choice.\n\nThe restructuring of the investment banking industry in the wake of\nthe financial crisis of 2008 should lead to a reordering of client rela-\ntionships. The results of our tests help shed light on what the investment\nbanking landscape may look like following this reordering. JPMorgan's\nacquisition of Bear Stearns, Bank of America's acquisition of Merrill\nLynch, and Lehman's demise will likely have a considerable impact on\ncorporations' choices of investment bank. Since their rivals' preexisting\nrelationships appear to act as a first-order constraint on the future\nchoices that these three banks' clients will make, our results suggest\nthat, to the extent that client overlap exists, competition in investment\nbanking may fall by more than the small number of affected banks\u2014\nthree\u2014suggests. This may lead not only to higher fees, based on our\nresults, but also potentially to a reduction in affected firms' investment\nspending, thus generating real economic consequences.\n\n",

Obviously as the value of life declines, the costs of\nregulation also decline.\n\nThe baseline scenario leads to an increase in social costs of regulation asso-\nciated with more deaths, but the issue is whether this will be counterbalanced\nby significant savings from the deadweight cost of taxation. The findings of table\n5 suggest that there is a net social cost for a plausible range of calculations.\n\nTo calculate the fraction of the excess deaths due to the average level of\nregulation, we estimate the mean wage differential. We use our LFS estimates\nof the markup of the outside wage over the regulated national wage in each\nregion. The wage differential is (an upper bar indicates a mean over all regions)\n\nWW\" xagm\n(OXAWDU\n\nwhere u/ is the outside (LFS) In(wage) in region 7; w/ is the national regulated\nwage (allowing for regional supplements in region 7), f, is the employment share\nof nurses working in region 7 and y, \u2014 uw! \u2014 uw.

                    "36 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nWe developed a simple theoretical model incorporating favoritism,\naltruism, and guilt to show the conditions and data required for iden-\ntifying these distinct behavioral motives when harm can be induced\nexogenously. The key condition, following the psychological literature,\nis that guilt is an interpersonal emotion so that it is necessary to distin-\nguish guilt-motivated behavior from altruistic behavior with information\non transactions from the agent causing harm to the harmed in com-\nparison with the unharmed who have both a similar personal relation-\nship to the agent and similar state variables.\n\nBesides measuring the causal effect of rustication on earnings and\nother outcome variables based on the different rustication experience\nof twins, we found that parents selected children with lower endowments\nto be sent down, and this selection in part was motivated by preferences\nfor more able children as well as possibly efficiency motives (combined\nwith altruism). We also found, on the basis of subsequent transfer be-\nhavior at the time of the marriage of the children, that parents behaved\naltruistically, providing more gifts to the sibling with lower earnings and\nschooling. But parents also exhibited guilt: given. the earnings and\nschooling attainment of the two children (and the characteristics of.\ntheir spouses and coresidence with parents) and despite the fact that\nrustication increased the earnings of those who were rusticated relative\nto those who were not, the child experiencing more years of rustication\n\nreccived significantly higher transfers. We also found that a twin who\nhad a co-twin who was rusticated also provided more resources to that\nco-twin later in life despite not having been responsible for the send-\ndown decision. This finding appears to be consistent with reports of\n\"survival\" guilt expressed by surviving family members of catastrophes,\nboth manmade and natural.\n\nGuilt, independent of altruism, thus appears to be an important force\ncounteracting adverse experiences among family members, whether\ncaused by the agents themselves or by others. Our finding that guilt is\none important motive for intrafamily resource transfers thus provides\nsome empirical foundation for theoretical models that use guilt or mo-\nrality to explain human behavior and suggest that the guilt motive\nshould be considered in the design of contracts in which enforcement\nand commitment issues, such as in the family, are important.\n\n"

                    "MONETARY INTERVENTION 1071\n\nthe year following Caldwell's collapse (and the consequent accelerator\neffects, debt deflation, and credit crunch) explains the severity of the\ncontraction during the years 1931-33. Third, monetarists such as Fried-\nman and Schwartz (1963) argue that the onset of banking panics in the\nfall of 1930 led to the collapse of the monetary system. The initial panic\nmarks the point at which the money multiplier, the deposit-currency\nratio, the deposit-reserve ratio, and all measures of the money supply\nplummeted. Their decline from November 1930 to March 1933 was the\nmost rapid and prolonged in American economic history. Their decline\nlowered the price level, raised real wages and interest rates, and, through\nthose and other channels, reduced both aggregate supply and demand.\n\nIf those scholars are correct, then the evidence presented in this essay\nindicates that the Federal Reserve System missed an opportunity to take\ninexpensive actions that would have stemmed the initial wave of banking\npanics and altered the course of the contraction. The broader impli-\ncations of this finding remain to be determined. Would mitigating the\ninitial wave of panics have prevented the panics that came later? Would\nmitigating panics have prevented the debilitating deflation and collapse\nof intermediation that dragged the U.S. economy ever deeper into de-\npression? What were the relative strengths of the money and credit\nchannels for the transmission of monetary policy? All these inquiries\nremain open questions. The evidence presented in the preceding par-\nagraphs is only suggestive.

                    "COLLECTIVE CONSUMPTION MODELS 1103\n\nmogeneity assumptions across different individuals, this provides strong\nevidence in favor of models focusing on intrahousehold decision mak-\ning.\n\nFinally, we have analyzed the power of alternative specifications of the\ncollective model (which correspond to different sharing rule restric-\ntions). A first power measure captures the probability of detecting ir-\nrational behavior of at least one household in the sample. This measure\nwas above 95 percent for a large class of the collective rationality models\nthat we evaluated. We conclude that the collective rationality tests are\nrather powerful at the sample level, which provides strong support for\nour above empirical findings. A second power measure captures the\naverage/expected proportion of households of which irrational behav-\nior is detected. The values of this measure were rather low for all model\nspecifications (including the unitary specification). We believe that this\nresult can at least partly be explained by the availability of only eight\nobservations per household. In this respect, it is worth noting that our\n(necessity and sufficiency) tests also apply to larger data sets. Such larger\ndata sets may entail higher power at the level of individual households\n(captured by our second power measure).\n\nApart from increasing the sample size, another potentially fruitful\nstrategy for obtaining more powerful collective rationality tests uses\nmore stringent household-specific sharing rule restrictions. For instance,\nsuch restrictions can be conceived on the basis of additional prior in-\nformation about the intrahousehold allocation process. As we indicated,\nitis easy to extend the proposed sufficiency tests by adding sharing rule\nrestrictions that vary for different households and choice observations.\nThis obtains refined sufficiency tests that are as easy to implement as\nthe basic sufficiency tests themselves but can be substantially more pow-\nerful. We have illustrated this for our own empirical application by\nbuilding on the unitary GARP tests to add structure to the collective\nrationality tests. These more powerful tests provided further empirical\nsupport for the collective approach to modeling the consumption be-\nhavior of multiperson households (in the case of couples).\n\n",

The stock composition changes only at the end of June of year (^ 1\nwhen we rebalance. As such, we fix the set of firms in a given portfolio in the\nformation year t when aggregating characteristics, dated both t and t-- 1, across\nfirms in the portfolio. In particular, to construct the numerator of /,,, we use\n1,.,/K,., from the portfolio formation year 1, which is different from the\n1,., /K,., from the formation year (- 1 used to construct the denominator of\n\u00bb\n\nThe SUE portfolios are initially formed monthly. We time-aggregate monthly\nreturns of the SUE portfolios from July of year t to June of 1 1 to obtain annual\nreturns. Constructing the matching annual investment returns, 7/,,, requires\ncare because the composition of the SUE portfolios changes from month to\nmonth. First, consider the 12 low SUE portfolios formed in each month from\nJuly of year ( to June of t 1. For each month we calculate portfolio-level char-\nacteristics by aggregating individual characteristics over the firms in the low SUE\nportfolio. We use the following specific characteristics: , and z, observed at the\nend of year t, K, at the beginning of year 1, K,,, at the beginning of (1 1, and\nT5 Yos Lii and, , at the end of year t^ 1. Because the portfolio composition\nchanges from month to month, these portfolio-level characteristics also change\nfrom month to month. Accordingly, we average these portfolio characteristics\nover the 12 monthly low SUE portfolios and use these averages to construct\nzia. Which is in turn matched with the annual r7, from July of t to June of\n1 1. We then repeat this procedure for the remaining SUE portfolios.\n\nThe after-tax corporate bond return, r/^,, depends on the tax rate and the\npretax bond return, z^, which we measure as the observed corporate bond\nreturns in the data. The timing of rZ, is the same as that of stock returns: after\nsorting stocks on characteristics for the fiscal year ending in calendar year 1\u2014\n\n1, we measure rZ, as the equalweighted corporate bond return from July of\nyear ( to June of (1. However, calculating 7/^, \u2014 r4, \u2014 (5, \u2014 1). is less\n\nstraightforward: z,., is applicable from January to December of year t- 1, but\n\n1, is applicable from July of year ( to June of \u00a3-- 1. We deal with this timing\n\nmismatch by replacing 7,., in the calculation of r/^, with the average of 7, and\n7, in the data. This timing mismatch matters little for our results because the\ntax rate exhibits little time-series variation. In particular, we have experimented\n\nwith time-invariant tax rates in calculating r^, and the results are largely similar.\n",

                    "ECONOMICS OF EXTORTION 451\n\nsuch as the age of the truck and the cargo being carried, so that trucks\nwith characteristics that indicate higher willingness to pay are indeed\ncharged higher bribes. Moreover, we show that at one of the four weigh\nstations on the route, a criminal organization appears to have partnered\nwith weigh station officials to introduce a menu of two-part tariffs. This\nsuggests that the barriers posed by the fact that corruption is illegal are\nnot sufficient to prevent complex pricing schemes involving multiple\ntransactions.\n\nThe results here have several implications for anticorruption policy\nFirst, the endogenous price responses documented here imply that de-\ncentralized corruption can result in higher bribes charged than if cor-\nruption was centralized. If that is the case, tackling corruption at the\ntop of an organization could actually lead to increases in bribes if the\nnumber of bribe takers on the ground remains the same but their\ncoordination system is undermined. Second, we show empirically that\nendogenous price change responses can substantially offset the gains\nfrom reducing the number of corrupt bureaucrats. In cases in which\ncorruption was centralized, these gains could be completely offset by\nendogenous price responses.\n\nAlthough the economic mechanisms identified in this paper are likely\nto be general, the degree of centralization or decentralization of bribes\nwill clearly vary according to the context. For example, a pilot survey\nconducted by the authors in March 2005 on the road between Jakarta,\nthe capital of Indonesia, and Bandung, the capital of nearby West Java\nprovince, found that\u2014in contrast to Aceh\u2014the vast majority of extor-\ntion payments made by truck drivers on the Bandung-Jakarta route\nwere in the form of routine monthly payments to police officials and\naffiliated criminal organizations, with relatively little collected at check-\n\npoints. One interpretation of this phenomenon is that the corrupt of-\nficials in West Java had managed to centralize collection of bribes pre-\ncisely in order to overcome the double marginalization problem\ndiscussed in this paper. Understanding the circumstances that allow\ncorruption to be coordinated in this way is an important direction for\nfuture research.\n",

                    "588 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\nVH. Conclusions\n\nThis paper considers two distinct models of asset trade with heteroge-\nneous agents and derives representations for the model SDFs in terms\nof the crosssectional consumption distribution. The first model is a\nstandard incomplete markets model. We show that in that model, the\nequity premium is higher if the stock returns covary fositively with con-\nsumption inequality. The second model is a model in which agents sign\nlifetime insurance/work contracts with employers or some other inter-\nmediary, and those employers trade assets. In that model, the equity\npremium is higher if stock returns covary negatively with consumption\ninequality. We estimate the two models in three different countries:\nUnited States, United Kingdom, and Italy. The first, incomplete markets,\nmodel is inconsistent with the equity premium in the United States,\nUnited Kingdom, or Italy for any specification of the coefficient of\nrelative risk aversion. In contrast, in all three countries, the second\n(PIPO) model is consistent with the equity premium for an estimated\ncoefficient of relative risk aversion of around 5. However, the model is\nconsistent with the short-term risk-free rate only for low discount factors\n(less than 0.5).\n\nThe intuition behind the PIPO model's success with the equity pre-\nmium is simple. With high consumption inequality, there are many\nconsumption-poor skilled agents. Such agents are easy to motivate, and\nso employers find it cheap to provide their employees with incentives\nin these high-inequality states. This basic argument means that in the\nPIPO model, the state price of consumption is higher when inequality\nis low. It turns out empirically that consumption inequality\u2014especially\nrighttail consumption inequality\u2014tends to be rising exactly when stock\nreturns are high. Stocks are not as valuable as bonds, and so the equity\npremium is high.\n\nReferences\n\nAlvarez, Fernando, and Urban Jermann. 2001. *Quantitative Asset Pricing Im-\nplications of Endogenous Solvency Constraints.\" Rev.

In the PIPO model, right-ail skill inequality should drive movements in the pricing\nkernel. In the online Appendix, we provide suggestive evidence showing a strong corre-\nlation between the 5th moment of the U.S. consumption distribution (we choose y\nt0 be consistent with our empirical estimates) and the share going to the top 0.01 percent\nof the wage distribution, which is a measure of right-tail skill inequality (the wage fractile.\n\nestimates come from Piketty and Saez [2003]).\n\n"

First, competition does not necessarily exac-\nerbate banking instability. Given our empirical findings for the Great\nDepression, theoretical models positing an ambiguous effect of com-\npetition on systemic stability appear to be warranted. Second, it suggests\nthat the banking system of the United States would have been less fragile\nin the 19305 had states allowed more branching, not necessarily because\nthe branch banks would have been more diversified, but because the\nsystem would have consisted of more efficient banks. Third, it allows us\nto conjecture that the recent consolidation wave will not necessarily\nreduce the ability of the banking system to weather shocks.\n\nReferences\n\nAllen, Douglas, and William Gale. 2004. \"Competition and Financial Stability.\"\n.J.

Fol-\nlowing Fischer (1982), we calculate annual seigniorage rates from actual data\nas\n\nMir - My\n\nM\n\n] (El)\n\nwhere the subscript A stands for annual and the superscript Agg stands for\naggregate. The term M) is aggregate reserve money for the year containing\nthe month indexed by t, and Y?* is aggregate nominal GDP in that yea\nthis calculation, there is no parameter 0 involved because we work directly on\nthe aggregate data on money.\n\nTo make the simulated data from our model as close to (El) as possible, we\ncompute the distribution of d,, as follows. We first draw s, from Pr (s|\u00f3, x\"),\nand for a given s, we then draw d(s) and compute d,, as an average of d/s)\nover the 12 months of the year. The simulated data d,, only approximate the\nactual data d?;^ because of the following differences. The price index data P.\nused for our model are CPI, not the GDP deflator. For the actual data, dj; is\ncalculated as a ratio of two sums or aggregates. For the simulated data, d??* is\ncomputed as a sum of monthly money creations in a percentage of real output.\n\nIn our estimation, d, is arbitrarily normalized. When comparing to actual data,\nwe need to renormalize it. We do so by matching the average of medians of\nsimulated annual seigniorage to the average of actual seigniorage rates over the\nsample for Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru. For Chile, we use the average\nover the sample excluding the hyperinflation period 1971-75, during which\nlarge simulated seigniorage levels are caused by a large shock variance. The\neffect of this relatively large variance is shown by the skewed distribution marked\nby the dashed bands in the second-row graph of figure 7. Note that changes in\nshock variances have no effect on the median of simulated seigniorage.\n\n",

Consumers in these markets are more likely to discard their own\ninformation and follow the herd.? But in music, when other consumers\nbuy an album, the songs on that album get played more frequently on\nthe radio, generating information to consumers about their own pref-\nerences for the album. As a result, consumers are less likely to make\nmistakes (in the ex post sense) in buying albums than, say, books, and\nhit albums are less likely to be oversold than bestselling novels.\" An-\nother example is personal computers: Goeree (2005) argues that the\nrapid pace of technological change in computers leads consumers to\nbe less than fully informed about the set of available products. Our\nfindings indicate that the distribution of success in these markets may\nbe very different from what it would be in a world with more fully\ninformed consumers.\n\n"

For\nexample, a round-trip fare from Boston to San Francisco would appear twice in\nthe data: once as BOS-SFO and once as SFO-BOS. Since this would have no\neffect on the consistency of our estimates but a significant effect on the size of.\nour standard errors, we chose to drop one of the directions. Of course, the\ndrawback of this assumption is that some one-way fares were dropped from the\ndata as a result. In our judgment, the first issue outweighed the second issue.\nDropping one of the directions decreases our sample to 112,499 carrierroute\nobservations, covering 5,444 distinct carrier-route observations and 2,902 distinct.\n\nroutes.\n",

                    "136 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nOur result can be illustrated by reconsidering the cost of inflation in\nthe parameterized model discussed by Lagos and Wright (2005). The\ncost and utility functions are given by \u00ab(y) \u2014 y and uj) 2 y Ya \u2014\n3), with  \u2014 3/10, the discount factor is \u00e0 \u2014 1/1.04, and the probability\nof a singlecoincidence meeting is 1/N \u2014 1/2. For this model, 5* \u2014 1\nand y,. (7) 9 [R(G/Q \u2014 9]. In the case of the Nash bargaining pro-\ntocol, Lagos and Wright obtain y \u2014 .442 when the inflation rate is zero\nand y \u2014 .143 when the inflation rate is 10 percent, implying a large\nwelfare cost. But for these parameter values we have 5, (0.1) \u2014 1.41,\nso that the first-best allocation is in the CP implementable set; in fact\nthe welfare cost is zero for inflation rates below 16.7 percent.\n\nVII. Concluding Remarks\n\nOur results imply that entire classes of trading protocols that have been\nstudied are missing good coalition-proof implementable allocations.\nThere is no reason to think that that result is limited to the Lagos-\nWright model. Thus, much hinges on whether we study all such allo-\ncations or choose a particular class of trading protocols. Existing work\nalso overstates the welfare cost of inflation and the beneficial role of.\ntax schemes used to finance the payment of interest on money. It over-\nstates the beneficial role of such tax schemes for two reasons. First, that\nwork understates what can be achieved without such tax schemes. Sec-\nond, most of it fails to subject tax schemes to restrictions such as no\ncommitment and imperfect monitoring, the restrictions that give money\na role.\n\n",

QED\n\nFinally, we can state a proposition.\n\nPmorosiTIoN 9. Consider any equilibrium such that A's message does not\ninfluence B's decision to invest. If & is small, then the probability of investment.\nand attack, and the expected payoff for each player, must be almost the same\nas in either full disclosure or full ambiguity, the difference vanishing as & ^ 0.\n\nProf \u2014 Asargued above, it suffices to consider an equilibrium satisfying prop-\nerties El, E2, and E3 and thus characterized in claim 4. Following m^ \u20ac M\", the\narmed B refuses inspections with probability strictly between zero and one (recall\nthat M \u2014 M\" by claim 1, so there must always be a chance of refusal). Player\nB's indifference condition requires that if the inspections cost is small, the\nprobability of attack must be approximately the same, whether or not inspections\noccur. Thus, a' and a^ must be very close, and B is attacked with probability\napproximately 1 \u2014 F('), whether or not there is an inspection. Types below\n4! never attack, and. (disregarding the very small interval [a', a^]) types above\n4' always attack. The outcome is therefore approximately the full ambiguity\nequilibrium of Section IILB. In particular, B must invest with probability close\nto X, and both \u00ab' and a\" must be close to \u00e0, where & and \u00e0 are as defined in\nthe. proof of proposition 3. An attack occurs approximately with probability\n1 \u2014 F(\u00e0), just as in the full ambiguity equilibrium of Section IIL.B. As & \u2014 0, each\nplayer's expected payoff must converge to the payoff of the full ambiguity equi-\nlibrium. QED\n\nReferences\n\nAyres, Ian, and Steven D.

In particular, we demonstrate that on the basis\nof their observable characteristics, pairs of individuals residing on the\nsame block would actually be slightly less likely to work together than\npairs in the same reference group but not on the same block. This\nprovides strong evidence that our research design is likely to be robust\nto within-reference group sorting. Further, the inclusion of individual\nfixed effects allows us to control for a form of sorting on unobservables.\n\nThis evidence also suggests that the research design proposed in the\npaper may be useful in a variety of contexts. For example, in the case\nof welfare participation, the block of residence is unlikely to greatly\ninfluence access to public service providers after the reference group\nis controlled for. More generally, this design might be extended to the\nstudy of neighborhood effects in specific contexts (e.g., specific types\nof neighborhoods), on specific populations (c.g., youths), and for al-\nternative outcomes (e.g. education, teenage fertility, health, welfare\nparticipation, bankruptcy, and mortgage delinquency), provided that\nthe researcher can demonstrate that the within-reference group cor-\nrelation in observable neighbor characteristics is zero, thereby ensuring\nthat the key identifying assumption on unobserved characteristics is at\nleast reasonable. In future work, we also intend to extend this analysis\nto young adults for whom neighborhood contacts might be an especially\nimportant source of job referrals.\n\n",

Define\n\ny .- [GO when R(g) \u00ab1 or g \u20ac A,\nQO:\u2014 mo 1 when R()\u00bblorge R^\" (M.\n\nOne may think of Q as resulting from R by \"tearing\" along the \"seam\"\nR(g) \u2014 l, with the seam itself going partly to the upper fragment and\npartly to the lower fragment. It may be seen that Q is first-order mono-\ntonic and satisfies the duality axiom but is not continuous; and there\nare gand A (on the \"seam\") satisfying (15), so Q is not ordinally equiv-\nalent to R.\n\nFinally, as already argued at the end of Section VIII, Sarin's index\nS(g) is continuous and firstorder monotonic but violates duality. QED\n\nXL Conclusion\n\nWe have defined a numerical index of the riskiness of a gamble with\nstated dollar outcomes and stated probabilities. It is denominated in\ndollars, is monotonic with respect to first- and second-order stochastic\ndominance, is continuous in about any sense one wishes, is positively\nhomogeneous, and satisfies a duality condition that says, roughly, that\nagents who are uniformly more risk averse are less likely to accept gam-\nbles that are riskier. It is the only index satisfying these conditions.\nMoreover, the index may be characterized in terms of constant Arrow-\nPratt risk aversion\u2014both absolute (CARA) and relative (CRRA)\u2014and\nit may be used to define a (dimensionless) index of riskiness for financial\ninstruments such as stocks or bonds.\n\nReferences\n\nArrow, Kenneth J. 1965.

So the average disutility becomes\n\nIgi, e) * Q0 7 sg eMe \u2014\n\n-a-\n\nss oft -5 t\u00fc-s) os(t Jom (D20)\nWe choose this particular specification because when the fixed cost of work is\nset at zero, it reduces to the log-linear specification used by Hansen (1985) and\n\u00e0 number of other researchers.\n\nThe calibration by Cho and Cooley (1994) for this parameterized disutility\nfunction is that (a, /, &) \u2014 (1.5, 0.45, 1.6). Since our two-good specification of\nthe utility from consumption is different from Cho and Cooley's one-good spec-\nification, we rescale this parameterized disutility. That is, in the above param-\neterized disutility function, we set ? \u2014 (0.45/1.5) - a and solve the sixth steady-\nstate equation for a given (E, \u00c0, d, sy. s) obtained from the first step described\nabove and given e \u2014 e,,. The value of a thus calibrated is a \u2014 2.1 (so 0 \u2014\n0.64). We assume T \u2014 24 x 7 hours.\n\nSimulation Results.\n\nA quantitative summary of simulation results for the present case of endogenous\nemployment and intermediate inputs is in table 5 of the text. Here, we display\ntwo figures. One, figure DI, plots the employment rate e, in the data and in two\nsimulations. The other, figure D2, is the endogenous-employment version of\nfigure 5 of the text. Compared to the exogenous-employment case, the model\nfits less well for GNP; but this is not surprising because in the exogenous-\nemployment case the employment rate is set at its actual level. We do not show\nthe endogenous-employment version of figure 6 (about capital accumulation)\nbecause it looks almost the same.\n\nReferences\n\nAkerlof, George. 1980. \"A Theory of Social Custom, of Which Unemployment\nMay Be One Consequence.\" Q.J.E. 94 (June): 749-75.\n\nBalke, Nathan, and Robert J.

Therefore, only a small fraction, a(In Q// \u2014\nIn Q//6 or just over 0.8 percent, of firms are affected by the decision cost. If\nthey are allowed to adjust, these firms charge In Qt \u2014 \u2014.005 rather than the\naverage of In Q7 and In Q^. This implies an average price change of just over 5\npercent. Firms affected by the decision cost therefore contribute \u20140.008 x\n0.05 \u2014- \u20140.0004 to the decline in the price level. The difference is small relative\n0 the decline in the price level itself, which is 0.28 percent in the linear model.\nThe difference is even smaller in subsequent periods since the policies move\nby less. It is also smaller in response to a positive shock to the money supply,\nsince the skewness of the Ss bands implies that the affected firms adjust by only\n4 percent.\n\nLarger monetary shocks reproduce figure C1 on a larger scale. The two im-\npulse responses look exactly the same; only the vertical axis changes. Once the\nmoney shock exceeds 5 percent, the model begins to break down. Firms initially\nat Q* may find themselves outside of the bands.

                    "1090 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nemployer. Sadly, then, modern pirates are far less interesting from an\neconomic or organizational point of view than their predecessors.\n\nThe institutions of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century pirates, in\ncontrast, provide an important glimpse into the typically invisible gov-\nernance mechanisms that support cooperation inside criminal organi-\nzations. My analysis of the law, economics, and organization of pirates\nleads to three conclusions.\n\nFirst, ordinary \"foot soldiers\" inside criminal organizations may face\na problem of leader predation similar to the problem citizens under\ngovernments face with respect to political rulers. Importantly, organized\ncriminals' inability to rely on state-created institutions to overcome this\nproblem does not prevent them from developing private, selt-enforcing\ninstitutions for this purpose instead. \"Kings were not needed to invent\nthe pirate system of governance\" (Rogozinski 2000, 184). It is unlikely\nthat they are needed to invent systems of governance in other criminal\norganizations either.\n\nSecond, the institutions that constituted the pirates' system of gov-\nernance\u2014democratic checks, the separation of power, and constitu-\ntions\u2014are remarkably similar to those governments employ to constrain\nruler predation in the \"legitimate world.\" Government does not have a\nmonopoly on these institutions of governance any more than it has a\nmonopoly on the ability to generate cooperation and order. The success\nof pirate \"an-arrgh-chy\" highlights both of these facts.\n\nIn the same way that merchant ship autocracy reflected an efficient\ninstitutional response to the particular economic situation that mer-\nchant ships faced, pirate organization reflected an efficient institutional\nresponse to the particular, and rather different, economic situation that\npirate ships faced. The efficiency of piratical institutions, it seems, re-\nsulted at least in part from this economic difference between pirate and\nmerchant ships, not from the former's inability to rely on government\nsupport for autocratic organization.\n\nFinally, organized criminals are as interested in creating order among\nthemselves as noncriminals. They, too, have an incentive to develop\nsolutions to obstacles that otherwise prevent them from cooperating for\nmutual gain. The fact that they direct their cooperation at someone\nelse's loss does not alter this. Thus, while Captain Charles Johnson\ndescribed the pirates' criminal organization as \"that abominable Society\"\n(1726-98, 114), it is important to acknowledge that, however abomi-\nnable, it was nevertheless a society.\n\nReferences\n\nAnderson, Annelise Graebner. 1979.

In equilibrium, aggregate consumption is lower than\nthe aggregate endowment in the high-endowment state s \u2014 1 (i.e., there\nare resources not utilized in that state). However, there is no incentive-\ncompatible and budget-feasible contract that provides the consumer a\nhigher utility than x^ by allowing her to consume additional resources\nwhen s \u2014 1 is realized. This claim is in contrast with the one in the\nproof of lemma 4 in Bennardo and Chiappori (2003). The authors argue\nthat, if the price associated with consumption in state 1 were zero re-\ngardless of the effort level, the consumer could do better by buying a\ndifferent contract x^, where x/ specifies low effort and a very high level\nof consumption with probability one, whatever the idiosyncratic state.\nSince x' is clearly not feasible, Bennardo and Chiappori concluded that\n7, (2, ,, \u20ac) could not be zero at an equilibrium; the nonexistence result\nin proposition 5 then relies on such a claim. But this misses an important\npoint: namely, that effort is chosen before the realization of the aggre-\ngate state; thus if x! specifies low effort with probability one, so must\nx. (eq. [2]). While a contract specifying low effort with probability one\ncan provide a very high level of consumption if the high-endowment\nstate s \u2014 1 is realized, consumption in the low-endowment state s \u2014\n2 may have to be rather low. The consumer in fact needs to pay a positive\nprice for the consumption goods received in state 2, and the price can\nbe quite high\u2014and the value of the endowment quite low\u2014in s \u2014 2\nwhen the consumer exerts low effort.\n\nFormally, if (as claimed by Bennardo and Chiappori) x' is feasible for\nthe consumer, it must induce agents to exert low effort (incentive com-\npatibility has to hold) and the budget constraint must be satisfied:\n\nCa mmboxioo mio xm nix EO.\n\nAlso, if x' is strictly preferred to x^ by the consumer, so is any convex\ncombination of x^and x: x* \u2014 (1 \u2014 e)x^  ox' with \u00ab \u20ac (0, 1]. For any\no, x\" \u20ac X and satisfies the resource constraint in s \u2014 2. Since at x^ the\nresource constraint in s \u2014 1 is slack, if o is sufficiently small, the same\nis true at x^. But this contradicts the fact that x^ is a solution to (5).\n\nReferences\n\nBennardo, Alberto, and Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Chiappori. 2003. \"Bertrand and Walras\nEquilibria under Moral Hazard.\" J.PF. 111 (August): 785-817.\n\nIntriligator, Michael D. 1971.

The evidence shows that immigrants do indeed spend\nmore time shopping than natives. As a result, stores tend to lower their\nprices in order to attract these new customers. This explains the negative\nimmigration effect. Significantly, the negative immigration effect holds\nfor almost all product categories and is stronger in products for which\nimmigrants have a larger share of the expenditure supporting a demand-\nbased interpretation of this effect.\n\nMore generally, the paper shows that by changing the composition\nof demand, immigrants can have an effect on product markets. It is not\nunreasonable to expect newly arrived immigrants to have higher price\nelasticities and lower search costs than the native population, at least\nin the short run. When this occurs and immigration is large enough,\nstores will be more reluctant to raise their prices. Thus immigration can\nhave a moderating effect on inflation through its direct effect on prod-\nuct markets, and not only by increasing the supply of labor.\n\nReferences\n\nBarron, John M., Beck A.

For instance, we write the total\nreturn on gross assets z^ as\n\nmm wirt up! wirt kun,\n\nwhere 7\" denotes the real (dollar) total return on asset category i (equity, FDI,\ndebt, or other), and w/ denotes the average weight of asset category i in gr\nassets. A similar equation holds for the total return on gross liabilities z/ (with\ncorresponding returns 7 on asset category i).\n\nItis difficult to construct precise estimates of the financially weighted nominal\neffective exchange rate, needed in particular to compute net portfolio returns\nin equation (10). There is little available evidence on the currency and country\ncomposition of total foreign assets. In practice, the Treasury Survey (U.S. Trea-\nsury 2000) reports country and currency composition for long-term holdings of\nforeign securities in benchmark years. Because few data are available before\n1994, the weights are likely to be substantially off base at the beginning of our\nsample. Instead, we construct a multilateral financial exchange rate using time-\nvarying FDI historical position country weights. This exchange rate proxies the\ntrue financially weighted exchange rate that affects the dollar return on gross\nforeign assets.\" We also make the realistic assumption that most foreign asset\npositions are not hedged for currency risk (see Hau and Rey 2006). For the\nperiod 1982-2004, our estimates are very close to the BEA international in-\nvestment position at market value (see Gourinchas and Rey 2007).\n\n",

                    "478 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nTrend. Report. The higher figure is estimated from readership data for the 172\nmagazines included in the NCS. The SCADS magazines represent 5 percent of.\nthe 580 magazines in the Magazine Trend Report data but account for 30.0 percent\nof circulation\n\nThe advertisements in the 26 SCADS magazines probably account for at least\n50 percent of all magazine advertisements seen in the United States. If adver-\ntisements were placed uniformly across magazines with different circulation or\nreadership, the estimates above suggest that SCADS would capture between 30.0\nand 57.5 percent of all magazine advertisements. However, in table 6 we find.\nthat more advertisements are placed in the SCADS magazines with higher total\nreadership. By construction, the SCADS archive contains the magazines with the\nhighest readership. So assuming that the positive relationship between the num-\nber of advertisements and readership holds for the universe of magazines, we\nexpect that there are more advertisements in average issues of the SCADS mag-\nazines than in the average issues of non-SCADS magazines. As a result, we expect\nthat SCADS magazines! share of advertisements is larger than SCADS magazines\nshare of circulation or readership.

One important insight gained in this regard is that range restric-\ntions influence behavior in important and unexpected ways. The need\nfor future empirical efforts is clear, since further treatments are nec-\nessary to figure out what these restrictions mean for social preference\nmodels and what they teach us about related field applications.

The\nsolution to this is g* \u2014 0.5.\" Part c, that guilt may sometimes be experienced,\nis true because, whenever u- 0.5, the act is committed and guilt is therefore\nexperienced. Part is also true. That undesirable acts may be committed follows\nbecause, as just noted, all acts for which u2 0.5 are committed, but for any such.\nu, some situations will be such that A7 uw because the distribution of /,is positive.\n(and independent of v) on (0, 2). That desirable acts may be deterred follows\nbecause all acts for which u \u20ac0.5 are deterred, but for all acts such that u 0,\nthere will be situations in which A\u00ab u.\n\nFinally, to show that it is possible that v* \u00bb 0 but virtue may not be experienced.\nwhen situations in 5, arise, we can construct a different type of example. Suppose\nthat there is only one subset (with probability 1). Suppose further that G \u2014 0,\nso that guilt cannot be used. In addition, assume that /i is distributed indepen-\ndently of u and has a mean of 1; the cumulative distribution of u on this single\nsubset /(0.1) \u2014 0.99, F(1) \u00ab 1; 8(0.1) \u00ab 0.2, G(1) \u00bb 1; and. V\u00bb 1.? First, observe\nthat v* \u00bb 0. This is necessarily true because welfare at v \u2014 0.1 exceeds welfare\nat v \u2014 0 (and v \u2014 0.1 is feasible since V\u00bb 1): Raising v from 0 to 0.1 involves\nan inculcation cost less than 0.2, deters 0.99 of the acts and thus causes a total\nloss in conventional utility of less than 0.1 (since each deterred act is such that.\nu \u20ac0.1) and avoids harm of 0.99 (since the mean of / is 1). Second, observe\nthat v* \u00ab 1. The reason is that the inculcation cost at v \u2014 1 exceeds 1, which in\nturn exceeds the maximum possible benefit from avoiding harm, which equals\n1, so total welfare at v \u2014 1 is less than that at v \u2014 0. Finally, this implies that,\neven though v* \u00bb 0, virtue will not always be experienced, for there are situations\nin which uw 1, where the act is committed (because v\u00ab 1 and g \u2014 0), and thus\nvirtue is not experienced.\n\n",

The third official\nmatters statistically and economically.\n\nIn sum, our original result was in error as a result of a, perhaps\nunderstandable but not excusable, data collection mistake. However, we\nthink that the search for reconciliation between the findings in hockey\nand basketball is not yet done. Moreover, we think that the National\nCollegiate Athletic Association, the National Basketball Association, and\nthe citizens walking the streets of many cities in the United States are\nsteadfast believers in the impact of additional crime enforcers on the\neconomic behavior of their charges, albeit surely less than we reported\nin 1984. The value of the third official remains very real. It is statistically\nsignificant, and, perhaps most important, it seems economically\nsignificant.\n\nMistakes happen, but we are not proud of this or any other one. We\nthank Hutchinson and Yates for correcting the error, but we do not\nmake as much of it as they do.\n\nReference\n\nMcCormick, Robert E., and Robert D.

But if demand is instead spread spatially, the industry's high\ntransport costs may make it worthwhile to own several plants throughout the\nmarket. Both the standard deviation of logged employment and the HHI of\nemployment levels measure the market's spatial demand variation, for a given\ndemand level (which we control for directly in the regressions). The standard\ndeviation in demand growth rates measures the market's demand volatility, which\nmay give firms an incentive to own multiple plants in different locations in a\nmarket to diversify away idiosyncratic plantdevel risk.\n\n",

In this relaxed. problem, the effective choice variables are the slopes\nAV, (foro \u2014 Q\u2014 N, ..., Q-- N). Expressed in terms of these new choice variables\nAV, the relaxed problem is strictly convex and can therefore be solved using a\nsimple Lagrangian. In particular, if we let 4 denote the multiplier for the con-\nstraint, the firstorder condition for each value of AV, is\n\n.

When we set Vj, \u2014 V, and\nVo-s-i 7 Vs and use the same slopes AV, derived in the relaxed problem, the\nal constraint is satisfied, and therefore a solution to (A5) is achieved.\nMoreover, uniqueness of this solution follows from the fact that the solution of\nthe relaxed problem is unique and, given these unique values for AV, the only\nway to satisfy the original constraint is by setting Vj, \u2014 V,,, and Vo, \u2014\nV...

                    "40 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nin the United States the entire drop in 2005 album sales is due to losses\nata single firm, the recently merged Sony-BMG, which has experienced\nsevere postmerger integration difficulties. If file sharing were respon-\nsible for the observed sales decline in the United States, we would not\nexpect this activity to affect the products of only a single firm.\n\nThe advent of the new P2P technologies can be considered in a\nbroader context. A key question is how social welfare changes with\nweaker property rights for information goods. To make such a calcu-\nlation, we would need to know how the production of music responds\nto the presence of file sharing. On the basis of our results, we do not\nbelieve that file sharing had a significant effect on the supply of recorded\nmusic. For artists who produce commercially relevant products, the ef-\nfects documented in this study are simply too small to change the num-\nber or quality of recordings that they release. And for new bands that\nare about to launch their career, the probability of success is so low as\nto make the expected income from producing music virtually zero, so\nfile sharing will not change the relevant incentives. If we are correct in\narguing that downloading has had little effect on the incentives to pro-\nduce music, we agree with Rob and Waldfogel (2006), who find that\nfile sharing likely increased aggregate welfare. The limited shifts from\nsales to downloads are simply transfers between firms and consumers.\nBut the sheer magnitude of P2P activity, the billions of songs down-\nloaded each year, suggests that the added social welfare from file sharing\nis likely to be high.\n\nReferences\n\nArbitron. 2006.

Hence, for k \u20ac k, legal change is good if it\nis good when only pro-O judges distinguish their precedent. In this respect, two\ncases must be considered. If A(A) 2 E(A(A)) (i.e., the activism of pro-Vjudges\non their precedent reduces welfare), then legal change is good for k \u20ac k because,\neven if we add to the activism of pro-O judges the harmful activism of pro-V\njudges on their own precedents, then social losses are exactly the same as under\n4 0.

With the exception of two variables that are\nboth measured by blood tests, albumin and bilirubin (where the rates of missing\ndata were 24 percent), we do not have a lot of missing data (rates were less\nthan 3 percent). Furthermore, there is no relationship between the presence\nof missing values for albumin and bilirubin and the intensity of an area. Nor\ndoes having missing values for these variables affect the probability of receiving\ncatheterization.\n\nReferences\n\nAndersen, Henning R., et al. 2003. \"A Comparison of Coronary Angioplasty with\nFibrinolytic Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction.\" New England J.

Hence, Wu, \u2014 G(), p) \u2014 G(, p) for all 8 (see fig.

Conclusions\n\nWe have developed a framework for valuing improvements in health\nbased on willingness to pay and used this framework to estimate the\nvalue of past and prospective health advances. The resulting values are\nlarge. Reductions in mortality from 1970 to 2000 had an (uncounted)\neconomic value to the 2000 U.S. population of about $3.2 trillion per\nyear. Cumulative longevity gains during the twentieth century were worth\nabout $1.3 million per person to the representative member of the 2000\nU.S. population. Valued at the date they occurred, the production of\nlongevity-related *health capital\" would raise estimates of per capita\noutput in the United States by from 10 to 50 percent, depending on\nthe time period in question.\n\nProspectively, even modest progress against diseases such as cancer\nand heart disease would have enormous social values. A 1 percent re-\nduction in mortality from cancer or heart disease would be worth nearly\n$500 billion to current and future Americans. These estimates ignore\nthe value of health advances to individuals in other countries, so they\nunderstate aggregate social values of possible innovations. They also\nignore corresponding improvements in the quality of life\u2014which evi-\ndence suggests may be even more valuable than gains in longevity\u2014\nand for these reasons as well they are likely to be conservative. We show\nthat these values will increase in the future because of economic growth\nand, more interestingly, because health itself continues to improve.\n\nLarge as they are, these values may be offset by the costs of developing\nand implementing health improvements. Current public and private\nspending on health-related research is a tiny fraction of potential ben-\nefits, yet such investments may not be worthwhile if the costs of imple-\nmenting new technologies are large. Social transfer programs and other\nthird-party methods of financing health care can distort both utilization\ndecisions and research, with the result that some health improvements\nare socially inefficient.\n\nReferences\n\nArthur, W. B. 1981. *The Economics of Risks to Life.\" A.E.R. 71 (March): 54\u2014\n64.\n\n?' This method may overstate \"quality\" gains for several reasons. One is that we may\nhave overstated the rate of decline in //(). But then our estimates of the value of increased\nlongevity would be lar mortality may decline for reasons unrelated to\n\"health,\" c.g., a decline in accident rates.\n\n"

                    "954 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nOne reason that insurers do not adopt per mile premium policies on\ntheir own is that so much of the gains are external and the monitoring\ncosts are internal. Currently a firm that quotes such premium schedules\nbears all the costs of monitoring mileage but gleans only a fraction of\nthe benefit: ts insureds cut back their driving, others avoid accidents\n(with them), and these others and their insurance companies benefit\nconsiderably. This externality, which is exactly what we have estimated,\nis what suggests that regulatory intervention could be warranted. Some\nhave suggested that insurers might band together to adopt per mile\npremiums without regulation, but there is little incentive to do that\n(even if it were not illegal price fixing) since they would compete away\nany gains.\n\nTo conclude, substantially more research on accident externalities\nfrom driving seems appropriate, particularly given the apparent size of\nthe external costs. There is substantial heterogeneity within states in\ntraffic density, so more refined data (such as county-evel data or time-\nof-day data) would yield more accurate estimates of the effect of traffic\ndensity and correspondingly of external marginal costs. In principle, it\nwould also be instructive to disaggregate traffic density into its com-\nponents by the age of the driver and by vehicle type. Likewise, it would\nbe instructive to study micro-level data correlating the number of ve-\nhicles involved in the average accident with accident costs and frequency.\n\nB\n\nReferences\n\nAyres, Ian, and Barry Nalebuff. 2003. \"Make Car Insurance Fairer.\" Forbes 171\n(March 17): 54.\n\nBelmont, D.

If at a solution the value of the objective function is nonpositive, then no\n8\"(b,,) can be entered into the basis to improve the value of the objective\nfunction. If, instead, the value is positive, the solution is used to update the\nbasis, new simplex multipliers to the alternative Pareto program are calculated,\nand the algorithm continues.\n\nThe advantage of this algorithm is that /,,, m \u2014 1, ..., M,, does not need to\nbe stored in computer memory. Instead, a /,,, is generated from II, only as it is\nneeded. The algorithm will converge because the simplex algorithm finds a\nsolution in a finite number of iterations. Furthermore, speed is not usually an\nissue because simplex-based algorithms tend to quickly converge in practice.\n\nReferences\n\nAghion, Philippe, and Patrick Bolton. 1997. *A Theory of Trickle-Down Growth\nand Development.\" Rev.

                    "BEHAVIORAL BIASES 535\n\ncan suggest an early-evolutionary origin for these biases in humans. This\nrelies heavily on the fact that on questions of origin, it is widely accepted\nin both cognitive science and evolutionary psychology that a mechanism\nis most likely evolutionarily ancient if it explains analogous behavior in\nboth humans and primates. That is, since primates and humans are\nclosely related, it is unlikely that a common trait evolved in parallel\nbetween our two species, and much more likely that common traits\nevolved once during our common evolutionary heritage. While our re-\nsults are by no means definitive proof that loss aversion is innate in\nhumans, to the degree that they make us more likely to believe that\nsome amount of this behavior has a biological component, they may\nhave implications for how we treat loseaverse tendencies in human\nbehavior.\n\nFor example, if these biases are innate, we may be more inclined to\nbelieve that they will persist in both common and novel settings, will\nbe stable across time and cultures, and may endure even in the face of\nlarge individual costs, ample feedback, or repeated market disciplining.\nThis would greatly constrain both the potential for successful policy\nintervention and the types of remedies available. In contrast, while a\nlearned, noninnate heuristic may arise in many (if not all) cultures, we\nmay not expect it to persist in settings in which it was highly suboptimal\nor in which market forces strongly discipline behavior. This would limit\nthe potential scope and scale for welfare losses and may suggest that\npolicy interventions that increase feedback or learning may eliminate\nwhat losses do exist.\n\nShort of this attributional leap, however, that loss-averse behavior is\nnot confined to humans can be seen as adding scope to the growing\nevidence of lossaverse behavior in many aspects of human economic\nbehavior. Understanding how broadly these biases manifest themselves\nmay influence how we should incorporate them into an adequate model\nof individual decision making. It is hoped that our paper also suggests\nthe utility of methodological exchanges between economics and the\nclosely related behavioral sciences. Bringing the analytic framework of\nrevealed preference to bear on questions at the intersection of eco-\nnomics, biology, and psychology carries the possibility of insights useful\nto each.\n\n",

This\nimplies that from history (GG, ey onward, the c^ allocation must be nonautarkic;\n\nin other words, X^ M/s\") 2 X;., Me) for all s', where 72 r-- 1 is not pos-\nsible. The reason is that the c\" Palocaion also solves the (GP) problem, and\n^. 9...) \u00ab0 together with X,\" Me//() 2 X, Mo/) for all s2 (s, o)\n\nwould imply that the social planner in the (Gp). problem could increase welfare\nby defaulting in history (s', oy.)\n\nNext, recall proposition 1. The result extends to the problem (GP^); that is,\nwith a binding participation constraint, the equilibrium c consumption stream\nfrom (s, \u00ab,.,) onward is identical to the stream after default in the V/\"(s',\n0,4) problem. Since the allocation after (s^, \u00ab,,,) is nonautarkic, the continu-\nation values are such that V/\"(s', o,,,) \u00bb V/(s^, &,.,) since the objective function\nis strictly concave. A social planner in the original centralized problem (GP)\ncould therefore relax the participation constraint in history (s, &,,,) that had.\na strictly positive Lagrange multiplier, and thereby increase weighted utility.\n",

                    "604 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nVIII \u2014 Conclusions\n\nRottenberg concludes his essay with a return to the reserve rule and\n\nconstraints on freedom to contract vis\u00e0-vis market outcomes:\n\nMarkets in which the freedom to buy and sell is constrained\nby the reserve rule or by the suggested alternatives to it do not\npromise better results than do markets constructed on the\npostulate of freedom. It appears that free markets would give\nas good aggregate results as any other kind of market for in-\ndustries, like the baseball industry, in which all firms must be\nnearly equal if each is to prosper. On welfare criteria, of course,\nthe free market is superior to the others, for in such a market\neach worker receives the full value of his services, and exploi-\ntation does not occur. (258)\n\nWith 50 years of hindsight and subsequent research, Rottenberg's\nlogic and observations stand up remarkably well. In addition to players\nreceiving more of their marginal revenue product (and owners fewer\nrents) in freer labor markets, resources devoted to the training of players\nunder free agency remain sufficient to ensure high-quality play on the\nfield, and competition in baseball appears to be as vigorous today as\ndebates about it.\n",

                    "2932 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nBut Lucas's work is not quantitative dynamic general equilibrium, and\nonly nine years later did Finn and I figure out how to quantitatively\nderive the implications of theory and measurement for business cycle\nfluctuations using the full discipline of dynamic stochastic general equi-\nlibrium theory and national accounts statistics. That we have learned\nthat business cycles of the quantitative nature observed are what theory\npredicts is testimony to the grand research program of Ragnar Frisch\nand to the vision and creative genius of Robert Lucas.\n\nOn nearly every dimension I am in agreement with what Frisch ad-\nvocated in his Nobel Prize address, but on one dimension I am not.\nLike Frisch, I am a fervent believer in the democratic process. The\ndimension on which I disagree is how economists and policy makers\nshould interact. His view is that the democratic political process should\ndetermine the objective, and economists should then determine the\nbest policy given this objective. My view is that economists should ed-\nucate the people so that they can evaluate macroeconomic policy rules\nand that the people, through their elective representatives, should pick\nthe policy rule. I emphasize that Finn's and my \"Rules Rather than\nDiscretion\" paper finds that public debate should be over rules and that\nrules should be changed only infrequently, and with a lag to mitigate\nthe time consistency problem.\n\nReferences\n\nAuerbach, Alan J., Laurence J.

                    "254 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nThere are several limitations of the analysis in this paper. For example,\nI employ armevel data from parallelarmed trials. To generate results\nthat would inspire greater confidence, one would like patient-level data\n(which are not subject to aggregation bias) and data from crossover\ntrials (which should generate more precise estimates).\" Moreover, my\ntest examines the effects of change in beliefs about the probability of\ntreatment rather than about the value of treatment on outcomes. The\ntwo effects are equal only when outcomes are a function of the expected\nvalue of treatment. The gap is analogous to that between expected\nincome and expected utility of income.\n\nThere are a number of questions that naturally follow from my find-\nings. First, to what extent are placebo effects a behavioral phenomenon?\nThe negative placebo effects from consumption of Pravachol and Mev-\nacor suggest moral hazard, which is a behavioral phenomenon. But not\nenough is known about the physiological effects of expectation to rule\nout that modality even in these cases. Moreover, it is odd that behavioral\neffects would vary across drugs within the same class of medication.\nNonetheless, it could be that all statins have counterproductive behav-\nioral effects but that some also experience physiological placebo effects\nthat more than offset those effects.\n\nSecond, are placebo effects keyed to patient beliefs about pharma-\ncological effects or to patient beliefs about pharmacological and placebo\neffects, and how are these beliefs generated? The answer to the latter\nquestion, in particular, is central to determining whether beliefs can be\nemployed to reduce health care costs and whether placebo effects are\na serious challenge to the independence axiom.\n\nReferences\n\nAmanzio, Martina, and Fabrizio Benedetti. 1999. *Neuropharmacological Dis-\nsection of Placebo Analgesia: Expectation-Activated Opioid Systems versus\nConditioning-Activated Specific Subsystems.\" J.

(If the field goal was attempted from less than 20 yards\nfrom the goal line, however, the defense gets a first down on its 20.yard line\nrather than at the point of the attempt.) After either a touchdown or a field\ngoal, the scoring team kicks off from its 30-yard line, as at the beginning of the\nime.\n\nB^ the final (and by far the least common) way to score is a safety: if the offense\nis pushed back across its own goal line, the defense scores 2 points, and the\noffense puts the ball in play by kicking to the other team from its ?0-yard line\n(a \"free kick\").\n\nThe game is divided into four 15-minute periods.

We therefore conclude\nthat. /he world. of economists has been. and still is spanned by a collection of.\ninterlinked stars and that this is critical for understanding the short average\ndistances.\n\nIV. Concluding Remarks\n\nIn this paper we have found substantial evidence that the world of\neconomists is becoming smaller. Further, we have identified stable and\nchanging features of the structure of coauthorship in economics. The\nanalysis allows us to make two general points. The first point concerns\na stable feature of the network: interlinked stars span the network of\ncollaboration, and this explains the small average distance between\neconomists. The second point concerns an important change: there has\nbeen a significant increase in the average degree of the network.\n\nThese results are very striking and lead us to ask questions about the\nprocess of network formation. In particular, we would like to better\nunderstand what the economic determinants of coauthorship are and\nhow the interlinked star architecture comes about.

                    "1212 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\nAppendix C\nStandard Error Adjustment\n\nFollowing Kloek (1981), Moulton (1990, eq. 3) provides a simple formula for\nthe adjusted OLS covariance matrix in the presence of clustered observations:\n\nC o*(X'X) [1 * (n\u2014 Dl.\n\nAs usual, o?(X'X)! is the standard OLS covariance matrix; 1 - (m \u2014 1)p is the\nadjustment factor, with m representing the number of observations per group\nand p the intergroup correlation. This formula will hold strictly only when the\nnumber of observations per group is the same. However, as Moulton points out,\nit is a close approximation to the true adjustment factor as long as the groups\nare of similar size.\n\nTn the example used in this paper, I do not observe the family size for each\nchild directly. Instead, I observe the average family size for each study. To be\nconservative in the adjustment factor, I assume that o\u00bb is equal to the largest\naverage family size in the studies used: m \u2014 6.\n\nThe other adjustment factor necessary here is p\u2014the interclass correlation.\nEssentially, this is simply the correlation of gender across any two randomly\nchosen children in the same family. Ideally, this would be done in places with\nlow levels of hepatitis B. To get some sense of the size of p, I put together\nhousehold surveys from several countries with low HBV rates (Nicaragua, Do-\nminican Republic, and Guatemala). In this set of countries, I look at the cor-\nrelation in gender of the first and second children, the first and third children,\nand the second and third children in roughly 12,000 families. This correlation\nis 0.0025. With this, I have sufficient information with which to adjust the stan-\ndard errors, and the corrected standard errors are presented in table 9.\n\nReferences\n\nAcemoglu, Daron, David H.

For example, the student may come back to\nthe notes taken in the amphitheater and try to grasp what he had not\nunderstood then. Or he may ask someone else to explain the material\nto him without reference to the notes he took (in the same way managers\nmay ask for a second opinion).\n\nAllowing for interactive communication is a very interesting avenue\nfor research, with natural applications for the design of educational/\ntraining programs, for example. Interactive communication has several\nbenefits: (i) it can allow 5 to monitor A5 effort through periodic checks\nof his understanding; (ii) rehearsal by R of specific fragments of the\nmessage can happen immediately while they await the completion of\nthe overall lecture in an amphitheater, say; and (iii) therefore, com-\nmunication can be adaptive: 5 can spend more time on questions that\nR does not understand well and less time on others (in particular, $5 can\nmore easily detect how much of the context is familiar with). On the\nother hand, interactive communication may exacerbate moral hazard:\nEach party gets a \"second chance\" and therefore may exert insufficient\neffort even relative to the one-shot case. Investigating this in detail is a\nnatural topic for further research.\n\nOur framework can also generate interesting implications for com-\nmunication strategies in markets. Think of advertising strategies pursued\nby an incumbent, who enjoys a brand-name advantage, and an entrant.\nNatural questions include the following: (i) Should the entrant or the\nincumbent or both engage in comparative advertising? (ii) Who would\nwant to rely on cues or on issue-relevant communication? (iii) How do\nthe answers to questions i and ii depend on the degree of product\ndifferentiation (which influences the \"stake\" consumers have in under-\nstanding the advertising content)? These important questions are left\nfor future research.\n\n",

                    "INSURANCE WITHIN THE FIRM 1085\n\nFor future work, it would be useful to extend our analysis to countries\nwith different institutional settings and different degrees of financial\nmarket development, which might influence the role of the firm as\ninsurance provider. Moreover, the large amount of wage insurance we\nestimate begs the question of how firms provide workers with appro-\npriate incentives. It would be of interest to assess the relative importance\nof different devices for eliciting effort, such as promotions and threat\nof termination. Finally, our estimates may be only a partial characteri-\nzation of the insurance role of the firm. Besides offering insurance\nagainst idiosyncratic shocks to its performance, the firm may facilitate\nthe emergence of insurance mechanisms against workerspecific shocks.\nThese shocks, unlikely to be formally insured in the market for the usual\nmoral hazard reasons, may be at least partially diversified within the\nfirm, since workers! repeated interaction at the workplace favors risk\npooling.\n\nReferences\n\nAbowd, John M., Francis Kramarz, and David N.

We also know, from fixed-point theory, that the equi-\nlibrium correspondence is uhc in e and that the set of equilibria for any given\neis compact. For every e, we choose an equilibrium that gives state 1 firms the\nlargest value. This equilibrium is well defined because the set of equilibria is\ncompact, and the value of a firm is a continuous function of (x, v, q. y, n).\nFurther, for sufficiently small 2s, this largest equilibrium value is nonnegative,\nand for sufficiently large es, it is nonpositive. We let ?* be the supremum of\nthe set of zs for which this value is nonnegative. Then, by upper hemicontinuity,\nthe value at ?* is nonnegative. On the other hand, if e\u00bb \u00a3*, the value at any\nequilibrium corresponding to eis negative. Therefore, e* is consistent with free\nentry: even if the largest equilibrium value at 2* is positive, the value of entry\nwould be negative if the measure of entrants were any higher than e*.

QED\n\nProof of Proposition 4\n\nWe shall in fact prove a slightly stronger result than proposition 4. We shall show\nthat, given any allocation of productive tasks across the n agents (i.c., tasks that.\neach generate a strictly positive value), a pyramidal hierarchy maximizes value\nin all ex post events. The ex ante first-best is thus achieved v\u00eda some pyramidal\nhierarchy through the optimal allocation of tasks.\n\nThe proof is by induction on n. The proposition holds trivially for n \u2014 1.\n\nConsider n2? agents and any allocation of productive tasks. Select one\nagent\u2014let us call her agent n\u2014whose task (A) is such that there is no one with\n\u00e0 broader remit (i.e., there is no one whose task /(A) is such that A strictly\nincludes A). By our nestedness assumption N, the other \u00bb\u2014 l agents can\nbe partitioned into two sets, / and /^: in J, everyone has a task (A) such that\n\u00c0 \u20ac A; in /^, everyone has a task /(A) such that An A \u2014 i.\n\nFrom the induction hypothesis, in the absence of agent \u00bb, a pyramidal hi-\nerarchy, H7^, say, comprising the other n \u2014 1 agents would maximize value in\nall ex post events. Construct a larger pyramidal hierarchy, /7\", comprising all n\nagents, which is the same as //\"^' except that agent n is placed in seniority above.\neveryone else on each of the assets in A.\n\nConsider the event in which agent n has an idea: event E, say. In this event,\nby the conditional superadditivity of v(), value is maximized if agent n imple-\nments her idea, irrespective of which agents in / (or /\") have ideas (agent n's\nimplementation of her idea does not interfere with the implementation of ideas\nby agents in /^). But given that agent n is senior on all the assets in A, hierarchy\nH\" thus always maximizes value conditional on \u00a3F.\n\nNow consider the complementary event in which agent \u00bb does not have an\nidea: event E'. Conditioning on \u00a3' has no effect on the values of any of the\nother n \u2014 1 agents' ideas. Hence, conditional on \u00a3', hierarchy H\" always max-\nimizes value (given that the subhierarchy H\"^' always maximizes value in the\nabsence of agent n).\n\nIn sum, hierarchy FH\" maximizes value in all events.

These observations lie at the heart of the\nview that sticky tradable goods prices are an important source of RER\nmovements.\n\nNext, we examine our results when we work with log (RER)). We\nfind that log (RER)) is much less volatile than log (RER ). However,\nthere is substantial heterogeneity across countries in the ratio of the\nstandard deviation of log(RER)) to the standard deviation of\nlog (RER). To relate this statistic to the Engel decomposition (11),\nwe compute the variance on both sides of that equation by abstracting\nfrom the covariance between log (RER;) and log (RER;) 5 We find\nthat movements in log (RER)) account, on average, for 63 percent\nof the standard deviation in log(RER). We also find that\nlog (RER)) is much less correlated with the logarithm of the nominal\nexchange rate, log (1/S), than log (RER). The average correlation\nwith the logarithm of the nominal exchange rate is 95 percent for\nlog (RER)) but only 67 percent for log (RER).\n\nWe conclude that changes in the prices of nontradable goods relative\nto pure traded goods account for a significant fraction of movements\nin the RER. But fluctuations in the prices of pure traded goods across\ncountries account for the majority of small movements in the RER.\n\nVII Conclusion\n\nIn this paper we argue that the primary force behind the large fall in\nreal exchange rates that occurs after large devaluations is the slow ad-\njustment in the price of nontradable goods and services. It is not the\nfailure of relative PPP for goods that are actually traded.\n\nWe do not address the question of why the rate of inflation for non-\ntradable goods is so much lower than the rate of devaluation. An im-\nportant task for future research is to develop quantitative general equi-\nlibrium models that can account for this phenomenon.\n\nReferences\n\nBaharad, Eyal, and Benjamin Eden. 2004. \"Price Rigidity and Price Dispersion\nEvidence from Micro Data.\" Rev.

Furthermore, through a\nchange of the integration variable, (A6) implies f, xdF(x-- p* \u2014 &*) \u20ac s, which in.\nturn implies [sxdF(x- p* \u2014 e*) \u20ac s for any R and hence from (1) V(t*, e*, p*,\nR) X0 for any R. Therefore, max,(V(d*, e*, p*, R), 0) \u2014 0, and so (d*, e*, *,\ntisfies (5) as well. Thus (d*, e*, f*, R*) is an equilibrium with no trade iff\nR* \u2014 0 and d*, e, and p* satisfy (A4)-(A6).\n\nWith the necessary and sufficient conditions established for each of the two\ntypes of equilibrium, a range of s is now identified for which each of these\nconditions holds. Let e(x) be defined by c'(e(x)) \u2014 1 \u2014 F(3), and let p(x) \u2014\n[1 \u2014 F(3]/f(). The concavity of T implies that x- e(x) \u2014 o(x) is increasing in x.\nIf \u00ab(0) \u2014 o(0) \u00ab 0, let 7be defined by 7 \u00ab() \u2014 6) \u2014 0 (in this case this equation\nhas a unique solution since x-- e(x) \u2014 p() is increasing and is positive for x \u2014\n1); otherwise let  \u2014 0. Let $ 5 [,/(u \u20145)dF(u).\n\nRecall r* from (10). It has been shown above that there is an equilibrium.\nwith trade (0, e*, p*, R*) iff &* \u2014 e(*), p* \u2014 p(r*), and R* \u2014 rc e* - p*2\n0. Since, for s\u00ab 5, we have r*\u00bbr and hence r* * &* \u2014 p* 0 and, for s\u00bb 5, we\nhave r* \u00ab rand hence r* * e* \u2014 f* \u00ab0, there exists an equilibrium with trade if\n5\u00ab 5, and there is not such an equilibrium if s\u00bb 5.\n\nNow, if (d*, e*, p*, 0) is an equilibrium with no trade, then e* and f* satisfy\n(A4)-(A6). Therefore, e&* \u2014 e(p* \u2014 &*), p* \u2014 p(p* \u2014 e*), and p* \u2014 &* 2 r*.

For $5, let &* \u2014\n\u00ab(?) and f* \u2014 p(). Thus e* and f* satisfy (A4)-(A5). Observe that either 5* \u2014\n\u00a3* \u2014 ror r\u2014 0.

                    "HIRING POLICIES 837\nVII. Conclusion\n\nWe build a model of job and worker flows in which worker turnover in\nexcess of job turnover results from the desire to create high-quality\nmatches in a world in which match quality is not perfectly observable\nex ante. Hiring practices play an important role in the resource allo-\ncation process in this economy: firms and workers decide how much\nscreening takes place prior to forming a match. We show analytically\nthat equilibrium hiring practices are influenced by various labor market\npolicies. These changes in hiring practices will influence observed labor\nmarket dynamics and in particular affect measures such as worker turn-\nover and unemployment durations. Our quantitative assessment suggests\nthat these elements can account for a sizable fraction of differences in\nworker turnover in the United States and continental Europe. We also\nshow that the welfare costs of distorting the hiring process are sub-\nstantial.\n\nOur model also suggests a novel perspective on the role of temporary\ncontracts. While much work emphasizes the role that these contracts\nplay in allowing firms to respond to temporary fluctuations, our model\nsuggests that another key role is in facilitating the worker screening\nprocess. Recent work by Portugal and Varej\u00e0o (2003) using data from\nPortugal concludes that screening for permanent jobs is the single most\nimportant role played by temporary contracts.\n\nThis paper suggests several areas for future work. On the empirical\nside, although the effects we have emphasized are consistent with ob-\nserved patterns in aggregate cross-country data, it is also of interest to\nobtain cross-country micro data of high enough quality to allow a more\ndetailed assessment of the mechanics stressed in this paper. On the\ntheoretical side, there is also much to learn about the more proactive\nmeans\u2014aside from simply being more selective\u2014that firms can utilize\nin order to reduce costly worker turnover, such as job training or more\nresource-intensive recruiting techniques.\n\n",

(A7)\n\nl\u2014-na\n\nTaking the expectation of (A4) over v, and using integration by parts, we obtain\n\n116) Qv).\n\nYo Up s E E[TRO\n\nso that (A5) follows. QED\n\nNow, using lemma A2, we prove propositions 4 and 5. From (A5), it is clear\nthat a feasible auction mechanism is revenue maximizing if it (1) assigns the\nobject to the bidder with the highest marginal revenue if the highest marginal\nrevenue is positive and leaves the object in the hands of the seller otherwise,\nand (2) gives the lowest type zero expected utility.\n\nWe first prove. proposition 4. Under the restriction that the seller cannot\ncommit to keeping the good, a feasible auction mechanism is revenue maxi-\nmizing if it assigns the good to the bidder with the highest marginal revenue\n(even if negative) and guarantees the lowest-type bidder zero expected utility.\nIt is clear that (v) in (7) is strictly increasing in v since the denominator of\nthe integrand in (7) is strictly positive when o \u00ab 1/n. So the lowest-price auction\na ns the object to the bidder with the highest value and, hence, to the bidder\nth the highest marginal revenue. Furthermore, a zero-type bidder bids zero\naccording to (7), which sets the auction's revenue at zero, leaving the lowest-\ntype bidder with zero expected utility. Hence, the lowest-price all-pay auction is\nrevenue maximizing. (We have already shown that revenue increases with o in\nthe proof of proposition 2.)\n\nNext we turn to proposition 5. In the equilibrium defined by (11), only bidders\nwith values v\u00bb? submit a bid according to a strictly increasing bid function\nwhereas bidders with values v\u00ab ? abstain from bidding. Hence, T' assigns the\ngood only to bidders with positive marginal revenues (if at all). Moreover, the\nbidding function in (11) is strictly increasing in v so that the bidder with the\nhighest marginal revenue receives the object. Finally, the expected utility of a\nbidder with the lowest type equals zero over both stages of I since\n\nU(p, x, 0) \u2014 (na \u2014 De * or(n \u2014 D \u2014 F()] \u2014 0\n\nby the definition of e. The given strategies constitute a Bayesian Nash equilib-\nrium, and when these are played, T maximizes (A5) and is thus optimal. Rev-\nenues increase with o since the denominator of (A5) is decreasing in o.

We also consider transfers 7 that\nare the same for all agents but are random over time. This version\ndelivers natural results and remains fairly tractable: we show that if 7 is\nindependently and identically distributed, then $ and q are constant;\nand if 7 is persistent, \u00f3 and q are smaller in periods of high 7 because\nthis implies forecasts of higher future inflation.\n\nOther extensions include the paper by Aruoba and Wright (2003),\nwho add neoclassical firms and capital\u2014that is, they make general goods\nstorable\u2014and integrate the framework with a standard real business\ncycle model. However, they assume that capital is not used in the de-\ncentralized. market, which implies some very special results; Waller\n(2003) and Aruoba, Waller, and Wright (2004) generalize this. Lagos\nand Rocheteau (2004) make the general good storable and allow it to\ncompete with money as a medium of exchange. Rocheteau and Wright\n(2005) add heterogeneity and free entry, which allows one to analyze\neffects on the extensive margin (number of trades), in addition to the\nintensive margin. (quantity per trade). Lagos and. Rocheteau (2005)\nendogenize search intensity and study the effects of inflation on velocity,\noutput, and welfare. Some of these papers also consider alternative\npricing mechanisms, such as price taking or posting, instead of bar-\ngaining. See also Ennis (2004), Faig and Huangfu (2004), and Roche-\nteau and Waller (2004). Ennis (2004) and Rocheteau and Wright (forth-\ncoming) redo the quantitative experiments in this paper under some\nof these alternative pricing mechanisms.\n\nFaig (2004) asks when credit and insurance markets can replace quasi-\nlinear utility. Williamson (forthcoming) studies policy in a version with\nseasonal and other fluctuations in the demand for liquidity. Lagos\n(2005) extends the basic environment to study liquidity and asset prices.\nBhattacharya, Haslag, and Martin (2005) study policy with heteroge-\nneous agents. Reed and Waller (2004) discuss risk sharing. Berentsen,\nCamera, and Waller (2004) and He, Huang, and Wright (2005) intro-\nduce roles for banks. Rocheteau and Craig (2004) consider \"sticky\"\npri Berentsen et al. (2005) assume that agents may be in the de-\ncentralized market for more that one round of trade, which makes the\ndistribution no longer degenerate but still tractable. Kahn, Thomas, and\nWright (2004) assume that utility is not quasidinear; this model can be\nsolved numerically to show that when wealth effects are not too big, the\nresults are close to those derived here. While not an exhaustive list, this\ngivesa sense ofa few of the applications and extensions that are possible.\n\nReferences\n\nAruoba, S.

                    "EQUILIBRIUM DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME 309\n\nciently compact is meant that the equilibrium distribution of income is\na mean-preserving spread of the initial distribution.\n\nThis principal result is proved when there are complete markets in\nstatus, with higher and lower status levels sold at an equilibrium set of\nhedonic prices. The paper shows, however, that the result also follows\nwhen status is acquired only indirectly through the purchase of status\ngoods.\n\nMoreover, our principal result on an equilibrium distribution of in-\ncome does not require that status be sold either directly or indirectly.\nAlthough sociologists have identified many determinants of status, most\neconomic analyses relate status to relative position, as in rank in the\ndistribution of income. We show that the principal result holds when\nstatus is automatically related to income rank. Then all initial distri-\nbutions within a range have the same equilibrium distribution of\nincome.\n\nWhen status is either directly or indirectly bought and sold, the equi-\nlibrium distributions of income and status would be exactly the same\nas that produced by a utilitarian social planner who can fully allocate\nconsumption and status. However, these equilibria are not generally\nidentical when status depends on ranks because changes in a person's\nrank, say through winning or losing lotteries, impose positive and neg-\native externalities on others by lowering or raising their ranks. In the\nrank case the equilibrium distribution of income produced by lotteries\ndiffers from that desired by a planner.\n\nWith a few prominent exceptions, economists have not assumed that\nbehavior is important in directly \"choosing\" the observed distribution\nof income. Building on some of these exceptions, our paper shows that\nthe assumption of risk taking and lotteries to acquire higher status and\nhigher incomes leads to predictions about the distribution of income\nthat might explain both differences and similarities in income distri-\nbutions among societies, and over time within the same society. This\nsuggests that choice and risk taking are crucial ingredients of the ob-\nserved distributions of income and status.\n\n",

Single-equation estimates of the impact on\ncollege attendance are also very large for this group, but the degree of\npositive selection on the observables that determine college attendance\nis sufficiently large that one could not rule out selection bias as the full\nexplanation for the CH effect on college attendance. Third, we do not\nfind much evidence that CH boosts test scores for the C8 sample or for\nurban minorities.\n\nIn closing, we caution against the potential for misuse of the idea of\nusing observables to draw inferences about selection bias.\" The as-\nsumptions required for condition 1 and condition 4 imply that it is\ndangerous to infer too much about selection on the unobservables from\nselection on the observables if the observables are small in number and\nexplanatory power, or if they are unlikely to be representative of the\nfull range of factors that determine an outcome. The theoretical anal-\nysis in Altonji et al. (2002) that we summarize here is only the start of.\nthe methodological work that is needed. Priorities include a Monte\nCarlo analysis of how the methods perform in the context of real-world\nexamples and a systematic look at how the performance of our methods\nvaries with the content of major data sets.\n",

                    "236 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nwhich, in turn, provide additional impetus to the nation's industry and\ncommerce.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nHume's economic writings have been subject to a series of controversies,\nfeaturing commentators from Oswald and Tucker to Keynes and Fried-\nman. While this interpretive multiplicity is due, in part, to a lack of care\nin reading the text and procrustean attempts to claim Hume as an\nintellectual progenitor, the primary explanation must focus on Hume's\nmethodological pragmatism and the fact that he chose thematic essays,\nrather than a more systematic treatise, to express his ideas on political\neconomy. By providing a careful reading of the text and the context\nand by explicitly recognizing that Hume made an analytical distinction\nbetween endogenous and exogenous money, this paper resolves the\nlongstanding controversy of whether Hume misapplied the quantity\ntheory, as well as overturns the commonly held view that Hume was an\ninflationist.\n\n",

                    "THE SOCIAL DISCOUNT RATE 1267\n\nomists, choice behavior would provide far more evidence than discus-\nsions of the sources of utility would. In this light, the most interesting\nquestion is whether or not choices are made that would allow prefer-\nences over past consumption to be measured. Can preferences over the\npast be revealed through choice behavior?\n\nEmpathic choices offer intriguing opportunities for observing pref-\nerences over past consumption. Parents in particular often act as social\nplanners for their children, working hard to ensure that their children\nwill have fond memories. Parental choices may therefore provide in-\nformation on the role of memory in utility. How much insight into the\nutility of the past can be gleaned from choice-based information of this\nsort is an open question.\"\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nThe principle of revealed preference has been oversold, in particular\nwhen used to justify use of the market interest rate in evaluating social\ninvestments. We highlight the limitations of the principle in dynamic\nsettings and provide conditions under which policy makers should be\nmore patient than private citizens.\n\nReferences\n\nAbel, Andrew B. 1987. \"Operative Gift and Bequest Motives.\" A.E.R. 77 (Decem-\nber): 1037-47.\n\nArrow, Kenneth J., and Mordecai Kurz. 1970.

                    "1362 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\nProof of Proposition 11\n\nFrom point c, consider r as a function of y and z(1). Note that 7 is increasing\nin 7(1), for all \u00bb, and so is [;7df. Thus, if a mean-preserving spread of y raises\n(lowers) fi rdp, r(1) must fall (rise) to restore [;7dp \u2014 1, and w(1) \u2014 w(0) must\nfall (rise). For r \u20ac (-1, 0], it can be readily verified that 7 is convex in p. There-\nfore, firdp is the expected value of a convex function of p, so it rises with a\nmean-preserving spread in ji and w(1) \u2014 w(0) must fall. For r\u00bb0, z is convex\nin p on [0, 1] iff it is convex as p 1. This is true as r0, but not as r I.\nHence for any given distribution of p (and therefore any given ), there exists\n7* e (0, 1) such that 7 is convex in p for r& r*, and part i of proposition 11\nfollows. For r2 1, 7 has a convex kink at 1(f,,) but is concave for p p(fui.).\nAs ro, f, 0. That is, z(u(f)) converges on unity from a concave function\nthat emanates from a point approaching the origin, so any mean-preserving\nspread of y reduces f, rdp (infinitesimally) and widens w(1) \u2014 w(0).

The sign and magnitude of our transport\ncost elasticity are inconsistent with PTM unless one assumes extremely\nlarge monopoly markups.\n\nFinally, the price effects we observe are quite large, implying signif-\nicant variation in relative demands across destinations. But some remote\ncountries face high transportation costs (and low tariffs) when exporting\nto all destinations.

Q.E.D.\n\nWe end the proof by induction on the number of individuals. Assume theorem\n3 to be true for any set with at most \u00bb \u2014 1 individuals (it is trivially true for a\nunique agent), and consider \u00bb individuals. By step 4, there exists an individual,\nsay n, with C, \u2014 [1], who, moreover, by step 6, is linked to a unique individual,\nsay n\u2014 1. Consider the network G., obtained from G by dropping the link\n(n \u2014 1, n): itis a tree on N\u2014 (a). For each C element of \u00a3 distinct from [n], take\nits intersection with N \u2014 [n], and let \u00a3 , be the obtained family. One easily checks\nthat \u00a3 , isa complete family of teams in G. ,. By the induction assumption, there\nis i\u00ab n for which the family \u00a3 , is the set of full teams in G , with ias principal.\nSince any set in \u00a3 that contains n \u2014 1 contains n (by step 5), this yields that \u00a3\nis the set of full teams 7, in G, which ends the proof.

Given the parameterized functions, we solve the model at each t \u2014 1,\n..., T. To solve the model, we use the firstorder conditions (15)-(18), the\ninitial condition for the contract (zero-profit condition for the intermedi-\nary), and the market-clearing condition in the labor market. Notice that in\ncomputing the market-clearing conditions, we use the true distribution of.\nfirms. The approximation based on the use of some of its moments is used\nonly for the computation of the three parameterized factors at each grid\npoint.\n\n4. Using the data obtained from solving the model at each / \u2014 1, ..., T, we\n\nestimate the coefficients of the parameterized functions with regressions as\n\nin Krusell and Smith (1998).\n\nThe estimates of the coefficients of the parameterized factors are used as\n\nnew guesses, and the procedure is restarted from step 3 until convergence.\n\nE\n\nFor robustness we have also extended the set of moments used to parameterize\nthe three factors without relevant changes in results.\n\nReferences\n\nAlbuquerque, Rui, and Hugo A.

                    "930 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\ncontracts we study is the use of high-powered group-based incentives.\nConventional wisdom holds that group incentives make most sense when\nproduction entails significant interdependencies among group mem-\nbers. These interdependencies, however, are largely absent in the or-\nganization we study. Similarly, while the reduction in income variation\ninherent in group-based incentives may benefit riskaverse physicians,\nrisk aversion would seem most likely to lead to use of low-powered\nincentives targeted at the individual level rather than high-powered\ngroup incentives. Our investigation of the anomalous use of team-based\nincentives led us to a little-noticed characteristic of these systems: that\nthey can enhance the efficiency of resource allocation decisions. The\ncentral economic logic of these gains from team incentives is a generally\napplicable point; these efficiencies can appear in any setting in which\nthe principal relies on the professional judgment of multiple agents to\nallocate resources.\n\nGroup incentives may enhance the efficiency of resource allocation\ndecisions, but they also introduce the wel-known problem of moral\nhazard. The designers of the HMO's system understood the problem\nof moral hazard in teams but hoped that peer pressure within physician\npanels would overcome the dilution of incentives that naturally occurs\nin group settings. Our finding that expenditures were substantially re-\nduced in small physician panels suggests that these effects were not\nsufficient to eliminate all \"free riding.\" This finding is significant because\nmany team-based incentives rely to some extent on the power of peer\npressure to overcome moral hazard. In subsequent research we hope\nto study more directly the role that peer pressure played in this system.\n\nBeyond the issue of group incentives, other features of the HMO's\nincentive system are hard to defend on economic grounds. While the\nuse of a bonus based on a target had the advantage of transparency,\nthe payout was highly nonlinear around target expenditures, likely in-\ntroducing an unnecessary fragility into the bonus system. Just as the\nstrike price is crucial to the incentive effect of chief executive officer\nstock options, so the power of the HMO's incentive system was critically\ndependent on not setting the target budgets *too low\" or \"too high.\"\n\nAt the managerial level, our work clearly demonstrates that the in-\ncentive systems HMOs introduce can help contain medical costs (though\nwe have not established that the savings thereby created exceed the cost.\nof implementing these systems). An equally important unresolved issue\nis whether cost-containment incentives compromise care quality. We\nplan to take up these issues in subsequent paper:\n\nReferences\n\nCoase, Ronald H. 1937. *The Nature of the Firm.\" Economica, n.s., 4 (November):\n386-405.\n"

                    "CHILD LABOR 945\n\nprovision of schooling was an implicit loan to their children. They also\nfind that the probability of receiving a remittance decreases with recip-\nient income and that the amount of the remittance increases with re-\ncipient income.\n\nMost of this work has specified the transfer function in a way that\nrules out the inverted-U shape that is possible in this model. A recent\nexception is a study of Peruvian households by Cox et al. (1998). This\npaper explores possible nonlinearity in the behavior of transfers by\nallowing recipient income to enter the transfer equation in a spline\nspecification, and it finds an inverted-U shape in the relationship be-\ntween transfers from adult children to their parents and parental\nincome.\n\nIV. Conclusions\n\nIn contrast to the widely held view that reductions in poverty must\nreduce child labor, we have found, in the context of the Baland-Rob-\ninson model with two-sided altruism, that higher parental income can\nlead to an increase in child labor. As poverty is reduced among parents,\nthey recognize that their adult children will be less likely to make trans-\nfers to them in recognition of the sacrifices they made to provide the\nchildren with education. The model yields predictions consistent with\nempirical evidence on the flow of transfers from adult children to their\nparents, which suggests that the nonmonotonic relationship between\nparental income and child labor is more than just a theoretical curiosity.\n",

At the beginning of the search, the\nalgorithm is allowed to make large upward moves and thus searches over the\nwhole parameter space. As the temperature drops, the algorithm concentrates\non more promising regions, but the random nature of the search still allows it\nto escape local minima.\n\nThis algorithm is explicitly designed to find a global minimum of functions\nthat may present multiple local optima or discontinuities. Because of compu-\ntational limitations, we cannot compute all possible equilibria for each 0. To\nidentify the equilibrium selection jointly with the parameters, in the face of\npossibly multiple equilibria, we adapt the algorithm so that, in the course of the\nminimization of J,(0), for each candidate value 6, it randomly picks several\ndistinct starting values for the iteration that yields the equilibrium. This pro-\ncedure effectively searches for several possible equilibria, computes the criterion\nJ\u00ab for each of these equilibria, and picks the lowest value as the value /,(0)\nfor that particular value of &. As a robustness check, given our estimates\n8, we are able to compute all the possible multiple equilibria for the set of o\nand A and, consequently, for IL. We then evaluate the minimum distance cri-\nterion /,(8) over all possible equilibria to check that our estimate 6 is indeed a\nlocal minimizer of /,(8) over the entire equilibrium set.\n\nReferences\n\nBecker, Gary S. 1973. *A Theory of Marriage: Part L\" J.PE. 81 (July/August):\n813-46.\n\n1974. *A Theory of Marriage: Part IL\" J.PE. 82, no. 2, pt. 2 (March/\n\nApril): S11-S26.\n\n. 1981.

The weighting matrix is trivially the\nidentity since this is always an exactly identified system. We then estimate 6,\nusing moment conditions y,. This second step incorporates the standard errors\nin estimating 6, using the standard two-step GMM procedure as in Ogaki (1993).\nThere are two additional complications that arise in our setup: the overlapping\nstructure of our repeated panels when we use autocovariances and the non-\nbalanced panel\nFor each moment condition based on, say, panel year 1, an MA(2) correction\nadded to the estimate of the covariance matrix associated with moment con-\nditions y.

We stack the repeated three moment conditions and use\nsample counterparts to estimate these covariance terms; the covariance matrix\nis block-diagonal, and each 3 x 3 block has nonempty off-diagonal elements. In\npractice, our results do not seem to be sensitive to this correction.\n\nBecause of the block-diagonal structure described above, the nonbalanced\npanel allows for the construction of standard GMM statistics. Let N* be the\nminimum sample size across all moments, and let other sample moments, say\nmoment j, be of size x, times N*. The standard GMM asymptotics follow from.\nassuming that sample sizes grow in these ratios. The covariance matrix used is\nthen constructed using each sample moment scaled by its x,\n\nReferences\n\nAbowd, John M., and David Card. 1989. \"On the Covariance Structure of Earn-\nings and Hours Changes.\" Econometrica 577 (March): 411-45.\n"

The results, reported in column 6 of table 4, indicate, however,\nthat the inclusion of these additional marriages leaves the baseline es-\ntimation results unchanged.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThis paper presents strong evidence that joint economic characteristics\nfrom the beginning of a marriage are significant explanatory factors in\na marriage's probability of survival. The evidence uncovered is that more\npositively correlated incomes between partners and a bigger gap in their\nincome volatilities are associated with marriages of decreased duration,\nthough bigger mean income gaps do not affect a marriage's duration.\nThis pattern of results is consistent with the view that spouses who are\ngood economic matches for one another are associated with longer-\nlasting marriages and that initial love is not a reliable substitute for this\nessential ingredient.\n\nA potential shortcoming of this model is that love is purely determined\nby exogenous factors.\" Rather, if partners could invest in love to raise\nits future stock, then they may find that better economic matches would\nlead to a higher return on the investment in love. In turn, as a result,\npartners with better economic characteristics would accumulate a\ngreater stock of love, which would make these marriages last longer.\nHowever, such considerations do not alter the basic finding that ben-\neficial economic characteristics lead to an increase in the survival of\nmarriages and that initial love cannot simply be substituted in its place.\n\nReferences\n\nBackus, David K., Patrick J.

We find that such counties were significantly less\nprone to consolidate their jurisdictions than counties that appeared\nsimilar at the beginning of each war decade. Both the timing and lo-\ncation of war-related shocks to racial heterogeneity are credibly exog-\nenous, so the war estimates strongly suggest that spurious correlation\nand endogenous migration do not account for our results.\n\nWe find evidence that people avoid heterogeneity because they do\nnot want to interact with different people, but we also find evidence\nthat people avoid heterogeneity because different people prefer differ-\nent public goods. Our evidence is not decisive enough to allow us to\napportion the blame neatly, but we conclude that both explanations\noperative.\n\nOur most striking result is the importance of racial heterogeneity\nrelative to income heterogeneity. It is conventional to assert that house-\nholds sort themselves among jurisdictions on the basis of income, if for\nno other reason than that they wish to avoid redistribution through the\nfinancing of local public goods. However, heterogeneity of preferences\nand avoidance of interaction receive very little attention from analysts\nof local public goods. Indeed, most models of local jurisdictions assume\nthat households care exclusively about the income of other residents in\ntheir jurisdiction.

                    "BLACK-WHITE WAGE GAP S27\n\nPnRoPOSITION. Assume that there are group differences in the patterns of\nselection into work among women; that is, for some i, (D,, \u2014 0, D, \u2014 1), and\nfor some 7^, (D, ^ 1, D,, ^ 0). Given such differences, the average potential\nwage among women in group \u00c0 who do not work will exceed the corresponding\naverage in group B.\n\nProof. For any i, there are eight possible combinations of (D,, M, D,, M,)\nsuch that D, *: D,, These combinations are the potential sources of selection\ndifferences between groups A and B at skill level i. Note that of these eight\ncombinations, only three could arise as equilibrium outcomes given the con-\nditions stated above.\n\nPar 1. (D, \u2014 1, M,\n\nPain 9. (D, \u2014 0, M,,\n\nPain 3. (D, \u2014 0, M, \u2014 1. D,\n\n'o see that only these three pairs remain, note that any combination involving.\n(M,, \u2014 0, M, \u2014 0) must have (D,, \u2014 D,) since single women of the same rank\nface the same market wage offer and the same menu of government programs.\nFurther, there can be no outcomes such that (M,, \u2014 0, M, \u2014 1) because the\nmarriage market for women in group A dominates the marriage market for\nwomen in group B. Finally, the combination (D, ^ 1, M, \u2014 1, D, 2 0, M, \u2014\n1) is not possible because condition A3 requires that an increase in the husband's\nmarket wage cannot increase the wife's labor supply in the market.\n\nGiven the remaining three sources of differential selection described in pairs\n1-3, the wage offer for a pair of women described by pair 1 must be less than\nthe wage offer for women who satisfy pair 2 since the group B women described\nin these pairs are both single, and only the one in pair 2 participates in market\nwork (see condition A4 above). Further, the women in pair 3 must enjoy a\ngreater potential wage than the women in pair ? since the group B woman in\npair 3 is married and the group B woman in pair 2 is not. Note that conditions\nAI and A2 together imply that all single persons have lower market wage offers\nthan all married persons.\n\nThus the group B women described in pair 1 have lower potential wages than\nthe group A women in pairs 2 and 3.\n\nReferences\n\nBayard, Kimberly, Judith Hellerstein, David Neumark, and Kenneth Troske. 1999.\n^Why Are Racial and Ethnic Wage Gaps Larger for Men than for Women?\nExploring the Role of Segregation Using the New Worker-Establishment Char-\nacteristics Database.\" In The Creation and Analysis of Employer-Employee Matched.\nData, edited by John C.

Hence, case 1 is the benchmark linear-quadratic-normal model. The other\ntwo cases use different values of \u00c0 to show how the slope and curvature of the\nprice function vary with \u00c0.

Neither ar-\nrangement infringes on choice (so both are libertarian), but one pro-\nduces higher savings rates and so might be considered paternalistic. The\nSMarT plan is even less intrusive than automatic enrollment since par-\nticipants have to take some action to enroll, and it is even more suc-\ncessful at getting people to save. So, we plead guilty to the charge of\ntrying to be paternalistic, but since we are striving for libertarian pa-\nternalism, we do not think that it should be considered objectionable.\n\nFinally, we hope that this study serves as a valid reply to two frequent\ncritiques of behavioral economics: the reliance on laboratory studies\nusing modest stakes and the ex post explanation of anomalous facts,\ndrawing on what is alleged to be a limitless store of potential behavioral\nexplanations. Here, we have used behavioral principles to design a plan\nto increase savings rates and tested the idea in the real world.\n\n",

In this\ncase, product improvements soften price competition, amplifying the\nfirm's incentive to innovate.\n\nEntry and potential entry have additional effects on pricing, consumer\nsurplus, and efficiency in a dynamic setting. For instance, the costs of\nlearning to use a new product and other complementary investments\ncreate switching costs for consumers. If there are scale economies in\nproduction, an incumbent can discourage future entry by pricing low.\nA low price expands the incumbent's current customer base and soaks\nup some of the future demand facing a prospective entrant. Product-\nlevel network effects also give rise to an entry-deterrence motive for low\npricing, as analyzed by Fudenberg and Tirole (2000).\n\nMuch of our analysis focuses on postentry incentives that soften price\ncompetition. Firms accomplish this goal by moving away from each other\nin product space. Prior to entry, however, an incumbent monopolist has\nseveral reasons to design a product with broad consumer appeal. For\nexample, a design with broad appeal is more likely to substitute closely\nwith a potential entrant's offering, so entry is less profitable because\npostentry competition is more intense.'\" In addition, a design with broad\nappeal soaks up some of an entrant's potential future demand by raising\ncurrent sales. With consumer switching costs and scale economies, it is\nthen harder for an entrant to capture a profitable market presence. In\nthese respects, a design with broad appeal is attractive to the incumbent\nfor the same reason as a low price: both help to soak up the future\ndemand for a potential entrant's product.\n\n",

                    "MANDATED SPEED LIMITS $265\nVIII. Conclusion\n\nAlthough subject to a number of limitations, our estimates of the value\nof a statistical life fall in the range between $1 million and $10 million,\nand our preferred estimates are much closer to the former than to the\nlatter. We think that these estimates are a particularly credible indication\nof public attitudes toward the trade-off between wealth and fatality risk.\nFirst, these estimates are based on the exogenously offered opportunity\nfor states to vote (and then retain) an increase in their rural speed limit\nand thereby save vehicle travel time at the risk of increased fatalities.\nSecond, the nature of the risk/wealth trade-off poses a relatively simple\npublic choice decision in which drivers/voters both receive the benefits\nand suffer the costs and in which agency problems and the resulting\ndistortions are not likely to be strong. Finally, there is evidence that the\nstate legislators were aware of the trade-offs involved and that the states\nthat implicitly were offered better terms (greater hours saved per fa-\ntality) were more likely to accept the offer.\n\nOn the basis of these results, it appears that measuring the choices\nthat result from exogenous changes in the trade-off between safety and\nwealth are the key to providing real progress in estimating the VSL. As\nwould be expected, where drivers select their speeds and thus their\nfatality risks in response to road conditions, the simple cross-sectional\ncorrelation between speeds and fatality risks is negligible. On the other\nhand, both speeds and fatality risks increase in response to an exogenous\nchange in speed limits, providing just the information critical to the\ncredible measurement of the VSL.\n\nOur results also indicate that there is room for much additional re-\nsearch in the valuation of safety risks. Recent years have seen the demise\nof all federally mandated speed limits and the evolution of considerable\nvariability within states and across states in traffic safety legislation. In\nprinciple, this variability could be used to measure the terms of wealth/\nrisk trade-offs at different levels of risk and provide betterinformed\ndiscussions of public policies toward safety.\n\n",

                    "COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE 65\nV. Concluding Remarks\n\nThe last decade has witnessed an increased interest in exploring the\nempirical content of neoclassical trade theory. In particular, the\nHeckscher-Ohlin model\u2014the *backbone of traditional trade theory\"\n(Leamer and Levinsohn 1995, p. 1345)\u2014has been the primary target\nof empirical research. The empirical trade literature typically aims at\nestimating the \"accuracy\" of the predictions of the Heckscher-Ohlin\nmodel rather than testing a specific hypothesis.\n\nTo our knowledge of the literature, this paper provides the first direct\ntest of the theory of comparative advantage in its most general for-\nmulation. It is \"direct\" since the underlying hypothesis is formulated in\nterms of a country's relative autarky prices. The testable hypothesis de-\nrived from this approach places no restriction on what accounts for\ncomparative advantage, whether factor endowments, technologies,\ntastes, or a combination of them. However, as a trade-off, the hypothesis\nprovides no information about the commodity composition of trade:\nwhich goods will be exported and which will be imported.\n\nOne central theme of this paper is that Japan's nineteenth-century\ntrade liberalization provides a \"natural historical experiment\" within\nwhich to test the autarky price prediction of comparative advantage\ntrade theory. The historical narrative demonstrates that the Japanese\neconomy during the time period of our investigation was compatible\nwith the assumptions of the underlying theory.\n\nAs has been noted elsewhere, the domain of economic theory surely\nencompasses more than the recent past, and there are distinct advan-\ntages to exploiting the rich veins of historical experience to test the\nvalidity of theory (McCloskey 1976). The case of Japan provides a natural\nexperiment that occurs in an environment that is transparent by any\nreasonable measure. External pressure forced a low tariff structure on\nJapan and precluded the use of other nontariff barriers that are part\nand parcel of contemporary trading regimes. The detail of Japan's trad-\ning statistics allowed a clear identification of the commodities actually\nentering trade. The robustness of our findings suggests that the autarky\nprice formulation of comparative advantage is a coherent and insightful\ntheory that can also be validated empirically.\n\nReferences\n\nBrennwald, C. 1865.

When the param-\neters of the heterogeneity distribution converged to boundary values,\nstandard errors could not be calculated. In these cases, though, the\nboundary values of the estimates imply no heterogeneity in credit access.\nWe believe that this approach is useful and hope that it leads to ad\ntional studies.\n\nAll told, our results are consistent with the conclusions of Shea (2000),\nCameron and Heckman (2001), and Keane and Wolpin (2001). AIl four\nmethods we employ produce no evidence of borrowing constraints.\nWhen interpreting our findings, we reiterate two caveats. First, none of.\nour evidence or the evidence in any of these other studies is direct since\nthe actual rates at which individuals borrow for school cannot be ob-\nserved. Second, our results do not imply that credit market constraints\nwould not exist in the absence of the assortment of private and gov-\nernment programs currently available. Instead, our findings show that\ngiven the large range of subsidies to education that currently exist, there\nis no evidence of underinvestment in schooling resulting from credit\naccess.\n\nReferences\n\nAltonji, Joseph G., and Thomas A.

                    "CORRELATION OF WEALTH i181\n\nIn Section V of the paper, we showed that preferences are, in fact,\ncorrelated across generations, especially at the tails of the risk tolerance\ndistribution. Moreover, for both parents and children, asset ownership\nvaries in a predictable fashion with attitudes toward risk. But the parent-\nchild similarity in asset composition is not affected with the addition of\nrisk tolerance controls. This suggests either that some preference other\nthan prudence matters or that children learn from or mimic their par-\nents' savings behaviors, irrespective of the similarity in their preferences.\nWe find further that risk tolerance explains only a very modest portion\nof the intergenerational wealth association, once asset composition and\nincome are accounted for. Nonetheless, the other results about pref-\nerences suggest that analyzing the role that parents play in shaping child\npreferences is a very interesting area for future research.\n\n"

                    "1260 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nLike many magicians and alchemists, this paper buries its trickery in\nthe setting of the stage. Excluding agriculture, at the very beginning,\nfrom the analysis incorporates the transfer of labor out of that sector\nasan input, while excluding agricultural total factor productivity growth\nand the efficiency gains brought about by movement of labor from the\nmeasurement of output. The sustained growth of agricultural output\nduring the reform period, in light of its rapidly declining share of the\nlabor force, is a testament to the misguided nature of plan policies that\nkept the peasantry tied up in agriculture, by restricting rural-urban mi-\ngration and limiting the development of rural nonagricultural activity,\nwhile saddling it with inefficient and alien organizational structures.\nThe reversal of these policies may be one of the greatest, and easiest,\nachievements of the reforms, although agriculture remains distorted in\nmany respects (e.g., with local procurement and price controls). A\nproper analysis of the agricultural sector, lying well beyond the abilities\nof the techniques used in this paper, might find rapid productivity\ngrowth in that sector and large gains from the release of its pentup\n\"surplus\" labor.\n\nAlong with rising participation rates, educational attainment, and cap-\nital investment, the transfer of labor out of agriculture, whether driven\nby productivity growth in that sector or the equalization of labor's ma\nginal product with other sectors of the economy, has played an impor-\ntant role in the growth of economies such as Korea and Taiwan. It plays\nan equally significant role in fueling the growth of the People's Republi,\nDespite the popular academic emphasis on industry and exports, a\ndeeper understanding of the success of the world's most rapidly growing\neconomies may lie in that most fundamental of development topic:\nagriculture, land, and the peasant.\n\nReferences\n\nChan, Kam Wing. \"Urbanization and Rura-Urban Migration in China since\n1982.\" Modern China 20 (July 1994): 943-81.\n\nChen, Dong, and Zhili Niu, eds.

Changes in the deduction parameter that leave individuals in the\nsame tax bracket have very little effect on MCF,. They affect the size of annuity\nmechanically by changing the level of tax liability. Ideally one should use the\nage profile of taxable estates without making any assumptions regarding deduc-\ntions. However, such information is not available. Note that if the true gross\nestate profile is flat (as assumed in the paper), the evidence that deductions\nfall with the gross estate contains no information about age effects. If the share\nof deductions is increasing with age, tax liability falls more quickly than implied\nby my assumptions, and I underestimate the size of annuity and overestimate\nMCF, On the other hand, if tax deductions respond to marginal tax rates, the\ntrue behavioral response is stronger and MCF, is underestimated.\n\nReferences\n\nAbel, Andrew B. \"Precautionary Saving and Accidental Bequests.?

In the presence of economies of scale, a larger household\nwith the same per capita income has been overcompensated compared\nwith a smaller one. If food is a normal good (and there are few econ-\nomies of scale in food and limited possibilities of substitution away from\nit), the per capita demand for food will rise. Because per capita total\nexpenditure is being held constant, the budget share of food (per capita\nfood expenditure divided by per capita total expenditure) will rise.

While\nthe number of firms is fixed, the total number of projects in the economy is\ntime-arying and stationary. We let the scale of new projects be proportional to\nthe aggregate production scale in the economy, which ensures stationarity of.\nthe cross-sectional distribution of the number of projects per firm. Thus k, \u2014\nK,/e, where the constant e controls the long-run average number of projects in\nthe economy, N'. On average, projects expire at the total rate \u00e0N\". The arrival\nrate of new projects is zp(x)e. Therefore, e is defined from the equation\nzEp(x))e \u2014 \u00d3N\".\n\nTn the simulation, time increment is discrete. The unit costs of new projects\nare spaced out evenly over the interval (0, f(x,)]. The investment of an individual\nfirm at time tis computed as the total amount the firm spends on its new projects\nat time (. The dividend paid out by a given firm during period is defined as\nthe difference between the cash flows generated by the firm's existing projects\nand its investment. Finally, the individual firm's book value is measured as the\ncumulative investment cost of the firm's projects that remain active at time f.\n\nIn our simulation, we first generate 200 years' worth of monthly data to allow\nthe economy to reach steady state. After that, we repeatedly simulate a 420-\nmonth panel data set consisting of the crosssectional variables (360 months of.\ndata constitute the main panel, and 60 extra months are used for preranking\nB estimation).\n\nReferences\n\nBerk, Jonathan B. *A Critique of Size-Related Anomalies.\" Rev.

Since\nthe set of 7 such that J(7) \u2014 0 is finite (zero is a regular value of (7) and the\nrange of r is compact), one can always choose an arbitrarily small perturbation\nsuch that |o,(s, x, 3) s |o. (7 1, x, 3)| for all 7 with (7) \u2014 0. Q.E.D.\n\nProof of Theorem 5 (Sketch)\n\nThe main part of the proof involves establishing that D \u20ac \u20ac. We demonstrate.\nthis by showing that any equilibrium with monotonic actions and an action pool\nnot containing 5 cannot satisfy the monotonic DI criterion.\n\nSince actions are monotonic in type, an action pool is a nondegenerate in-\nterval, [t t,]. Since Vj,\u00bb 0, every segment within [/, \u00a3,] is also an interval. It is\neasy to show that /, must belong to a nondegenerate segment, which implies\nb(t;) \u20ac t.\n\nLet i 5 lim,,i()) and // \u2014 lim,,, (). Clearly, )/2 t,\u00bb b(t;). It is straightfor-\nward to show that, in equilibrium, /, must be indifferent between (u(/), 5(6))\nand (u^, 5^) and that j/\u00bb u(t,).\n\nChoose some p, \u20ac (u(t)), p); note that this action is not chosen in equilibrium\nby any type. Let n be an arbitrary message. We claim that, if the monotonic DI\ncriterion is satisfied, (i, m) \u2014 t; But then f, would deviate to p, (provided that\nwe have chosen y, sufficiently close to p(r))), which overturns the equilibrium.\n. To establish the claim, we need to demonstrate that, for all 5 \u20ac [/(u.),\nbu) and t t, Uus, 0 * BV. 0) 2 U(u(t), 0) * BVO(), 10) implies UQu,, t) -\nBV(b, t,) \u00bb Utt), t) * BV), t,). Consider t\u00ab t,. Suppose that t weakly prefers\n(us D) to (u(), b(0). Then t must also weakly prefer (u,, /) to (u(t)), b(1,)). But\nthen, since b &(uj) \u2014 b(6), p(;) \u20ac p, Vi\u00bb 0, and U,, 7 0, t, must strictly prefer\n(uo, D) to (u(t,), (t). The argument for t\u00bb t, is similar, except that it uses 5\nb(u)) \u2014 b and p,\u00ab '.\n\n\"To complete the proof, one must show that \u20ac \u20ac D. The separating equilib-\nrium, if it exists, obviously satisfies the monotonic DI criterion (since actions\nare monotonic and all actions are taken by some type in equilibrium). Consider\nany central pooling equilibrium characterized by the three parameters t, 1, and\nx,. The set of outof-equilibrium actions is (u(t), xj) U (xj, &(1,)). Construct out-\nofequilibrium beliefs as follows: for x \u20ac (u(t), xj), let \u00f3(t, x, m) \u2014 1 and \u00e9(t,\nx, m) \u2014 0 for t\u00ab t, and for x \u20ac (x,, &(6), let \u00f3(,, x, m) 7 1 and $(t, x, m) \u2014\n0 for t\u00ab t. It is easy to check that this is an equilibrium. One establishes that\nit satisfies the monotonic DI criterion through an argument analogous to that\nused in the first part of this proof.

                    "TEAM INCENTIVES 495\n\ntook a pay cut to be on teams, why more heterogeneous teams are more\nproductive, and why teams that formed early experience greater pro-\nductivity gains. Thus nonpecuniary benefits and bargaining or mutual\nlearning remain important factors in explaining team productivity at\nKoret even if we credit team productivity gains to the minor increase\nin incentive intensity.\n\nA complementary explanation for the rise in productivity is that teams\nare effective when a firm adopts a set of complementary practices in-\ncluding employment security, flexible job assignments, skills training,\nand communication procedures. For instance, several studies (e.g.,\nWomack et al. 1990; MacDuffie 1995; Ichniowski, Shaw, and Prennushi\n1997; Boning et al. 2001) indicate that productivity improvements come\nabout only when high-performance employment practices are adopted\ntogether. In the case of Koret, an important institutional feature may\nbe the fact that the plant was unionized and operating with a three-\nyear union contract. Union representation at Koret may have provided\nan effective safeguard against management's ratcheting the standard as\nwell as to safeguard the option of team workers to return to PBS pro-\nduction. Thus group piece rates may not have delivered the same pro-\nductivity improvements if the plant was nonunion. This argument is\nconsistent with Black and Lynch's (2001) empirical findings from a\nrepresentative sample of U.S. businesses that unionized establishments\nthat adopted industrial relations practices that promote joint decision\nmaking coupled with incentive-based compensation have higher pro-\nductivity than other similar nonunion plants. Those unionized busi-\nnesses that maintained more traditional labor-management relations\nhad lower productivity.\n\nOverall, our arguments suggest that it may be feasible for a firm to\nreduce turnover and increase production by introducing team produc-\ntion, even if some workers earn lower pay after joining the team. More-\nover, our analysis suggests the team production is a complex behavioral\nphenomenon that presents a challenge to theoreticians because it is\nlikely to involve multiple mechanisms that go beyond free-riding and\nthat these mechanisms may interact.\n",

                    "528 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nAt the end of the decision problem, we will look at the choice actually made\nby your pair member and compare his/her choice to your predictions. We will\nthen pay you for your prediction as follows:\n\nSuppose you predict that your pair member will choose 1 with a 6096 chance\nand 2 with a 406 chance. In that case you will place 60 next to the entry 1 and\n40 next to the entry 2. Suppose now that your pair member actually chooses 2.\nIn that case your payoff will be\n\nPrediction Payoff \u2014 [20,000 \u2014 (100 \u2014 40)* \u2014 (60)*].\n\nIn other words, we will give you a fixed amount of 20,000 points from which\nwe will subtract an amount which depends on how inaccurate your prediction\nwas. To do this when we find out what choice your pair member has made (i.e.\neither 1 or 2), take the number you assigned to that choice, in this case 40 on\n2, subtract it from 100 and square it. We will then take the number you assigned\nto the choice not made by your pair member, in this case the 60 you assigned\nto 1l, and square it also. These two squared numbers will then be subtracted\nfrom the 20,000 francs we initially gave you to determine your final point payoff.\nYour point payoff will then be converted into francs at the rate of 1 point \u2014\n\u2014 francs.\n\nNote that the worst you can do under this payoff scheme is to state that you\nbelieve that there is a 10096 chance that a certain action is going to be taken\nand assign 100 to that choice when in fact the other choice is made. Here your\npayoff from the prediction would be 0. Similarly, the best you can do is to guess\ncorrectly and assign 100 to that choice which turns out to be the actual choice\nchosen. Here your payoff will be 20,000.\n\nHowever, since your prediction is made before you know what your pair mem-\nber actually will choose, the best thing you can do to maximize the expected\nsize of your prediction payoff is to simply state your true beliefs about what you\nthink your pair member will do. Any other prediction will decrease the amount\nyou can expect to earn as a prediction payoff.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summation, this decision problem will proceed as follows. When you sit down\nat the terminal you will be able to see the decisions that have been made by\nthe previous pairs who have participated in this decision problem, and you will\nbe able to see the advice that your immediate predecessor has given you. You\nwill then be asked to predict what your pair member will do by filling out the\nprediction form. After you do that, the decision box will appear on the screen\nand you will be prompted to make your decision. You will then be shown the\ndecision made by the person you are paired with, and you will be informed of\nyour payoff. Finally, you will fill out the advice form for your successor.\n",

At this point, however, we can\nsimply observe that momentum's importance in an investment context\nis affected significantly by the addition of spreads based on liquidity\nrisk.\n\nV. Conclusions\n\nMarketwide liquidity appears to be a state variable that is important for\npricing common stocks. We find that expected stock returns are related\ncross-sectionally to the sensitivities of stock returns to innovations in\naggregate liquidity. Stocks that are more sensitive to aggregate liquidity\n\nhave substantially higher expected returns, even after we account for\nexposures to the market return as well as size, value, and momentum\nfactors.\n\nOur liquidity measure captures a dimension of liquidity associated\nwith the strength of volume-related return reversals. Over the last four\ndecades, this measure of marketwide liquidity exhibits a number of sharp\ndeclines, many of which coincide with market downturns and apparent\nflights to quality. Our liquidity measure is also characterized by signif-\nicant commonality across stocks, supporting the notion of aggregate\nliquidity as a priced state variable. Smaller stocks are less liquid, ac-\ncording to our measure, and the smallest stocks have high sensitivities\nto aggregate liquidity.\n\nOne direction for future research is to explore whether liquidity risk\nplays a role in various pricing anomalies in financial markets. This study\ntakes a step on this path by showing that the momentum strategy of.\nbuying recent winning stocks and selling recent losing stocks becomes\nless attractive from an investment perspective when portfolio spreads\nbased on liquidity risk are also available for investment. Future research\ncould investigate whether expected returns are related to stocks\" sen-\nsitivities to fluctuations in other aspects of aggregate liquidity. It would\nalso be useful to explore whether some form of systematic liquidity risk\nis priced in other financial markets, such as fixed income markets or\ninternational equity markets.\n\nReferences\n\nAcharya, Viral V., and Pedersen, Lasse Heje. \"Asset Pricing with Liquidity Ris\nWorking paper.

                    "266 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nin to sell the shares short and, in so doing, will drive the prices back\ndown to rational valuations. The lesson to be learned from this paper\nis that arbitrage does not always enforce rational pricing. In the case of\nPalm, arbitrageurs faced little risk but could not find enough shares of\nPalm to satiate the demands of irrational investors. We have identified\ncases in which arbitrageurs are unable to arbitrage relative mispricing.\nMore generally, there can be cases of mispricing in which arbitrageurs\nare unuilling to establish positions because of fundamental risk or noise\ntrader risk. Many investors thought that Internet stocks were overpriced\nduring the mania, but only a small minority were willing to take a short\nposition, and these short sellers were not enough to drive prices down\nto rational valuations. Further, many institutions either are not permit-\nted to sell short or simply choose not to do so for various reasons.\nAlmazan et al. (2001) find that only about 30 percent of mutual funds\nare allowed to sell short, and only 2 percent actually do sell short.\n\nLimits of arbitrage can create market segmentation. If irrational in-\nvestors are willing to buy Palm at an unrealistically high price and ra-\ntional but risk-averse investors are unwilling or unable to sell enough\nshares short, then two inconsistent prices can coexist. The same argu-\nment can apply to any apparent mispricing, from closed-end fund dis-\ncounts and premia to differences in returns between value stocks and\ngrowth stocks. The traditional view is that a stock with a low expected\nreturn must have low risk. The examples given here suggest an alter-\nnative possibility, namely that the investors who buy apparently expen-\nsive stocks are just making a mistake.\n\nThe conclusion we draw is that there is one law of economics that\ndoes still hold: the law of supply and demand. Prices are set so that the\nnumber of shares demanded equals the number of shares supplied. In\nthe case of Palm, the supply of shares could not rise to meet demand\nbecause of the sluggish response of lendable shares to short. Similarly,\nif optimists are willing to bid up the shares of some faddish stocks and\nnot enough courageous investors are willing to meet that demand by\nselling short, then optimists will set the price.\n\n",

                    "402 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nHowever, the increasing penetration of computers and the World\nWide Web seems to be gradually changing the culture in the steel mar-\nket, lowering \u00a3, and creating the possibility for profitable entry. As we\nnoted, there have recently been several unsuccessful attempts at entry\nby potential market makers. This may indicate that technology and\nassociated cultural changes are reducing \u00a3, relative to &, moving the\nmarket toward the boundary between region 1 (where entry by a market\nmaker is unprofitable) and region 2 (where entry is profitable). From\nour own observation of the steel market, we think that it is only a matter\nof time before successful entry does occur. Also, some of the problems\nexperienced by the first wave of entrants into the steel market may have\nbeen due to the general effects of the dot-com crash of 2001-2, and\nsome of these entrants (such as Enron) might have succeeded in en-\ntering the steel market had it not been for problems in their other lines\nof business.\n\nMore generally, our model provides new insights into how the infor-\nmation revolution could affect the microstructure of a variety of differ-\nent markets. We expect that improvements in computing and com-\nmunications technologies will tend to drive all three parameters \u00f3, &,\nand A, toward zero. In this case we expect that most markets will ulti-\nmately be in a configuration near the origin in region 2 of figure 8.\nOur theoretical results predict that middlemen and market makers will\ncoexist, with each handling approximately half of the total volume of\ntrade.\n\n",

In this setup, higher interest rates exert a contractionary\neffect on output by reducing bank credit to firms. This negative output\ncost tends to offset the positive money demand effect and thus generates\nsimilar trade-offs for the monetary authority. We show that, in the pres-\nence of output costs, the basic insights derived in this paper remain\nessentially unchanged.\n\nAppendix A\nProof of Proposition 4\n\nFirst, notice that dm,/dy \u00bb 0 for \u00bb \u2014 0, as follows directly from proposition 3.\nSecond, notice that (26) implies, when we take (22) and [g;y^), ^] \u2014 0 into\naccount, that\n\nlim A \u2014 cae (Al)\n\nHence, there exists at least one value of \u00bb \u20ac (0, ^) such that dm;/dy \u2014 0. We\nshall assume (without proving it) that this value is unique (as numerical examples\nfor both the Cagan and quadratic cases suggest) and denote it by y\".\n\nAppendix B\nProof of Proposition 6\n\nNotice first that dc/dy 7 0 for y \u2014 0, as shown in proposition 5. From (30), and\nfrom (20), (23), and (27), it follows that\n\n; dt DL\nLEE (Bl)\n\nbecause (di/iy)|,.. :\u00ab 0. Hence, there exists at least one value of \u00bb \u20ac (0, y)\nsuch that dc/dy \u2014 0. Again, we shall assume (without proving it) that this value\nis unique (as all our numerical examples suggest) and denote it by ^; \".

However, any additional information that could be extracted\nfrom the data given our assumptions would require exploiting the correlation\nstructure among bids implied by G,4,.,(, *, ). Matching an arbitrary corre-\nlation structure would likely require a stochastic bidding rule (rather than a set\nof deterministic bid functions like those above). This makes it particularly hard.\nto \"guess\" a general solution, and a constructive approach based on copulas\nappears to require fundamental advances that are beyond what could be ad-\ndressed in this paper.

                    "COMMERCIAL POLICY 199\n\nthe vast majority of the benefits of protection flow to a few relatively\nrich individuals (as Johnson [1974] shows to be true in the case of the\nU.S. sugar program). My paper shows that the argument can be com-\npelling nonetheless since altruists may prefer tariffs that generate such\nuneven benefits to doing nothing at all.\n\nEven if tariffs are preferred to free trade in an otherwise undistorted\neconomy, other policies may be superior; this issue is not explored at\nlength in this paper. As I suggested in the Introduction, transfers that\nare conditioned only on the income of the recipient have problems of\ntheir own, including the moral hazard they induce and the fact that\nsome people regard the resulting beneficiaries as undeserving because\ntheir effort is low. Some of these difficulties are avoided by tariffs because\nthe resulting benefits go only to factors that exert effort. What still\nremain open are the conditions under which altruists prefer tariffs to\nother policies that subsidize work.'^\n\nThe existence ofa role for altruism in the setting of commercial policy\nis by no means inconsistent with the possibility that political contribu-\ntions also have a direct effect on the votes of legislators. I neglected\nthese considerations in my analysis only to clarify the effects of altruism\nitself. Building models in which both factors are present appears very\nattractive because such models could simultaneously explain the types\nof arguments that are used for protection and the fact that protection\nis sometimes accorded when these arguments ought to prove insuffi-\ncient. It would thus open the door for analyzing how changes in the\npolitical process affect policy outcomes by affecting the quality of the\ninformation that impinges on these outcomes.\n\nReferences\n\nAnderson, Kym, and Baldwin, Robert E. *The Political Market for Protection in\nIndustrial Countries.\" In.

                    "224 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\ndebated in policy circles are forming, indeed, along regional lines, such\nas the expansion of NAFTA to include Chile, Argentina, and other South\nAmerican countries or that of the European Union to include countries\nfrom eastern and central Europe. Academic and policy discussions on\nthe future of the world trading system have focused substantially on the\nmerits of such preferential trading arrangements.\n\nThis paper makes two contributions to this debate. Perhaps the pri-\nmary contribution is a methodological one: The paper implements an\nestimation framework with tighter links to the underlying general equi-\nlibrium theoretical model and with far fewer restrictions as to functional\nforms than is traditional in the literature on preferential trade agree-\nments. Second, in the actual implementation using U.S. trade data, this\npaper finds no support for the \"natural trading partners\" hypothe-\nsis\u2014the idea that preferential tariff reduction with respect to geograph-\nically proximate countries is to be preferred over preferential treatment\ntoward distant countries. Future research will tell whether this finding\nwill be confirmed for other countries or in broader contexts even for\nthe United States. The present analysis, nevertheless, points to the dif-\nficulty of identifying systematic economic criteria in choosing partners\nfor preferential trading: Outcomes may simply be highly sensitive to\ncontext.\n\nSeveral limitations of the economic analysis conducted here have been\ndiscussed in the text. Additionally, beyond trade and trade flows, it is\nworth mentioning other factors that have been suggested to be relevant\nin the decision to liberalize trade preferentially with one's neigh-\nbors\u2014and that were ignored in the analysis. These include, inter alia,\nstrategic defense considerations, the role of capital mobility, scale econ-\nomies and the benefits of local economic concentration, the possibility\nof establishing stronger trading ties and networks with proximate coun-\ntries due to, say, ethnic and cultural similarities, and so on. Serious\nconsideration of these issues was entirely out of the scope of the present\npaper. They remain subjects for future research.\n\nReferences\n\nBarnett, William A. \"Theoretical Foundations for the Rotterdam Model.\" Rev.\nEcon. Studies 46 (January 1979): 109-30.\n\nBarten, A.

Little is known about what forms\nof incentive systems are best in general or specific circumstances, or\nabout precisely what results might be expected from making wider use\nof any specific system. However, the importance of the evaluation pre-\nsented here lies in the fact that the power of incentives observed else-\nwhere in the economy is also evident in schools, even in the case of\nrelatively low performance bonuses.\" There are some open issues that\ncould not be addressed in this paper, for example, what the relative\nefficacy of group versus individual incentives is, whether the improve-\nments are permanent, and what would happen if the incentives were\nremoved. Finding the answers to these questions and the best ways to\nstructure incentives in schools, for teachers and students alike, should\nbe based on more experimentation and evaluation.\n\nReferences\n\nAngrist, Joshua D. *Estimating the Labor Market Impact of Voluntary Military\nService Using Social Security Data on Military Applicants.\" Econometrica 66\n(March 1998): 249-88.\n\nAngrist, Joshua D., and Lavy, Victor. \"Using Maimonides' Rule to Estimate the\nEffect of Class Size on Scholastic Achievement.\" Q.J.F. 114 (May 1999): 533-75.\n\n. \"Does Teacher Training Affect Pupil Learning?

                    "1352 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nof reductions across districts is skewed. When some districts lose more\nspending than others, the welfare consequences are unclear. Thus\nstrong executives may reduce the distortion on the size of the budget,\nyet they might introduce distortions in the distribution of spending if\nthey cater to a minimum winning coalition. These issues are hard to\naddress with the data at hand since city government budgets are not\nbroken down by district. Such analysis may be possible, however, at the\nfederal level looking at the relationship between the changes in the size\nof the federal budget and its distribution across congressional districts.\n\nAnother important arca of research is to take one step further back\nand examine the question, Why do some cities choose strong-mayor\nforms of government? Such an exercise addressing the important ques-\ntion of why certain political institutions get chosen is admittedly difficult\nto address using cross-country data because of the role of history and\nunquantifiable factors, but it can be usefully addressed using the city\ngovernment data at hand. Over the course of their history, cities have\noccasionally changed their form of government. If the arguments pre-\nsented in this paper have some bearing on reality, one factor that would\nbe important for a city deciding the form of government would be the\nsize of the council. If the size of the council is relatively exogenous\nbecause it may depend in part on the city population and if it is the\ncase that bigger councils are going to have greater spending pressures,\ncities with large legislatures should choose strong-mayor forms of gov-\nernment. Although OLS and probit regressions show a positive and\nsignificant effect of council size on alternative indicators for strong-\nmayor forms of government, the empirical challenge is to identify the\neffect of council size on the form of government since both may be the\nresult of some third outside factor (such as a movement for \"reform\"\nthat entailed changes to both council size and form of government).\nFurther work in this area would shed additional important light on these\nissues.\n\nReferences\n\nAiken, Michael, and Alford, Robert. \"Governmental Units Analysis Data.\" Study\nno. 0028.

Even with the huge transfer of workers out\nof farming, the income disparity widened.\n\nWhat the Chinese experience indicates is that the conditions under\nwhich mobility occurs can affect the outcome, something Caselli and\nColeman neglected in their model but was a matter of major concern\nto agricultural economists in the 1940s through the 1960s. The relative\nincome position of farm people declined in China. Why? Because there\nare significant legal restraints on migration from rural to urban arcas.\nBut even in the absence of such restraints, the urban-rural income ratio\nmight have increased. The transfer of labor out of farming averaged\napproximately 10 million annually, which was an annual transfer of\nabout 4 percent. To induce that many people to change jobs or locations\nwould require a large income differential in the absence of restraints\non migration. Thus it should not be assumed that under all or even\nmost conditions there may not be instances during the period of rapid\nfarm labor adjustment in which the margin between farm and urban\nwages or incomes widens. It is hoped that the disparity will eventually\ndisappear, but as the experience in the United States and Western Eu-\nrope shows, it takes a long time. In the case of China it will take at least\na century, perhaps more, since it took that long in the United States.\n\n",

                    "MASS CONSUMPTION SOCIETIES 1069\n\nA similar remark can also be made on the specification of dynamic\nincreasing returns. The critical feature of the present model is that the\nspeed of productivity improvement responds to the market size. Learn-\ning by doing with complete spillover across competitive producers is the\nsimplest way of capturing the feature without introducing any intertem-\nporal decision on the production side. In reality, research and devel-\nopment may be a more important source of productivity improvement.\nIt is not clear, however, whether modeling dynamic increasing returns\ndue to R&D, instead of learning by doing, would generate any additional\ninsights that merit complications that arise from the intertemporal na-\nture of innovations.\n\nFinally, in this paper the distribution of income (or, more generally,\npurchasing power) across households is treated as the primitive of the\nmodel. In particular, households are not allowed to set up lotteries.\nOnce the possibility of lotteries is introduced, many questions posed in\nthis paper\u2014such as \"what is the role of income distribution in the rise\nof a mass consumption society?\" or \"what are the effects of income\ntransfer?\"\u2014themselves become ill defined. On a positive note, the\nmodel presented in this paper should be a useful building block for\nanalyzing general equilibrium implications of lotteries and other modes\nof consumer finances.\n\n",

Their numerical\nsimulations are based on insights similar to those provided here.\n\nIn summary, the trade-off between risk and incentives has become a\nmantra among economists working on agency issues, despite the rather\nlukewarm evidence in its favor. Indeed, in some occupations there is\nmore convincing evidence of a positive relationship. The objective of\nthis paper has been to understand why we might not expect to find\nsuch a relationship in the data. I argue that the marginal returns to\ndelegation are likely to be higher in more uncertain environments, since\na principal may have little idea what the right kinds of effort are in such\ncases. In more stable environments, they can simply tell the agent what\nto do, whereas in riskier settings, they may have little choice but to offer\nagency contracts to induce appropriate behavior, since there are no\nother good measures of performance on which to base pay. Thus in-\ncentives and uncertainty are positively related.\n\nReferences\n\nAckerberg, Daniel A., and Botticini, Maristella. \"Endogenous Matching and the\nEmpirical Determinants of Contract Form.\" J.PE. 110 (June 2002): 564-01.\n\nAggarwal, Rajesh K., and Samwick, Andrew A: \"The Other Side of the Trade-\noff The Impact of Risk on Executive Compensation.\" J.PE. 107 (February\n1999): 65-105.\n\nAghion, Philippe, and Tirole, Jean. \"Formal and Real Auth\ntions.\" J.P. 105 (February 1997): 1-29.\n\nAllen, Douglas, and Lueck, Dean. \"Contract Choice in Modern Agriculture: Cash\nRent versus Crop Share.\" J.

The\ntechnique should be useful for a broad range of markets in which data\non price and product characteristics may not be sufficient to precisely\nidentify the relevant substitution patterns. In the minivan case, I find\nthat the microdata are important for demand and welfare measurement,\nprimarily because they appear to free the model from a heavy depen-\ndence on the idiosyncratic logit error.\n\nMy results suggest that overall gains from the introduction of the\nminivan were large and that consumer bencfits far outweighed the costs\nof development and the profits obtained by the innovator. Consumer\nbenefits were distributed across households in a nonrandom way, and\nalmost half of these benefits came from increased price competition\nand accrued to non-minivan purchasers. On the producer side, the\nresults were mixed. Chrysler obtained large benefits from the intro-\nduction of the minivan, easily recouping its initial development costs.\nThese sales came at the expense of the rest of the industry, which was\nunprepared for the minivan innovation and unable to respond quickly\nwith the introduction of a comparable product.\n\nThese results support a story in which large improvements in con-\nsumers' standard of living arise from competition between firms. These\nfirms ignore the externalities they impose on one another, cannibalizing\neach other's profits by introducing new and different goods. The new\ngoods that successfully differentiate themselves from existing products\ncan yield large profits for the innovator and substantial gains for\nconsumers.\n\n",

Consistent with earlier results, we reject the model when no\nprovision is made for the limited participation. We also presented some\nevidence that an SDF calculated as the per capita marginal rate of sub-\nstitution is better able to explain the equity premium and does so with\na lower value of the RRA coefficient as the definition of asset holders\nis tightened to recognize the limited participation of households in the\ncapital market. Our evidence that the representative-consumer model\ncan account for the equity premium when limited participation is taken\ninto account is sensitive to the experimental design. It is of interest to\nexplore further the robustness of this evidence.\n\nReferences\n\nAbel, Andrew B, \"Asset Prices under Habit Formation and Catching Up with\nthe Joneses.\" A.E.R.

                    "852 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nfor it to be optimal to do sophisticated intertemporal optimization.\nAnother possibility is that households with small savings account hold-\nings (and no stocks etc.) may in reality be net borrowers or be borrowing\nconstrained, holding just a small amount of assets in a savings account\nfor precautionary purposes. As mentioned in the Introduction, the find-\nings of Gross and Souleles (2002) suggest that once a more appropriate\ninterest rate is used for borrowers (in their case the credit card rate),\nborrowing and thus consumption growth are sensitive to the interest\nrate, suggesting a nonzero EIS.\n\nHI. Conclusion\n\nThe paper suggests that accounting for limited asset market participa-\ntion is important for estimation of the elasticity of intertemporal sub-\nstitution. Differences in the estimates of the EIS between asset holders\nand non-asset holders are large and statistically significant. This is the\ncase whether one estimates the EIS on the basis of the Euler equation\nfor the NYSE stock index return and distinguishes between stockholders\nand nonstockholders as best as possible or estimates the EIS on the\nbasis of the Euler equation for Treasury bills and distinguishes between\nbondholders and nonbondholders. Estimates of the EIS are around\n0.3-0.4 for stockholders and 0.8-1 for bondholders, and they are larger\n\nfor households with larger asset holdings within these two groups.\n\nI do not attempt here to explain why some households chose corner\nsolutions for stocks or bonds. I have argued elsewhere (Vissing-\nJergensen 2002) that information costs work as entry costs and per\nperiod market participation costs, making it suboptimal for households\nwith low or moderate financial wealth to enter these markets.\n",

                    "898 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nOur results for the user cost of the nickel resource fall within the\nrange suggested by these previous studies. For our sample as a whole,\nestimated marginal user costs of ore average 8 percent of the price of\nnickel, whereas for the years contained within the Stollery sample, our\nestimates of user cost average 11 percent of the price of nickel.\n\nOur results can also be compared to the results that would be obtained\nif a model of market power that ignored the role of the resource input,\nas described in the Introduction, were applied to the Inco data. To do\n50, we reestimate equations (15), (17), and (27) after deleting all the\nparameters and variables involving N and. Z. That this would be a sig-\nnificant misspecification is confirmed by a test of the corresponding\nparameter restrictions. The Wald statistic is 116.44, and the critical value\nat the 1 percent level is 15.09.\n\nThe model specification without a natural resource input to produc-\ntion has 10 parameters, of which only two are significant at the 1 percent.\nlevel. The estimated value of the market power markup in this model\naverages $1.90, compared to $1.67 in the model incorporating the non-\nrenewable resource variables. For 31 of the 39 years in the sample, the\nmodel without the natural resource input overstates the degree of mar-\nket power exercised by Inco.\n\nV. Concluding Comments\n\nThe measurement of market power in nonrenewable natural resource\nindustries is complicated by the absence of observable market prices\nfor most nonrenewable resource inputs. Because the user cost of the\nresource input is left implicit, there isa risk of attributing its contribution\nto output price as being due to the existence of market power. In this\npaper we derive a method for simultaneously estimating three possible\ndeterminants of output price: the marginal market cost of production,\nthe user cost of the natural resource, and the existence of market power.\n\nApplication of our model to a newly constructed data set for Inco\nresults in the rejection of price-taking behavior, with output price sub-\nstantially exceeding the full marginal cost of output. Evaluation of the\nindividual determinants of output price indicates that the user cost of\nnickel ore accounts for a much smaller share of output price than the\nexercise of market power does.\n\nReferences\n\nAppelbaum, Elie. \"Testing Price Taking Behavior\" J.

                    "AGING POPULATION 917\n\nAlso, many workers enjoy employee-provided health care insurance (in\nEurope, often as a supplement for the public health system); public\nmedical insurance replaces this provision during retirement. Therefore,\nit may be considered \"fair\" to finance these benefits by payroll taxes.\nExtending the model and empirical work to consider the overall tax\nburden and the split into labor and capital income tax would be an\nimportant topic for future research.\n\nFor a recent theoretical and empirical analysis of capital income tax-\nation with an aging population see Razin et al. (2001/). The paper\nfleshes out a central political economy mechanism that causes the capital\nincome tax to rise when the share of the old in the population increases.\nThis fiscaleakage mechanism is akin to the one analyzed in the present\nstudy.\n\nIn the future, the aging of the baby boom generation and declining\nfertility rates in the advanced economies both suggest future increases\nin the dependency ratio. The results of this paper imply that this will\nput downward pressure on labor tax rates, as long as the voting bloc of\nthe retired is not the majority. This is relevant for the current debate\non the privatization of social security systems. In the context of our\nmodel, the desire to have individual retirement accounts rather than a\npay-as-you-go system can be seen as an attempt by current workers to\nlessen the fiscal leakage of transfers to the retired.\n\nReferences\n\nAlesina, Alberto, and Wacziarg, Romain. \"Openness, Country Size and Govern-\nment.\" J.

The results seem somewhat robust: the growth of Internet use\ndoes not appear to reduce the price of whole life policies (which were\nnot covered by the Internet insurance comparison sites), the growth of\nInternet use before 1996 (when insurance comparison sites did not\nexist) did not reduce prices, and the results are not affected by adding\ndetailed controls for changes in group-specific mortality.\n\nOverall growth of Internet usage can potentially explain a significant\nshare of the large price declines of the 1990s. The rise of the Internet\nfrom 1995 to 1997 appears to have reduced term life prices by about\n8-15 percent. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that, although\nseemingly a modest niche of Internet commerce, Internet comparison\nsites may have increased consumer surplus by $115-$215 million per\nyear and perhaps by as much as $1 billion.\n\nIn this sense, our results show that, at least for some financial products,\nthe ability of the Internet to reduce search costs can have a significant\nimpact on market power. When it does so, it may lead to large consumer\nwelfare gains, potentially at the expense of supplier profits. The impli-\ncations for the market value of on-line and off-line companies could\nnot be more important.\n\n",

Specifically, when investment demand is unrestrained by\nchanges in wages and interest rates, the model demonstrates its potential\nfor large synchronizations in investment timing in response to aggregate\nshocks. As shown in figure 5, these large changes in investment timing\ncan produce sufficiently large disturbances to the distribution of plants\nas to alter the path of aggregate investment demand both quantitatively\nand qualitatively relative to a business cycle model lacking establishment-\nlevel capital heterogeneity.\n\nThe importance of marketclearing price adjustment is vivid in the\nanalysis. Were the method less tractable, so that the examination ended\nwith such a fixed price figure, one would be led to conclude that lumpy\ninvestment plays a substantial role in aggregate dynamics. In fact, in\nequilibrium, this is shown to be incorrect. Large distributional shifts\ndisappear in the presence of relatively minor price changes, and the\ninclusion of lumpy plantJevel investment does not significantly alter the\nequilibrium predictions of the traditional neoclassical equilibrium busi-\nness cycle model.\n\nThis invariance of aggregate dynamics to the presence of lumpy cap-\nital adjustment at the micro level is not special. Similar results arise\nunder a variety of specifications for the underlying adjustment cost dis-\ntribution, household preferences, as well as the relative importance of.\ncapital and labor inputs in production. Of course, some modifications\nto the current environment may allow lumpy investment a more prom-\ninent aggregate role. While I have confined this study to economies in\nwhich aggregate productivity shocks are the sole exogenous source of\nfluctuations, it is possible that disturbances exerting more direct effects\non the plant distribution (e.g., changes in investment tax credits or\ndepreciation allowances) may generate dynamic effects more consistent\nwith the predictions of figure 5. Alternatively, given that the current\nfinding rests largely on the importance of household preferences in\ndetermining equilibrium quantities, it is also possible that relaxing the\nassumptions of complete markets or perfect competition may sufficiently\nweaken the role of the representative household as to overturn the\nresult.\n\n"

But the results reported in Section II\nindicate that the AR(1) processes for U.S. state-level income are not\nidentical. Exploratory analysis points to a potentially interesting regu-\nlarity: excess sensitivity is larger the higher the persistence of income.\nWe shall not pursue this issue further in this paper, but we believe that\nutilizing state-level differences in order to sort through the many models\nof consumer behavior is a fruitful area for research.?\n\nReferences\n\nAltonji, Joseph G., and Siow, Aloysius. \"Testing the Response of Consumption\nto Income Changes with (Noisy) Panel Data.\" Q.E. 102 (May 1987): 293-328.\n\nAsdrubali, Pierfederico; Sorensen, Bent E.; and Yosha, Oved. \"Channels of In-\nterstate Risk Sharing: United States 1963-1990.\" Q.J.E. 111 (November 1996):\n1081-1110.\n\nChristiano, Lawrence J. \"Why Is Consumption Less Volatile than Income?\" Fed.\nReserve Bank Minneapolis Q.

                    "PROTESTANT REFORMATION 669\n\nthe details and. eliminated the temporal connections of the Catholic\nChurch's belief structure. By the late Middle Ages, church doctrine\ninvolving purgatory, indulgence, confession, penance, and all their at-\ntendant beliefs had become so complex as to be unbelievable, especially\nat the high prices the church was charging for redemption.\n\nA number of other interesting areas of research relate to, but are\nexcluded from, this study. More work is required in order to produce\na clear picture of the special variants of Protestantism and how they\ndeveloped. Further research would, in particular, probe the precise na-\nture of the *breakaways\" and the impact of the Counter-Reformation\nligious markets. The Catholic Church was forced to adjust its pol-\nicies by new competition, and it would be interesting to see how it\nadjusted after entry took place (in both doctrine and practice).\n\nWe conclude by stressing that, in part, our argument conforms to the\nconventional wisdom. For centuries, historians and other observers have\nargued that the \"selling of indulgences\" produced the Protestant revolt.\nBut the traditional argument revolves around the *ethical\" conse-\nquences and attendant moral corruption that such venality introduced.\nBy contrast, we emphasize the economic consequences of early, medieval,\ndoctrinal innovations. Further, we have added a supply side to the ar-\ngument, which recognizes that the Catholic Church's viability was in-\nextricably linked to the kind of societal and economic institutions that\nwere extant at the time of the revolt.\n\n",

                    "MARKET MICROSTRUCTURE 379\n\nMore generally, intermediaries reduce the problems associated with ex\npost bargaining by offering binding contractual commitments (see Spul-\nber 1999). If intermediaries have incentives to honor contracts because\nthey deal with many buyers and sellers, they can make commitments\nthat cannot be made by individual buyers and sellers. Thus the solution\nto underinvestment is not necessarily vertical integration but rather the\nentry of intermediaries that enhance market efficiency and reduce or\neliminate contract holdup.\n\nVIII. Conclusion\n\nThe foregoing analysis shows that markets with competing dealers pro-\nvide incentives for efficient investment and are therefore superior to\ndecentralized direct exchange. The entry of competing intermediaries\nin business-to-business markets is likely to enhance complementary in-\nvestments by firms in a wide range of industries. The benefits from\nincreased investment and the improved efficiency of trade create market\nreturns to the entry of intermediaries. Rather than engage in costly\nscarch and bilateral bargaining, buyers and sellers turn to intermediaries\nto handle exchange at posted prices.\n\nWith decentralized exchange in a search market, underinvestment\nhas several sources. The incfficiency of search creates uncertainty about\nthe likelihood of finding a suitable trading partner. Moreover, random\nmatching lowers the expected gains from trade in successful matches.\nFinally, bargaining with the trading partner means that buyers and sellers\ndivide the gains from trade so that companies do not obtain the full\nmarginal return to their irreversible investment, which is similar to the\ncontract holdup problem. By posting prices, intermediaries alleviate\nthese three effects: reducing uncertainty about finding a trading partner,\nreducing uncertainty about the gains from trade, and reducing the\nholdup problem since buyers and sellers that trade with the dealer keep\nthe returns to their investment. Market microstructure matters for the\ninvestment efficiency.\n",

Of course, for this pro-\ngram to work, the pension fund must be made legally inalienable. Note\nthat, unlike the redistribution scenario discussed earlier, this forced-\nsaving program does not constitute a Pareto improvement (relative to\nthe competitive equilibrium allocation) since type B individuals are\nmade worse off; the \"paternalistic\" intervention is motivated entirely by\nthe selfish motives of type A individuals who wish to avoid being exposed\nto incidences of extreme deprivation.\n\nV. Concluding Remarks\n\nWhile the economic environment described above is highly stylized, it\narguably corresponds to reality along several key dimensions, in partic-\nular, the type of preference heterogeneity described above together with\nthe assumed access to financial markets. It is therefore plausible that\nmany real-world legal restrictions that effectively inalienate some types\nof property can be understood as an institutional response to the prob-\nlems highlighted above.\"\n",

A challenge for the multiunit auction theory is therefore to\nestablish under what conditions such equilibria exist.\n\nAppendix\nVolatility Estimation\n\nWe estimate conditional volatility with an ARCH(2) model using daily bond\nprice data.

In those cases, we use the prices of the most similar\nsecurity, that is, the traded Treasury bill, which matures 30 days before the new\nTreasury bill maturity (57 auctions), and the traded Treasury bond with duration\nthat most closely mimics the duration of the new Treasury bond (seven auctions).\nWhen a new Treasury bond is auctioned, we use the average winning auction\nyield to compute duration.\n",

                    "480 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\nII. Conclusion\n\nA puzzling aspect of Cornes and Silva's paper was that it apparently\ncontradicted another result by Bergstrom (1989), stating that the gen-\neralized quasi-linear form was necessary for the Rotten Kid theorem to\napply, whatever W. Our note provides an explanation for this discrep-\nancy. Cornes and Silva's argument, although formally correct, applies\nonly to interior solutions, whereas the Rotten Kid game is such that\nsolutions are not interior except for nongeneric W cases. It remains that\nthe Rotten Kid theorem holds in the public-good case provided that (i)\nkids have identical preferences and (ii) the patriarch treats the kids in\na purely symmetric way. This result, albeit less general than it initially\nappeared, still constitutes an insightful contribution to the understand-\ning of these problems. Whether it can be generalized to other settings\nis still an open question.\n\nReferences\n\nBergstrom, Theodore C. *A Fresh Look at the Rotten Kid Theorem\u2014and Other\nHousehold Mysteries.\" J.PE. 97 (October 1989): 1139-59.\n\nCornes, Richard C., and Silva, Emilson C.

In the absence of transfers, the outcome is C \u2014 1, P \u2014 1, and in this\ncase it is not possible for the D members to generate a large enough transfer\nto change the outcome. To see this, suppose that the 's try to bribe L2 M W\n\nmembers to vote for C \u2014 1, P \u2014 \u20141 in order to change the majority rule out-\ncome. The maximum transfer that the J's are willing to pay is X...\u00bb2|/|, their\nincrease in utility from C \u2014 1, P\u2014 \u20141 relative to C \u2014 1, P \u2014 I; the unbribed\n\nWs are willing to offer a counterbr\nmembers from accepting the bribe is\n\nAUP* \u2014 - Mie Yo - Y 260, (A3)\ne s rA\n\ne of X,w;21, The net utility to the L\n\nwhere the first term represents the bribees' loss in utility from getting their less\npreferred outcome \u20ac \u2014 1, P \u2014 \u20141, the second term is the maximum bribe from\nthe D's, and the third term is the loss of the maximum counterbribe from the\nremaining Ws. Since this expression equals \u20142,f, which is weakly negative,\nthe L members refuse to sell their votes. Suppose instead that the majority of\nmembers are D, with M the size of their numerical advantage. In this case the\nW members are willing to pay a bribe of X ,- 21, to any set L2 M of D members\nto vote for C \u2014 1, P \u2014 1, and the unbribed D members will pay a counterbribe\n\u00bb.9|t,].

We focus on the case in which X,/,2 0 (the proof for X,1,\u00ab0 is\nanalogous). Here l 1 defeats C \u2014 1, \u20141 (from lemma 2). If\nND X, 2|| \u00ab0, then \u20ac \u2014 1, P \u2014 1 also defeats C \u2014 0 (from lemma 1), and\nso it is the Condorcet winner.

Students who score poorly on stan-\ndardized achievement tests are also more likely to smoke.\n\nMore basic to the economic model of human behavior than the law\nof demand is the idea that consumers make choices by comparing the\nperceived marginal benefits with the perceived marginal costs of each\ndecision. Given other important influences on the perceived marginal\nbenefits and costs, the monetary price of cigarettes may play a relatively\nsmall role in youth smoking decisions. Summarizing research on psy-\nchosocial risk factors, the Surgeon General's report on preventing youth\nsmoking concluded that the influence of peers plays a \"powerful role,\"\nbecause \"smoking initiation appears to be a component of peer asso-\nciations and. peer bonding in adolescence, as peer groups establish\nshared behaviors to differentiate themselves from other adolescents and\nfrom adults\" (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 19945,\np. 139). On the basis of a comprehensive literature review, Tyas and\nPederson (1998, p. 416) also conclude that *one of the most consistent\nfindings in the literature is that of the social influence of peers and\nothers on adolescent smoking.\" Our results on the importance of var-\niables such as dropout status are consistent with strong peer influences\non youth smoking behavior. If peer influences are the major determi-\nnant of youth smoking, then the demand for cigarettes can be viewed\nas derived from the demand for peer acceptance. This approach may\nhelp explain the strong brand preferences of youth smokers and why\nyouth smoking behavior and brand preferences vary systematically with\nrace/ethnicity (DeCicca et al. 2000; Kenkel and Mathios 2000). Further\nevidence on the technology of producing peer acceptance is needed to\ndevelop predictions about the likely price responsiveness of the derived\ndemand for cigarettes.\n\nReferences\n\nAllison, Paul D.

Our findings suggest instead that this market is indeed ag-\ngregating information.\n\nOur portfolio shifts model provides explicit characterization of this\ninformation aggregation process. The model is also quite successful in\nthat it accounts for more than 60 percent of daily changes in the deut-\nsche mark/dollar rate and more than 40 percent of daily changes in\nthe yen/dollar rate. Our estimates of the sensitivity of the spot rate to\norder flow are sensible as well and square with past estimates at the\nindividual-dealer level.\n\nOur objective in this paper is to clarify order flow's role in transmitting\ninformation to price. Pushing this line further, one may ask, What pre-\ncisely is the information driving order flow? As noted, from a valuation\nperspective, there are two distinct views. The first view is that order flow\nreflects new information about valuation numerators (i.e., future inter-\nest differentials). The second view is that order flow reflects new infor-\nmation about valuation denominators (i.e., anything that affects dis-\ncount rates). Our portfolio shifts model is an example of the latter: by\nassumption, order flow is unrelated to valuation numerators\u2014the future\nAr, Order flow of this type can result from, for example, shocks to\nliquidity demands, shocks to hedging demands, or timewarying risk\ntolerance. An example consistent with the valuation numerators view is\nthat order flow proxies for changes in individuals! interest differential\nexpectations. Future work can distinguish the two views, for example, by\ndecomposing order flow to determine whether specific trader types pro-\nduce higherampact (i.e., more informative) orders, as opposed to the\nundifferentiated. price impact of public orders in the portfolio shifts\nmodel.\n\n",

Empirically, polyandry seems to be a marriage\npattern that survives only under very precarious conditions, despite the\napparent complementarity between polygyny and polyandry. Prostitu-\ntion provides a possible explanation why the two do not coexist. Con-\nsider the following example: the sex ratio balances, and some men can\nafford to take several wives. This would imply that not all remaining\nmen can take one wife each. In principle, these men may prefer to share\na wife. However, polyandry among the lower social rungs breaks down\nif women prefer to be prostitutes to the whole population rather than\nwives to a subset of poor men.\n\nReferences\n\nAtchison, Chris; Fraser, Laura; and Lowman, John. \"Men Who Buy Sex: Prelim-\ninary Findings of an Exploratory Study.\" In Prostitution: On.

                    "2932 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nCentral Florida are beginning a Center for Environmental Policy Analysis\n(CEPA). CEPA is a proposed research center to examine local, state, and global\nenvironmental issues such as air and water pollution, endangered species pro-\ntection, and biodiversity enhancement. We believe that careful research will lead.\nto solutions to important environmental problems.\n\nCEPA will be housed in the Department of Economics in the College of\nBusiness. Although CEPA has some seed money available, we cannot begin op-\nerating until we have funded the equipment required for our researchers. Con-\nsequently, we are writing to ask for your help in creating CEPA at the University\nof Central Florida. We would like you to consider making a contribution towards\nthe purchase of a $3,000 computer to be used by researchers at CEPA. We have\nalready obtained funds to cover [1056] [3376] [6756] of the cost for this com-\nputer, so we are soliciting donations to cover the remaining [$2,700] [$2,000]\n[$1,000].\n\nYou are part of a group of 500 individuals to whom we are writing to fund\nthis particular purchase. If we fail to raise the [$2,700] [$2,000] [$1,000] from\nthis group of 500 individuals, we will not be able to purchase the computer,\n[but we will use the received funds to cover other operating expenditures of\nCEPA] [so we will refund your donation to you]. If we do raise at least [$2,700]\n[$2,000] [$1,000], we will purchase the computer and use any additional rev-\nenues above this threshold to fund CEPA's other needs. In either case, you will\nreceive a note from us to let you know the status of your donation.\n\nI hope you will join us in our commitment to sensible environmental policy\nby making a financial donation to CEPA by December 31, 1999. AII donations\nare tax deductible. Please complete the enclosed contribution form and make\nchecks payable to \"CEPA.\" We have enclosed a postage-paid return envelope for\nyour convenience. For further information about CEPA, please see the enclosed\nbrochure. Please contact me if you have any questions about this fund-raising\ncampaign. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

Given current rates of\nenforcement for drunk driving, the appropriate loss per drunk driving\narrest is approximately $8,000.\n\nThe methodology we present provides a simple, flexible, inexpensive\ntool for analyzing driver risk. Unlike past survey methods that are ex-\npensive to administer and subject to important nonparticipation biases,\nour approach is easily implemented using only data on fatal accidents\nthat are readily available. Our method can be applied to any driver\ncharacteristic, any localized geographic area, and any time period. The\nvariety of specifications presented suggests that the method is robust.\n\nThe estimates we obtain can be used to inform public policy debates\non road safety. In contrast to reduced-form estimates, which can reveal\nonly what policies have worked in the past, the more structural approach\nwe adopt may suggest better policies for the future that take into account\nbehavioral responses of drinking drivers. For instance, random road-\nblocks work solely on the margin of reducing the number of drinking\ndrivers, ignoring the possibility that the care such drivers take might be\naffected. Our results suggest that policies focused on stopping erratic\ndrivers with greater frequency might be more successful. For instance,\nrewards could be provided to motorists who use cellular phones to help\npolice identify reckless drivers, or dedicated police patrols could be\ncreated whose only responsibility is the identification of drunk dri\nEmploying the latter strategy, a pilot program in Stockton, California,\nreduced involvement in drunk driving crashes by 10-15 percent by ded-\nicating the equivalent of four full-time-equivalent police officers exclu-\nsively to drunk driving patrols (Voas and Hause 1987).\n\nMore generally, our approach to addressing the issue of drinking and\ndriving may provide insight to researchers on topics far afield. By ex-\nploiting the hidden richness of the data arising from interactions be-\ntween participants, we are able to identify relationships in the data that\nmay have seemed beyond reach ex ante. Variations on our approach\nmay be useful in examining other issues in which agents interact, for\nexample, search models, the transmission of AIDS, oligopoly pricing,\nand the relationship between special-interest groups and politicians. The\nparallel between our model and these more complicated economic set-\ntings is not exact because the random matching in our traffic model is\nless plausible in other cases (e.g., Flinn and Heckman 1982). Nonethe-\nless, with the adoption of an appropriate alternative matching model,\nextensions of this model may prove relevant.\n\n",

By 1972 the individual categories become too ex-\ntensive to itemize, ranging from country club memberships to electrical equip-\nment to music lessons to swimming pool maintenance. Recreational expendi-\ntures in 1972-73 are understated relative to 1960-61 because some of the\ntransportation expenditures included in 1960-61 in recreation were not in-\ncluded in 1972-73. In. 1972-73, vacation expenditures on food, lodging, and\ntravel are explicitly identified. However, by 1980, vacation expenditures on food,\nlodging, and gasoline are no longer identified. Because vacation travel was iden-\ntified in neither the 1935-36 nor the 1980-94 surv I do not include it in my\ndefinition of total recreational expenditures.\n\nB. Price Indexes\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has been measuring changes in retail\nprices of goods and services purchased by city wage carners and clerical workers\nsince 1913 using weights calculated from the consumer expenditure surveys.\nIndexes from 1800 through 1912 are estimated from price data from sources\nother than the BLS (see series E135-66 in U.S. Bureau of the Census [1975,\npp. 210-11]).\n\nThe BLS provides regional price indexes up to the present day for urban\nconsumers for all items and for food beginning in 1967 and for food at home,\nnonfood, and recreation beginning in 1978.\" Price indexes for earlier years are\ngiven for selected cities only. I weight the price indexes for cities on the basis\nof their populations to create regional price indexes. For 1917-50, I use the\ncities and price indexes given in ZIandbook of Labor Statistics: 1950 Edition (U.S.\nBureau of the Census 1951) to create regional price indexes for all items and\nfor all food. For 1950-67 for all items and for food, for 1953-78 for food at\nhome, and for 1960-78 for recreation, I use the smaller sample of cities for\nwhich continuous price indexes are available.^ The food index used in the\nestimation is based on the price of all food. The results were not sensitive to\nthe use of a price index for food at home instead of all food.\n\nReferences\n\nBaily, Martin Neil. \"Productivity and the Services of Capital and Labor.\" Brookings\nPapers Econ.

                    "1112 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nimmediately before. In all specifications, the coefficient estimate for the\nCCW dummy variable is statistically insignificant. This finding suggests\nthat property crime rates were trending up differentially in CCW states\nprior to the passage of the legislation and that the passage of the law\nwas not associated with a significant change in property crime relative\nto its pre-CCW rate.\n\nCarrying concealed weapons legislation could plausibly have affected\nthe crime rate through two channels. Using the magazine sales data, I\nfind no evidence to suggest that CCW laws caused a reduction in the\nviolent crime rate through either of these two pathways. Consistent with\nthis, robustness checks of the Lott-Mustard findings cast considerable\ndoubt on the hypothesis that CCW legislation had any effect on crime\nrates.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nThis paper uses a unique data set to demonstrate that increases in gun\nownership lead to substantial increases in the overall homicide rate.\nThis is driven entirely by a relationship between firearms and homicides\nin which a gun is used, implying that the results are not driven by reverse\ncausation or by omitted variables. The relationship between changes in\ngun ownership and changes in all other crime categories is weaker and\ntypically insignificant, suggesting that guns influence crime primarily by\nincreasing the homicide rate.\n\nThe data employed in this paper should allow researchers to answer\nother important questions regarding the impact of alternative gun con-\ntrol policies and the effect of gun ownership on other outcomes of\ninterest. After peaking at more than 39,000 in 1993, the number of\nindividuals dying from gun-inflicted injuries fell by 23 percent during\nthe next five years. While much of this decline is due to a reduction in\ngun homicides, the number of deaths from gun suicides has also fallen\nsubstantially Whether recent reductions in firearm. ownership have\ncaused the reduction in the nation's suicide rate is an important topic\nfor future research.\n\nMore generally, the magazine sales data employed in this paper sug-\ngest an alternative strategy for estimating variables that have previously\nbeen considered unobservable. Similar applications of these data in\nother settings may allow researchers to answer other important empirical\nquestions more convincingly.\n\nReferences\n\nAyres, Ian, and Donohue, John J., III. *A Trend Analysis of Shall-Issue Laws.\"\nManuscript.

A new\ntype of car engine will be evaluated not only on whether it makes a car\ngo faster but also on whether it produces an acceptably smooth ride,\nacceptably low pollution, a good-looking car, and so on. A new way of\ntraining for the 1,500-meter run, on the other hand, need produce only\nfaster times. Technical progress might be faster in track and field for\nthis reason.\"\n",
                    "B. Method of Estimation\n\nWe believe that this paper is the first to estimate the parameters of non-\ni.i.d. record processes. The empirical techniques we develop for studying\ntrack and field records may also prove helpful for other problems that\neconomists study. In many areas of economic life, people do things a\ncertain way until something better comes along. Physicians injected Salk\npolio vaccine until oral Sabin vaccine was invented; they adhered to the\nstress theory of ulcer causation until the bacteria theory triumphed.\nPeople stopped buying vinyl when compact discs became available. Ab-\nelard was true to his vows until Heloise came along. Consumers stick\nto their favorite brands of soda, running shoes, pretzels, and cars until\nthey find brands they like better.\n\nIf people stick to the old ways until they find something better, the\ntheory of record processes explains how often they change. That is how\nwe link records and international trade: at any moment the region\nproducing automobiles for the U.S. market, say, should be the region\nthat can do so most cheaply (in relative terms); so switches in the origin\nof automobiles should occur only when another region finds it can\nproduce more cheaply (always in relative terms). A change in the origin\nof U.S. automobiles is like a record break: a new region can produce\nmore cheaply than all previous regions. Thus track and field, technical\nprogress, and international trade are not the only areas in which switches\nare like record breaks. The theory of records offers testable predictions\nabout how often people will change jobs, drugs, marriage partners,\nbrands of soda, and political affiliations.\n\nReferences\n\nBartel, Ann P., and Sicherman, Nachum. \"Technological Change and Wages:\nAn Interindustry Analysis.\" PE. 107 (April 1999): 285-325.\n\n? The Lagrangian transformation shows that every constrained optimization problem\nwith a single objective (e.g., a track and field problem) is equivalent to an unconstrained\noptimization problem of the weighted sum of multiple objectives (e.g., a car design prob-\nlem). This is the deeper reason why it does not scem possible to guess, a priori, which\nsort of problem should be more amenable to progress through innovation.\n\n"

Thus, for any\nD, \u20ac p, we can define o, \u00bb 0 such that\n\nop \u2014 h(p,),\n\nnoting that, by construction, (a) \u2014 0 for \u00ab\u20ac (0, o). As o(a) \u2014 8(a)(o), this\nalso implies o(a) \u2014 0 foro \u00ab o\u00ab,. When this argument is applied to p., this implies\nthat since p, \u00ab , there exists a., \u20ac (0, o) such that o(a,,, p,) \u2014 0\u00aba,. Since\nG(o,. p) \u00bb o, again by the intermediate value theorem, there exists \u00e0^ \u20ac\n(c, 0) such that o(a^, p.) \u2014 a. Since both a^ and o are nonzero, this es-\ntablishes that, for some p \u00ab p, multiple equilibria with a positive frequency of.\nwar exist. To define p, observe that when p 0, c(a, p) \u2014 0 for all a \u20ac (0, 1].\nThus if p is sufficiently small, only the Kant equilibrium exists. Thus p can be\ndefined as the minimum of the set of p for which multiple equilibria exist. Since\nwe already demonstrated that this set includes p,\u00ab, p is in the interior of\n(0, p).\n\nA() \u2014\n\n-p\n\nProof of Proposition 4\n\nThe multiplicity condition is lim, ., d(o)/da \u00bb 1. Stability of the Kant equilibrium\nrequires lim, ., do/da & 1. Thus the multiplicity condition rules out stability for\nthe Kant equilibrium.\n\nProof of Proposition 5\n\nSince o(\u00e0) is continuous in \u00ab and since o(1) \u00ab 1, the largest & must be such that.\ndo(&)/da \u00ab 1; hence, it is locally stable. For the Kant equilibrium, we know from.\nproposition 3 that there exists o\u00ab, such that o(a) \u2014 0 for all a \u00ab a. So suppose\nthat we have a small deviation from the steady state, a, \u2014 y, where q \u20ac\n(0, 4). Then &, \u2014 \u00bb. But then , 2 \u00f3(\u00e0&) \u2014 9() \u2014 0, which is exactly the\nsteady state. So the Kant equilibrium is also stable.\n\nReferences\n\nAlesina, Alberto, and Spolaore, Enrico. \"International Conflict, Defense Spend-\ning and the Size of Countries.\" Working Paper no. 5694.

                    "GEOGRAPHY OF INVESTMENT 839\n\ntors located near a firm can visit the firm's operations, talk to supplie!\nand employees, and assess the local market conditions in which the firm\noperates. In addition to the lower travel, time, and research costs as-\nsociated with obtaining such information, local investors may also gain\naccess to private information. Mutual fund managers and local corporate\nexecutives may run in the same circles, belong to the same country club,\nand so forth. Our finding of stronger local profits among smaller, older,\nand remotely located funds is consistent with this.\n\nOur results provide new insights into the mutual fund industry, of-\nfering rare evidence of mutual funds' ability to select stocks. In addition,\nour findings contribute to a growing literature on the economic im-\nportance of geography, shedding light on the propensity to invest locally,\ndocumented by Coval and Moskowitz (19994) and Huberman (in press),\nand perhaps the international home bias puzzle. However, despite the\nfact that these papers document a local bias in investor equity holdings,\ngiven the local performance results, it remains a puzzle as to why funds\ndo not hold even more local stocks. In equilibrium, it seems that fund\nmanagers should focus exclusively on local assets, specializing in their\nimmediate area and minimizing monitoring and search costs. Investors\ncan then hold a diversified set of these localized funds. This, of course,\nis not the current state of the mutual fund industry. As Coval and Mos-\nkowitz (19997) show, the clients of mutual funds tend to be geograph-\nically localized as well and concentrated in a small number of funds.\nThus they may prefer a more diversified portfolio. This may be an\ninteresting avenue for further inquiry.\n\nFinally, the role of asymmetric information in determining equilib-\nrium asset prices has been addressed in several models (e.g., Merton\n1987; Wang 1993, 1994; Jones and Slezak 1999) yet has proved difficult\nto assess empirically. Theory offers little guidance in distinguishing be-\ntween securities with scarce information from those with widely available\ninformation, and it does not identify informed investors in the investor\npopulation. This paper may offer a unique method of identifying firms\nheld by asymmetrically informed investors. Investors located near po-\ntential investments may have significant information advantages relative\nto the rest of the market. By documenting the relationship between\nlocal bias and trading activity, we offer potential insights into the be-\nhavior of informed investors, identifying perhaps the first set of seem-\ningly informed traders.\n\n",

The constants o, and\nB, are chosen such that in each year average black and nonblack support for\nwelfare equals zero. This prevents the predictor from being driven simply by\nthe statewide proportion of blacks. Average support for welfare spending in each\ntract is calculated as a weighted average of black and nonblack support:\n\n(support for welfare), \u2014 (black support for welfare),\n\nx (fraction black)\n\n^ (nonblack support for welfare),\n\nx (fraction nonblack) (B10)\n\nStateJevel welfare support is calculated as a populationoweighted average of\nwelfare support in the census tracts. To ensure that the predictor is not driven\nby a possible bias in the welfare proxy that varies across states, I rescaled the\nwelfare proxy for each state such that the caseload/population ratio according\nto the proxy equals the caseload/population ratio from administrative data. This\nrescaling slightly reduces the statistical significance of the predictor.\n\nReferences\n\nAlesina, Alberto; Baqir, Reza; and Easterly, William. \"Public Goods and Ethnic\nDivisions.\" Q,.E. 114 (November 1999): 1243-84.\n\nBobo, Lawrence, and Kluegel, James R. \"Opposition to Race-Targeting: Self-\nInterest, Stratification Ideology, or Racial Attitudes?\" American Sociological Rev.\n58 (August 1993): 443-64.\n\nBowles, Samuel, and Gintis, Herbert. *Reciprocity, Self-Interest and the Welfare\nState.\" Manuscript.

An ousted right-wing government\nhas about twice as large a cycle (12 percent of total debt) as a reelected\nright-wing incumbent. In contrast, an ousted left-wing government has\na considerably smaller cycle (1.5 percent of total debt) than a reelected\nleft:wing government. These results further strengthen the strategic debt\nexplanation of this paper.\n\nAnother issue that would lend support to the strategic debt expla-\nnation is that leftwing and right-wing governments actually pursue dif-\nferent fiscal policies once in power. The explicit assumption in Persson\nand Svensson's strategic debt model is that left:wing governments want\nhigher spending than rightwing governments. Pettersson-Lidbom\n(2000) makes an extensive test of whether different parties matter for\nfiscal policy choices, again using the same sample of Swedish local gov-\nernments. The empirical identification strategy is now to control for\nboth municipality fixed effects and time-specific effects. Thus the par-\ntisanship effect is identified only when there has been a change in power.\nI find significant and sizable partisanship effects: a change of power\nfrom left to right leads to an immediate spending cut of about 1.6\npercent of total spending, and vice versa. The long-run effect is instead\non the order of 12 percent of spending.\n\nVIL Conclusion\n\nMy results strongly suggest that a right-wing government accumulates\nmore debt during its term in office the more likely its anticipated elec-\ntoral loss. On the other hand, a leftwing government accumulates less\ndebt the higher the probability of its defeat. These effects are sizable:\na right-wing government increases its level of debt by 15 percent, whereas\na leftwing government decreases its debt by 11 percent, both believing\nthat they will be replaced with certainty rather than remain in office\nwith certainty. These results are consistent with the predictions from\nthe strategic debt model developed by Persson and Svensson (1989).\n\nReferences\n\nAghion, Phillipe, and Bolton, Patrick. \"Government Domestic Debt and the Risk\nof Default: A Politica-Economic Model of the Strategic Role of Debt.\" In\nPublic Debt Management: Theory and History, edited by Rudiger Dornbush and\nMario Draghi.

Li, Rosen, and Suen (in press) show that incentives\nto manipulate evidence by committee members to their own advantage\nmake efficient sharing of evidence impossible. Instead, under any com-\nmittee decision rule such as the threshold rule in Section II, the support\nof each member's evidence is partitioned into intervals, and only the\nrank-ordered information of which interval the observation lies in mat-\nters to the committee decision. Thus private and manipulable evidence\nimposes restrictions on the way information is aggregated in the com-\nmittee. Any remedy to the free-rider problem should respect these re-\nstrictions. Analysis of the free-rider problem in evidence gathering in\nthe presence of information manipulation is worth pursuing in future\nresearch.\n\n",

In particular, fix a monotonic Markov equilibrium and any given \u00c0 and y;\nthere exists x such that, for all x & x, there is babbling at every history in which\nthe advisor's reputation is \u00c0 and (x, y) are the values of the current decision\nproblem.\n\nI conclude with a brief analysis of what happens if there is no variation in x\nand y and the discount rate of the decision maker goes to one (say without loss\nof generality that they were equal to one in every period). What can we say\nabout monotonic Markov equilibria in this case? It will be shown by contradiction\nthat, for at least some discount rates for the bad advisor and utility functions\nfor the decision maker, there is not a truth-telling equilibrium. In particular,\nsuppose that the good advisor always told the truth and the bad advisor always\nannounced 1 (this is a best response for the bad advisor if \u00e0, is sufficiently close\nto zero). Then we would have T(0) \u2014 1 \u2014 y, A(0, 1) \u2014 1, and A(0, 0) \u2014 1; and\nfor small \u00c0, we would also have T(1) \u00ab3, A(1, 1) \u00ab0, and A(1, 0) 20. So suppose.\nthat the good advisor has reputation close to 0 and has just observed signal 1\nWhat is the expected net gain from lying and announcing 0? There is a current\nloss of ip, (5, 1) \u2014 \u00fcpy(1 \u2014 y, 1). The benefit is that at future histories in which\nsignal 1 is realized and signal 0 has never occurred, the decision maker will\nreceive \u00e1p, 1) \u2014 \u00e1p, (4, 1). There is a probability one-half that such a history\noccurs next period, probability one-fourth that it occurs next period, and so on.\nThus if \u00e0,,, is sufficiently close to one and A is sufficiently close to zero, there\nis an incentive for the good advisor to lie if\n\n9d, 1) & d \u2014 y, D t psy, D-\n\nThis condition holds for some strictly concave utility functions, and in this case\nthere cannot be any truth-telling equilibrium.\n\nReferences\n\nAusten-Smith, David. \"Explaining the Vote: Constituency Constraints on So-\nphisticated Voting.\" American J.

                    "278 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\nVI. Conclusion\n\nEconomists focus on parents! investments in their children's human\ncapital to explain the effect of parental income on their children's\noutcomes but ignore children's behavior and parent-child interactions.\nBuilding on work in psychology and sociology, I emphasize the impor-\ntance of child-rearing practices, which vary with income. Parents\" ability\nto mold their children's behavior through pecuniary incentives is limited\nat low incomes, leading to lower outcomes and increased reliance on\nnonpecuniary mechanisms such as corporal punishment. In this way,\nmy model generates a positive relationship between parental income\nand children's outcomes, especially at low incomes, and endogenously\nproduces a relationship between parental income and child-rearing\npractices. These implications are supported by my empirical analysis.\n\n",

                    "POLICY ASSESSMENT 285\n\nalternatives.\" Belief in the Pareto principle not only rules out the choice\nof Pareto-dominated policies but also renders inadmissible a wide range\nof criteria for assessing policy.\"\n\nHaving stressed that policy assessment must be welfarist if one believes\nin the Pareto principle, let us comment on several senses in which\ncertain apparently utility-independent. principles, notably, commonly\nheld notions of fairness, may nevertheless be relevant when evaluating\npolicy under a welfarist approach. First, individuals may have a taste for\nadherence to a principle of fairness; that is, their utilities might be\nhigher if a policy embodies some notion of fairness (such as that pun-\nishment should fit the crime). In this case, the taste for fairness would\nbe relevant under purely welfarist assessment, just as any other taste\nwould. Second, a notion of fairness might be useful for policymaking\nif it serves as a good proxy principle for raising utilities when direct\nassessment of policies cannot be undertaken. (Punishing in proportion\nto the seriousness of crime may lead to approximately optimal deter-\nrence.) Third, some notions of fairness and justice (such as rights of\nindividuals against the government) might usefully be incorporated in\nrules in order to constrain the behavior of agents who cannot be trusted\nto use their discretion to maximize social welfare.\" Fourth, teaching and\ninculcating principles of fairness and everyday morality are consistent\nwith maximization of individualistic measures of social welfare, for belief\nin these principles (such as keeping promises) induces individuals to\nrefrain from behavior (breaking promises) that would harm others.\"\n\nReferences\n\nDiamond, Peter A. *Cardinal Welfare, Individualistic Ethics, and Interpersonal\nComparison of Utility: Comment.\" J.PE. 75 (October 1967): 765-66.\n\nHare, Richard M. Moral Thinking: Its Levels, Method, and Point. Oxford: Oxford\nUniv. Press, 1981.\n\n' However unlikely it may be that two randomly selected states could be ranked by the\nPareto principle, it can be seen from our proof that the following is nevertheless true: At\nany point (in the space of utility profiles) at which, under a social welfare function, any\nimportance is attached to a non-welfare-based consideration (i.e., wherever, under the\nsocial welfare function, two states with the same utility profiles but distinct nonutility\ninformation are assessed differently), it is possible to identify other states such that there\nis a Pareto conflict.\n\n^ A similar point, that examining the case of identical individuals can lead one to reject\ncertain normative approaches (even if individuals are not in fact identical), is made by\nMirrlees (1982).\n\n7 The libertarian rights examined in Sen (1970) \u2014mentioned in n. 2\u2014and the concern\nfor \"process\" noted by Diamond (1967) seem appealing for this reason. Indeed, this reason\nsupplies us with an entirely welfarist justification of libertarian and process rights.\n\n\"In particular, individuals are led to adhere to the principles by a feeling of virtue if\nthey obey the principles and by a feeling of guilt or a fear of social disapproval if they do\nnot. Such instrumental views of morality are emphasized by, among others, Mill (1863),\nSidgwick (1907), and Hare (1981).\n\n"

We\nconjecture that the positive correlation obtained in earlier studies may\nbe explained, in part, by mismeasurement of the opportunity cost of\ncapital, the complementarity of skilled labor and capital, and omitted\nvariable bias.\n\nIt is unlikely that wages are positively related to equity returns because\nmore successful firms employ more skilled labor that is also more ex-\npensive. We estimate the impact of equity returns on wages after con-\ntrolling for the worker's age, race, sex, education, and job tenure. More-\nover, wage change regressions that difference out time-invariant firm\nand worker characteristics, including unobserved skills, yield nearly\nidentical coefficients on equity returns. Finally, equity returns are insig-\nnificantly related to observed worker characteristics, which suggests that\nthe bias due to omitted skill variables in our sample mall.\n\nOur empirical results also demonstrate that the positive relationship\nbetween wages and shareholder wealth is not explained by demand\nshocks and inelastic labor supply schedules. More rapidly growing firms\nemploy less skilled workers and pay lower wages, all else equal. In ad-\ndition, estimated equity return elasticities are nearly identical whether\nwage regressions include or exclude employment growth variables. Fi-\nnally, wage-equity return elasticities are larger at longer lags, and these\nelasticities are not significantly higher for workers with more specific\nhuman capital, which contradicts the predictions of a simple model with\ndemand shocks and inelastic labor supply.\n\n",

                    "INFORMATION AND COMPETITION 415\nAppendix B\n\nIn this Appendix, we briefly describe our data sources and criteria for selecting\nour sample. The data can be divided into two categories: bidding data and cutting.\ndata. The bidding data contain information on sale appraisals as well as the\nhighest bids placed by each bidder at the auction. These data are publicly\navailable from the Forest Service immediately after the auction. The cutting data\nare the ex post information about the timber actually removed from the tract.\nThese data are also publicly available from the Forest Service. Because the Forest.\nService uses different coding systems for the different species of timber in the\nbidding and cutting data, the Forest Service data are somewhat difficult to work\nwith, and so we purchased \"matched\" data from one of the leading industry\ndata sources, Timber Data Company.\n\nWe selected a number of forests, focusing on larger forests that had a large\nfraction of sales with two major species. The forests we obtained include region\n6, forests 1-6, 9-12, and 15-18; and region 5, forests 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 14-18.\nAmong the sales from these forests, we consider only sales in which the matching\nprocess met certain reliability criteria. We then narrowed the sample along a\nnumber of criteria.\n\nIn region 6, we ruled out sales in which the average bid per mbf was within\n$1 of the reservation price, since such sales leave little scope for skewing; sim-\nilarly, we ruled out sales in which the overbid per mbf was less than 5 percent\nof the appraised difference in values, Ax We further ruled out sales with extreme\nmisestimates (greater than 27 percent) or gaps between aggregate volume sold\nand cut (greater than 30 percent in magnitude on the sale, or 25 percent on\neither species) since these sales may have special circumstances (e.g., cutting\nmay have been aborted for some reason). We then dropped outliers along a\nnumber of dimensions, including only sales with volume estimated between 100\nmbf and 25,000 mbf and density less than 115 mbf per acre. Finally, we dropped\nsales in which road construction was greater than 2.5 percent of the value of\nthe sale. Since the government reimburses road construction using a compli-\ncated system of credits, bids in sales with low road construction can be inter-\npreted more directly in terms of expected payments. For region 5, we used\nessentially the same criteria, with one notable exception: we allowed sales with\nroad construction valued at up to 100 percent of the appraised value of the\ntract. This allows a larger sample size, a problem for region 5 sealed-bid auctions.\n\nFinally, we note a subtlety that arises in interpreting the bidding data. Forest\nService regulations require that no matter what the appraised values and costs,\nall per unit bids must clear a certain minimum value, known as the *base rate.\"\nOn a small number of sales, the base rate is greater than the reserve price. Thus\nthe Forest Service might accept a bid that violates the base rate rule. In such a\ncase, the Forest Service uses a preannounced mechanism to lower the bid on\nsome species and raise it on others. In this way, firms can sometimes achieve\nskews that violate the posted reserve price constraints. Fortunately, the Forest\nService data include the information required for us to compute the amount a\nbidder anticipates paying when the bid is placed. This is known as the \"statistical\nbid,\" and all our results use the statistical bids. In any case, only a few sales are\naffected by this rule.\n\nReferences\n\nAthey, Susan. *Monotone Comparative Statics under Uncertainty\" QE. (in\n\npress). (a)\n"

                    "COMPETITIVE FAIR DIVISION 441\n\nbids are made in proportion to the differences, or gaps, between these\nbids for each room and the nextlower bids. Thereby the market helps\nto set prices by incorporating the most competitive lower bids into the\npricing mechanism.\n\nThe Gap Procedure precludes the possibility of negative rent. In ad-\ndition, it assigns rooms to players at prices that never exceed their bids,\nensuring that the allocation is feasible and the total rent equals a pre-\ndetermined amount. Because no other room assignments and prices\ncan yield surpluses Pareto-superior to the Gap surpluses, the Gap sur-\npluses are Pareto-optimal, though not exclusively so (if negative rents\nare disallowed). While this Pareto optimality rules out mutually bene-\nficial trades, it does not rule out envy: one player may prefer another's\nroom at the price it pays. Indeed, there may be no feasible envy-free\nassignments at nonnegative prices if there are four or more players.\n\nWhile the Gap Procedure does not always give an envy-free allocation,\neven when this is possible (which is always the case when there are only\ntwo or three players), we believe that the Gap prices take proper account\nof market competition. It seems only fair that prices should be higher\nwhen there is greater demand for items. Additional advantages of the\nGap Procedure are that it is monotonic in bids, encourages sincere\nbidding, and generates prices that are partially independent of the bids.\n\nBesides the fair division of rent among housemates, the Gap Proce-\ndure is applicable to situations in which cach player is entitled to receive\none item\u2014and perhaps more than one if the procedure is applied round\nby round. Besides MBA interviews, it might be applied in equalentitle-\nment auctions ranging from estate division to chore division, including\nburden sharing at the international level.\n\nOther political applications of the Gap Procedure come to mind in\nwhich players do not have equal endowments or entitlement, as in\nbidding for ministerial posts in a parliamentary government. Suffice it\nto say that the Gap Procedure offers a promising approach to balancing\ncompetition and fairness, though neither it nor any other procedure\ncan entirely eliminate envy.\n\n",

Hence, for\nK \u20ac (0, K\"), the left-hand side of (21) is strictly greater than the right-hand side\nfor any e \u20ac 1/2(1 \u2014 6). Hence threats are too costly for group A. Therefore, the\nSPE outcome is one in which the franchise is not granted for any value of a. If.\nK K', the lefthand and right-hand sides of (21) may cross at a \u00ab 1/9(1 \u2014 6).\nHence the equilibrium will be dependent on a. If we denote the nth crossing\nto the left of 1/2(1 \u2014 6) by o, then we shall have alternating equilibria.

                    "SPOUSAL LEISURE 201\n\nFrom propositions 3-6, we can see that the partials of the sharing rule,\nindividual consumption on unassignable commodities, independent lei-\nsure, and spousal leisure are fully recovered as terms of the first and\nsecond derivatives of some functions. This means that identification\ndepends on the nonlinearity of the functions. However, in addition to\nthe three sharing factors, in some surveys, we are also able to obtain\ndata such as unearned income at individual levels or some *extrahouse-\nhold environmental parameters,\" which impose no direct effect on de-\nmandi. In this subsection, we show that if we observe one such additional\nsharing factor, we can develop an alternative way of identification that\ndoes not depend on the nonlinearity of functions. This is important\nsince identification that is not based on nonlinearity is generally more\nrobust (Bourguignon et al. 1995). The following proposition summa-\nrizes the results.\n\nPRoPosrrION 7. Under assumptions i-iv, if there exists one more shar-\ning factor other than individual wages and household unearned income,\nthen the partials of individual consumption on unassignable commod-\nities, independent and spousal leisure, and the sharing rule are all fully\nidentified in terms of the first derivatives of some observable functions.\n\nIV. Conclusions\n\nThis paper has explored the fact that spouses spend some leisure time\ntogether and some leisure time separately. Despite the unobservability\nof each type of leisure, it is shown that each type of leisure can be\nidentified up to an additive constant, under standard assumptions in\nthe literature. This surprising result is obtained by extending the recent\ncollective models to allow both public goods and endogenous labor\nsupply. Such a result is simply impossible in *neoclassical\" household\nmodels. It thus illustrates the power of the individualistic collective set-\nting. Furthermore, we show that the framework allows us to understand\na great deal about intrahousehold resource allocation. These results are\nuseful for governments that consider policies targeting spousal leisure\nand genderspecific consumption, which may increase marriage stability\nor reduce gender inequality within the household.\n\nReferences\n\nBaxter, Leslie A., and Dindia, Kathryn. \"Marital Partners!

The argument that infers racism\nfrom this evidence relies on two very strong assumptions: (1) that mo-\ntorists of all races are equally likely to carry drugs and (2) that motorists\ndo not react to the probability of being searched. Relaxing these as-\nsumptions, as we do in this paper, leads to a very different kind of test.\n\nOur empirical results for the Maryland data showed that the proba-\nbilities of being found with drugs in any amount are equal across African\nAmericans and whites, which is consistent with maximizing behavior by\npolice who are not racially prejudiced. We also find equality of pro-\nportions guilty across several other dimensions of driver characteristics,\nwhich further supports the conclusion that police are trying to maximize\nthe number of successful searches. When we look at the probability of.\nbeing found with drugs in large quantities, this probability tends to be\nhigher for African-American drivers, which would imply a bias against\nwhite motorists. Our finding of lower probabilities of guilt for Hispanics\nsuggests that police may be biased against Hispanics, but the sample\nsize for this group is small and further investigation is warranted.\n\nAlthough this paper focuses on traffic searches, our analysis extends\nstraightforwardly to some other similar settings; for example, our test\ncould be applied to analyze the behavior of security and customs agents\nin airports, where it is alleged that minorities and foreigners are unfairly\ntargeted in baggage and passenger searches (see, e.g., Anderson v. Cor-\nnejo, 1999 [no. 97 C 7556]).\n\nStatistical discrimination, even if not due to prejudice, may be con-\nsidered unfair because innocent drivers experience different probabil-\nities of being searched depending on their race. In ongoing research\n(Knowles et al. 1999), we address the issue of fairness and show that\nimplementing color-blind search behavior does not necessarily entail a\ncost in terms of efficiency in interdiction.\n",
