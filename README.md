# Top 5 economic journal paper affiliation extraction

## Table of contents

## General information
This repository detials how University names are extracted from messy data for my masters dissertation which is to construct a long-term ranking of research intensity of universities globally based on publications in the Top 5 economics journals (AER, JPE, ECTA, QJE, REStud) from 1940 to 2020.
The repository takes in outputted raw NLP data from papers published and cleans this data, as well as visualising the data.

## Setup 
All source files have been included under 'Tesseract output json files'.
The project is witten using MACOS and files refecinging will need to be adapted for Windows use. 

## File structure
The project contains the source data as well as the different iterations in getting to the final result. 

### Masterlists 
Contains the truth files for the papers downloaded from the journals. 

## 2_Extracting affilitions
Split into 2 sections of manual extraction and fuzzy matching. These are the 2 thoughts on how to extract affilitons from the different journals. 
### 1_Manual splitting
The first failed iteration of the project. This was an attempt at maually coding in rules to split the data. In the end this couldn't work due to the variability in the data. Especially when switching between journals.
