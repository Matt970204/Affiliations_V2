Mod-\nelling the information processing constraints of economic agents, whether these agents are\nindividuals or organizations, is a way of understanding how the decision rules that arise\ngiven these constraints differ from those predicted by models with unboundedly rational\nagents.\n\nFor organizations, such modelling has an additional motivation. Information pro-\ncessing is decentralized in organizations; that is, it is performed jointly by the members of\nthe organizations. Therefore, as has long been emphasized in management science and by\nbusiness historians such as Chandler (1966, 1990), information processing is itself an econ-\nomic activity\u2014one that is an important determinant of the structure of organizations and\nthat uses significant resources. For example, the members of a firm's administrative staff\nare hired precisely because there is no unboundedly rational entrepreneur who could con-\ntrol the firm in the way that is often assumed in economic models.\n\nEconomists have used various approaches to modelling information processing by the\nadministrative staffs of organizations. One is to model constraints on communication\nbetween a fixed number of agents, such as in the literatures on communication mechanisms!\nand team theory.? This approach attempts only to explain the decision procedures of exogen-\nously given agents. In fact, information transmission costs cannot explain why those who\n",

Second, what is the effect of actually participating in this training on the length of\nsuch spells? Belonging to the treatment group shortens unemployment spells but has no effect on\nemployment spells. Actually participating in training has a larger positive effect on the exit rate\nfrom unemployment than the effect of simply being a member of the treatment group.

This consensus is reinforced by\na recent experimental study of adult women who were offered access to classroom training\nadministered under the U.S. Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) (Bloom er. al. (1993)).\nStudies suggest that these gains usually result more from increased weeks of employment\nthan from increased hourly wages or increased hours per week for those who are employed.\n\nIn this paper we address two questions about the impact of classroom training (CT)\non the labour market histories of adult women who participated in the National JTPA\nStudy. First, we ask whether being a member of the treatment group increased employment\n\n655\n",

A dynamic utility maximization model\nis presented and estimated using longitudinal data on women from the Panel Study of Income\nDynamics. The MLE method employed, involves solving a dynamic programming problem.\nFurther, a minimum distance estimator is proposed which allows for the incorporation of wage\ndata in a computationally simple way. The estimates are used to predict changes in the life-cycle\npatterns of employment, marriage and divorce due to differences in education, race, the female's\nearnings and her (potential) husband's earnings. The estimation results indicate that the utility\ngains to marriage are decreasing in the female's wage rate and increasing in her (potential) hus-\nband's earnings, while the opposite is found for gains to working. Ignoring the endogeneity of\nmarital status decisions is shown to lead to an underestimation of own and husband's wage effects\non female labour supply.\n",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe American family has undergone a major transformation over the last four decades.\nThis change was characterized by a large increase in the labour force participation rate\nof married women, a sharp increase in the rate of divorce, a drop in the fertility rate and\nan increase in the number of female-headed households and never-married men and\nwomen. These demographic trends have led to an increased recognition among labour\neconomists of the importance of household structure in the study of individual and family\nlabour supply. In the study of female labour supply, for example, there is growing aware-\nness that both marital status and fertility decisions are strongly interrelated with female\nlabour supply decisions and can therefore no longer be considered exogenous from a life-\ncycle perspective. The presence of children (especially when they are young) is known to\nhave a strong negative effect on the mother's labour supply. Consequently, female wages\nand labour force experience could be expected to play an important role in decisions on\nthe timing and number of births.\n\nFemale labour force participation decisions have also been found to depend strongly\non the marital status of women. In addition, economic theories of marriage imply a strong\ncorrelation between a female's return in the labour market and her 'return' in the marriage\nmarket, measured in terms of utility gains from marriage. For example, according to\nBecker's (1973, 1974) theory of marriage, marital gains can be derived from the specializa-\ntion of labour within the household, which is found to depend negatively on the ratio of\nthe wife's to the husband's wage rate. Gains from marriage and therefore marital status\ndecisions will thus in general depend on a female's (potential) wage rate. If gains from\n\n199\n",

                    "The possibility of sunspot equilibria and endogenous cycles are explored in a two-sector\noverlapping-generations model with entry. It is shown that if prospective entrants act oligopolisti-\ncally as producers but competitively as consumers then a strategic complementarity between the\nentry decisions of agents across sectors and across time may arise. If the complementarity is\nsufficiently strong, the economy will have multiple, Pareto-ranked steady states. Stationary sunspot\nequilibria can then be constructed as a randomization between allocations in the neighbourhood\nof the multiple steady states providing a source of aggregate fluctuations.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe extent to which changes in beliefs can be important factors in initiating economic\nfluctuations has been a prominent area of investigation for macroeconomists. The notion\nthat beliefs about the future influence current decisions is a property of almost all dynamic\neconomic systems. The more challenging task is identifying economic environments in\nwhich changes in beliefs alone influence current choices in such a way that the variations\nin beliefs are self-fulfilling. Because the resulting fluctuations arise in the absence of\nvariations in fundamental variables such as preferences and technology, they are often\ntermed *'sunspot equilibria\". Apart from suggesting that instability of expectations may\nbe a distinct source of cyclical volatility, sunspot equilibria may also explain why\napparently small disturbances in fundamentals lead to large change in macroeconomic\naggregates.'\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate the possibility of sunspot equilibria in an overlapping-\ngenerations economy characterized by a plausible form of strategic complementarity: as\nmore agents enter as producers in any particular sector of the economy, they create an\nincentive for agents to enter as producers into other sectors as well? The basis for this\n\n1. Woodford (1987) provides additional arguments for the consideration of sunspot equilibria.\n\n2. Strategic complementarity is a condition on the direction of the strategic interaction between players\nin a game and has been useful in a variety of contexts in industrial organization (Bulow, Geanakopolos and\nKlemperer (1985)) and in macroeconomics (Cooper-John (1988)).\n\n795\nThis content downloaded from\n137.158.158.62 on Tue, 08 Feb 2022 16:37:44 UTC\nAII use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n"

If an agent\ndefaults on a contract, he can be excluded from future contingent claims markets trading and can\nhave his assets seized. He cannot be excluded from spot markets trading, however, and he has some\nprivate endowments that cannot be seized. All information is publicly held and common knowledge,\nand there is a complete set of contingent claims markets. Since there is complete information, an\nagent cannot enter into a contract in which he would have an incentive to default in some state. In\ngeneral there is only partial insurance: variations in consumption may be imperfectly correlated\nacross agents; interest rates may be lower than they would be without constraints; and equilibria\nmay be Pareto ranked.\n"

DEMARZO\nNorthwestern University\n\nFirst version received April 1988; final version accepted July 1992 (Eds.)\n\nThis paper incorporates a model of corporate control into a general equilibrium framework\nfor production economies with incomplete markets. The classical objective of value maximization\nis extended, but is indeterminate. Instead, firms are viewed as being subject to shareholder control\nvia some decision mechanism. As long as this decision mechanism is responsive to a unanimous\npreference by shareholders, shareholder control is consistent with but stronger than value maximiz-\nation. Next, the particular institution of majority voting by shareholders is examined. It is shown\nthat for generic economies, a majority rule equilibrium for a firm implies that production is\noptimal for the largest, or dominant, shareholder. Finally, a more realistic control mechanism is\nconsidered in which majority voting by shareholders is constrained by a group of shareholders,\nor Board of Directors, who control the voting agenda. The result is that shareholders not on the\nBoard have no influence on the equilibrium production choice of the firm.\n"

INTRODUCTION\n\nMost of the recently developed models of entry in oligopolistic markets and the theory\nof political competition deal with the case of dominant firms or parties which face a\nthreat of potential entry. These models possess a number of features on which they may\nbe compared and contrasted. The most important of these features are the ways in which\nthe existing parties or firms compete against each other for votes or profits, and types of\nexpectations the incumbents have about the responses of potential entrants to changes\nin their decisions. In most of the cases an electoral or oligopolistic competition is\nrepresented by some type of a non-cooperative game played by parties or firms.\n\nIn this paper we also consider a non-cooperative model of electoral race where the\nestablished parties (incumbents) compete against each other by offering positions\n(*ideologies\") to the population of voters. Given the profile of voters! preferences over\nthe space of *'ideologies\" (or, issue space), each of the established parties attempts to\nmaximize its vote share. In making their choices, the incumbents, however, anticipate\nthat a new party (an entrant) will join the electoral race. Consistent with the other parties'\nobjectives, the entrant is assumed to maximize its share of voters while taking the\nincumbents' choices as given. The resulting non-cooperative game possesses, therefore,\na structural hierarchy: the established parties behave as Nash players with respect to each\nother, whereas acting as Stackelberg leaders with respect to the entrant and correctly\nanticipating its vote-maximizing response to their choices in the issue space.\n\nThe main purpose of this paper is to study the properties of the game we described\nand, in particular, to characterize its equilibrium, which we will call **hierarchical equili-\nbrium\". Naturally, some assumptions are needed in order to guarantee the existence of\nthe equilibrium. We assume that there are two established parties, the issue space I is\nthe uni-dimensional interval, all voters have symmetric single peaked-peaked preferences\nover I and the distribution of the voters' ideal points is represented by a quasi-concave\ncontinuous density function. Under these rather mild assumptions, we are able to prove\nthe existence and uniqueness of the hierarchical equilibrium and to completely\ncharacterize it.\n",

                    "1. MOTIVATION\n\nFor games in which firms producing identical products compete in prices there are several\nwell-known results relating mixed-strategy Nash-equilibria to the Walrasian equilibrium\n(e.g. Allen and Hellwig (1986), Vives (1986)).! The purpose of this paper is to show that\nsome of these results remain true if one replaces the concept of mixed-strategy Nash-\nequilibria by the concept of iterated elimination of dominated strategies.\n\nThe paper has two motivations. One is that in our opinion the use of a more\nelementary solution concept makes the above results more transparent.\n\nThe other is that, as a model of non-cooperative behaviour, the concept of iterated\nelimination of dominated strategies assumes less coordination of the players! choices\nthan the concept of mixed-strategy Nash-equilibrium does. This is important in our\ncontext because the Walrasian equilibrium is intended to describe decentralized\neconomies, and hence a model providing non-cooperative foundations for Walras' concept\nis the more attractive the less coordination is assumed to exist exogeneously.\n\nThe difference between the concept of iterated elimination of dominated strategies\nand the concept of mixed-strategy Nash-equilibrium can be viewed in several ways. One\nis that the iterated elimination of dominated strategies is a procedure which in principle\nevery agent can carry out for himself. The analogue is true for mixed-strategy Nash-\nequilibria only if there is a unique equilibrium. If there are multiple equilibria then some\nkind of explicit pre-play communication is required to ensure that players coordinate to\nplay one particular equilibrium.\n\nAt a deeper level one can compare the formal informational assumptions required\nto justify the iterated elimination of dominated strategies with those required to justify\nmixed-strategy Nash equilibria. A natural framework for such a comparison is a formal\nmodel of common knowledge of the type suggested by Aumann (1976, 1987).\n\n1. An early analysis of mixed-strategy Nash-equilibria in price games is contained in Shubik (1959). An\nalternative approach has been suggested by Dixon (1987) who investigates epsilon-equilibria.\n163\n",

                    "This paper discusses why redundant skilled workers may be reluctant to accept interim\nunskilled jobs. If skilled work is more satisfying or less arduous for highly productive workers,\nthen such workers invest more in moving quickly between skilled jobs. Thus, high productivity\nworkers tend to search on-the-job, and if unemployed will specialise in job search, rather than\ntake an interim position. If individual differences in productivity are known to the worker but\nnot the potential employer, then search strategy may be used as a productivity signal, with more\nthan the efficient proportion of workers searching on-the-job and too few accepting interim\nunskilled jobs. Optimal policy requires a subsidy on interim unskilled jobs.\n",
                    "The primary aim of this paper is to consider why unemployed skilled workers are\napparently reluctant to take temporary unskilled jobs, preferring to \"stick to their trade\",\nand accepting a possibly long unemployment spell, during which little search may occur.\nWhilst commonplace in Britain, this phenomenon is also significant in the U.S.\u2014for\nexample, Clark and Summers (1979). Bulow and Summers (1986) capture this in a dual\neconomy model by assuming that primary sector jobs are offered to the unemployed, but\nnot to secondary sector workers.\n\nFour reasons have been advanced to explain why a competitive unskilled jobs sector\nmight fail to absorb unemployed workers not undertaking significant amounts of search\nwhile waiting for a skilled job. First, the level of unemployment benefit may discourage\nsuch work. Second, the threat of unionization may cause the unskilled wage to be set\nabove the market clearing level. Third, in the segmented labour market literature, taking\nbad jobs has been conjectured to have a long term \"'scarring effect\", reducing skills and\nthereby future earnings. (See Taubman and Wachter (1986).) Fourth, the remote location\nof secondary sector employment may prevent on-the-job search for primary sector jobs\n(Harris and Todaro (1970)). In the model described in the next section workers' reluctance\nto take interim jobs arises because secondary sector employment reduces future earnings,\nbut unlike the segmented labour market models, unskilled work need not reduce future\nproductivity.\n\nThe primary hypothesis advanced here is that under a plausible behavioural assump-\ntion\u2014namely, that within a skill category, more productive workers find skilled work\nmore satisfying or less arduous than less productive workers\u2014job search decisions may\nact as a productivity signal. The starting points for the work here are the important\ncontributions on information creation by Spence (1974), Akerlof (1970, 1976), Salop and\nSalop (1976), Guasch and Weiss (1980, 1981), and Burdett and Mortensen (1981).

We study how expectations of a policy\nswitch whose timing or mix between expenditure cuts, tax increases or increases in money growth\nrates may be uncertain, affect economic dynamics before the switch takes place. We are especially\nconcerned with the correlation between changes in the deficit and inflation. Of particular interest\nis our finding that timing uncertainty may induce fluctuations in the rate of inflation that seem\nto be unrelated to the budget deficit, at a time when the budget deficit is responsible for inflation.\n"
